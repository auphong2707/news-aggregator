Spectral is collaborating with deep learning experts from Hugging Face to advance open-source models, datasets, and applications for the Onchain Agent Economy. How to use Hugging Face Hugging Face plays a critical role across Spectral\u2019s organization. Through the Expert Support Program, Spectral regularly meets with the Hugging Face team to plan new use cases, strategize dataset construction, and develop training strategies. Earlier this year, Spectral launched Syntax, which is composed of a fine-tuned LLM orchestrator that routes queries between several tools, including search, Foundry, and an open-source model to generate Solidity code. Building Syntax required custom datasets for both finetuning and RAG, an original Solidity evaluation dataset written by elite smart contract developers, and experimentation across a wide range of open and closed-source models. Spectral\u2019s approach to dataset preparation, training, routing, and evaluation has drastically improved during this process, largely due to help from Hugging Face experts. Regular discussions on Spectral\u2019s approach mean that the company always receives impartial feedback on its decisions and can reevaluate its strategy as needed. This was important for both the finetuning and evaluation steps, which have now gone through several rounds of improvement thanks to the Hugging Face team. Spectral also relies on Hugging Face for inferences in production through dedicated Inference Endpoints. The fully managed infrastructure allows Spectral to iterate on new models quickly, easily update container and hardware configurations, autoscale with demand, and keep production costs low. Over the coming months, Spectral is excited to continue to open-source its work with onchain datasets and models that interact onchain through Hugging Face. Users can view Spectral\u2019s training dataset for the credit scoring challenge and follow its progress here. The Onchain Agent Economy Syntax is pioneering the accessible onchain Agent Economy, inviting users to select agents tailored for their specific tasks. Users can either interact with the foundational agent to generate solidity code or opt for one of the specialized agents, each adept in distinct tasks. For example, we recently launched Syntax MoonMaker, an agent that launches a memecoin project end to end, and are soon launching Syntax- TestMachine, an agent that detects vulnerabilities in your smart contracts. Many such agents are currently in production, and upcoming releases of our product will allow users to create their own agents and monetize them on the Syntax network. This system relies on a vast suite of functions available to language models, open-source models for tasks like classification and image generation, fast and reliable blockchain infrastructure, and a trustless system to execute and verify each step. To solve these problems, we\u2019ve begun developing the Inferchain, optimized to serve the rapidly growing demand for agents and verifiable inferences. Hugging Face Users joining the Onchain AI community The importance of open collaboration cannot be overstated. Like many other projects, Spectral would not exist without the work of open-source contributors. Spectral is greatly indebted to everyone who makes this work possible and believes this positive impact should be recognized. As part of this engagement, Spectral is focusing specifically on users powering the AI community. The top individual and small organization contributors on Hugging Face, measured by likes and downloads of their models and datasets, are eligible to register to claim a share of SPEC tokens starting the week of May 6th. Users can check eligibility by signing in with their Hugging Face account here. A snapshot of activity was taken last month, and eligible users will not need an existing wallet to claim. This airdrop is designed to recognize users for their critical work and enable new functionality for the next generation of AI tools. Criteria Spectral reviewed all individual contributors from organizations with less than 10 members that published models or datasets. From these, Spectral took a combined measure of activity from likes and downloads for both models and datasets. Then, Spectral identified the users with the most combined activity from both model and dataset publishers (11298 in both categories) which resulted in a final list of 20,004 unique huggingface users.

By purchasing and trading the uWatt, investors from all over the world are creating a liquid market of investment in tokenised renewable energy infrastructure that incentivises the developers of these projects and generates stable yields for the holders of the uWatt token. Given the market necessity of developing high impact renewable energy infrastructure, combined with the availability of a great solar and wind potential, Colombia is an ideal spot to invest in clean energy projects. The current regulation favours this kind of projects and allows them to accelerate its development which usually takes between two or three years, down to just five months. In Colombia, the regulation of digital assets is still in its very early stages, and although this opens the window for innovation, it also poses some challenges with respect to creating confidence in more traditional investors. As a start-up, we\u2019re aiming to raise and close a seed round by the third quarter of this year.

Em conversa looks to uncover what the future of fintech could look like in the region, following a $2.1billion valuation in 2022.", "DETAILED_CONTENT": "In March 2024, Unergy, a Latin American cleantech and fintech specialising in the financing of high-performance renewable energy production assets, announced the implementation of its first agrovoltaic projects in Colombia. Exploring how the company is promoting a more sustainable environment in the region, we sat down with Nicolas Villegas, co-founder and CTO of Unergy. In Colombia, solar energy is gaining prominence within the renewable energy sector, supported by favourable policies and fintech innovations that offer new financing mechanisms. The country\u2019s strategic regulatory framework, which includes tax incentives and funds dedicated to non-conventional energy sources, has attracted significant investments in solar projects. Fintech platforms play a crucial role in connecting these projects with investors, using tools such as green bonds and blockchain technology to facilitate financing. Despite challenges such as grid connectivity and the intermittency of solar energy, the integration of fintech solutions presents a promising future for expanding the footprint of solar energy in Colombia, improving both its economic viability and its contribution to sustainable development. Countries in Latin America, including Colombia, are experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand. Specifically, Colombia has been significantly reliant on hydroelectric power, accounting for 70 per cent of the nation\u2019s generation. However, the biggest opportunities for hydroelectric projects have already been tapped. Given this context, the renewable energy sector has a massive growth opportunity in the following few years, and requires a quick capital injection to keep pace with the regional growth. Unergy is helping to close the investment gap in renewable energy opportunities by directing resources from both retail and institutional investors toward the development of renewable energy projects that are both necessary for the energetic safety of the region and are also profitable with double-digit returns. Unergy achieves this by leveraging on blockchain technology to tokenise the ownership over the renewable energy infrastructure and create the uWatt, a digital currency backed by a portfolio of operative renewable energy projects. By purchasing and trading the uWatt, investors from all over the world are creating a liquid market of investment in tokenised renewable energy infrastructure that incentivises the developers of these projects and generates stable yields for the holders of the uWatt token. Given the market necessity of developing high impact renewable energy infrastructure, combined with the availability of a great solar and wind potential, Colombia is an ideal spot to invest in clean energy projects. Through Unergy\u2019s model, investors from all over the world can easily participate in the development of solar energy projects and generate stable returns. The current regulation favours this kind of projects and allows them to accelerate its development which usually takes between two or three years, down to just five months. Additionally, economic conditions are starting to settle down, after a period of high interest rates that we lived between 2022 and 2023. This is decreasing the cost of capital and allowing many retail and institutional investors to lean onto alternative investment opportunities, which creates very favourable conditions for the development of the energy infrastructure we need. In Colombia, the regulation of digital assets is still in its very early stages, and although this opens the window for innovation, it also poses some challenges with respect to creating confidence in more traditional investors. However, the adoption of digital financial products is growing rapidly, and we can see that by the surge of new fintech models around digital wallets, tokenized investments, crowd-funding platforms, crowdlending to MSEs, factoring, digital real estate, and many other models that give the local fintech sector a very diversified offer. Unergy is aiming for rapid \u2013 but organic \u2013 growth in the short and medium term. Our next big step is to launch our renewable energy tokens in new markets across LatAm such as Peru, Chile, Mexico and Argentina, and gain a significant adoption in those markets, while we also strengthen the adoption of our product in Colombia. We have designed the uWatt in a way that addresses the concerns of the retail sector in these countries, since it maintains a stable value over time, at the same time that it generates stable yields, so it can be used to protect against inflation and at the same time as a highly liquid investment vehicle. As a start-up, we\u2019re aiming to raise and close a seed round by the third quarter of this year. As the global push for sustainable and clean energy continues to gain momentum, Latin America, and Colombia in particular, find themselves at the forefront of a transformative journey. Unergy emerges as a pivotal player in this transition, demonstrating the power of fintech innovations in reshaping the renewable energy landscape. In conclusion, Unergy stands as a beacon of innovation within the fintech renewable energy sector, embodying the potential for technology-driven solutions to spearhead meaningful and lasting change. Its journey reflects a broader movement towards integrating financial ingenuity with sustainable development goals, offering a glimpse into a future where renewable energy is not only viable but preferred. As Unergy continues to expand and evolve, its impact on Colombia, Latin America, and potentially the world, offers an inspiring testament to the role of fintech in paving the way for a cleaner, greener future.

This innovative approach, which is getting legally possible and popular in certain countries, not only democratizes investment in real estate, but can also introduce a level of liquidity previously unseen in the sector. As India\u2019s real estate market is projected to grow exponentially, reaching USD 1 trillion by 2030, the adoption of blockchain asset tokenization with regulatory support could be the catalyst needed for this burgeoning growth. The Essence of Blockchain in Real Estate Blockchain technology, with its decentralized nature, offers a secure and transparent platform for conducting transactions without the need for intermediaries. This technology underpins the tokenization process, where real estate assets are converted into digital tokens that represent a fractional ownership or interest in the property. These tokens can be traded on blockchain platforms, enhancing liquidity and making real estate investment accessible to a broader audience. The Mechanism of Asset Tokenization Asset tokenization involves three core elements: the incoming asset (property), the blockchain infrastructure for \u201csubstitution\u201d of the asset, and the virtual asset version (digital tokens). This process not only simplifies the investment in real estate but also opens up the market to small investors by enabling fractional ownership. The Boston Consulting Group predicts that asset tokenization could reach $16 trillion within the next decade, with real estate tokenization playing a significant role. The Role of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Decentralized Finance (DeFi) introduces a digital monetary ecosystem built on blockchain, facilitating borrowing, lending, and exchanging without traditional financial intermediaries. In the realm of real estate tokenization, DeFi enhances efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity, further revolutionizing the sector. Real Estate Asset Tokenization: A New Era Tokenizing real estate assets involves creating digital tokens that correspond to a specific portion of a property, allowing for fractional ownership. This approach not only makes real estate investment more accessible but also increases market liquidity. With the global property market valued at an estimated $228 trillion, tokenization has the potential to significantly expand investment opportunities and poised to be a tremendous volume business in near future. This not only increase liquidity in Real Estate, but can also enhance general liquidity in the market for all businesses, by giving opportunity to get liquidity out of dormant fixed assets. The Process and Regulatory Landscape The process of real estate asset tokenization encompasses several steps, from identifying the asset and clearing legal regulations to developing smart contracts, launching the token for fractional ownership and ensuring distribution of income. Regulatory considerations are crucial, as the framework for asset tokenization is still evolving. Countries like Singapore, Thailand, UK, and USA have already come up with regulations to facilitate asset tokenization. Despite Regulatory aversion for Crypto Currencies in India, there is need to look at Asset Based Cryptos like Real Estate differently as it is relatively safe underlying assets and more robust than the traditional fractional funding mechanism. Incidentally, GIFT City in Ahmadabad may be the first to effectively explore Asset Tokenization in India. Future Outlook and Conclusion The future of real estate asset tokenization is promising, with potential impacts on traditional financial systems and opportunities for further research and innovation. This approach can revolutionize real estate. As the regulatory landscape evolves and more countries recognize the benefits of asset tokenization, we can expect a significant shift in how real estate investments are made, ultimately leading to a more inclusive and liquid market. Blockchain asset tokenization can bring a significant leap forward for the real estate sector in India. Proper Regulatory frame work can enable even Residential Asset Tokenization triggering a huge market liquidity for investment by Start ups and MSMEs, by enabling fractional ownership, enhancing liquidity, and democratizing investment. Tokenisation has the potential to reshape the landscape of real estate investment, making it more accessible and appealing to a wider range of investors. As we move forward, the continued evolution and adoption of blockchain technology will be key to unlocking the full potential of real estate tokenization, paving the way for a more inclusive and dynamic real estate market in India and beyond.

At its first-ever annual event held during Paris Blockchain Week, Sui was feted by developers and builders from around the world during a two-day event. Speakers at Sui Basecamp spanned all aspects of the industry from payments to gaming to e-commerce to major league sports, offering commentary in keynotes, panels, and fireside chats. The event was punctuated by three major announcements. In partnership with Playtron, the Sui team announced the SuiPlay0x1, the world\u2019s first lightweight handheld gaming device designed with native Web3 capabilities, and promising new gaming experiences. Additionally, First Digital Labs, joined an announcement that FDUSD, the fastest-growing stablecoin in crypto, will be the first native dollar-backed stablecoin on Sui, a boon to Sui\u2019s DeFi ecosystem, which is already the fastest-growing in the industry. Finally, Sui announced Enoki, a suite of Web3 utilities that will make it very simple for enterprises to leverage decentralized solutions inside their applications, products and services. \u201cIn building Sui, we began with a blank canvas, aiming to create the preeminent platform for decentralized applications without the structural limitations we saw in other blockchains,\u201d said Evan Cheng, Co-founder and CEO of Mysten Labs, originator of the Sui Network. \u201cLess than a year after launching Sui\u2019s mainnet, the remarkable strength of Sui\u2019s performance has confirmed the approach. From nearly limitless horizontal scalability to industry leading speed of execution to achieving the most transactions in a single day of any blockchain ever, Sui\u2019s performance has been exceptional and the network has only scratched the surface.\u201d The industry veterans who founded Sui launched its mainnet nearly a year ago to great expectations, and the network has performed exceptionally well. Rather than cloning an existing network, the Sui team started from scratch to build an entirely new infrastructure layer that addressed the shortcomings of existing blockchains. They started by creating Move, a novel smart contract language, and on top of it created a new architecture centered around objects that enables performance and functionality that is simply not available on existing blockchains. The result is a blockchain that is singular in the industry \u2014 the universal coordination layer for intelligent assets. Sui is a industry leader with lightning-fast transactions, with time to finality clocked at just 400 milliseconds. Likewise, Sui\u2019s scalability is also at the pinnacle, reaching 297,000 TPS in a controlled environment. But the Sui team is also constantly improving its technology. At the conference, members of the Sui team unveiled the next advancement in speed and scalability in the form of Mysticeti, which significantly accelerates Sui\u2019s time to finality, and Pilotfish, which enables nearly unlimited horizontal scaling by validators. And beyond performing in test environments, at just four months old, Sui broke the record for transactions executed in a single day, achieving a higher figure than any existing blockchain while fees remained low and stable. Notably, in nearly a year of its mainnet, Sui has not experienced a single minute of downtime. Gradually, after a series of community events around the world, media stories highlighting Sui\u2019s remarkable early milestones, sustained ecosystem growth and multiple stories of builders eschewing other blockchains to leverage the Sui network, builders, developers, investors and the broader community have begun to understand the potential for Sui\u2019s groundbreaking blockchain technology. The crowds that gathered for Sui Basecamp 2024 represented the culmination of Sui\u2019s arrival. \u201cThe overwhelming turnout and the vibrant enthusiasm at the inaugural Sui Basecamp event reflects a Sui community that is captivated by Sui\u2019s potential to make people\u2019s lives better,\u201d said Greg Siourounis, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation. \u201cIn the coming months, the Sui Foundation will continue to focus on expanding the ecosystem of projects leveraging Sui and the number of users benefiting from those applications as we work to make Sui one of the blockchains most widely adopted to solve real world challenges.

At its first-ever annual event held during Paris Blockchain Week, Sui was feted by developers and builders from around the world during a two-day event. Speakers at Sui Basecamp spanned all aspects of the industry from payments to gaming to e-commerce to major league sports, offering commentary in keynotes, panels, and fireside chats. The event was punctuated by three major announcements. In partnership with Playtron, the Sui team announced the SuiPlay0x1, the world\u2019s first lightweight handheld gaming device designed with native Web3 capabilities, and promising new gaming experiences. Additionally, First Digital Labs, joined an announcement that FDUSD, the fastest-growing stablecoin in crypto, will be the first native dollar-backed stablecoin on Sui, a boon to Sui\u2019s DeFi ecosystem, which is already the fastest-growing in the industry. Finally, Sui announced Enoki, a suite of Web3 utilities that will make it very simple for enterprises to leverage decentralized solutions inside their applications, products and services. \u201cIn building Sui, we began with a blank canvas, aiming to create the preeminent platform for decentralized applications without the structural limitations we saw in other blockchains,\u201d said Evan Cheng, Co-founder and CEO of Mysten Labs, originator of the Sui Network. \u201cLess than a year after launching Sui\u2019s mainnet, the remarkable strength of Sui\u2019s performance has confirmed the approach. From nearly limitless horizontal scalability to industry leading speed of execution to achieving the most transactions in a single day of any blockchain ever, Sui\u2019s performance has been exceptional and the network has only scratched the surface.\u201d The industry veterans who founded Sui launched its mainnet nearly a year ago to great expectations, and the network has performed exceptionally well. Rather than cloning an existing network, the Sui team started from scratch to build an entirely new infrastructure layer that addressed the shortcomings of existing blockchains. They started by creating Move, a novel smart contract language, and on top of it created a new architecture centered around objects that enables performance and functionality that is simply not available on existing blockchains. The result is a blockchain that is singular in the industry \u2014 the universal coordination layer for intelligent assets. Sui is a industry leader with lightning-fast transactions, with time to finality clocked at just 400 milliseconds. Likewise, Sui\u2019s scalability is also at the pinnacle, reaching 297,000 TPS in a controlled environment. But the Sui team is also constantly improving its technology. At the conference, members of the Sui team unveiled the next advancement in speed and scalability in the form of Mysticeti, which significantly accelerates Sui\u2019s time to finality, and Pilotfish, which enables nearly unlimited horizontal scaling by validators. And beyond performing in test environments, at just four months old, Sui broke the record for transactions executed in a single day, achieving a higher figure than any existing blockchain while fees remained low and stable. Notably, in nearly a year of its mainnet, Sui has not experienced a single minute of downtime. Gradually, after a series of community events around the world, media stories highlighting Sui\u2019s remarkable early milestones, sustained ecosystem growth and multiple stories of builders eschewing other blockchains to leverage the Sui network, builders, developers, investors and the broader community have begun to understand the potential for Sui\u2019s groundbreaking blockchain technology. The crowds that gathered for Sui Basecamp 2024 represented the culmination of Sui\u2019s arrival. \u201cThe overwhelming turnout and the vibrant enthusiasm at the inaugural Sui Basecamp event reflects a Sui community that is captivated by Sui\u2019s potential to make people\u2019s lives better,\u201d said Greg Siourounis, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation. \u201cIn the coming months, the Sui Foundation will continue to focus on expanding the ecosystem of projects leveraging Sui and the number of users benefiting from those applications as we work to make Sui one of the blockchains most widely adopted to solve real world challenges. With cutting edge technology and the most dedicated and professional community in web3 behind it, Sui\u2019s progress so far is just a glimpse of what this network will achieve.\u201d Users can read more on the event on the Sui Blog.

Product page: https://www.bunzz.dev/audit   The Significance of Using AI for Smart Contract Audits The tasks performed by audit firms can broadly be classified as follows: For the first task, vulnerabilities in smart contracts are normally checked by humans reviewing the source code.

From the results obtained through research and development, Bunzz believes that for detecting vulnerability patterns as in the first task, a database + AI approach is more suitable than a human approach. Regarding the second task of detecting vulnerabilities specific to a project\u2019s logic, this is not addressed by the above approach but rather by professional auditors from the Bunzz Audit team (as an option).

Leveraging the newly unveiled dWallet primitive, smart contracts using rollups built on Avail DA will be able to programmatically manage native BTC for the first time while preserving user ownership. This marks a paradigm shift from emerging Bitcoin L2 solutions that predominantly rely on collusive and often risky cross-chain solutions, such as bridges, where the user must sacrifice ownership of their BTC. \u201cAllowing BTC to be used programmatically on other blockchains via a trust-minimized approach is a clever approach to increasing BTC adoption.\u201d said Anurag Arjun, co-founder Avail. \u201cTogether with dWallet, we can enable Layer-2 chains or rollups on top of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin represents a superb base layer from the DA perspective, with the highest security available in the ecosystem. As a result, the dWallet integration will enable users to leverage arbitrary execution and logic to secure their BTC via a decentralized multiparty computation (MPC) solution.\u201d In essence, the collaboration aims to harness dWallet\u2019s MPC infrastructure to enhance Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities by enabling the creation of native bitcoin rollups \u2014 ushering in more efficient and secure transactions and operations on the Bitcoin blockchain and supporting a wider range of functionalities beyond simple transactions. The integration with the dWallet Network, coupled with the ability to control dWallets from a smart contract on any Avail rollup, was made possible through Avail Nexus, a zero-knowledge coordination rollup embedding validity-proof based light clients and execution proof aggregation. This pivotal move towards the unification of Web3 will also enable developers to power Avail Fusion\u2019s borrowed security from native assets of the most mature ecosystems, including BTC, ETH, and others. Furthermore, the dWallet Network integration will facilitate the Fusion Security model when it goes live, empowering users to securely hold their BTC, ETH, or other assets in dWallets and stake them to bolster the safety of the Avail ecosystem, all while maintaining ownership of their native assets. This introduces the first native multi-chain staking/restaking solution aimed at securing the consensus of a different blockchain. To implement the dWallet primitive, the dWallet Network utilizes 2PC-MPC, the state-of-the-art protocol invented by its team. This industry-first multiparty protocol enables the generation of an ECDSA signature in a non-collusive way, requiring participation from both the end-user and a significant number of nodes, the number of which could potentially reach hundreds or thousands. dWallet technology allows a Solidity smart contract on an Avail rollup to create Bitcoin signatures and enables developers to manage a dWallet. Meanwhile, the dWallet Network mandates approval from the Avail rollup smart contract for logic enforcement, requiring users to finalize the signature to prevent collusion and asset theft. Whether for Web3 applications in custody, DeFi, DAOs, gaming, or other domains, any protocol on an Avail rollup can leverage dWallets for enhanced functionality and secure interoperability. \u201cWe are excited to team up with Avail because our visions of a unified Web3 have so much in common, with both companies striving to bring countless disparate ecosystems together,\u201d noted Omer Sadika, co-founder of dWallet Network. \u201cWe firmly believe that the future of Web3 is multi-chain, not cross-chain, and together with Avail, we will continue to work tirelessly on making this vision a reality.\u201d This latest integration aligns perfectly with Avail\u2019s mission to unify Web3, for which it\u2019s already employing a comprehensive full-stack architecture that comprises three innovative solutions \u2014 DA, Nexus, and Fusion Security \u2014 to help usher in the rollup future and solve the growing scalability pains of the blockchain industry.

Syntax marks the manifestation of the Agent Economy in Web3. Today, Spectral Labs has launched Syntax, a new LLM enabling people to ship agents that automate onchain projects and tasks, thereby manifesting their Web3 product ideas. While still in beta, Syntax\u2019s vision is to create an open onchain Agent Economy, where developers, individuals, and enterprises can for the first time select the agents they would want to delegate their Web3 tasks, projects, and product development to. These projects and products include production grade smart contracts, arbitrage agents, NFTs, rollups, and more. Scaling web3 engineering efforts and shipping new onchain products is limited by the number of solidity developers, as well as enterprises\u2019 ability to test and ship smart contract code in a fast and effective way without burning through engineering resources. Spectral has set out to solve this with its new LLM, Syntax, a development environment designed to manifest Web3 product ideas by converting natural language into Solidity code that can be deployed instantly onchain. For professional developers, Syntax can accelerate and optimize bandwidth by writing large libraries and components. Syntax provides an Agentic experience, where users tell Syntax what they want to build, and Syntax writes and deploys the code onchain at the click of a button. Spectral defines an Onchain Agent as a set of instructions and code capable of deploying itself onchain and possessing a dedicated provisioned wallet for doing so. Loosely similar to custom instructions in ChatGPT, Syntax Agents also have their own identity and can autonomously figure out ways to interact with deployment infrastructure. With Syntax, users can compile, debug, and deploy AI-generated solidity code. Syntax gives users and the industry the ability to quickly test, ship and scale new products, as well as determining the usability and functional relevance of the code generated while also giving them control to quickly edit code snippets. Initially, Spectral\u2019s Onchain Agents will be curated and built by Spectral, but soon every user will be able to create their own Agent and monetize it in future Syntax releases. \u201cAt Spectral, we\u2019re pioneering a future where autonomous Agents redefine what\u2019s possible onchain. With Spectral Syntax, we empower these agents to operate independently, making it simpler for everyone to bring their blockchain ideas to life.\u201d \u2013 Sishir Varghese, Founder. What truly sets Syntax apart is its capability to deploy code directly onchain, executing deployments through Foundry by writing instructions that Foundry can process, including code compilation, onchain deployment, and signing transactions. Syntax is pioneering an accessible onchain Agent Economy, inviting users to select agents tailored for their specific Web3 tasks. Users can either interact with the foundational agent or opt for one of the specialized agents, each adept in distinct tasks and operations\u2014like the Code Forker assistant, ideal for those aiming to fork and customize a codebase. Additionally, users can discern an agent\u2019s expertise and trustworthiness by reviewing its category listing and the popularity reflected through its user engagement. \u201cSyntax by Spectral is at the forefront of merging AI with web3, pioneering the onchain agent economy and making it easier and more accessible for users to create their own blockchain products,\u201d said Josh Rosenthal, Partner, Polychain Syntax produces accurate and gas-optimized Solidity code for a variety of prompts ranging from low to medium complexity, and it outperforms baseline models on Spectral\u2019s Solidity evaluation dataset. As Spectral\u2019s modeling efforts continue to evolve, the company expects Syntax to deliver optimized code for increasingly complex problems. These Solidity models are explicitly designed to assist developers in writing optimized, modern, well-tested, and secure code.

Exclusion from banks and essential financial services traps people in poverty, fuels inequality, and stifles economic growth. This is where DLT could play a major role in lifting individuals out of poverty and guiding them toward prosperity and growth. DLT can transform government schemes, such as Direct Fund Transfers, by overcoming beneficiary identification and data sharing challenges. Blockchain Redefining Financial Landscape Financial inclusion rests upon four pivotal pillars: Access \u2013 focus on using financial products considering cost and distance, Quality \u2013 assessing appropriateness and client awareness, Trust \u2013 reliability of digital services, and Usage \u2013 examining customer engagement. The rapid adoption of technology has promoted financial inclusion, notably in India with initiatives such as Aadhaar Card linking to Jan Dhan accounts for the rural and unbanked population. This integration facilitates the government\u2019s Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, ensuring monetary compensation delivery to the intended recipients. But does our current technology guarantee the efficient execution of DBT schemes? Is the core principle of \u2018eligibility\u2019 truly driving the success of the program? Diving deep into the matter, it is evident that DLT will serve as a crucial tool in the implementation of government schemes, improving their efficiency. Its role is to guarantee the appropriate utilization of government subsidies and benefits. The underlying principle focuses on outcomes rather than mere eligibility. Let us explore a few use cases: Education loans to the underprivileged: Upon receiving a loan and commencing their education, a student\u2019s performance metrics, including attendance and test scores, are recorded on the blockchain. Conditions encoded in the DLT govern this process, linking performance to a variable interest rate. Improved academic performance leads to lower interest rates, fostering productivity and ensuring proper use of public schemes. Farmer subsidy: When a farmer receives fertilizer subsidies, the aim is to boost crop yield. However, there is a risk of misuse if the farmer is not actively farming and utilizing subsidy as per linked land. Using DLT and real-time drone imagery of the farmer\u2019s land, authorities can verify crop cultivation coverage. This ensures that subsidies align with outcomes, promoting efficient allocation of government funds. In addition to India, other Public Distributed System (PDS) such as Brazil\u2019s Bolsa Fam\u00edlia program, or Kenya\u2019s Uwezo Fund can enhance productivity and effectiveness via DLT. DLT is poised to fuel economic growth. It transcends mere technological innovation, emerging as a transformative force for empowering communities and individuals economically. Challenges and Collaborative Solutions for a Changing Landscape Navigating Obstacles: DLT, with its immense potential, grapples with various challenges on its journey forward. Scalability emerges as a primary concern, as the technology contends with efficiently managing substantial transaction volumes. Regulatory ambiguity adds another layer of complexity, potentially deterring widespread adoption due to a lack of clear frameworks. Furthermore, the formidable task of constructing the required technical infrastructure presents financial and temporal obstacles, underscoring the uphill battle blockchain faces in overcoming these hurdles. Paving the Path to Success: Triumphing over these challenges demands a collaborative approach from key stakeholders. Governments must play a pivotal role by formulating transparent regulations that encourage innovation while managing associated risks. Financial institutions are urged to invest in blockchain infrastructure and initiate pilot projects to test the waters. Simultaneously, technology companies are tasked with refining and simplifying user-friendly blockchain solutions.

For creators to undergo a transformation in this digital era, it seems that the answer lies in decentralisation induced by Web3.0. Web3.0, seemingly hailed as the next step in the Internet\u2019s progression, is believed to have hit the spotlight over its ability to help the creator economy go beyond traditional boundaries. With possibilities ranging over integration between Web3.0 and the creator economy, a paradigm shift towards individual empowerment and digital autonomy can unfold. \u201cI think Web3.0 allows for direct interaction between creators and audiences through decentralised applications (dApps). Using blockchain, creators can leverage tools such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to monetise their work and build communities around it. Fans can invest directly in creators and own unique experiences. This has the potential to facilitate new revenue streams. Decentralisation is considered important as it allows creators to govern projects without centralised control,\u201d Sumit Ghosh, co-founder and CEO, Chingari, a Web3.0 live streaming application, told FE TransformX. So, how exactly is there a relationship between Web3.0 and the creator economy? According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), a professional service firm, despite Web2.0 helping creators by reducing entry obstacles for social and other media platforms to increase engagement, it creates autonomy of power. In that regard, Web3.0 has the potential to ensure equitable distribution of power by transferring ownership from centralised officials to individuals and communities. From what it\u2019s understood, this segregation in power gets implemented using technologies such as NFTs, smart contracts, decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs), and blockchain. As far as Web3.0 for NFTs is concerned, creators can earn revenue through NFT transactions, token incentivisation, and membership plans. Moreover, Web3.0 can help creators allocate content across different blockchain-based platforms, along with relationship development across DAOs and the establishment of connections with audiences worldwide unrestricted by transaction barriers or geographic boundaries. \u201cI believe decentralised funding models such as DAOs allow creators to seek support directly from their audience. Smart contracts can ensure fair compensation and transparent revenue distribution. NFTs can provide immutable proof of ownership and authenticity for digital creations. Collaborative creation and ownership models can foster inclusivity and cooperation among creators. Community engagement and decentralised governance mechanisms can empower audiences to participate in decision-making. Overall, Web3.0 can enhance the creator economy by promoting autonomy, fairness, and engagement,\u201d Prakash Kamaraj, managing director, Chaincraft Labs Inc, a Web3.0-based technological consultancy firm, explained. According to media reports, digital marketing is considered an important segment of the creator economy developed by Web2.0. Insights from a study conducted by Gartner, a management consulting company, found that around 72% of businesses intend to expand their Web3.0 marketing costs in 2024. Reportedly, different corporations have already entered into the Web3.0 landscape, with Samsung and Nascar entering into collaborations with blockchain-oriented firms and Starbucks trying to implement an NFT loyalty program. In recent developments, Friend.tech, a decentralised social network, entered into the Web3.0-based creator economy and clocked $50 million worth of fees within three months, along with garnering 75,000 daily active users. Market experts believe that the influencer marketing landscape could shift towards user-generated content rather than brand-centric content, with the influence of Web3.0. In terms of valuation, Goldman Sachs, an investment banking company, has valued the creator economy at roughly $250 billion, and Metav.rs, a no-code metaverse platform, has valued the Web3.0 market to reach $81.5 billion by 2030. Overall, in 2024, market research has suggested that the anticipated bull run will benefit the Web3.0-based creator economy. It\u2019s believed that Web3.0 influencers available on TikTok, X, formerly Twitter, YouTube, among others, are and will be valuable for sustaining the Web3.0 creator economy, on account of their interactions with individuals belonging to Web3.0 networks such as Chainlink, Solana, Ethereum, and Cosmos. \u201cIn 2024, I anticipate more creators, from nano to mogul levels, leveraging platforms such as Roblox and Fortnite to reach new audiences, a trend we seem to be already witnessing. With online followings reaching saturation, creators should explore distribution channels beyond social media and seek alternative revenue sources. I am expecting more creator economy-focused startups to come up with better value propositions, and platforms that are more mindful about monetisation opportunities and optimised for creators. If you see one of the key narratives driving the Web3.0 specific market sentiment, it should be the creator economy, and we could expect some funding rounds in the coming months,\u201d Ravi Chamria, co-founder and CEO, Zeeve, a blockchain deployment and management platform, concluded.
