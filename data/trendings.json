It has now completed its first experiment using DLT, giving the monetary authority a glimpse into the potential merits of the tech.", "DETAILED_CONTENT": "Over the next six months, onboarded companies will conduct trials and experiments on three Eurosystem interoperability-type solutions proposed for central bank money settlement of wholesale financial transactions recorded on DLT platforms. Furthermore, these tests will continue to explore the viability and benefits of actual central bank money settlement of wholesale financial transactions using DLT technologies. The European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks of the euro area are among the first central banks to delve into the viable use of the tech. Initially, 16 private companies will conduct trials involving actual settlement in central bank money. They will also experiment with mock settlement in test environments. The exploratory work will provide the Eurosystem with insights into how the TARGET Services and DLT platforms could interact in wholesale financial markets. Oesterreichische Nationalbank carried out the first experiment. It covered the tokenisation and simulated delivery-versus-payment (DvP) settlement of government bonds in a secondary market transaction against central bank money. Preparations for further trials and experiments are ongoing and will cover a variety of use cases. This includes DvP transactions in primary and secondary markets, securities lifecycle management, automated wholesale payments and payment-versus-payment transactions. A set of key performance indicators will be used to assess the results of the trials and experiments. The participating companies will perform the assessment in cooperation with Eurosystem. In December 2023 the Eurosystem launched a call for expression of interest in exploratory work on the three interoperability solutions proposed by the Eurosystem and detailed these in the annexes to the notice. Commenting on Eurosystem\u2019s trials, Edvards Margevics, co-partner at fintech company CONCRYT, the payments and banking fintech: \u201cAs the Eurosystem embarks on these trials, we will hopefully witness a pivotal moment in the evolution of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. \u201cEurosystem is involving private companies and central banks in live trials. As a result, it is demonstrating a commitment to exploring innovative solutions for enhanced efficiency and security in financial markets. These trials offer valuable insights into the potential benefits of DLT integration in wholesale financial transactions. They are also paving the way for future advancements in blockchain infrastructure. \u201cHowever, Eurosystem\u2019s exploratory work does not necessarily constitute a commitment to provide any steady-state solution(s) in the future. Nor does it need to make any changes to its current infrastructure. The responsibility for making DLT a success is on industry players. Additionally, if the market wants to go in this direction, it is on the ECB to find out what the cost-benefit of any solution will be. Therefore, the entire crypto industry will be interested in the outcome of these trials.\u201d Neil Vernon, chief product and innovation officer at Gresham Technologies, a global fintech company specialising in mission-critical data and automation solutions for the finance industry, commented on the announcement saying: \u201cEurosystem\u2019s successful trial indicates that the fintech sector is setting up for significant change in the next five to 10 years. \u201cSystems will improve, speed up and carry more ability than ever before. With T+1 settlement times entering the fray, and huge advancements in AI and automation shaping how we view technology, the fintech we know today could be unrecognisable sooner than we expect.\u201d \u201cThe Eurosystem\u2019s successful experiment with new technologies for settling wholesale transactions in central bank money marks a significant step toward modernising financial infrastructures,\u201d said Robert Brown, head of strategic development at MAS Markets, the flexible multi-asset liquidity firm. \u201cBy involving 16 private companies, the trial explored both actual and mock settlements. \u201cDLT offers potential benefits such as increased efficiency, reduced reliance on intermediaries, and enhanced compliance through transparent, immutable transaction records. These advancements could aid in monitoring cross-border payments and reducing fraud. However, DLT adoption may require central banks to adjust their infrastructures, enabling DLT platforms to interface with existing systems or offering central bank money in a DLT-compatible form.\u201d Jorge Lesmes, senior director and client partner, banking at NTT DATA UK&I, said: \u201cEurosystem\u2019s successful trial underscores the potential of DLT to revolutionise wholesale transactions by enhancing efficiency, security, and transparency. \u201cHowever, to achieve broader adoption of DLT, several steps remain. Firstly, regulatory frameworks need to be harmonised across jurisdictions to provide clarity and assurance to market participants. Secondly, the industry must invest in interoperability solutions to ensure seamless integration with existing financial systems. Lastly, robust cybersecurity measures are crucial to safeguard the integrity of DLT-based platforms. \u201cEurosystem\u2019s trial signals to the fintech sector that DLT is no longer a theoretical concept but a practical solution with tangible benefits. This successful experiment will likely spur further innovation and investment in DLT, accelerating its adoption across the industry and paving the way for more advanced applications in financial transactions.\u201d The Fintech Times ", "TAGS": "", "AUTHOR_NAME": "The Fintech Times, Mark Walker, Mark Walker, Polly Jean Harrison, ", "CATEGORY": "Blockchain", "CREATION_DATE": "2024-05-18", "HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION": ".penci-entry-content.entry-content"}, {"LINK": "https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/05/16/protocol-village/", "WEBSITE_SOURCE": "Coindesk", "IMAGE": "https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/dZ9Z4-X1gf3PUen4xat8AWfzvoY=/570x321/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/UK44TNET4ZFIFAX2JQSWJQJSTU.jpeg", "TYPE": "News Article", "SUMMARY": "May 17: Oobit, a mobile payment app, has \"collaborated with TON Foundation to integrate its native cryptocurrency, TON (Toncoin), into its platform, advancing the usage of cryptocurrency as a means of payment,\" according to the team: \"Toncoin holders will be able to Tap & Pay at over 100 million retailers worldwide.

Spectral is collaborating with deep learning experts from Hugging Face to advance open-source models, datasets, and applications for the Onchain Agent Economy. How to use Hugging Face Hugging Face plays a critical role across Spectral\u2019s organization. Through the Expert Support Program, Spectral regularly meets with the Hugging Face team to plan new use cases, strategize dataset construction, and develop training strategies. Earlier this year, Spectral launched Syntax, which is composed of a fine-tuned LLM orchestrator that routes queries between several tools, including search, Foundry, and an open-source model to generate Solidity code. Building Syntax required custom datasets for both finetuning and RAG, an original Solidity evaluation dataset written by elite smart contract developers, and experimentation across a wide range of open and closed-source models. Spectral\u2019s approach to dataset preparation, training, routing, and evaluation has drastically improved during this process, largely due to help from Hugging Face experts. Regular discussions on Spectral\u2019s approach mean that the company always receives impartial feedback on its decisions and can reevaluate its strategy as needed. This was important for both the finetuning and evaluation steps, which have now gone through several rounds of improvement thanks to the Hugging Face team. Spectral also relies on Hugging Face for inferences in production through dedicated Inference Endpoints. The fully managed infrastructure allows Spectral to iterate on new models quickly, easily update container and hardware configurations, autoscale with demand, and keep production costs low. Over the coming months, Spectral is excited to continue to open-source its work with onchain datasets and models that interact onchain through Hugging Face. Users can view Spectral\u2019s training dataset for the credit scoring challenge and follow its progress here. The Onchain Agent Economy Syntax is pioneering the accessible onchain Agent Economy, inviting users to select agents tailored for their specific tasks. Users can either interact with the foundational agent to generate solidity code or opt for one of the specialized agents, each adept in distinct tasks. For example, we recently launched Syntax MoonMaker, an agent that launches a memecoin project end to end, and are soon launching Syntax- TestMachine, an agent that detects vulnerabilities in your smart contracts. Many such agents are currently in production, and upcoming releases of our product will allow users to create their own agents and monetize them on the Syntax network. This system relies on a vast suite of functions available to language models, open-source models for tasks like classification and image generation, fast and reliable blockchain infrastructure, and a trustless system to execute and verify each step. To solve these problems, we\u2019ve begun developing the Inferchain, optimized to serve the rapidly growing demand for agents and verifiable inferences. Hugging Face Users joining the Onchain AI community The importance of open collaboration cannot be overstated. Like many other projects, Spectral would not exist without the work of open-source contributors. Spectral is greatly indebted to everyone who makes this work possible and believes this positive impact should be recognized. As part of this engagement, Spectral is focusing specifically on users powering the AI community. The top individual and small organization contributors on Hugging Face, measured by likes and downloads of their models and datasets, are eligible to register to claim a share of SPEC tokens starting the week of May 6th. Users can check eligibility by signing in with their Hugging Face account here. A snapshot of activity was taken last month, and eligible users will not need an existing wallet to claim. This airdrop is designed to recognize users for their critical work and enable new functionality for the next generation of AI tools. Criteria Spectral reviewed all individual contributors from organizations with less than 10 members that published models or datasets. From these, Spectral took a combined measure of activity from likes and downloads for both models and datasets. Then, Spectral identified the users with the most combined activity from both model and dataset publishers (11298 in both categories) which resulted in a final list of 20,004 unique huggingface users.

Em conversa looks to uncover what the future of fintech could look like in the region, following a $2.1billion valuation in 2022.", "DETAILED_CONTENT": "In March 2024, Unergy, a Latin American cleantech and fintech specialising in the financing of high-performance renewable energy production assets, announced the implementation of its first agrovoltaic projects in Colombia. Exploring how the company is promoting a more sustainable environment in the region, we sat down with Nicolas Villegas, co-founder and CTO of Unergy. In Colombia, solar energy is gaining prominence within the renewable energy sector, supported by favourable policies and fintech innovations that offer new financing mechanisms. The country\u2019s strategic regulatory framework, which includes tax incentives and funds dedicated to non-conventional energy sources, has attracted significant investments in solar projects. Fintech platforms play a crucial role in connecting these projects with investors, using tools such as green bonds and blockchain technology to facilitate financing. Despite challenges such as grid connectivity and the intermittency of solar energy, the integration of fintech solutions presents a promising future for expanding the footprint of solar energy in Colombia, improving both its economic viability and its contribution to sustainable development. Countries in Latin America, including Colombia, are experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand. Specifically, Colombia has been significantly reliant on hydroelectric power, accounting for 70 per cent of the nation\u2019s generation. However, the biggest opportunities for hydroelectric projects have already been tapped. Given this context, the renewable energy sector has a massive growth opportunity in the following few years, and requires a quick capital injection to keep pace with the regional growth. Unergy is helping to close the investment gap in renewable energy opportunities by directing resources from both retail and institutional investors toward the development of renewable energy projects that are both necessary for the energetic safety of the region and are also profitable with double-digit returns. Unergy achieves this by leveraging on blockchain technology to tokenise the ownership over the renewable energy infrastructure and create the uWatt, a digital currency backed by a portfolio of operative renewable energy projects. By purchasing and trading the uWatt, investors from all over the world are creating a liquid market of investment in tokenised renewable energy infrastructure that incentivises the developers of these projects and generates stable yields for the holders of the uWatt token. Given the market necessity of developing high impact renewable energy infrastructure, combined with the availability of a great solar and wind potential, Colombia is an ideal spot to invest in clean energy projects. Through Unergy\u2019s model, investors from all over the world can easily participate in the development of solar energy projects and generate stable returns. The current regulation favours this kind of projects and allows them to accelerate its development which usually takes between two or three years, down to just five months. Additionally, economic conditions are starting to settle down, after a period of high interest rates that we lived between 2022 and 2023. This is decreasing the cost of capital and allowing many retail and institutional investors to lean onto alternative investment opportunities, which creates very favourable conditions for the development of the energy infrastructure we need. In Colombia, the regulation of digital assets is still in its very early stages, and although this opens the window for innovation, it also poses some challenges with respect to creating confidence in more traditional investors. However, the adoption of digital financial products is growing rapidly, and we can see that by the surge of new fintech models around digital wallets, tokenized investments, crowd-funding platforms, crowdlending to MSEs, factoring, digital real estate, and many other models that give the local fintech sector a very diversified offer. Unergy is aiming for rapid \u2013 but organic \u2013 growth in the short and medium term. Our next big step is to launch our renewable energy tokens in new markets across LatAm such as Peru, Chile, Mexico and Argentina, and gain a significant adoption in those markets, while we also strengthen the adoption of our product in Colombia. We have designed the uWatt in a way that addresses the concerns of the retail sector in these countries, since it maintains a stable value over time, at the same time that it generates stable yields, so it can be used to protect against inflation and at the same time as a highly liquid investment vehicle. As a start-up, we\u2019re aiming to raise and close a seed round by the third quarter of this year. As the global push for sustainable and clean energy continues to gain momentum, Latin America, and Colombia in particular, find themselves at the forefront of a transformative journey. Unergy emerges as a pivotal player in this transition, demonstrating the power of fintech innovations in reshaping the renewable energy landscape. In conclusion, Unergy stands as a beacon of innovation within the fintech renewable energy sector, embodying the potential for technology-driven solutions to spearhead meaningful and lasting change. Its journey reflects a broader movement towards integrating financial ingenuity with sustainable development goals, offering a glimpse into a future where renewable energy is not only viable but preferred. As Unergy continues to expand and evolve, its impact on Colombia, Latin America, and potentially the world, offers an inspiring testament to the role of fintech in paving the way for a cleaner, greener future.

This innovative approach, which is getting legally possible and popular in certain countries, not only democratizes investment in real estate, but can also introduce a level of liquidity previously unseen in the sector. As India\u2019s real estate market is projected to grow exponentially, reaching USD 1 trillion by 2030, the adoption of blockchain asset tokenization with regulatory support could be the catalyst needed for this burgeoning growth. The Essence of Blockchain in Real Estate Blockchain technology, with its decentralized nature, offers a secure and transparent platform for conducting transactions without the need for intermediaries. This technology underpins the tokenization process, where real estate assets are converted into digital tokens that represent a fractional ownership or interest in the property. These tokens can be traded on blockchain platforms, enhancing liquidity and making real estate investment accessible to a broader audience. The Mechanism of Asset Tokenization Asset tokenization involves three core elements: the incoming asset (property), the blockchain infrastructure for \u201csubstitution\u201d of the asset, and the virtual asset version (digital tokens). This process not only simplifies the investment in real estate but also opens up the market to small investors by enabling fractional ownership. The Boston Consulting Group predicts that asset tokenization could reach $16 trillion within the next decade, with real estate tokenization playing a significant role. The Role of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Decentralized Finance (DeFi) introduces a digital monetary ecosystem built on blockchain, facilitating borrowing, lending, and exchanging without traditional financial intermediaries. In the realm of real estate tokenization, DeFi enhances efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity, further revolutionizing the sector. Real Estate Asset Tokenization: A New Era Tokenizing real estate assets involves creating digital tokens that correspond to a specific portion of a property, allowing for fractional ownership. This approach not only makes real estate investment more accessible but also increases market liquidity. With the global property market valued at an estimated $228 trillion, tokenization has the potential to significantly expand investment opportunities and poised to be a tremendous volume business in near future. This not only increase liquidity in Real Estate, but can also enhance general liquidity in the market for all businesses, by giving opportunity to get liquidity out of dormant fixed assets. The Process and Regulatory Landscape The process of real estate asset tokenization encompasses several steps, from identifying the asset and clearing legal regulations to developing smart contracts, launching the token for fractional ownership and ensuring distribution of income. Regulatory considerations are crucial, as the framework for asset tokenization is still evolving. Countries like Singapore, Thailand, UK, and USA have already come up with regulations to facilitate asset tokenization. Despite Regulatory aversion for Crypto Currencies in India, there is need to look at Asset Based Cryptos like Real Estate differently as it is relatively safe underlying assets and more robust than the traditional fractional funding mechanism. Incidentally, GIFT City in Ahmadabad may be the first to effectively explore Asset Tokenization in India. Future Outlook and Conclusion The future of real estate asset tokenization is promising, with potential impacts on traditional financial systems and opportunities for further research and innovation. This approach can revolutionize real estate. As the regulatory landscape evolves and more countries recognize the benefits of asset tokenization, we can expect a significant shift in how real estate investments are made, ultimately leading to a more inclusive and liquid market. Blockchain asset tokenization can bring a significant leap forward for the real estate sector in India. Proper Regulatory frame work can enable even Residential Asset Tokenization triggering a huge market liquidity for investment by Start ups and MSMEs, by enabling fractional ownership, enhancing liquidity, and democratizing investment. Tokenisation has the potential to reshape the landscape of real estate investment, making it more accessible and appealing to a wider range of investors. As we move forward, the continued evolution and adoption of blockchain technology will be key to unlocking the full potential of real estate tokenization, paving the way for a more inclusive and dynamic real estate market in India and beyond.

At its first-ever annual event held during Paris Blockchain Week, Sui was feted by developers and builders from around the world during a two-day event. Speakers at Sui Basecamp spanned all aspects of the industry from payments to gaming to e-commerce to major league sports, offering commentary in keynotes, panels, and fireside chats. The event was punctuated by three major announcements. In partnership with Playtron, the Sui team announced the SuiPlay0x1, the world\u2019s first lightweight handheld gaming device designed with native Web3 capabilities, and promising new gaming experiences. Additionally, First Digital Labs, joined an announcement that FDUSD, the fastest-growing stablecoin in crypto, will be the first native dollar-backed stablecoin on Sui, a boon to Sui\u2019s DeFi ecosystem, which is already the fastest-growing in the industry. Finally, Sui announced Enoki, a suite of Web3 utilities that will make it very simple for enterprises to leverage decentralized solutions inside their applications, products and services. \u201cIn building Sui, we began with a blank canvas, aiming to create the preeminent platform for decentralized applications without the structural limitations we saw in other blockchains,\u201d said Evan Cheng, Co-founder and CEO of Mysten Labs, originator of the Sui Network. \u201cLess than a year after launching Sui\u2019s mainnet, the remarkable strength of Sui\u2019s performance has confirmed the approach. From nearly limitless horizontal scalability to industry leading speed of execution to achieving the most transactions in a single day of any blockchain ever, Sui\u2019s performance has been exceptional and the network has only scratched the surface.\u201d The industry veterans who founded Sui launched its mainnet nearly a year ago to great expectations, and the network has performed exceptionally well. Rather than cloning an existing network, the Sui team started from scratch to build an entirely new infrastructure layer that addressed the shortcomings of existing blockchains. They started by creating Move, a novel smart contract language, and on top of it created a new architecture centered around objects that enables performance and functionality that is simply not available on existing blockchains. The result is a blockchain that is singular in the industry \u2014 the universal coordination layer for intelligent assets. Sui is a industry leader with lightning-fast transactions, with time to finality clocked at just 400 milliseconds. Likewise, Sui\u2019s scalability is also at the pinnacle, reaching 297,000 TPS in a controlled environment. But the Sui team is also constantly improving its technology. At the conference, members of the Sui team unveiled the next advancement in speed and scalability in the form of Mysticeti, which significantly accelerates Sui\u2019s time to finality, and Pilotfish, which enables nearly unlimited horizontal scaling by validators. And beyond performing in test environments, at just four months old, Sui broke the record for transactions executed in a single day, achieving a higher figure than any existing blockchain while fees remained low and stable. Notably, in nearly a year of its mainnet, Sui has not experienced a single minute of downtime. Gradually, after a series of community events around the world, media stories highlighting Sui\u2019s remarkable early milestones, sustained ecosystem growth and multiple stories of builders eschewing other blockchains to leverage the Sui network, builders, developers, investors and the broader community have begun to understand the potential for Sui\u2019s groundbreaking blockchain technology.

This collaboration is particularly significant for DeFi initiatives on Sui, providing them with the unprecedented ability to include native BTC and ETH transactions, a milestone in blockchain interoperability and functionality. To implement the dWallet primitive, the dWallet Network utilizes 2PC-MPC, the state-of-the-art protocol invented by its team. This industry-first multiparty protocol enables the generation of an ECDSA signature in a non-collusive way, requiring participation from both the end-user and a significant number of nodes, the number of which could potentially reach hundreds or thousands. Omer Sadika, Co-Founder of dWallet Network, expressed his excitement about the partnership, stating, \u201cWe are excited to partner with Mysten Labs and bring our decentralized, non-collusive dWallet building block to the Sui ecosystem. This partnership not only broadens the horizons for DeFi and gaming on Sui but also represents a significant leap towards realizing our vision of a seamless, multi-chain future.\u201d An exciting aspect of this partnership is the use of dWallets in conjunction with Sui\u2019s zkLogin feature, offering a simplified Web2 user experience for managing assets across blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. This innovative approach leverages the ease of Web2 logins, like Google accounts, to interact with any asset on any blockchain, thereby reducing barriers to entry for users and enabling mass adoption of blockchain technology. Furthermore, the collaboration extends beyond technical integration, with dWallet Network and the Sui Foundation co-hosting the Overflow hackathon. This event underscores the commitment of both projects to foster innovation, community engagement, and the development of cutting-edge applications within the Sui ecosystem. \u201cInteroperability is key to the growth of blockchain-powered applications. The introduction of dWallet\u2019s innovative tooling will enable users in the Sui ecosystem to operate seamlessly across disparate protocols,\u201d said Evan Cheng, CEO and co-founder of Mysten Labs, original contributor to Sui. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to join dWallet in creating a multichain future.\u201d The strategic alliance between Mysten Labs and dWallet Network marks a significant milestone, promising to bring unprecedented flexibility, security, and efficiency to multichain DeFi and gaming.

Overcoming the Challenges of Traditional Smart Contract Audits in Blockchain Projects Blockchain-related projects trade users\u2019 assets on-chain, and the smart contracts governing this logic are at risk of being attacked. As a measure, \u201csmart contract audits (Audit)\u201d are conducted, but users of existing major audit firms face the following challenges: As an approach to solve these issues, Bunzz, the smart contract development infrastructure, has researched and developed an AI-based audit service, \u201cBunzz Audit.\u201d In the open beta version in January this year, Bunzz received a lot of positive feedback, and it has now officially launched \u201cBunzz Audit\u201d as a formal version. Product page: https://www.bunzz.dev/audit   The Significance of Using AI for Smart Contract Audits The tasks performed by audit firms can broadly be classified as follows: For the first task, vulnerabilities in smart contracts are normally checked by humans reviewing the source code. However, due to variations in auditors\u2019 knowledge of vulnerability patterns and their detection capabilities, oversights due to human error are a current issue. In this regard, Bunzz Audit owns a database of previously discovered vulnerability patterns and adopts an auditing method that scans code from over 100 perspectives. This approach allows for comprehensive coverage and accurate, omission-free vulnerability identification, which is physically impossible for humans. From the results obtained through research and development, Bunzz believes that for detecting vulnerability patterns as in the first task, a database + AI approach is more suitable than a human approach. Regarding the second task of detecting vulnerabilities specific to a project\u2019s logic, this is not addressed by the above approach but rather by professional auditors from the Bunzz Audit team (as an option). Clients can choose between two types of audits: one that only reviews the code and another comprehensive audit that includes both the code and the project-specific logic.  Currently, Bunzz is distributing a 10% discount promotion code for free. Using this code, audits are available for 1,791 USD. The fee remains constant regardless of the amount of source code or the level of vulnerabilities found, allowing for the highest level of ROI in the industry. Please give it a try.

Leveraging the newly unveiled dWallet primitive, smart contracts using rollups built on Avail DA will be able to programmatically manage native BTC for the first time while preserving user ownership. This marks a paradigm shift from emerging Bitcoin L2 solutions that predominantly rely on collusive and often risky cross-chain solutions, such as bridges, where the user must sacrifice ownership of their BTC. \u201cAllowing BTC to be used programmatically on other blockchains via a trust-minimized approach is a clever approach to increasing BTC adoption.\u201d said Anurag Arjun, co-founder Avail. \u201cTogether with dWallet, we can enable Layer-2 chains or rollups on top of the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin represents a superb base layer from the DA perspective, with the highest security available in the ecosystem. As a result, the dWallet integration will enable users to leverage arbitrary execution and logic to secure their BTC via a decentralized multiparty computation (MPC) solution.\u201d In essence, the collaboration aims to harness dWallet\u2019s MPC infrastructure to enhance Bitcoin\u2019s capabilities by enabling the creation of native bitcoin rollups \u2014 ushering in more efficient and secure transactions and operations on the Bitcoin blockchain and supporting a wider range of functionalities beyond simple transactions. The integration with the dWallet Network, coupled with the ability to control dWallets from a smart contract on any Avail rollup, was made possible through Avail Nexus, a zero-knowledge coordination rollup embedding validity-proof based light clients and execution proof aggregation. This pivotal move towards the unification of Web3 will also enable developers to power Avail Fusion\u2019s borrowed security from native assets of the most mature ecosystems, including BTC, ETH, and others. Furthermore, the dWallet Network integration will facilitate the Fusion Security model when it goes live, empowering users to securely hold their BTC, ETH, or other assets in dWallets and stake them to bolster the safety of the Avail ecosystem, all while maintaining ownership of their native assets. This introduces the first native multi-chain staking/restaking solution aimed at securing the consensus of a different blockchain. To implement the dWallet primitive, the dWallet Network utilizes 2PC-MPC, the state-of-the-art protocol invented by its team. This industry-first multiparty protocol enables the generation of an ECDSA signature in a non-collusive way, requiring participation from both the end-user and a significant number of nodes, the number of which could potentially reach hundreds or thousands. dWallet technology allows a Solidity smart contract on an Avail rollup to create Bitcoin signatures and enables developers to manage a dWallet. Meanwhile, the dWallet Network mandates approval from the Avail rollup smart contract for logic enforcement, requiring users to finalize the signature to prevent collusion and asset theft. Whether for Web3 applications in custody, DeFi, DAOs, gaming, or other domains, any protocol on an Avail rollup can leverage dWallets for enhanced functionality and secure interoperability. \u201cWe are excited to team up with Avail because our visions of a unified Web3 have so much in common, with both companies striving to bring countless disparate ecosystems together,\u201d noted Omer Sadika, co-founder of dWallet Network. \u201cWe firmly believe that the future of Web3 is multi-chain, not cross-chain, and together with Avail, we will continue to work tirelessly on making this vision a reality.\u201d This latest integration aligns perfectly with Avail\u2019s mission to unify Web3, for which it\u2019s already employing a comprehensive full-stack architecture that comprises three innovative solutions \u2014 DA, Nexus, and Fusion Security \u2014 to help usher in the rollup future and solve the growing scalability pains of the blockchain industry. Avail DA stands as the initial cornerstone element of the Avail trinity, offering expansive blobspace for rollup developers and serving as a foundational layer for a diverse and vibrant ecosystem of rollups. Avail Nexus, aimed at unifying the ecosystem beyond the blockchains built atop Avail\u2019s DA layer, employs Avail DA as the trust anchor for ecosystem-wide coordination. Lastly, Fusion Security will offer additional protection to an expanding network of rollups and blockchains, thus enhancing Avail\u2019s consensus mechanism. Supercharging the Avail trinity with dWallets accelerates the unification of Web3, addresses issues of fragmentation, and paves the way for a completely integrated, secure, and native experience across all Web3 ecosystems.
