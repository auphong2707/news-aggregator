Specifically, Colombia has been significantly reliant on hydroelectric power, accounting for 70 per cent of the nation\u2019s generation. However, the biggest opportunities for hydroelectric projects have already been tapped. Given this context, the renewable energy sector has a massive growth opportunity in the following few years, and requires a quick capital injection to keep pace with the regional growth. Unergy is helping to close the investment gap in renewable energy opportunities by directing resources from both retail and institutional investors toward the development of renewable energy projects that are both necessary for the energetic safety of the region and are also profitable with double-digit returns. Unergy achieves this by leveraging on blockchain technology to tokenise the ownership over the renewable energy infrastructure and create the uWatt, a digital currency backed by a portfolio of operative renewable energy projects. By purchasing and trading the uWatt, investors from all over the world are creating a liquid market of investment in tokenised renewable energy infrastructure that incentivises the developers of these projects and generates stable yields for the holders of the uWatt token. Given the market necessity of developing high impact renewable energy infrastructure, combined with the availability of a great solar and wind potential, Colombia is an ideal spot to invest in clean energy projects. Through Unergy\u2019s model, investors from all over the world can easily participate in the development of solar energy projects and generate stable returns. The current regulation favours this kind of projects and allows them to accelerate its development which usually takes between two or three years, down to just five months. Additionally, economic conditions are starting to settle down, after a period of high interest rates that we lived between 2022 and 2023. This is decreasing the cost of capital and allowing many retail and institutional investors to lean onto alternative investment opportunities, which creates very favourable conditions for the development of the energy infrastructure we need. In Colombia, the regulation of digital assets is still in its very early stages, and although this opens the window for innovation, it also poses some challenges with respect to creating confidence in more traditional investors. However, the adoption of digital financial products is growing rapidly, and we can see that by the surge of new fintech models around digital wallets, tokenized investments, crowd-funding platforms, crowdlending to MSEs, factoring, digital real estate, and many other models that give the local fintech sector a very diversified offer. Unergy is aiming for rapid \u2013 but organic \u2013 growth in the short and medium term. Our next big step is to launch our renewable energy tokens in new markets across LatAm such as Peru, Chile, Mexico and Argentina, and gain a significant adoption in those markets, while we also strengthen the adoption of our product in Colombia. We have designed the uWatt in a way that addresses the concerns of the retail sector in these countries, since it maintains a stable value over time, at the same time that it generates stable yields, so it can be used to protect against inflation and at the same time as a highly liquid investment vehicle. As a start-up, we\u2019re aiming to raise and close a seed round by the third quarter of this year. As the global push for sustainable and clean energy continues to gain momentum, Latin America, and Colombia in particular, find themselves at the forefront of a transformative journey. Unergy emerges as a pivotal player in this transition, demonstrating the power of fintech innovations in reshaping the renewable energy landscape. In conclusion, Unergy stands as a beacon of innovation within the fintech renewable energy sector, embodying the potential for technology-driven solutions to spearhead meaningful and lasting change. Its journey reflects a broader movement towards integrating financial ingenuity with sustainable development goals, offering a glimpse into a future where renewable energy is not only viable but preferred. As Unergy continues to expand and evolve, its impact on Colombia, Latin America, and potentially the world, offers an inspiring testament to the role of fintech in paving the way for a cleaner, greener future.

This innovative approach, which is getting legally possible and popular in certain countries, not only democratizes investment in real estate, but can also introduce a level of liquidity previously unseen in the sector. As India\u2019s real estate market is projected to grow exponentially, reaching USD 1 trillion by 2030, the adoption of blockchain asset tokenization with regulatory support could be the catalyst needed for this burgeoning growth. The Essence of Blockchain in Real Estate Blockchain technology, with its decentralized nature, offers a secure and transparent platform for conducting transactions without the need for intermediaries. This technology underpins the tokenization process, where real estate assets are converted into digital tokens that represent a fractional ownership or interest in the property. These tokens can be traded on blockchain platforms, enhancing liquidity and making real estate investment accessible to a broader audience. The Mechanism of Asset Tokenization Asset tokenization involves three core elements: the incoming asset (property), the blockchain infrastructure for \u201csubstitution\u201d of the asset, and the virtual asset version (digital tokens). This process not only simplifies the investment in real estate but also opens up the market to small investors by enabling fractional ownership. The Boston Consulting Group predicts that asset tokenization could reach $16 trillion within the next decade, with real estate tokenization playing a significant role. The Role of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Decentralized Finance (DeFi) introduces a digital monetary ecosystem built on blockchain, facilitating borrowing, lending, and exchanging without traditional financial intermediaries. In the realm of real estate tokenization, DeFi enhances efficiency, transparency, and inclusivity, further revolutionizing the sector. Real Estate Asset Tokenization: A New Era Tokenizing real estate assets involves creating digital tokens that correspond to a specific portion of a property, allowing for fractional ownership. This approach not only makes real estate investment more accessible but also increases market liquidity. With the global property market valued at an estimated $228 trillion, tokenization has the potential to significantly expand investment opportunities and poised to be a tremendous volume business in near future. This not only increase liquidity in Real Estate, but can also enhance general liquidity in the market for all businesses, by giving opportunity to get liquidity out of dormant fixed assets. The Process and Regulatory Landscape The process of real estate asset tokenization encompasses several steps, from identifying the asset and clearing legal regulations to developing smart contracts, launching the token for fractional ownership and ensuring distribution of income. Regulatory considerations are crucial, as the framework for asset tokenization is still evolving. Countries like Singapore, Thailand, UK, and USA have already come up with regulations to facilitate asset tokenization. Despite Regulatory aversion for Crypto Currencies in India, there is need to look at Asset Based Cryptos like Real Estate differently as it is relatively safe underlying assets and more robust than the traditional fractional funding mechanism. Incidentally, GIFT City in Ahmadabad may be the first to effectively explore Asset Tokenization in India. Future Outlook and Conclusion The future of real estate asset tokenization is promising, with potential impacts on traditional financial systems and opportunities for further research and innovation. This approach can revolutionize real estate. As the regulatory landscape evolves and more countries recognize the benefits of asset tokenization, we can expect a significant shift in how real estate investments are made, ultimately leading to a more inclusive and liquid market. Blockchain asset tokenization can bring a significant leap forward for the real estate sector in India. Proper Regulatory frame work can enable even Residential Asset Tokenization triggering a huge market liquidity for investment by Start ups and MSMEs, by enabling fractional ownership, enhancing liquidity, and democratizing investment. Tokenisation has the potential to reshape the landscape of real estate investment, making it more accessible and appealing to a wider range of investors. As we move forward, the continued evolution and adoption of blockchain technology will be key to unlocking the full potential of real estate tokenization, paving the way for a more inclusive and dynamic real estate market in India and beyond.

At its first-ever annual event held during Paris Blockchain Week, Sui was feted by developers and builders from around the world during a two-day event. Speakers at Sui Basecamp spanned all aspects of the industry from payments to gaming to e-commerce to major league sports, offering commentary in keynotes, panels, and fireside chats. The event was punctuated by three major announcements. In partnership with Playtron, the Sui team announced the SuiPlay0x1, the world\u2019s first lightweight handheld gaming device designed with native Web3 capabilities, and promising new gaming experiences. Additionally, First Digital Labs, joined an announcement that FDUSD, the fastest-growing stablecoin in crypto, will be the first native dollar-backed stablecoin on Sui, a boon to Sui\u2019s DeFi ecosystem, which is already the fastest-growing in the industry. Finally, Sui announced Enoki, a suite of Web3 utilities that will make it very simple for enterprises to leverage decentralized solutions inside their applications, products and services. \u201cIn building Sui, we began with a blank canvas, aiming to create the preeminent platform for decentralized applications without the structural limitations we saw in other blockchains,\u201d said Evan Cheng, Co-founder and CEO of Mysten Labs, originator of the Sui Network. \u201cLess than a year after launching Sui\u2019s mainnet, the remarkable strength of Sui\u2019s performance has confirmed the approach. From nearly limitless horizontal scalability to industry leading speed of execution to achieving the most transactions in a single day of any blockchain ever, Sui\u2019s performance has been exceptional and the network has only scratched the surface.\u201d The industry veterans who founded Sui launched its mainnet nearly a year ago to great expectations, and the network has performed exceptionally well. Rather than cloning an existing network, the Sui team started from scratch to build an entirely new infrastructure layer that addressed the shortcomings of existing blockchains. They started by creating Move, a novel smart contract language, and on top of it created a new architecture centered around objects that enables performance and functionality that is simply not available on existing blockchains. The result is a blockchain that is singular in the industry \u2014 the universal coordination layer for intelligent assets. Sui is a industry leader with lightning-fast transactions, with time to finality clocked at just 400 milliseconds. Likewise, Sui\u2019s scalability is also at the pinnacle, reaching 297,000 TPS in a controlled environment. But the Sui team is also constantly improving its technology. At the conference, members of the Sui team unveiled the next advancement in speed and scalability in the form of Mysticeti, which significantly accelerates Sui\u2019s time to finality, and Pilotfish, which enables nearly unlimited horizontal scaling by validators. And beyond performing in test environments, at just four months old, Sui broke the record for transactions executed in a single day, achieving a higher figure than any existing blockchain while fees remained low and stable. Notably, in nearly a year of its mainnet, Sui has not experienced a single minute of downtime. Gradually, after a series of community events around the world, media stories highlighting Sui\u2019s remarkable early milestones, sustained ecosystem growth and multiple stories of builders eschewing other blockchains to leverage the Sui network, builders, developers, investors and the broader community have begun to understand the potential for Sui\u2019s groundbreaking blockchain technology. The crowds that gathered for Sui Basecamp 2024 represented the culmination of Sui\u2019s arrival. \u201cThe overwhelming turnout and the vibrant enthusiasm at the inaugural Sui Basecamp event reflects a Sui community that is captivated by Sui\u2019s potential to make people\u2019s lives better,\u201d said Greg Siourounis, Managing Director of the Sui Foundation. \u201cIn the coming months, the Sui Foundation will continue to focus on expanding the ecosystem of projects leveraging Sui and the number of users benefiting from those applications as we work to make Sui one of the blockchains most widely adopted to solve real world challenges. With cutting edge technology and the most dedicated and professional community in web3 behind it, Sui\u2019s progress so far is just a glimpse of what this network will achieve.\u201d Users can read more on the event on the Sui Blog.

Simultaneously, the Travel & Tourism market is on an upward trajectory, projected to hit $927.30 billion in revenue in 2024, with an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2028) of 3.47%, ultimately reaching a market volume of $1,063.00 billion by 2028. In this expansive sector, the Hotels market takes center stage, expected to reach a market volume of $446.50 billion in 2024, with an estimated 1,397.00 million users by 2028. As user penetration increases from 25.9% in 2024 to a projected 28.1% by 2028, online sales are anticipated to contribute 76% to the total revenue in the Travel & Tourism market by 2028, according to Statista. Concurrently, the retail automation market in the hospitality industry is anticipated to soar to $5.73 billion by 2027, emphasizing the need for innovative technologies to maintain competitiveness in the evolving landscape. Originally devised for validating cryptocurrency transactions, blockchain has evolved into a versatile technology with applications permeating every industry. For hotels exploring the realms of the metaverse and virtual reality, blockchain emerges as a transformative force, promising to elevate their offerings to new heights. Smart Contracts: Revolutionizing Booking Experiences At the forefront of this evolution are smart contracts, self-executing agreements with terms encoded into code. These contracts offer a groundbreaking approach to streamline booking processes, providing a seamless \u201cbook as you see\u201d experience. Blockchain facilitates the deployment of smart contracts for virtual hotel room tours, allowing guests to explore and dynamically adjust terms and conditions based on their preferences. Real-time updates to room availability and automatic payment execution unfold without any manual intervention, ensuring a frictionless and efficient booking process that aligns with the dynamic nature of the metaverse. Decentralized Identity for Seamless Verification Blockchain\u2019s cryptographic signatures and distributed ledgers play a pivotal role in furnishing guests with a verified digital identity. This digital identity encapsulates information traditionally collected through physical IDs, effectively reducing the need for repetitive authentication processes. As guests navigate the virtual hotel landscape, they can do so with confidence, knowing that their identity is secure and verified through blockchain technology. Immutable Rules: Building Trustworthy Virtual Hotels A cornerstone feature of blockchain is its immutability, preventing data from being altered once added to a block. Virtual hotels can leverage this property to establish immutable rules for storing visitor reviews and feedback. Utilizing cryptographic hashing, these hotels create an unalterable proof of concept that reflects honesty and transparency. This, in turn, ensures a trustworthy brand reputation, providing quality assurance that resonates with potential guests in the ever-expanding metaverse. Challenges and Considerations While blockchain holds promising solutions for the virtual hotel industry, challenges persist, particularly in the realms of governance and interoperability: Governance A critical consideration is whether blockchain-based processes align with existing hospitality regulations. As the metaverse evolves, ensuring compliance with regulatory frameworks becomes paramount. Collaborative efforts between industry stakeholders, regulators, and technology developers are crucial to establishing governance frameworks that strike the right balance between innovation and adherence to established standards. Interoperability with Existing Processes and Systems Integration with existing processes and systems presents another challenge. Ensuring seamless interoperability between blockchain solutions and legacy systems is essential for a smooth transition. Industry-wide standards and open communication between technology providers can facilitate the integration process, allowing hotels to leverage blockchain without disrupting their current operations. To Sum up As the metaverse becomes an increasingly integral part of the hotel industry, blockchain\u2019s role in shaping virtual realities is undeniable. From smart contracts for frictionless bookings to decentralized identities enhancing security, blockchain offers a myriad of benefits. Navigating challenges such as governance and interoperability will be crucial for unlocking the full potential of blockchain in building trustworthy and immersive virtual hotel experiences. The journey towards a blockchain-powered metaverse heralds a new era in the hospitality industry, promising innovation, efficiency, and unparalleled guest experiences.

By securing the support of several governments, XCAD aims to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, and enable more people to partake in the Web3 Space. XCAD Network has announced the first government agreement, which is with Pakistan. Under this partnership, XCAD will distribute and incentivise the consumption of educational media among Pakistani citizens. Education is the first step in bringing new people into the Web3 space. As part of the MOUs, XCAD Network will work with governments to launch pilot campaigns to educate their citizens on Web3. These campaigns will be joint campaigns launched by governments and the XCAD team alongside select content creators from that country\u2019s jurisdiction. Users will have to download the XCAD Network application to watch interactive educational content on various Web3 topics. Upon completing the modules and consuming content, users are rewarded with tokens. Blockchain, cryptocurrency and the Web3 world will be the key focus areas. However, governments can also focus education on other subjects, such as financial literacy. Oliver Bell, the Chief Executive Officer of XCAD Network, commented, \u201cWorking directly with Government entities is incredibly exciting for the XCAD project and the Web3 Space as a whole. What we\u2019re doing aligns with the government\u2019s vision towards digitisation and global blockchain adoption\u201d Another way that XCAD plans to work with Government entities, is by leveraging the XCAD platform to boost travel and tourism engagement in their country. They want to partner with creators and citizens to create engaging educational content around tourism in their country. Those who consume the content are then rewarded. XCAD Network has already onboarded some of the biggest YouTubers in the world to issue creator tokens on its platform. However, getting governments involved gives the project more credibility. This allows XCAD Network to attract even bigger names to issue creator tokens, stay on top of regulatory requirements and drive more users to the XCAD platform. About XCAD Network XCAD Network allows YouTube creators to launch personalised tokens and generate dedicated economies around their loyal fan-base It also offers new upstart creators a way to earn tokens and generate income even before the creator generates traction on YouTube itself. In addition to helping generate new revenue, XCAD Network fosters deeper engagement through gamification and rewards. Fans benefit monetarily from the growth of their favourite creators, thus strengthening the bonds between creators and their followers. The platform is backed by famous YouTubers such as KSI and Mr Beast, and is home to 100+ celebrity influencers globally with a combined audience of over 800M. The XCAD ecosystem consists of DEXs, a governance portal, a browser plugin with Youtube integration, cross-chain bridges, staking pools, and creator swap, which lets users exchange creator tokens.

Syntax marks the manifestation of the Agent Economy in Web3. Today, Spectral Labs has launched Syntax, a new LLM enabling people to ship agents that automate onchain projects and tasks, thereby manifesting their Web3 product ideas. While still in beta, Syntax\u2019s vision is to create an open onchain Agent Economy, where developers, individuals, and enterprises can for the first time select the agents they would want to delegate their Web3 tasks, projects, and product development to. These projects and products include production grade smart contracts, arbitrage agents, NFTs, rollups, and more. Scaling web3 engineering efforts and shipping new onchain products is limited by the number of solidity developers, as well as enterprises\u2019 ability to test and ship smart contract code in a fast and effective way without burning through engineering resources. Spectral has set out to solve this with its new LLM, Syntax, a development environment designed to manifest Web3 product ideas by converting natural language into Solidity code that can be deployed instantly onchain. For professional developers, Syntax can accelerate and optimize bandwidth by writing large libraries and components. Syntax provides an Agentic experience, where users tell Syntax what they want to build, and Syntax writes and deploys the code onchain at the click of a button. Spectral defines an Onchain Agent as a set of instructions and code capable of deploying itself onchain and possessing a dedicated provisioned wallet for doing so. Loosely similar to custom instructions in ChatGPT, Syntax Agents also have their own identity and can autonomously figure out ways to interact with deployment infrastructure. With Syntax, users can compile, debug, and deploy AI-generated solidity code. Syntax gives users and the industry the ability to quickly test, ship and scale new products, as well as determining the usability and functional relevance of the code generated while also giving them control to quickly edit code snippets. Initially, Spectral\u2019s Onchain Agents will be curated and built by Spectral, but soon every user will be able to create their own Agent and monetize it in future Syntax releases. \u201cAt Spectral, we\u2019re pioneering a future where autonomous Agents redefine what\u2019s possible onchain. With Spectral Syntax, we empower these agents to operate independently, making it simpler for everyone to bring their blockchain ideas to life.\u201d \u2013 Sishir Varghese, Founder. What truly sets Syntax apart is its capability to deploy code directly onchain, executing deployments through Foundry by writing instructions that Foundry can process, including code compilation, onchain deployment, and signing transactions. Syntax is pioneering an accessible onchain Agent Economy, inviting users to select agents tailored for their specific Web3 tasks. Users can either interact with the foundational agent or opt for one of the specialized agents, each adept in distinct tasks and operations\u2014like the Code Forker assistant, ideal for those aiming to fork and customize a codebase. Additionally, users can discern an agent\u2019s expertise and trustworthiness by reviewing its category listing and the popularity reflected through its user engagement. \u201cSyntax by Spectral is at the forefront of merging AI with web3, pioneering the onchain agent economy and making it easier and more accessible for users to create their own blockchain products,\u201d said Josh Rosenthal, Partner, Polychain Syntax produces accurate and gas-optimized Solidity code for a variety of prompts ranging from low to medium complexity, and it outperforms baseline models on Spectral\u2019s Solidity evaluation dataset. As Spectral\u2019s modeling efforts continue to evolve, the company expects Syntax to deliver optimized code for increasingly complex problems. These Solidity models are explicitly designed to assist developers in writing optimized, modern, well-tested, and secure code. About Spectral Spectral, a pioneer of the agent economy behind Syntax, is at the forefront of integrating AI with blockchain to democratize development in Web3. Our mission is to simplify the creation and deployment of decentralized applications through autonomous Onchain Agents. Syntax, Spectral\u2019s flagship product, translates natural language into Solidity code, enabling both novices and experts to build on the blockchain effortlessly. With a commitment to transparency and user empowerment, Spectral is shaping a future where anyone can participate in the blockchain revolution.

Exclusion from banks and essential financial services traps people in poverty, fuels inequality, and stifles economic growth. This is where DLT could play a major role in lifting individuals out of poverty and guiding them toward prosperity and growth. DLT can transform government schemes, such as Direct Fund Transfers, by overcoming beneficiary identification and data sharing challenges. Blockchain Redefining Financial Landscape Financial inclusion rests upon four pivotal pillars: Access \u2013 focus on using financial products considering cost and distance, Quality \u2013 assessing appropriateness and client awareness, Trust \u2013 reliability of digital services, and Usage \u2013 examining customer engagement. The rapid adoption of technology has promoted financial inclusion, notably in India with initiatives such as Aadhaar Card linking to Jan Dhan accounts for the rural and unbanked population. This integration facilitates the government\u2019s Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, ensuring monetary compensation delivery to the intended recipients. But does our current technology guarantee the efficient execution of DBT schemes? Is the core principle of \u2018eligibility\u2019 truly driving the success of the program? Diving deep into the matter, it is evident that DLT will serve as a crucial tool in the implementation of government schemes, improving their efficiency. Its role is to guarantee the appropriate utilization of government subsidies and benefits. The underlying principle focuses on outcomes rather than mere eligibility. Let us explore a few use cases: Education loans to the underprivileged: Upon receiving a loan and commencing their education, a student\u2019s performance metrics, including attendance and test scores, are recorded on the blockchain. Conditions encoded in the DLT govern this process, linking performance to a variable interest rate. Improved academic performance leads to lower interest rates, fostering productivity and ensuring proper use of public schemes. Farmer subsidy: When a farmer receives fertilizer subsidies, the aim is to boost crop yield. However, there is a risk of misuse if the farmer is not actively farming and utilizing subsidy as per linked land. Using DLT and real-time drone imagery of the farmer\u2019s land, authorities can verify crop cultivation coverage. This ensures that subsidies align with outcomes, promoting efficient allocation of government funds. In addition to India, other Public Distributed System (PDS) such as Brazil\u2019s Bolsa Fam\u00edlia program, or Kenya\u2019s Uwezo Fund can enhance productivity and effectiveness via DLT. DLT is poised to fuel economic growth. It transcends mere technological innovation, emerging as a transformative force for empowering communities and individuals economically.

For creators to undergo a transformation in this digital era, it seems that the answer lies in decentralisation induced by Web3.0. Web3.0, seemingly hailed as the next step in the Internet\u2019s progression, is believed to have hit the spotlight over its ability to help the creator economy go beyond traditional boundaries. With possibilities ranging over integration between Web3.0 and the creator economy, a paradigm shift towards individual empowerment and digital autonomy can unfold. \u201cI think Web3.0 allows for direct interaction between creators and audiences through decentralised applications (dApps). Using blockchain, creators can leverage tools such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to monetise their work and build communities around it. Fans can invest directly in creators and own unique experiences. This has the potential to facilitate new revenue streams. Decentralisation is considered important as it allows creators to govern projects without centralised control,\u201d Sumit Ghosh, co-founder and CEO, Chingari, a Web3.0 live streaming application, told FE TransformX. So, how exactly is there a relationship between Web3.0 and the creator economy? According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), a professional service firm, despite Web2.0 helping creators by reducing entry obstacles for social and other media platforms to increase engagement, it creates autonomy of power. In that regard, Web3.0 has the potential to ensure equitable distribution of power by transferring ownership from centralised officials to individuals and communities. From what it\u2019s understood, this segregation in power gets implemented using technologies such as NFTs, smart contracts, decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs), and blockchain. As far as Web3.0 for NFTs is concerned, creators can earn revenue through NFT transactions, token incentivisation, and membership plans. Moreover, Web3.0 can help creators allocate content across different blockchain-based platforms, along with relationship development across DAOs and the establishment of connections with audiences worldwide unrestricted by transaction barriers or geographic boundaries. \u201cI believe decentralised funding models such as DAOs allow creators to seek support directly from their audience. Smart contracts can ensure fair compensation and transparent revenue distribution. NFTs can provide immutable proof of ownership and authenticity for digital creations. Collaborative creation and ownership models can foster inclusivity and cooperation among creators. Community engagement and decentralised governance mechanisms can empower audiences to participate in decision-making. Overall, Web3.0 can enhance the creator economy by promoting autonomy, fairness, and engagement,\u201d Prakash Kamaraj, managing director, Chaincraft Labs Inc, a Web3.0-based technological consultancy firm, explained. According to media reports, digital marketing is considered an important segment of the creator economy developed by Web2.0. Insights from a study conducted by Gartner, a management consulting company, found that around 72% of businesses intend to expand their Web3.0 marketing costs in 2024. Reportedly, different corporations have already entered into the Web3.0 landscape, with Samsung and Nascar entering into collaborations with blockchain-oriented firms and Starbucks trying to implement an NFT loyalty program. In recent developments, Friend.tech, a decentralised social network, entered into the Web3.0-based creator economy and clocked $50 million worth of fees within three months, along with garnering 75,000 daily active users. Market experts believe that the influencer marketing landscape could shift towards user-generated content rather than brand-centric content, with the influence of Web3.0. In terms of valuation, Goldman Sachs, an investment banking company, has valued the creator economy at roughly $250 billion, and Metav.rs, a no-code metaverse platform, has valued the Web3.0 market to reach $81.5 billion by 2030. Overall, in 2024, market research has suggested that the anticipated bull run will benefit the Web3.0-based creator economy. It\u2019s believed that Web3.0 influencers available on TikTok, X, formerly Twitter, YouTube, among others, are and will be valuable for sustaining the Web3.0 creator economy, on account of their interactions with individuals belonging to Web3.0 networks such as Chainlink, Solana, Ethereum, and Cosmos. \u201cIn 2024, I anticipate more creators, from nano to mogul levels, leveraging platforms such as Roblox and Fortnite to reach new audiences, a trend we seem to be already witnessing. With online followings reaching saturation, creators should explore distribution channels beyond social media and seek alternative revenue sources. I am expecting more creator economy-focused startups to come up with better value propositions, and platforms that are more mindful about monetisation opportunities and optimised for creators. If you see one of the key narratives driving the Web3.0 specific market sentiment, it should be the creator economy, and we could expect some funding rounds in the coming months,\u201d Ravi Chamria, co-founder and CEO, Zeeve, a blockchain deployment and management platform, concluded.

During testing and development in a Sui blockchain environment, Pilotfish, a prototype Sui extension, increased throughput by 8x when backed by 8 machines, successfully illustrating the possibility of linear scaling. Notably, the latency per transaction decreased as more machines were added during the test, proving the viability of linear horizontal scaling for low latency blockchain transactions for the first time ever on any blockchain. This proof-of-concept, was formally presented as an academic preprint titled, \u201cPilotfish: Distributed Transaction Execution for Lazy Blockchains,\u201d and initially shared on January 29, 2024 as an article on the open access archive arXiv. \u201cPilotfish is a game changer as the blockchain industry seeks to achieve the same dynamic capacity increase currently possible only with centralized server technologies,\u201d said Lefteris Kokoris-Kogias, one of the authors of the paper and researcher at Mysten Labs. \u201cPilotfish has the potential to push throughput well beyond what is currently at the forefront of high-performance blockchains, enabling transaction throughput levels no other blockchain existing today can achieve.\u201d Sui leads the industry in throughput by leveraging multiple cores for parallel transaction execution within individual validators. Using this approach, within months following mainnet, Sui reached 65.8 million transaction executions in a single day\u2014the most of any blockchain ever. However, a single machine can only incorporate a finite number of cores, so throughput gains via this strategy are limited. Moreover, the machines capable of accommodating large numbers of cores are expensive to buy and use. The breakthrough solution that Pilotfish offers enables a single validator to employ multiple servers simultaneously. This new technology not only makes elastic capacity possible, but its auto-scaling architecture, akin to centralized solutions like AWS or Heroku, allows the use of smaller, cheaper servers available on demand. Nearly all other blockchains aiming to scale use some form of batching\u2014grouping transactions together to be added all at once. The downside of this method is significant additional latency. Instead of transactions moving directly to finality, they are delayed waiting for others to be batched for execution with them. Unlike these other scaling solutions, Pilotfish achieves potentially linear throughput scaling without increasing latency. In the simplest terms, with the horizontal scaling enabled by Pilotfish, simply by engaging the requisite number of machines, a validator can adapt its throughput and resource use to the use case at hand. Alberto Sonnino, a research scientist at Mysten Labs, said, \u201cUntil now the only option to increase a validator\u2019s capacity has been to upgrade to a more powerful machine. Pilotfish removes that constraint, making possible horizontal scaling by simply adding servers and without delaying execution. With Pilotfish, the question is no longer whether a level of throughput is possible, only how many servers it will require.\u201d Pilotfish achieves its remarkable scalability by enabling a single validator to execute transactions across multiple machines. Specifically, Pilotfish partitions the validation function into three key roles: (1) the Primary, which handles sequencing transactions using a high-throughput consensus, (2) SequencingWorkers (SWs), which store transactions and dispatch them for execution; and (3) ExecutionWorkers (EWs), which store the blockchain state and execute transactions received from the SWs. Different components may reside on multiple different machines to increase the capacity of the system with more precision. In experimental results, Pilotfish has already achieved remarkable results in terms of linear scaling, low latency, and support for various workloads. In testing, Pilotfish reduced network response times and maintained a latency envelope below 20ms. Future plans include enhancements like multiple SequencingWorkers, shard replication, and ultra-fast networking.
