Why does the market keep repeating these cycles, instead of supporting the more productive blockchain-based innovations that will truly make a difference? Memecoins are crypto tokens used mostly for humour, born of joining an online community that’s in on the joke. You’ve probably heard of Dogecoin, based on the old doge meme featuring images of Shiba Inu dogs. It emerged as a loose community online when someone ironically added a cryptocurrency that later had some financial value. This kind of memecoin embodies various facets of internet culture and is mostly harmless. But my goal here is not to defend or to diminish memecoins. It’s to point out the absurdity of a regulatory regime in the US that lets meme-only tokens thrive — while crypto companies and blockchain tokens with more productive uses face hurdles. We see this everyday while working with entrepreneurs and start-ups. Any mememaker can easily create, launch, and even automatically list tokens. But entrepreneurs trying to build something lasting? They get stuck in regulatory purgatory. Think about it this way: we’d consider it a policy failure if we had a securities market that incentivised only GameStop meme stocks, but rejected the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. Yet current regulations encourage platforms to list memecoins and not other, more useful tokens that make it possible for individuals and communities to own internet platforms and services. But the lack of regulatory clarity in the crypto industry means platforms and entrepreneurs fear that the more productive blockchain token they are listing or developing could suddenly be deemed a security. I call the distinction between these more speculative and productive use cases in the crypto industry the “computer vs the casino”. One culture (“the casino”) sees blockchains as a way to launch tokens primarily for trading and gambling. The other (“the computer”) is more interested in blockchains as a new platform for innovation, much like web, social and mobile were before it. Such blockchain-based innovations include decentralising AI and verifying what’s real against deepfakes. So why are we prioritising memes over matter? US securities laws do not empower the Securities and Exchange Commission to make merit-based judgments about an investment. Nor is it the SEC’s job to end speculation altogether. Instead, its role is to protect investors; to maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets; and to facilitate capital formation. The commission is failing across all three objectives when it comes to digital asset markets and tokens. The primary test the SEC uses to determine whether or not something is a security is the 1946 Howey test, which involves assessing a number of factors — including whether there is “a reasonable expectation of profits” due to the managerial efforts of others. Take, for example, bitcoin and ethereum: while both crypto projects began with the vision of a single person, they evolved into communities of developers with no one entity in control — so potential investors don’t have to rely on anyone’s managerial efforts. These technologies now function like public infrastructure rather than proprietary platforms. Unfortunately, other entrepreneurs building innovative projects don’t know how to qualify for the same regulatory treatment as bitcoin (founded in 2009) and ethereum (2013-2014). These are the only significant blockchain projects that the SEC has deemed, explicitly or implicitly, not to involve managerial efforts. The SEC approach has led to much confusion and uncertainty in the industry. While the Howey test is well reasoned, it is inherently subjective. Memecoin projects don’t have developers so there’s no pretence of memecoin investors relying on the managerial efforts of anyone. Memecoins thus propagate, while more innovative projects struggle. The answer isn’t less regulation — it’s better regulation. Specific solutions include adding well-tailored disclosures to provide regular investors with more information. Another solution is requiring long lock-up periods to prevent get-rich-quick schemes. Regulators implemented similar protections following the Great Depression, after the excesses of the roaring 1920s and stock market crash of 1929. Once those guardrails were in place, we saw an unprecedented era of growth and innovation in our markets and economy. It’s time for regulators to learn from the mistakes of the past.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Chris Dixon","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2024-04-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/a41de872-11cb-4ad2-87f4-e55eaef9cff0","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fe9c1fc94-6697-48e1-ad4d-34b49d75e760.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Digital financial services: an explainer","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/fbe27292-4df9-4610-99e0-a93121e06dd3","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F9522194b-001d-41a8-a0c9-06c8970ce94f.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"$100mn in crypto payments traced to Myanmar-based ‘scammers’","INTRO":"Analysts say Tether digital coins were used to transfer funds from victims of ‘pig butchering’ racket","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A single company operating from a compound in Myanmar has swindled over $100mn from victims in less than two years, according to analysis by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis and US anti-slavery group International Justice Mission. Chainalysis said it had tracked digital coins issued by Tether, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency platforms, that were used in so-called “pig butchering” scams in which false romantic relationships are engineered in order to gain a victim’s trust. It said Tether tokens had also been used to make payments to a company based in a compound known as KK Park in eastern Myanmar from the families of trafficked workers that it said had been forced to pay ransoms for their release. “Everyone has known for a long time that these kinds of scams are blockchain-based, but this is the first time we’ve been able to tie it to a specific location and a known compound,” said Eric Heintz, global analyst at International Justice Mission. The analysis found that the single Chinese company was able to pull over $100mn in cryptocurrency into just two digital wallets, a scale that Jackie Koven, head of cyber threat intelligence at Chainalysis, said showed the extent to which bad actors were using digital assets to fuel a burgeoning black market. Tether’s eponymous tokens are designed to track the US dollar and have previously been used by criminal groups as a cross-border payment tool. “This case is so illustrative of what’s happening, it’s just a vignette of what’s taking place on a [larger] scale,” said Koven. “Once criminals realised it was traceable we thought they would stop using it, but they didn’t.” Chainalysis and IJM declined to identify the Chinese company in order to protect workers there who were victims of human trafficking. Heintz said former workers involved in pig-butchering scams had provided IJM with information regarding the two crypto wallets used by the company to receive illicit funds. IJM said KK Park, which is located near Myanmar’s border with Thailand, was likely to be home to thousands of trafficked workers, many forced to operate online scams. “It’s a self-contained city,” Heintz said. The ownership of KK Park is unclear and its operators could not be reached for comment. The Karen National Union, an ethnic armed group present in the territory where KK Park is located, and Myanmar’s military government did not respond to requests for comment. The findings on KK Park are likely to increase pressure on Tether, which manages almost $100bn in assets, to crack down on use of the company’s in-house currency for illicit purposes. The UN’s office on drugs and crime warned last month that Tether had emerged as one of the leading payment methods for money launderers and fraudsters in south-east Asia. The company’s token offers high-speed, irreversible transactions that are an attractive proposition to those seeking to scam victims. Tether said it was working with authorities around the world to prevent the illicit use of its token and had frozen $276mn used in pig butchering-related scams. The platform added that it was “proud of its ongoing co-ordination with law enforcement”. According to data provider CCData, Tether has blacklisted almost 1,300 crypto wallets, with numbers surging since November when the company gave access to its platform to US authorities including the FBI. Most of the $100mn-worth of crypto tracked to the company in KK Park was traded on the Tron blockchain, a network that has grown into one of the largest in the industry and which promises cheap transaction fees. “We’re seeing lots of these scams leverage Tether and Tron. The price stability of Tether is an attractive medium, as well as the low transaction fees for Tron,” Koven said. Earlier this week, Tether rival Circle — which issues the second-largest dollar-pegged token on the market — announced it would stop support for its own coin on the Tron blockchain. Over half of Tether tokens in circulation are traded on Tron, according to the platform’s website. “Most of the people don’t have time to waste, they want something that works,” Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s chief executive, said of the Tron network when he appeared on an industry podcast last year. Tron network founder Justin Sun was charged by US regulators in March last year with the alleged unregistered sale of securities and market manipulation, a complaint he said “lacks merit”. While pig butchering scams do not exclusively use crypto for payments, the speed and complexity of transactions on the blockchain make them more challenging for law-enforcement agencies. Koven said the fact that bad actors were using Tether and Tron, which can often be tracked on a public ledger, provided law enforcement with an opportunity to disrupt illegal activity, but this would require global co-ordination. “This case illuminates how we can quantify the scale of the problem, identify other scams in the broader network and discover more victims,” she said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Scott Chipolina","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2024-02-25","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/775a9133-1367-42ed-b1a7-ba10b31229c8","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Ff3af1da9-9126-4cd0-9a03-6dca2e1ad350.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Big tech killed the internet — blockchain can help revive it","INTRO":"Unlike traditional computers, blockchains ensure that any code they run will continue to operate as designed","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The author is general partner at Andreessen Horowitz and author of ‘Read Write Own’ The early internet was a magical place because it was driven by people and their creativity. Builders knew that whatever they made, they owned — a simple promise that established the right incentives for the technology to flourish. But now, the internet is stagnating and it’s harder than ever for new apps to break through. Consider the app stores: almost all the products that consistently appear on leader lists were founded more than a decade ago: Facebook (2004), YouTube (2005), Twitter, now known as X (2006), WhatsApp (2009), Uber (2009), Instagram (2010), Snap (2011) and even Tiktok’s parent ByteDance (2012). Big Tech consolidated its control of the internet around 2010. Just a few gatekeepers now determine who or what will succeed online. Restoring a vibrant internet means breaking this power and putting users back in the driver’s seat. The key to doing that is creating new networks that cannot be easily usurped — ideally, those built on blockchains. Early internet networks, like the web and email, provided a stable foundation upon which people could build businesses and establish a direct connection to their audience. This is no longer the case: networks controlled by the largest tech companies now reach billions, but entrepreneurs and creators have learned just how untrustworthy they can be. These businesses clamp down on application programming interfaces, meddle with mysterious algorithms, and rank content according to opaque and capricious policies. Worse, big tech companies claim most of the revenue that flows through their networks. This stifles creativity, making our online lives poorer. This is the economics of network effects: companies provide perks and easy-to-use tools to draw in users — and then, once they are locked in, switch to extracting value from them. A corporate network that doesn’t make this switch will be outcompeted by one that does. It’s impossible to quantify how much innovation and consumer choice has been lost as a result. Some clamour for regulation — though this risks cementing existing power structures. Others focus on reviving early internet protocols, such as plans for so-called federated networks (in which policies are enforced by a central framework), though these are not widely used. A revitalised internet would require three properties. First, openness: being available to anyone, anywhere. Second, trust: the rules should be transparent, fair and dependable, so builders, creators and users know the network cannot yank the rug out from under them. Finally, all users — not just centralised gatekeepers — should have a say in the networks they contribute to. Networks built on blockchains have all these attributes. While it’s easy to dismiss the technology because of its associations with casino-style gambling behaviour — notably FTX and meme coins — it would be a mistake to ignore its potential. Progress towards greater scalability indicates this could be as transformative as the arrival of the PC. Blockchains are a new class of virtual computer that can, for the first time ever, establish inviolable rules in software. Usually, whoever controls computer hardware can tell the software what to do. But blockchains invert this relationship, preventing those who control a centralised server from arbitrarily changing rules. Unlike traditional computers, blockchains can ensure that any code they run will continue to operate as designed. This could potentially revolutionise the internet’s power dynamics. Networks built on blockchains combine the societal benefits of early internet protocol networks (open access, democratic governance, low take rates and user ownership rights) with the competitive advantages of corporate ones (sustainable sources of funding and advanced features). This provides the path to a freer and more vibrant internet that will reward us all.

Over the past 15 years, however, despite advances in blockchain technologies, this promise has yet to be realised: almost no cryptocurrency has emerged as a reliable store of value, and none has developed into a widespread medium of exchange. Thus, a potentially innovative technology — blockchain — has been, at best, used mainly for risky speculation and, at worst, mostly hijacked by bad actors. What has been the “killer app” of crypto? Insiders now argue it is stablecoins that track the value of major fiat currencies such as the US dollar. Notice the paradox, however: crypto started as a revolt against fiat currencies and the risk of their debasement via inflation. But this “best” application of crypto is a digital version of fiat currencies with worse flaws — the same risk of debasement; a greater risk of a run than bank deposits, as stablecoins do not have access to central banks as lenders of last resort or deposit insurance; a lack of transparency into the assets backing them; worse money laundering problems with stablecoins used to pursue illicit activities; and zero nominal return. Thus, the potential benefits of stablecoins — speed, portability and privacy — are offset by their many risks and limitations. Moreover, stablecoins may become redundant when safer central bank digital currencies are issued by big central banks. But despite my longstanding scepticism over such crypto developments, the need for a more secure store of value backed by stable assets that can also be a means of payment is legitimate in a world in which inflation is likely to be higher even in advanced economies, let alone in unstable emerging market economies where poorer households don’t have access to a stable currency. Even the most traditionally safe asset as a store of value — long duration bonds — is not safe when inflation rises. Last year, for example, the rise in long yields implied that US Treasury bonds lost more than the S\u0026P 500. The real solution is secure currencies — or “flatcoins” — such as the one my company is developing. These differ from most stablecoins that are ostensibly pegged to one asset. Instead flatcoins are backed by a basket of different assets that aim to produce returns in line with a goal such as matching inflation. Flatcoins reflect the value of the underlying basket of assets. They are an innovation that merges the benefits of blockchain and fintech: programmable securities backed by a portfolio of assets that protect against a variety of risks. These include inflation, currency debasement, and potential de-dollarisation, as well as political and geopolitical instability and climate change. Based on historical evidence, the safest assets vis-à-vis the tail risks described above are short-term bonds and inflation-indexed bonds; gold; green metals that are key for the green transition; and sustainable real estate. The latter includes existing real estate assets with lower risk of huge losses that climate change will cause; as well as new real estate that supports the adaptation that environmental shifts will require. Thus, a flatcoin can do a social good — providing investment in assets that ameliorate or seek to offset the effects of climate change — as well as doing well by hedging against other tail risks. Recommended Since these assets have negatively correlated returns, a portfolio of them gives good returns with low volatility in stable times, and much higher returns when tail risks materialise. In essence, a flatcoin is a secure currency that is backed by hard assets and financial instruments with low volatility: it becomes a good store of value but also a global means of payment with a positive return rather than the 0 per cent of fiat. Blockchain technology also allows transactions at unprecedented speed; custody of the underlying assets in a cloud-based account to make holdings transparent and redeemable; the use of smart contracts with anti-money laundering features to prevent illicit financing; and financial inclusion, as flatcoins will be available in unstable monetary systems. We need to reform the current monetary and currency system to protect existing national currencies while hedging against tail risks and providing financial inclusion. Flatcoins are the way forward.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nouriel Roubini","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-12-14","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/2daf0c89-a2b5-4828-bb76-18b1e5aa99ef","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Ff28c9a4c-f394-4bd6-a861-8c6e1e1cf0ec.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Crypto ETN providers head for UK but urge rethink on retail ban","INTRO":"The FCA has said it will allow listing requests but only give access to ‘professional investors’","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A rash of cryptocurrency exchange traded products are likely to be listed in London after regulators softened their hardline opposition to allowing domestic access to funds with cryptocurrency exposure. However, industry figures have criticised the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority for limiting their availability to “professional investors” and continuing with its ban on retail investors buying crypto ETPs. The FCA said last week it would “not object” to a request from bourses such as the London Stock Exchange and Cboe UK to list unleveraged crypto-backed exchange traded notes linked to bitcoin or ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies. But it added that the vehicles should only be available to institutions such as investment firms, credit institutions, pensions funds and insurance companies. Its stance is in contrast to the growing number of other countries that have opened the door to individual investors. Nonetheless, the end of the FCA’s blanket ban on crypto ETPs brings it a fraction more in line with continental Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada and the US, which already boast crypto ETPs. US-domiciled “spot” bitcoin exchange traded funds have garnered $31bn between them since their rollout in January, helping send the price of the digital token spiralling to an all-time high of $73,000 before losing some ground. Despite the UK’s cautious approach, a number of pre-existing crypto players are likely to come on board. “The LSE is such an important market for us we definitely will list products when possible and preparation is under way. We hope the retail ban will be lifted soon after,” said Bradley Duke, chief strategist of ETC Group, which runs Europe’s largest crypto fund, the $1.6bn ETC Group Physical Bitcoin. Townsend Lansing, head of product at CoinShares, which runs the next four largest, said: “We look forward to engaging with the LSE about the new listing opportunities and to better understand their requirements and how our products might fit.” WisdomTree, which has more than $800mn across its range of eight European crypto ETPs, said the LSE would “provide a more convenient access point for UK-based professional investors seeking exposure to crypto ETPs than overseas exchanges”. “We are currently engaging with the FCA and LSE to explore the opportunity more thoroughly,” it added. Menno Martens, crypto product manager at VanEck, said the FCA’s announcement was a “very positive development” and that it was “looking into potentially listing our crypto ETNs in the UK”. The UK’s stance is unlikely, though, to attract every issuer active in the European crypto ETP market — which boasts 100 products with combined assets of $14.2bn, according to ETFbook data. One house told the FT: “Obviously, it’s not available to UK [retail] investors currently. Should the regulation change and there is client demand, we would consider something for clients in the UK.” Mandy Chiu, head of financial product development at 21Shares, another major player, said although the FCA’s decision was “encouraging” it would continue to “monitor” the situation and did not have plans for any UK-listed products at present. Recommended The UK regulator said last week it “continued to believe that crypto ETNs and crypto derivatives are ill-suited for retail consumers due to the harm they pose”. Given that crypto assets are “high risk and largely unregulated, those who invest should be prepared to lose all their money”, it added. Yet UK retail investors are free to buy cryptocurrencies directly on exchanges, which come with the additional need for digital wallets and private keys, as well as the risk of theft. “I find it ridiculous,” said Pawel Janus, head of analytics at ETFbook. “Retail investors can buy crypto on exchange. You have zillions of different platforms and they are all approved. “On the other hand regulators have a problem with giving a green light to the ETP, which generally is a better structure. You know it’s fairly priced otherwise there would be an arbitrage.” CoinShares’ Lansing said it was “disappointing to see the FCA remain out of step in terms of retail investors, who, in the rest of Europe and the United States can use regulated listed products to access digital assets but who, if UK resident, are required to use uncollateralised and unregistered exchanges to invest in this asset class”. Hector McNeil, co-founder and co-chief executive of London-based HANetf, which lists six ETC Group crypto vehicles on its ETF white-label platform, said the FCA’s announcement was “a good step forward. It means the UK is catching up with other markets in Europe now.” However, McNeil said that as the door was only being opened to professionals, “the bar is still too high”. He argued that access should be along the lines of the UK’s regime for complex instruments such as leveraged ETFs, whereby brokers act as gatekeepers, only allowing through “retail clients who understand and can afford the risks of the asset class”. Tim Bevan, chief executive of ETC Group, referenced Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s push to make the UK a hub for digital assets. “If UK regulations permitted retail investors to invest in crypto ETPs via regulated markets this would bring the UK in line with much of Europe and allow those retail investors to take advantage of the built-in security that established exchanges provide,” he said. “It would also help advance the claim of the UK to be a global leader in fintech.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Steve Johnson","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2024-03-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/8aa731a0-5456-4121-a2f7-828ae90ed199","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F61243d29-a954-4d68-803b-bcaaf59c3e22.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"An Anglo-Italian company says it has cracked bitcoin. People have questions","INTRO":"Trade secrets and nonce sense","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Quantum Blockchain Technologies has a whizzy name and a complicated history. Back in 2000, it was an internet incubator called Brainspark. About half its investments had failed within a year of its Aim float. An Italian entrepreneur, Francesco Gardin, then picked up the pieces via his listed software company. By 2010, Brainspark’s main asset was a plot of land an hour from Milan that Gardin hoped to turn into a theme park. Next came a water park an hour from Turin, some Milanese sushi restaurants and an Italian hotel chain that collapsed, by which time Brainspark was called Clear Leisure. Luke Johnson chaired Clear Leisure for a year, resigning in October 2013 after financial irregularities at its African hotels subsidiary came to light. “Unfortunately the figures were nonsense and the business was infested with litigation and fraud,” Johnson wrote at the time. Blockchain was added to the business plan in 2018, then in 2021 to the corporate name. Quantum Blockchain Technologies, still run by Gardin, has since wrapped its collection of distressed legacy investments and legal claims in crypto jargon. In essence, Quantum Blockchain Technologies says it has discovered more efficient ways to mine bitcoin. The proof-of-work lottery that rewards miners for maintaining the blockchain has repeating patterns that make it possible to eliminate redundant computations, it says. We asked leading academics in the field of crypto for their thoughts on this proposition. Many were sceptical. Making any sense of the Quantum Blockchain’s claims requires a foundational knowledge of crypto, so what follows might be a test of patience. If you’ve done the 11 hours of study needed to become a Certified Cryptocurrency Expert™, or if are happy to suffice with the “solved Sudokus” analogy, please skip forwards until we stop talking about balloons and teacups. Bitcoin’s blockchain updates its ledger of transactions by creating a new block about every 10 minutes. Miners compete by making candidate blocks. Blocks always contain the digital fingerprint of the previous block, lots of transaction data, and an address to deliver the reward. The prize for having your candidate added to the blockchain is some newly-minted bitcoins plus any fees attached to the transactions being verified in the block. Mining means generating a numeric fingerprint for a candidate block, known as a hash. If the hash happens to be a number that’s the same or lower than the target number set by the bitcoin protocol, that miner’s candidate block becomes the official one and the process starts over again. An algorithm known as SHA-256 creates the hash. It takes all the data in the block, stirs it around in a random yet repeatable way and spits out a number. This signature number can be as high as a quattuorvigintillion, approximately. The same data will always generate exactly the same hash, but source data can’t be extracted from the hash. Changing a single bit in the block will change its signature in ways that are effectively impossible to predict. To maximise this unpredictability, there’s a section of the block that’s just for doodling. The number that goes here is called the nonce, which is an old English word meaning single-use. It’s included because transaction data in the block will be very similar between miners, if not identical, but the nonce is literally any number. A proof-of-work lottery involves randomly generating new signatures by keeping the candidate block the same and changing the nonce, usually by some quick and easy method such as adding 1. This tiny change will completely rewrite the hash specific to that block, and where this rewrite will land among the approximately quattuorvigintillion permutations can’t be predicted. The only way to find out is to do the work. Bitcoin’s protocol adjusts its target number to regulate how often new blocks are added. This number, known as the target difficulty, is a fixed length and starts with a lot of zeros. If the target difficulty has 10 leading zeros and a hash for a candidate block just happens to have a signature with 11 leading zeros, that block becomes the official one and its miner wins the prize. Hash generation is unpredictable enough for this process to be considered a chance lottery. OK, that’s still a lot of jargon, but maybe we can try another analogy? Imagine a water balloon hitting a target that’s spinning rapidly at a constant rate, suspended above a teacup. Or, if you’d prefer, look at the post illustration. Now imagine this happening in perfect laboratory conditions, meaning an identical throw of an identical balloon will result in an identical explosion. Now imagine a game where the challenge is to get as little water as possible in the teacup. Contestants have nearly-but-not-quite-identical balloons and can only change the angle of their throw. Realistically, contestants have absolutely no way of predicting how much water will end up in the teacup. Some might claim to have strategies but the only good option is to keep throwing slightly different balloons at slightly different angles until the right amount of water lands in the teacup. Once that happens the winner is declared and the game starts again, except this time everyone’s balloons are filled with gravy. By knowing the exact balloon structure and the exact angle, a person can reproduce the winning throw. But importantly, it’s not possible to work out anything useful from the amount of liquid that lands in the teacup. Each result is random yet replicable. There’s no secret formula. Knowing how the water-throwing round went offers contestants no advantage whatsoever in the gravy-throwing round. In this analogy, the balloon is a miner’s candidate blockchain block. The spinning target is the hashing algorithm. The teacup represents the difficulty level, where the maximum waterline is the target difficulty. The angle of throw is the nonce. Congratulations, you’re now an Alphaville Certified Crypto Expert™. Lots of people have tried lots of ways to optimise crypto mining. One of the most important is AsicBoost, which according to its inventors Timo Hanke and Sergio Lerner could lower bitcoin’s mining costs by about 20 per cent. The basic idea of AsicBoost is to whittle down the range of potential guesses by splitting the hash calculation in two and reusing some data. It’s all hugely complicated but, in target-teacup terms, can be thought of a little like partially freezing some of the balloon. Speculation that miners including Bitmain of China were covertly using this method or something similar caused an almighty rift in the crypto community and, in 2017, bitcoin changed how it recorded transactions in a way that made AsicBoost much less useful. Quantum Blockchain says it has found several ways to reinvent AsicBoost and is seeking two UK patents. The first is for Asic Ultraboost, which it describes as using a similar two-part calculation method to its predecessor. The second is for ASIC EnhancedBoost, which involves “partial pre-computing of future blocks”. In addition, Quantum Blockchain says it has developed three separate mechanisms for optimising mining. Method A exploits a claimed weakness in block generation. Method B uses “a composition of ML and mathematical methods” to decide which blocks are most likely to win. Method C, announced earlier this month, does the same but with “predictive AI”. All of them, in one way or another, involve taking some of the random chance out of nonce selection. Quantum Blockchain has yet to demonstrate its innovations publicly and publishes only outline information on how they might work. For Methods A and B the company provides short, typo-strewn YouTube videos that simulate how they might outperform conventional mining, followed by a disclaimer warning that all product images and descriptions are for illustrative purposes only: Quantum Blockchain told FTAV it has not published any papers on technology or methodology “in order to protect their research”. Its patent applications are “as far as they have dared to go with making the developments public,” said a spokesman. That policy leaves a lot of questions unanswered. “Without further details, it is hard to say anything really useful about this,” Edgar Weippl, professor of security and privacy at the University of Vienna and a team leader at SBA Research, told FTAV: In general terms, I would think it’s possible to not calculate the entire hash to see if it starts with the required numbers of 0 for bitcoin but to break early and thus save time/energy. I would imagine that this can be done on a hardware level [ . . . ]. However, this would then only apply to bitcoin and very similar cryptos. and only [until] they decide to change the hash algorithm. A big challenge for Quantum Blockchain is that its claims go against the academic orthodoxy that SHA-256 and related algorithms are unbreakable using currently available computing power. Trust in the hash makes them ubiquitous tools for guaranteeing online security. If bitcoin’s implementation of SHA-256 has been churning out hashes in predictable patterns it could have far-reaching implications that would touch nearly every aspect of our digital lives. “Generally, the security of hash functions is well-studied in the cryptography community,” said Zhuo Cai, of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, who has published several papers on randomness in decentralised networks. “The reason that we are still using hash functions like SHA-256 is that no one has found a significant attack even though many smart people have tried a lot in the last 20 years.” Quantum Blockchain’s announcement that it can find these patterns with predictive AI also raised some doubts. The gist of the company’s claim is that AI can sense before the full hash is generated whether a calculation will fall within the likely range of success. Terminating losers early improved mining efficiency by around 30 per cent, it says. “I don’t think their approach is feasible,” Zhuo Cai told FTAV. Machine learning is good at solving structural problems such as face recognition, and for taking a sequence and approximating what comes next, whereas data produced by hash functions is unstructured and discontinuous by design, he said: It is ridiculous that they claim that they can predict [the hash] for future blocks. If this is possible, then it infers that machine learning can predict all transactions in the next hour in the future. Note that even if the prediction is different than the reality by very little bit, the hash function outputs are vastly different. Who’s behind the technology? Quantum Blockchain says on its website that its R\u0026D team “is composed of a number of sector experts selected across the UK and Italy, and includes highly skilled professionals, PhD students and university professors, with expertise in Quantum Computing, Machine Learning, Cryptography and Algorithms Optimisation Theory.” The company’s 2022 annual report registers just four employees, up by one on the previous year, which includes its three directors. The 2023 edition is due next quarter. “Team members [have] asked to remain confidential as one team member has been approached by someone from the industry,” Quantum Blockchain told us. “All annoyingly hush hush until they commercialise the product. So, everything publicly available is on RNS or the website.” On LinkedIn there are two profiles giving Quantum Blockchain as their current employer: chief research officer Rita Pizzi, a hire it announced in November 2022, and “data scientist freelance” Isacco Valsecchi, both of Lombardy in Italy. Going by their CVs, Valsecchi graduated in 2021 with a bachelors degree in musical informatics from the University of Milan’s computer science department, where Pizzi was a senior research fellow between 2002 and 2022. Describing his “work experience” at Quantum Blockchain, Valsecchi says he has “reverse-engineered bitcoin mining protocols” and “regularly communicated complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders”. None of these peculiarities are out of character for Quantum Blockchain, which even by the wild-west standards of London’s junior market has been an odd investment. Its annual revenue has been zero or negligible in 21 of the 23 years since its foundation. Its aggregate net loss over the whole period, with 2023 figures not yet available, has exceeded £100mn: You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser. Quantum Blockchain’s main backer for at least a decade has been Eufingest, a Swiss-based company that has provided several loans and to our knowledge has never declared another investment. Since announcing its pivot to crypto in 2018 the company has raised nearly £5mn with share placings. It also placed shares in 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2012, 2010 and 2009. More than 70 per cent of Quantum Blockchain stock sits in retail broker nominee accounts. One conclusion to take from the AsicBoost saga is that, if any party finds a better way to mine crypto, the most profitable strategy is to mine lots of crypto. Publicising the method will only cause a fight about what the community considers fair and might prompt a redesign of the protocol. That could help explain why an Aim-quoted company with a £14mn market cap has chosen to tease innovations that — if they work! — would upend the $1.2tn market for bitcoin. It doesn\u0027t help explain why a company with a money-printing machine would be selling stock rather than printing money. We’ve tried to understand the reasons. But apparently, we’re not allowed to know.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Bryce Elder","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2024-03-21","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/c3a40719-b096-4767-8bd8-2a7da27c3a94","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7f1786c6-aab2-4c62-b3c6-b21062d8b5d5.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Tokenised securities: blockchain offers more than lower cost and faster speed","INTRO":"Tokenisation would blur the line that separates private and public assets","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The cryptocurrency boom ended in frauds and fines. The revolution in digital assets is grinding on nonetheless. Banks and institutional money managers have long been intrigued by the scope for efficiency gains from using the technology underlying crypto — the shared immutable digital ledger, or blockchain. Some are increasingly convinced about its disruptive potential. The big prize for financiers is the tokenisation of financial securities and funds. At the core of the idea is standardisation. Time and money can be saved by stripping out financial intermediaries who all work on different versions of the same data in their own silos. Transactions between them must all be checked and verified. Tokenised volumes today are small. Clear, consistent regulation will be needed to achieve scale, according to Lamine Brahimi of digital asset group Taurus. It also depends on the involvement of “mega” custodians to safeguard holdings and the existence of robust tokenised money or deposits. Institutions are starting to take advantage of the benefits that tokenisation offers. Franklin Templeton launched the first tokenised money market fund using the Stellar blockchain in 2021*. Others are following. Abrdn launched a tokenised sterling fund in the summer. Shares in investment funds are also switching on to blockchains. Those could just be the low-hanging fruit of blockchain technology. Tokenisation could also make a big difference to markets such as private debt and structured finance, according to Ralf Kubli, board member of the Casper Association in Switzerland. Information on cash flows and payment obligations could be coded to public tokens, potentially increasing liquidity and opening up access to many more investors. In this way, tokenisation would blur the line that separates private and public assets. That means it is potentially more than an efficiency tool for traditional asset managers.

At the height of the excitement around cryptocurrencies, their underlying blockchain technology was also heralded as a revolutionary way to improve the mundane but crucial plumbing underpinning global capital markets. Proponents of blockchain promote it as being a faster, cheaper and more efficient method of trading and settling deals, and are keen for mainstream financial institutions to embrace a technology that is the backbone of the crypto-trading industry. But, as the enthusiasm for blockchain subsided, and attention has turned to artificial intelligence developments, few traditional companies are using blockchain for day-to-day processes. British bank HSBC and US lender Wells Fargo are bucking that trend, having partnered in 2021 to use blockchain to settle foreign exchange transactions between them. Vince Hindman, global head of rates and FX solutions at Wells, says the company is “leveraging the technology in a hybrid way”. Recommended The two banks use blockchain to settle transactions of US dollars, sterling, euros and China’s offshore yuan between them on a private ledger, which the lenders say increases efficiency and reduces costs. They use a shared private ledger — essentially a shared database — to track and manage the currency trades. This has helped cut risks and ease any previous worries around the banks potentially having different information about the same trade. “We’re using distributed ledger technology to orchestrate the matching, netting and settlement of foreign exchange transactions but still using historic payment rails, fiat currency from traditional bank accounts,” says Hindman. “We can essentially see the same facts concurrently,” he explains. “Historically, in banking, you had your own system of record: your own version of the transactions you’ve executed. In this case, we’re looking real time at the same ledger, so there’s less room for differences.” Settling trades in this way is especially useful in the case of China’s currency since CLS — the world’s largest foreign currency settlement system, which is widely used by investment banks and central banks around the world — does not settle the renminbi. “A shared ledger can help reduce settlement risk . . . for a currency where there isn’t really a mechanism for us to do that today,” Hindman notes. Beyond settling transactions with Wells, HSBC sees more promise for blockchain technology and has been using it to settle foreign exchange transfers internally, too. Mark Williamson, global head of foreign exchange and commodities partnerships and propositions at HSBC, says distributed ledger technology has been used since early 2018 “for the trades between 18 different balance sheets that we have in HSBC and 13 different currencies”. He calculates that the bank has, so far, settled $6.7tn in trades in this way. For HSBC and Wells, using blockchain has made their currency settlement easier, faster and cheaper. “There have been savings,” says Williamson. “It is cheaper sending it through this infrastructure than it is through traditional infrastructure.” Hindman adds that the system “is reducing operational cost and friction”. A survey by consultancy Accenture found that blockchain could cut infrastructure costs for eight of the world’s 10 biggest investment banks by up to $12bn a year. Yiannis Giokas, senior director of product innovation at Moody’s Analytics, says many companies are currently exploring using blockchain. “In foreign exchange, we have seen a lot of interest in cross-border money transfer and remittance to happen over blockchain,” he says, adding that “a lot of the larger institutions . . . are testing the waters because they want to be ready”. But while interest in blockchain remains high, the real, scalable uses are fewer since “the maturity of the implementation is not yet there”. “We spent a lot of time on education and awareness,” says Williamson. “The only way that you can truly understand this technology is by using it.” HSBC and Wells’ commitment to using blockchain comes despite a series of scandals engulfing the wider digital assets industry and several significant blockchain programmes being abandoned. In November 2022, the Australian stock exchange dropped its years-long plan to upgrade the clearing and settlement of shares on to a blockchain-based platform, citing significant technology and governance issues. That same month, AP Møller-Maersk, one of the world’s biggest container shipping companies, abandoned its blockchain-enabled supply chain project with tech group IBM, saying it was not commercially viable. These failures underscore that there is a long road ahead for blockchain projects to go from buzzword to mainstream adoption.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nikou Asgari","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-11-02","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/9399d969-1896-46dc-a047-30a6278dfbf9","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7ef6d805-2b51-4e61-99a8-c25e1b98924e.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin’s halving makes its future pay-to-play","INTRO":"As mining rewards fall, transaction fees must rise","DETAILED_CONTENT":"How much does it cost to secure bitcoin and who should pay for it? Because that’s what this week’s much-discussed ‘halving’ event this week for the biggest cryptocurrency is really about. For those fortunate enough to be unaware, at some point probably on Friday, the total of bitcoins that miners receive for securing the network and validating new transactions will be halved, from a share of 900 a day to just 450. This happens every four years and it’s an important foundational principle for bitcoin. Its pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto envisaged bitcoin in part as a hedge against inflation and decreed there would be just 21mn coins in existence. To ensure its scarcity, Nakamoto also decided that the amount of coins distributed by the bitcoin protocol would halve every four years. Why 21mn and why every four years is a mystery. No matter — the fourth halving is upon us. Just about everyone in cryptoland seems to agree that this ultimately is A Good Thing for Bitcoin’s price in the long run because it increases the coin’s scarcity (even though 19mn of the 21mn available have already been mined and availability of coins has never been a problem). Most bitcoin enthusiasts look back at patterns of the previous halvings, in 2012, 2016 and 2020, and it’s true that the price has gone up afterwards over time. However, it’s Not A Good Thing for the crypto miners because their rewards go down. As Andrew O’Neill, managing director of S\u0026P Global’s Digital Assets Research Lab noted yesterday: Some operations will become non-profitable and will shut down as result, particularly those with higher energy costs. The most profitable BTC miners with lower energy costs will remain. Between now and the next halving in 2028, the issues of reward and payment could become more of a serious problem for the bitcoin network too. Satoshi’s bitcoin white paper offered an answer to something that had bedevilled internet cryptographic pioneers like David Chaum for years — in a digital world where things can be reprinted infinitely, how do you know that you’re only spending cash once? There are many things to say about Satoshi’s 2008 white paper (as shown by 14 years and counting of FTAV coverage) but one is that it quite elegantly offers a real working solution to that problem. Central to it is the proof-of-work system, which depends on crypto miners to verify blocks of deals. In a network designed to bypass a traditional centralised institution like a bank or a stock exchange, the miners are the ones supplying the trust that you’re not being defrauded. Miners being paid bitcoin is the main payoff for that effort. Up to now they have collectively taken on the cost of securing the bitcoin network. But it’s also the part of the bitcoin system that has real-world bills to pay. Processing power takes up energy and space. Already many miners are only just recovering from an era of rapid overexpansion and leverage. But it’s getting more expensive, especially as AI is now competing for resources. Already some miners have hit on the wheeze of being paid by local governments NOT to mine cryptocurrencies. The US is taking a closer look at exactly how much energy bitcoin mining in local areas in the US suck up, and trying to assess how it stacks up against directing to other uses, such as keeping people’s homes warm. Halving the reward is going to make things harder for miners to do what they do. If they aren’t paid enough and drop out, that becomes a problem. There are issues around security of the network and centralisation of mining (such as the so-called 51 per cent attack) but the bottom line is no miners, no bitcoin. So the debate is likely to turn to ways miners can keep going in sufficient numbers to both secure the network and decentralise it. S\u0026P’s O’Neill expects miners will look at energy efficiency, especially the economics of renewable energy projects. But that might not be enough. In its annual report at the end of February, Marathon Digital, one of the US’s largest miners and valued by the market as a likely survivor, laid out the two options: This transition could be accomplished either by miners independently electing to record in the blocks they solve only those transactions that include payment of a transaction fee or by the digital asset network adopting software upgrades that require the payment of a minimum transaction fee for all transactions. Neither will be appealing. Up to now miners haven’t really relied on transaction fees, paid by users every time they do a deal, to cover the computational cost. Fees are optional right now and are really just a way to ensure your deal is checked first, a bit like priority boarding on an airline. On the other hand, not changing bitcoin’s software code is something of an article of faith for bitcoin followers, so at first the system may informally try to work out what the market will bear in fees. How much could be the next friction point. As another miner, Riot Platforms, pointed out in its annual report: High Bitcoin transaction fees may slow the adoption of Bitcoin as a means of payment, which may decrease demand for Bitcoin and future prices of Bitcoin may suffer as a result. Widespread adoption of bitcoin as a means of payment couldn’t really get much slower but certainly, adding friction to a system only makes it less efficient. The shift towards transaction fees has arguably already begun. Last year the crypto market saw the emergence of fungible tokens, which work as a way to bypass the limitations of the bitcoin protocol but at least generate some transaction fees. (No, of course there’s no broader use case for them yet.) Last year Marathon earned 7.7 per cent of its full-year net income from transaction fees, up from 1.3 per cent in 2022. It’s almost inevitable that ratio will rise substantially in the coming years. It’s this, and not the endless bullish predictions, that is the biggest consequence of this week’s halving.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2024-04-16","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/a7e60d42-58d4-4931-923a-aea2170a1bc5","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fbb6145fe-6c37-49dc-8756-1f52691a4525.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Buying frenzy puts some Grayscale crypto funds at ‘absurd’ premiums","INTRO":"Grayscale Filecoin Trust hit high of more than 10 times underlying value of its assets in November","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools Some cryptocurrency funds run by the world’s largest crypto manager are trading at as much as eight times their underlying value amid an unprecedented buying frenzy. The sharp price gains are the latest sign of the passing of the “crypto winter”. The price of bitcoin has jumped to a 20-month high of $42,000 amid expectation of the imminent launch of US exchange traded funds directly tracking the world’s largest digital token. The mania has spread to a host of private trusts operated by Grayscale. The company’s Filecoin Trust is trading at $34.25, 721 per cent above its net asset value of $4.17, having hit a premium of more than 1,000 per cent in November. Its trust tracking solana, the third-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin and ether, is at a premium of 302 per cent, while those investing in chainlink, livepeer, lumens and Decentraland’s mana token are priced at between twice and four times their NAV. “It’s absurd. I feel the investor doesn’t really understand what they are getting into,” said Bradley Duke, chief strategist of ETC Group, which runs more than $1bn in European-listed crypto exchange traded products. “I wouldn’t know what [investors] could be thinking buying at these prices,” said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research, North America, at Morningstar. “A lack of understanding can easily be part of it.” The funds can only be traded via OTC Markets Group, formerly known as the “pink sheets” market, where over-the-counter secondary trading in pre-existing shares takes place. Shares cannot be redeemed, while new shares can only be created if Grayscale carries out a private placement exercise, meaning there is no arbitrage mechanism to bring prices back in line with the underlying holdings. However, most of the premiums only emerged, or widened sharply, in November, coinciding with a rally in the price of many cryptocurrencies. “There is a very strong appetite for crypto products at the moment as the crypto winter has melted. Investors are allocating to crypto in larger allocations and also diversifying from bitcoin and ethereum,” said Michael Sonnenshein, chief executive of Grayscale. He believed some investors may be willing to pay well over the odds for Grayscale’s trusts in order to access cryptocurrencies “through a product wrapper that is known to them, is familiar and gives them added protections that they are used to seeing when they invest in any other asset”. The alternative is to trade via an unregulated crypto exchange. For many of these tokens, Grayscale’s funds are the only regulated products available to US retail investors. “Because there are so few regulated products out there, the investors who don’t want to, or can’t, invest directly in these assets have little choice,” said Duke. “As a result, these products end up trading at these huge premiums. It’s a function of the structure of the products.” “I guess it’s down to accessibility,” said Armour, although he added that cryptocurrencies “have such high volatility it might be [that investors] don’t even care” at what price they are buying. Another contributory factor may be limited liquidity, given the small size of some of the trusts. The Filecoin Trust has assets of just $464,000 and the solana vehicle, the largest currently trading at a significant premium, at $10.8mn. “These are fairly illiquid products and, as solana spot has seen, these illiquid products are seen as proxies by those who can’t buy solana directly in their funds or prefer not to,” said Gautam Chhugani, senior analyst, global digital assets at AB Bernstein. Duke argued that the large departures from net asset value showed the benefit of the European model. According to this, in contrast, scores of exchange traded products that invest directly in a rich array of cryptocurrencies — including those operated by ETC Group — “track the underlying almost perfectly”. They are analogous to ETFs in the US but need to call themselves ETPs because they fail to meet European Ucits regulations on portfolio diversification. The Securities and Exchange Commission has so far not permitted any such “spot” cryptocurrency ETFs in the US. Instead it only allows ETFs that invest in the futures market. Expectation is widespread that BlackRock and rival operators will be given the green light early next year. “Without regulated products these kinds of [price] anomalies are likely to exist,” Duke said. “I think we are very lucky in Europe . . . the ETP wrapper is far more efficient with the ETPs trading at or very close to NAV.” In contrast, the US private trust structure “is problematic. And Grayscale recognise it’s problematic,” he added. Visit the ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools helping you to understand everything from performance to ESG ratings Grayscale has fought a long battle with the SEC to allow it to convert its flagship Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), at $24.1bn the world’s largest bitcoin fund, into an ETF. In August, a federal appeals court in Washington DC ruled that the SEC was wrong to reject Grayscale’s application to convert GBTC. Although this trust still trades at a discount to NAV, this discount has narrowed to a 28-month low of 8.7 per cent — from a nadir of almost 50 per cent in December 2022 — in anticipation of the likelihood of Grayscale being given the go-ahead to convert it into an ETF. The company has also filed with the SEC to transform its $6.2bn Ethereum Trust (ETHE), again the largest such vehicle in the world, into an ETF. This trades at a discount of 14.6 per cent, a far cry from the near-60 per cent level seen at the turn of the year. Sonnenshein said that, in the fullness of time, he would like to see the rest of Grayscale’s 17-strong product suite follow suit. “The goal would be to uplift all these products to ETFs,” he said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Steve Johnson","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-12-05","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/fbc95a19-4d7d-44b6-b52d-1d5209b1e22e","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F49360210-4fc1-4c1b-a6ab-968c0f3daf84.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"An almost convincing Delaware-crypto-filing scam","INTRO":"No, BlackRock is not creating a iShares XRP fund","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ah, Delaware . . . along with decent beaches and the fading glamour of the DuPont dynasty, the state is known for being a cheap and cheerful venue for registering companies in relative privacy. It isn’t so private that someone can register a company under false pretences without getting referred to federal prosecutors, however. A spokesperson for the Delaware Department of State said Tuesday that it has referred what appears to be a faked iShares filing to the state’s Department of Justice. The fake filing in question looks like it’s related to — what else? — a crypto scam. This all started late Monday afternoon when the following listing, which appeared to be from BlackRock Advisors, started making the rounds on social media: It was for a company called the iShares XRP Trust. Now, it was easy enough to log on to Delaware’s corporate registry and confirm that this filing did really exist, and that BlackRock Advisors’ Daniel Schwieger was listed as the registered agent. But a BlackRock representative told Alphaville (along with others) that the company had not filed for an iShares XRP Trust. XRP, for those lucky readers who don’t know, is a token issued by Ripple Labs. In a strange decision earlier this year, a US District Judge ruled that XRP wasn’t an illegal unregistered security in its secondary-market trading, even though it was when it was issued, somehow. The judge then decided last month that the SEC can’t appeal that decision. One might think that crypto-land would simply take these wins and see how things shook out with XRP. Think again! In the simplest version of possible events here, somebody instead took matters into their own hands, and made a fake filing in Delaware to make it look like BlackRock was going to launch an investment vehicle for XRP. That would be a very strong institutional stamp of approval. XRP’s price spiked in response. The jump lasted less than an hour, but the token gained as much as 12.4 per cent: Now, crypto scams are a dime a dozen. But this one is interesting because it highlights how easy it is to register a company in Delaware. There are rules that require registered agents to vet the identities of clients who want to form a Delaware company, but it isn’t clear what controls there are if someone wants to fake having a registered agent. (We asked Delaware’s representative, but their only comment was about the DoJ referral.) Delaware online document-uploading service that requires a name for the person submitting the request, but doesn’t seem to need much more information besides that, the name of the company and the name and address of the registered agent. It also processes documents in an hour for a $1000 fee. Here’s the form for a trust: The iShares XRP filing is no longer accessible on the site, but again, Alphaville looked it up quite easily on Monday. (And there’s still a reference number listed if you search for the company: 2619091.) The question now is how easy it will be to figure out who did it, assuming it was really a scam and not some other type of botched filing. Delaware may be rather secretive, but it is still in the United States, where digital privacy is mostly a myth. A scammer could get away with it, of course. But it’s also possible that they’ve just committed a dumb crime for a 12-per-cent pump and now have the Justice Department on their case.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Alexandra Scaggs","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-11-14","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/d0447dcd-9aa5-4f71-9919-5061e77772d5","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F42f5b291-ee2b-4c2f-9292-c6822015f095.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How is blockchain changing financial services?","INTRO":"The technology has yet to make significant inroads into the traditional banking sector","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When Blythe Masters, a former top JPMorgan Chase executive and one of the most prominent financiers on Wall Street, was appointed chief executive of blockchain company Digital Asset Holdings in 2015, many saw it as a sign that the technology — for building secure transaction networks — would upend financial services. At the time, Masters told Bloomberg News: “You should be taking this technology as seriously as you should have been taking the development of the internet in the early 1990s.” Eight years later, blockchain start-ups, such as Digital Assets, have yet to make much of an inroad into the world of finance beyond the realm of cryptocurrencies, which is where the technology started. Masters left Digital Assets three years after she joined. In May, she returned to Wall Street as part of the ill-fated effort to save Swiss bank Credit Suisse. Following crypto’s spectacular blow-ups last year, the question of how seriously the financial services industry should take blockchain seems even more up in the air than it was eight years ago. Late last year, in the wake of the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, several high-profile blockchain projects, including one by the Australian stock exchange, were put on hold. Recommended “A lot of the energy was being put around the crypto side of it,” says Robert Ruark, who leads the US fintech practice of Big Four accounting firm KPMG. “When the crash happened, all of those investments pulled back.” Finance experts, though, say the promise of blockchain technology and the potential for it to change Wall Street and beyond remains. A major reason for that has to do with what a blockchain is. Blockchains, often described as distributed ledgers, are in essence sophisticated but open spreadsheets. Imagine a Google sheet where the editor has given access to anyone in the world. And there is not one blockchain, but each digital asset, or currency or token, has its own blockchain. The one wrinkle — and this is the innovation within blockchain technology and where the “crypto” in cryptocurrency comes from — is that the code that makes the spreadsheet work is encrypted. So, while anyone can look at a blockchain spreadsheet, in order to edit it (typically to enter a transaction) you need to have the exact code (sometimes called a key) and you must be entering a change that makes sense in the context of the rest of the spreadsheet. You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser. So while anyone can view blockchains, they are almost impossible to hack. Not that you don’t hear about blockchain or crypto hacks — there are lots of them. But most hacks involve gaining access to key codes, which are stored off the blockchain. The fact that blockchains make markets more transparent is a significant benefit for the technology, says David Treat, a senior managing director at consultancy Accenture who specialises in technology and capital markets. “Everyone gets the exact same information at the exact same time.” He says that matches the direction in which financial markets are going — namely, towards “greater access to information in an auditable way”. So, what is holding up the move to blockchain? In large part, it is about regulation, says Treat. Regulators must ensure markets are fair, so they have to approve changes. That slows down how quickly markets can migrate to new infrastructures — especially in securities, such as bonds or commodities or stocks, where individual investors have already invested a large amount of money. Another hurdle, industry specialists say, has to do with liquidity. The markets with the most activity tend to have the best prices and lowest transaction costs, even if technology and market structure is better elsewhere. That could be why blockchains have taken off in crypto markets, which were non-existent before the technology, but not, say, in the bond market, where trillions of dollars already trade through established networks. Observers say the most immediate areas for growth in the use of blockchain are in functions that are adjacent to trading and cash markets, such as trade settlement and processing. Connecting blockchain-recorded transactions to those recorded off a blockchain has been the hold-up, here. But several companies, the most prominent of which is Web3 services platform Chainlink, have been developing software that connects blockchains with external data. Earlier this year, Swift, the global financial messaging platform jointly owned by the largest banks around the world, announced a partnership with Chainlink. In August, Swift and Chainlink successfully tested a system that can transfer value from one blockchain to another, allowing the open, but siloed, networks to communicate with one another. In another sign of how blockchain is being more widely adopted in traditional banking, both Citigroup and JPMorgan have announced blockchain projects in recent weeks. Citi is testing a blockchain project that will allow its institutional and corporate customers to turn cash into digital tokens, making it easier to move money at times when traditional financial markets are closed. For now though, Citi’s tokens can only be transferred internally, but the bank is working with regulators and others in the financial industry to create architecture that will allow the tokens to be moved between banks and other institutions. In early October, JPMorgan said it was starting to process transactions between customers using a settlement network built with blockchain technology. “When I stand back and look at the blockchain projects in traditional financial markets, I think the progress has been pretty good,” says Accenture’s Treat. “The vision for simplified blockchain-enabled networks are there — it just takes time.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Stephen Gandel","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-10-23","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/3717fe36-1536-43ef-ace4-b63e5efe778e","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F4b626995-7266-4977-9088-96ff4aae9dbd.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"What are digital bonds and how are they issued?","INTRO":"The European Investment Bank is one of the institutions leading the way with four such offerings so far","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Banks are turning to blockchain technology to experiment with issuing ‘digital’ bonds — a move that, proponents say, could revolutionise the slow and costly process of issuing debt. At its simplest, blockchain is a digital ledger that stores, verifies and records transactions. The technology came to prominence for underpinning bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency. But advocates say integrating blockchain into traditional financial markets could lead to more efficient processes and cost savings for banks and their investors. Larry Fink, chief executive of asset manager BlackRock, has even heralded the use of blockchain for tokenising traditional asset classes as the “next generation” for financial markets. Several banks have experimented with using blockchain ledger technology to issue bonds, in an attempt to make the process more efficient. The European Investment Bank, the lending arm of the EU, is one leading institution that has issued bonds on the blockchain. So far, it has issued four, including a two-year £50mn bond and an SKr1bn green digital bond, the proceeds from which, it has said, will go towards climate projects. Other lenders that have issued bonds on the blockchain include Swiss bank UBS, Spain’s Santander and the World Bank. Mohamed Damak, a senior director in financial services at S\u0026P Global Ratings, says digital bonds mean banks “end up with a smoother process of issuance by reducing the number of intermediaries” and those lenders that have so far launched digital debt “want to see if this could help them to issue bonds in a much more efficient and speedy way”. For issuers, cost savings are a key driver for creating digital bonds. The blockchain technology records and updates information, including the asset’s ownership, transaction history and regulatory requirements, cutting the need for manual work by back-office and middle-office staff. Settlement is also much faster than the traditional two to three days, with money typically flowing to the issuer immediately once the bond has been priced. “When you do an issuance, that settles within minutes or seconds of issuing,” says David Newns, head of SIX Digital Exchange, a stock exchange and central securities depository (CSD). “From a treasury perspective, you can see you immediately hold that bond.” Using blockchain technology could save at least 35-65 per cent of the costs associated with issuance, according to a study by German fintech Cashlink. Blockchain automates processes such as updating bond documents and recording trades — acting, essentially, as a single standardised database. The technology also reduces the number of intermediaries involved. For example, the debt does not need to be registered at a CSD. Corporate actions such as coupon payments or returning capital could also be automated, cutting costs and paperwork. “You can automate a lot of aspects of the security that have historically been a lot more manual and typically require multiple steps,” says Newns, whose exchange has listed three digital bonds since its launch in 2021. Despite the prospect of a cheaper, more efficient way to issue bonds, digital debt volumes remain a tiny part of the vast global debt market. Just $500mn-worth of digital bonds were issued in the year to September 12, according to S\u0026P Global Ratings, while $6.3tn worth of US bonds alone were issued in the same period, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. For the asset class to take off, it will take time to build the technological infrastructure for banks and their investors, and to build confidence in a market that is now showing more enthusiasm for other technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence. “The whole digital securities world in the institutional space is one that requires construction — it’s a building project,” says Newns. The obstacles to Wall Street banks fully embracing blockchain are numerous — the technology, itself, being number one. “For the time being, it’s mainly testing the tech, testing the platforms,” says Damak, adding that “the numbers at this stage are still small”. Investors are also not fully prepared for buying and trading digital bonds, as they, too, need to have the right technology in place. “You typically have very few investors — sometimes it’s the banks themselves,” says Damak. He adds that the digital bonds issued so far have been dual in nature, meaning that both a digital and traditional version exists. “If the digital bond fails, there’s usually a back-up traditional bond that takes over so investors are paid,” he explains. Last year, UBS issued a SFr375mn bond, listed on both SIX’s digital and traditional exchange. Issuers are also conscious of the risks of creating digital bonds. The instruments “can carry some novel risks, namely operational, legal and cyber-related”, S\u0026P Global Ratings warned in a recent report.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nikou Asgari","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-10-23","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/fa673b94-7f7b-45a2-8754-6a83619ed6e1","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fcef15211-8849-4175-aaf3-443def47aed9.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How can blockchain be used to trade bonds?","INTRO":"Banks are making use of the technology underlying crypto — but how does it work with highly regulated assets?","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Wall Street is quietly becoming the vanguard of innovation in crypto-based technologies. A host of start-ups — from FTX to Celsius and Voyager Digital — have tried, and failed, to make a business out of crypto tokens built on top of blockchains. But, now, established investment banks and asset managers — including JPMorgan Chase, UBS and BlackRock — are trying to take the technology underlying crypto and apply it to trading tried and tested, highly regulated assets, such as stocks and bonds. The big idea capturing the imagination of Wall Street executives is tokenisation. This involves turning a legal asset, such as a US Treasury bond, into a digital token that sits on a blockchain ledger, which is shared between many parties. The token represents legal ownership. Coded into it is other crucial information, such as the previous owners and data on its transactions, trading and regulation. All of this information is immutable and cannot be edited by a single party. To ensure that, the ledger is shared publicly or between a select group of parties. Almost any asset can be turned into a token, but the focus of development at the moment is on assets that are traded on off-exchange markets, such as bonds and money market funds. Historically, parts of the bond market have been slower to adapt to newer technologies because they tend to be more illiquid and require more human intervention than others. That is especially true of corporate bonds. As fixed-income assets, bonds also have different maturities, making them more bespoke than a share or futures contract. Buyers and sellers of bonds usually rely on traders at banks to quote a price for a deal and trades are often struck privately — meaning information about deals is fragmented and opaque. But fixed-income securities are a crucial part of the global financial market. Sovereign bonds, because they are backed by governments, are regarded as akin to cash and so are accepted as collateral for margin [borrowing], or insurance, that backs daily trading and other activity. The blockchain allows a select group — the bank’s own clients, which are often other banks — on its network. Each client has access to the tokenised asset and each has its own node, or point on the blockchain network where transactions on the blockchain are verified. Collectively, these tools give them access to the market for tokenised assets. Take JPMorgan, as an example. The world’s largest investment bank offers trading of fixed income through its Onyx Digital Assets arm. It handles $1bn-$2bn a day of traded tokenised assets, although this is only a fraction of the size of deals that pass across the US bank’s trading desks. However, JPMorgan isn’t alone. Other banks, such as UBS, are developing their own networks. Putting bond transactions on a distributed ledger can help with the margin and collateral arrangements that accompany them. Banks have to be clients of other banks because they need to borrow money temporarily, to meet demands for funds. Often, those can be demands from for margin [borrowing], to cover the cost of trades that are still open. Usually, the borrowing bank has high-quality assets, such as US Treasuries, that it can borrow against, but it needs cash for the short term. So the bank will have a credit line with another bank, although this may be unsecured. That means the customer can borrow the money without having to put up its own insurance, but it can be costly in other ways. The bank, as a customer has to meet its own regulatory requirements, to show it can withstand stress in the market and still make payments to its lenders. A tokenised asset can help, here, as it still represents a legal asset and can be used as collateral for clients to borrow against under a secured loan. That makes it a repurchase, or repo, agreement. This very common agreement in the fixed-income market. It is widely used by banks and investors to find cash for the short term. US Treasuries are widely used as collateral. The buyer of the repo is the lender and the seller is the borrower. The former has offered financing that is secured; the latter has found the liquid assets it needs. Putting this deal on a distributed blockchain ledger also means that other parts of the life of the deal can be automated. For example, a smart contract — a computer program that executes actions automatically when certain conditions are met — could return the funds and assets to their original owners when the contract expires. A contract might only last for a few hours. It is still unclear whether there is long-term demand for this new way of handling trades. Many processes are inefficient, but the back office of banks, where the perfunctory business of matching and reconciling trades takes place, has long been ignored by senior managers who focus on more profitable activities. Banks are also aware that their own privately built platforms will need to operate with each other if the market is to grow. “This is no different from the way the market has evolved in the past — the banks have always innovated and always dealt with some of these issues,” says Mark Makepeace, chief executive of Wilshire, an index provider. And the market is, as ever, moving ahead of regulation. Many authorities are still trying to get used to an alternative approach. At a crypto conference in London recently, Tyrone Lobban, head of Onyx Digital Assets at JPMorgan, admitted: “We still have to get to the point where regulators are comfortable with this technology — and, until we get to that point, it’s going to be slow steps along the way.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-10-23","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/ce177de8-2828-4fe2-827f-1c25dcbc99ff","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F9c22357c-afb8-497c-b8e3-1ea892f2e30d.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"LSE Group draws up plans for blockchain-based digital assets business","INTRO":"Exchange operator in talks with UK government and regulators over new trading venue","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The London Stock Exchange Group has drawn up plans for a new digital markets business, saying this will make it the first major exchange to offer extensive trading of traditional financial assets on the blockchain technology best known for powering cryptocurrency. Murray Roos, head of capital markets at the LSE Group, told the Financial Times that the company had been examining the potential for a blockchain-powered trading venue for about a year, and had reached an “inflection point” where it had decided to take the plans forward. It has asked Julia Hoggett, head of the London Stock Exchange, one unit in the broader group, to spearhead the project. Roos stressed that his exchange was “definitely not building anything around cryptoassets” but was looking to use the technology that underpins popular tokens such as bitcoin to improve the efficiency of buying, selling and holding traditional assets. “The idea is to use digital technology to make a process that is slicker, smoother, cheaper and more transparent . . . and to have it regulated,” Roos said. He added that LSEG had waited to proceed until it was sure that the public blockchain technology was “good enough” and that investors were ready. The move by LSEG comes as a host of mainstream financial institutions talk up the potential for the blockchain — a digital ledger that records and verifies transactions — to streamline the process of issuing and trading financial assets, which often relies on cumbersome and frequently manual processes. Much of this hinges on so-called tokenisation, the process of creating digital representations of stocks or bonds whose ownership can be tracked on the technology. Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, earlier this year said “the next generation for markets” lay in the tokenisation of assets. If its plans come off, Roos said the LSEG would be the first large global stock exchange to offer an “end to end” blockchain-powered ecosystem to investors. Many other blockchain-powered projects have covered only part of the lifecycle of financial assets, rather than everything from issuance to trading, reconciliation and settlement. Roos added that the digital markets venture would not be a competitor to LSE’s traditional business, and its development was not an attempt to shore up its equities markets business, which has suffered in recent years as initial public offerings have dried up. “We’re very committed to the London equity markets,” Roos said. “What we are seeking to do is continue to do what London has always done and continue to innovate.” LSEG, which is considering using a separate legal entity for the digital markets business, hopes to have the first market up and running within the next year, subject to regulatory approval. It is already in talks with regulators in multiple jurisdictions, as well as the government and Treasury in the UK. “The ultimate goal is a global platform that allows participants in all jurisdictions to be able to interact with people in other jurisdictions completely abiding by rules, laws and regulations, potentially multiple jurisdictions simultaneously, which is something that hasn’t been possible in an analogue world,” Roos said. Recommended He offered as an example a transaction involving a Swiss buyer, Japanese asset and American seller which would be “very difficult” to do with older technology but could be easily accomplished in a digital world if LSE can get buy-in from multiple regulators. Roos said the digital business was likely to focus on private markets initially since activity there was particularly cumbersome and opaque. Once LSEG has proved the model there, it will expand it to other assets. “The technical opportunity of digitising a bunch of traded asset classes is extremely high,” Roos said. Data from the European securities regulator Esma on Thursday showed that just $800mn of traditional assets had been tokenised — or put on the blockchain — so far.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Laura Noonan Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-09-04","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f57f7071-ad7a-4a15-8210-f8bc79a8971b","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F3b8a9433-2fcf-475d-831b-c0b7c702a1ee.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Looking at LSE Group’s blockchain plans and trying not lose our minds","INTRO":"Awoouu (wolf howl)","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A mainFT scoop earlier this week might have prompted feelings of déjà vu for some readers: The London Stock Exchange Group has drawn up plans for a new digital markets business, saying this will make it the first major exchange to offer extensive trading of traditional financial assets on the blockchain technology best known for powering cryptocurrency. Once you’ve got past the whiplash of effectively hearing “I’m sceptical of crypto but blockchain has potential” rearing its head*, let’s look a bit closer. LSEG is, certainly by the standards of its own stock exchange, an interesting company. It share price has risen dramatically over recent years amid its combination with Refinitiv and the company’s continued transformation from mere stock exchange (yawn) to a fully-fledged financial data giant (exciting). Its new slogan is hardly inspiring, but can’t really be argued with: “Others do some of what we do, but not everything we do.” In fact, it feels like exactly the type of techy London-listed company that would currently be a flight risk, if it wasn’t for . . . well, you know. As a recent Jefferies note put it: LSEG’s evolving equity story is increasingly driven by continued momentum in its subscription-income-generating business lines. The relative positioning of its index and enterprise data businesses is already strong, in our view. The “weak link”, as Jefferies puts it, is Refinitiv’s “desktop franchise”, ie Eikon, ie the Bloomberg terminal competitor that is often invoked in the sentence “stupid f---ing Eikon”. That may change with the arrival of Workspace, its new platform (but Alphaville remembers similar chatter about Eikon when that launched back in 2010). LSEG is also moving forward in other areas, including, natch, AI. As mainFT’s Nikou Asgari reported last month, it has found a friend with benefits in this area: David Schwimmer, chief executive of LSEG, said the company was working with Microsoft to create “bespoke large language models” . . .  Microsoft took a 4 per cent stake in LSEG in December last year and secured a board seat as part of a 10-year strategic partnership, marking the latest in a series of incursions by Big Tech into the operation of global capital markets. Seattle-based Microsoft also invested $10bn in OpenAI in January. Jefferies held an call with Paul Dragan, former head of market development at Eikon, in July. Here’s part of what he had to say about the Microsoft connection: I think it’s fantastic. I think there were multiple layers of what was actually going through when we first heard about the partnership between Microsoft and Refinitiv. First of all, I think when you think about maybe the most obvious piece for some, which is the cloud, Microsoft Azure offering, etc., you have to understand the operational complexity and cost for Refinitiv of collecting all the financial data in the world, normalising it, cleansing it, structuring it, but also delivering it to their customers around the world. So you have customers in Sydney that love to receive their US market data really fast and really fresh and that’s expensive. You have a lot of manual work. You have a lot of infrastructure that Refinitiv has to manage in order to make that possible. So having a player like Microsoft Azure and all their data centres, all their capabilities in the cloud, will definitely have an impact on the infrastructure costs. I think there’s some great cost-savings potential for Refinitiv just simply by leveraging what Microsoft Azure has to offer. Refinitiv’s cost of maintaining their own infrastructure is quite high and it needs to be refreshed. They own the data centres, they own the comm lines, etc. The cost of refreshing that is quite high and it has to happen every three years in order to be competitive, etc. It will definitely give LSEG and Refinitiv some cost-savings and allow them to be more competitive. It all sounds pretty snug. But, uh, blockchain? Really? We can confirm that Microsoft is involved — LSEG’s head of capital markets Murray Roos told mainFT in world exclusive, previously-unreported comments (h/t Laura Noonan): We’ve been investigating some of the tech and engineering . . . for a number of months with Microsoft. Plus Microsoft’s global Web3 lead just kinda tweeted it out: watch this space 👇 more information to come soon 👀https://t.co/n6ZeUyN5Mo What do we know about Microsoft’s blockchain offering? On the surface, not a whole lot. Chief executive Satya Nadella told Davos this year that he believed in the blockchain, but that it needed “killer apps”. We also know it had a home-made blockchain product on Azure, its web services platform, that got canned in 2021 in favour of a third-party offering. There is this press release, from May (our emphasis): Digital Asset and leading market participants announce their plans to launch the Canton Network, the industry’s first privacy-enabled interoperable blockchain network designed for institutional assets and built to responsibly unlock the potential of synchronized financial markets. Canton Network participants include 3Homes, ASX, BNP Paribas, Broadridge, Capgemini, Cboe Global Markets, Cumberland, Deloitte, Deutsche Börse Group, Digital Asset, DRW, Eleox, EquiLend, FinClear, Gambyl, Goldman Sachs, IntellectEU, Liberty City Ventures, Microsoft, Moody’s, Paxos, Right Pedal LendOS, S\u0026P Global, SBI Digital Asset Holdings, The Digital Dollar Project, Umbrage, Versana, VERT Capital, Xpansiv, and Zinnia. Canton, the release says will provide a “decentralised infrastructure” that will connect between different applications built with Digital Asset’s Daml smart-contract language. This feels a lot the kind of thing LSEG has in mind, and Microsoft are clearly involved. We can’t see another finance-oriented blockchain project that they’re in bed with. However, Deutsche Börse and CBOE are listed as Canton partners while LSEG isn’t — so we are heavily spitballing here. Indeed, it isn’t even clear that work has really begun on this blockchain project. But if Canton is the framework . . . what’s Digital Asset? [birdseye camera zooms out from London, planet pivots and spins backwards through time, camera zooms in on A Land Down Under] From the Australia Financial Review last December: Digital Asset, the start-up that was building the new settlement system for the Australian equity market, has declared the ASX [Australian stock exchange] must shoulder the blame because it changed the scope of the project and never created a plan to fix core issues as it began to unravel. The retort from the New York-based company comes after ASX chief executive Helen Lofthouse earlier this week told a parliamentary committee that “escalating delays” in software development at Digital Asset were one of the key reasons behind the ASX’s decision to pull the plug on the project. This triggered a $250 million write-down, set the critical market infrastructure upgrade back at least five years, and triggered a loss of faith in ASX’s capability to manage technology, infuriating the Reserve Bank and corporate regulator. [FT coverage of the Australian exchange group’s hilarious blockchain misadventure here] The ASX commissioned Accenture (who, it should be noted, are hardly independent in this context, given their involvement in pushing blockchain solutions) to conduct a review of the saga (PDF here). Accenture found only 63 per cent of the rebuild was provided to ASX for testing. A Reuters postmortem from late last year said: People working on the project raised concerns that Digital Asset lacked after-market support and that the ASX had enlisted the company without testing its product for scalability, the person said, adding that the worries went unaddressed. Ultimately, ASX had 300 people working on the CHESS replacement project, about one-third of its headcount. We’re quite far down a hypothesis hole here, but we think it would certainly raise some eyebrows in the City if LSEG does end up in bed with Digital Asset over this — regardless of whether or not the latter was to blame for the ASX debacle. But maybe Microsoft would be just the kind of chaperone to make such an arrangement work. Wild speculation notwithstanding, the bigger picture is still remarkable. A year on from ASX’s embarrassing and ignominious blockchain blow-up, LSEG’s embrace of the same tech feels surprising to say the least. We’ll be watching how this develops with great interest. Digital Asset declined to comment. LSEG declined to comment. Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment. *This also isn’t the first time LSEG has made a blockchain push — in 2017, it partnered with IBM to make a blockchain-based platform for issuing private shares in Italian businesses through Borsa Italiana, using something called the Hyperledger Fabric frame. It’s not clear how that has progressed, although Hyperledger lists far fewer “premier members” than it used to.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Louis Ashworth","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-09-12","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/7d1a9ecf-e5bf-42ce-b923-4839f3f53bc5","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F16d70de8-c10d-406d-bf08-d0f1b88943f1.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Crypto tumult spurs rethink on best uses for blockchain","INTRO":"Tokenisation to create new markets, and decentralised ledgers to boost security, offer opportunities for growth","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The recent tumult in crypto markets, and ensuing regulatory crackdowns on the sector’s major players, have dented the appeal of their underlying blockchain technology to traditional finance operators. The collapse of FTX in November 2022 capped off a year of crisis in crypto markets in which price falls and scandals left a permanent black mark on the sector. And this year has been defined by flashpoints between regulators and the blockchain industry. In June, the Securities and Exchange Commission followed the lead of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in levelling charges against Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, for alleged trading violations. Publicly listed rival Coinbase is also facing similar charges from the SEC. At the height of enthusiasm for crypto in 2021, blockchain technology commanded mainstream attention, with exchanges securing celebrity endorsements, striking high-profile sponsorship deals, and several running multimillion dollar Super Bowl ads — including the now defunct FTX. The sector also drew sizeable investments from venture capital funds during the market’s record setting bull run. According to capital markets data provider PitchBook, investors poured roughly $30bn into crypto projects in both 2021 and 2022. This year, though, the figure is set to be nearer $10bn as investors’ exuberance has subsided and the regulatory pressure on companies at the epicentre of blockchain has prompted traditional finance to reconsider its approach to a technology once heralded as a new dawn for banking. “The current macroeconomic slowdown has caused businesses to be revalued, with some not receiving the funding they were expecting,” says Carl Uminski, executive vice-president and partner at CI\u0026T, which advises companies on internal digital transformations. “Investors are playing a cautious card right now and may not see blockchain as a profitable asset yet, so newer businesses adopting these technologies may struggle to move at the pace they hoped for.” Recommended At the end of last year — when the crypto industry was reeling not only from the collapse of FTX but other sector bellwethers including Celsius and Three Arrows Capital — a series of high-profile blockchain experiments failed. In November, the Australian stock exchange abandoned a plan to upgrade the clearing and settlement of shares to a blockchain-based platform. That same month, TradeLens, a blockchain-inspired supply chain solution for the shipping industry masterminded by Maersk and the tech giant IBM, was discontinued. “It’s an illusory phenomenon that certain innovation departments in companies have a mandate from the C-suite to ‘explore emerging technologies like blockchain’,” says Stephen Diehl, software engineer, author and crypto critic. The outlook for blockchain technology is not entirely bleak, however. Earlier this year, BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink described tokenisation — which involves digitising traditional assets and placing them on a blockchain — as the “next generation for markets”. Already, the London Stock Exchange Group is working to become the first major exchange to offer an “end to end” blockchain solution to customers, ranging from security issuance and trading to reconciliation and settlement. But the blockchain’s struggle to break into established finance is being hamstrung by advances in artificial intelligence, a technology turning heads in traditional finance in ways that blockchains once promised to. “Banks can use real-time data and artificial intelligence to identify any interactions needed,” says Nick Delis, senior vice-president of international and strategic business at Five9, a cloud systems provider. “They can prioritise high emotion, high stress contacts for human agents and route basic inquiries to intelligent virtual agents.” “During the interaction, banks can leverage data to give real-time insights to consumers, such as how their credit is being used, while giving customers the empathy they deserve.” AI is already being used in banking to help process and analyse large chunks of data. Screening payments and transactions for potential financial crime has also proven a popular use case. Recommended However, as banks step up their use of AI to combat scams and fraud aimed at them and their consumers, its impact on traditional banking could, in turn, present fresh demand for broader adoption of blockchain systems. Uminski, who attributes the sluggish advance of blockchain to a broader macroeconomic slowdown, suggests this could serve to create sector growth in the long term. “Blockchain can absolutely enhance the security of consumer and the banks’ records through the use of a decentralised ledger,” he argues. Ultimately, though, blockchain’s ability to find an established home in traditional finance may depend on whether the wider crypto industry satisfies regulator scrutiny. Beyond the SEC’s cases against Coinbase and Binance, US policymakers have pursued even the deepest corners of crypto, including decentralised finance, which eliminates the need for a third party intermediary such as a bank. “The underlying technology of blockchain, detached from speculation, isn’t that interesting or particularly useful in practice,” says Diehl. “Companies can keep building these things if they want because there’s no law against slow clumsy databases, but it will never add any value to their business.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Scott Chipolina","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-09-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/64249786-47e2-49db-989b-8870317d45b3","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F272c4fb1-46dd-41f8-b8b6-ea37cf6ffc2f.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ether futures ETFs fizzle on US debut","INTRO":"The nine ETFs saw combined trading volume of $6.6mn on Monday — attracting only a fraction of BITO’s $1bn initial haul","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools The hotly anticipated rollout of exchange traded funds linked to ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, in the US has turned into a damp squib, with modest investor interest. Nine ETFs holding futures contracts based on ether — the token of the Ethereum blockchain on which most “smart contracts” are written — debuted on the same day after regulators expedited the approval process to sidestep a potential US government shutdown, now averted. However the funds saw combined trading volume of just $6.6mn on Monday, according to data from AB Bernstein. This was a pale shadow of the $1bn of assets that the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) garnered on its first two days of trading in October 2021 when it became the first US ETF trading in futures contracts linked to bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency. “The ether futures ETFs opened to a rather tame start on Monday. Total trading volume was $6.6mn which was a disappointing start,” said Gautam Chhugani, senior analyst, global digital assets at Bernstein, who believed media attention was focused on the impending trial of FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried in New York. Chhugani believed the lacklustre launch was “not surprising, given the continued weak retail sentiment” towards cryptocurrencies, whereas BITO launched at the peak of a digital bull market. “Like any listed security, success or failure cannot be measured on the first days of trading with market sentiment and the macro environment all having a bearing on performance,” said Bradley Duke, chief strategist at ETC Group, a provider of crypto exchange traded products. Despite rallying 10 per cent last week in anticipation of the wave of launches, the price of ether is still down 64 per cent from its peak in November 2021. It fell 4 per cent to $1,663 on Monday as the launches underwhelmed — although as the ETFs are futures products, rather than investing in the “physical” spot cryptocurrency, purchases do not have any direct impact on the price. Bitcoin is also down by 57 per cent from the highs it briefly touched in November 2021 as cryptocurrencies have proved to be procyclical “high beta” assets. The bulk of the trading that did take place was in the pre-existing Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which changed its name to add “and Ether” on Tuesday, when it broadened out to incorporate both cryptocurrencies. BTF traded $4.6mn, according to Bernstein. The liveliest of the newly launched ETFs was the ProShares Ether Strategy ETF (EETH), which saw turnover of $879,000, ahead of the VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF (EFUT), at $516,000. Nevertheless, Chhugani argued that, if and when more retail investors do return to crypto there will be “wide availability of fair, secure and regulated products that help them attain crypto exposure without worrying about losing their savings from fraudulent exchanges”. Dave Weisberger, chief executive and co-founder of CoinRoutes, an algorithmic trading platform for the digital asset industry, believed the funds would be popular with financial advisers, who cannot invest client money in crypto itself, but can do so via ETFs. Ether is reasonably popular in Europe, where ETPs investing in both crypto futures and the physical spot currencies are permitted in many jurisdictions. The 13 pure ether ETPs available on the continent have combined assets of €1.1bn, according to data from TrackInsight, compared to €2.6bn in 20 bitcoin ETPs. Overall, ether has a market capitalisation of $200bn, compared to $535bn for bitcoin and $83bn for tether, the third-largest cryptocurrency. The launches come as the US ETF industry remains barred from what is sees as the crown jewel of the crypto firmament — spot bitcoin funds. The Securities and Exchange Commission has refused to allow the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, citing fears of fraud and manipulation on the unregulated exchanges on which the digital tokens trade, concerns that it does not have about futures contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a regulated venue. The SEC has thus far maintained this stance despite losing a court case to crypto manager Grayscale, which sued over the regulator’s refusal to let it convert its $17.4bn Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a private fund, into an ETF, in August. After that defeat, one school of thought was that the SEC might satisfy the court’s ruling — and equalise its treatment of spot and futures bitcoin ETFs — by retroactively axing BITO and its sister bitcoin futures ETFs. The regulator’s willingness to allow ether futures ETFs would appear to have put that idea to bed. Alongside Grayscale, 10 other managers, including BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, WisdomTree, VanEck and Valkyrie, have outstanding filings in place to launch spot bitcoin ETFs. Chhugani believed a “distinct shift” was now evident in the SEC’s stance towards crypto ETFs, with applicants “seeing a more engaged SEC being responsive, unlike the past”. He believed the first such bitcoin ETFs would be approved sometime around early January. Spot ether ETFs may follow not long after, with Ark and VanEck among the groups to have filed to launch products. Grayscale has also filed to convert its existing $5bn Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into an ETF. “What is clear is that, like bitcoin, the listing of these ethereum futures ETFs is ultimately paving the way for a spot ethereum ETF in the US,” said Duke.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Steve Johnson","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-10-04","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/22ec15e9-7e5e-420b-a109-3f480595d02b","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fcb3929ed-9022-488a-8883-20c4e7c1ced6.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin: crypto backers hope scarcity can solve everything","INTRO":"Regulator warnings have made banks more skittish about holding their assets after FTX’s failure","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The days of Bill Clinton appearing on stage at cryptocurrency conferences and Matt Damon starring in crypto exchange ads are long gone. Speculative mania has given way to more sober reflection. In the US, the energy usage of miners is under fresh attack. The White House has suggested that mining companies pay tax equal to 30 per cent of the cost of electricity they use. Despite this, the price of bitcoin has climbed 67 per cent this year, exceeding $30,000 in April before falling back. Ethereum, the second- largest digital token, is following the same trajectory. It may be less than half its high point, but the pause on interest rate rises has lifted bitcoin’s price. A technical event known as the halving could drive it higher still. There will only ever be 21mn bitcoin in circulation. Every four years, rewards for mining bitcoin are chopped in half. Right now, miners receive 6.25 bitcoin for verifying a new block of transactions on the blockchain. Next year this will drop to 3.125. Eventually the reward will be cut to $0. The lead-up to previous halvings has coincided with bitcoin price rises. Recommended It is possible, however, that dwindling enthusiasm for the crypto industry will damp the halving’s impact. Venture capital funding for crypto and blockchain start-ups dropped 80 per cent in the first quarter of the year compared with the same period in 2022, according to data from PitchBook. Excitement around artificial intelligence that has lifted prices in semiconductor companies and other tech stocks has not extended to crypto companies. Regulator warnings have made banks more skittish about holding their assets after FTX’s failure. Bitcoin was created in the wake of the financial crisis as a decentralised alternative. But the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank this year did not trigger renewed conversion to bitcoin. Lack of transparency remains a problem. So does criminal activity. Price moves dictated by technical mechanisms that create scarcity show how far the digital asset is from ushering in a brand-new financial system.

It is to create a global network in which users feel able to trust strangers on the internet. The method — scanning eyeballs to create digital IDs — is misguided. Channelling wider unease, the Kenyan government has ordered a halt to sign-ups. People had been queueing round the block for iris scans in the east African country. Iris scanning could allow the San Francisco and Berlin-based start-up the opportunity to amass a centralised biometric database. It has been dishing out tokens, ostensibly worth a few dollars each, in return. Participants clearly have no idea what their personal data is worth to tech companies. They also have a worrying level of faith in the value of the tokens. Tokens trade at $2.31 apiece, according to data site CoinGecko. That means a market worth of just under $270mn for the tokens in supply. But this is a small, highly illiquid market in which price moves may be driven by bad data. And if tokens are free, they lack the scarcity that propelled bitcoin’s price. Parent company Tools for Humanity has yet to present a convincing business model for Worldcoin. Fluctuating prices go against the start-up’s original plan, which was to provide tokens that could act as global currency for a universal basic income. Altman is riding high on the success of OpenAI, the generative artificial intelligence start-up he co-created. Worldcoin’s iris scan is designed to verify humans, acting as a countermeasure to the proliferation of AI that OpenAI is part of. Altman is therefore trying to solve a problem he helped create. OpenAI has raised more than $11bn in funding. Worldcoin has received far less. Crypto start-ups fell out of favour after the price of digital assets crashed last year. But Worldcoin investors are well regarded, including venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. The same concerns that hobbled Meta’s digital token project could stymie Worldcoin. Regulators have already raised alarms. Tokens are unavailable in the US, where regulators are still deciding on definitions for securities. This will deter users. Even if demand is high, Worldcoin’s chance of worldwide success is slim. Global governments have no intention of allowing a private company to challenge fiat currency.

This week, we’re taking a look at the troubled bitcoin mining industry. The repeated blowout earnings from Nvidia have delighted the chipmaker’s investors and Wall Street analysts and no doubt the company management, if only because they do not need to talk about the irritating issue of crypto. The worlds of digital assets and global chipmaking intersect in cryptocurrency mining, which plays a crucial role in the operation of tokens such as bitcoin. For bitcoin and other tokens to work, miners are needed to verify new blocks of payments on blockchains. They effectively take on the role as the market guarantor that ensures deals are trustworthy in a system that bypasses third parties such as banks and exchanges. In return, miners are rewarded financially with new coins. Their computers run continuously and require specialised graphics processing units (GPUs), computer chips that can handle high volumes of calculations. It turned out that Nvidia’s chips were the best product suited to the task and so demand from crypto-hungry miners soared from 2017. However, these customers were something of an inconvenience for Nvidia, although it wasn’t the only chipmaker to have this problem. Last year Nvidia settled charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission, with a $5.5mn penalty, that the company had failed to adequately disclose to investors the impact of crypto mining on its gaming business in the financial year to 2018. And by May 2021 it was tweaking the output of some graphics cards to make sure they fell into the hands of gamers, rather than crypto bros jumping on the latest trend. “Nvidia had designed its high GPUs for AI training and its low-end ones for gamers, both of which were more stable and reliable long-term markets than crypto,” Chris Meserole, director of the Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative at the Brookings Institution, the US think-tank, told me. “So when the price of ethereum spiked, the demand for [Nvidia’s] chips crowded out many of the long-term customers it was trying to service. Not that they hated the short-term profits, but strategically it created a few headaches,” Meserole added. But the clamour for AI chips has shifted the company’s relationship with crypto dramatically. With Nvidia’s success snowballing, in March the company felt comfortable enough to say what it really felt. “I never believed that [crypto] is something that will do something good for humanity,” Michael Kagan, Nvidia’s chief technology officer, told the Guardian. “All this crypto stuff, it needed parallel processing, and [Nvidia] is the best, so people just programmed it to use for this purpose. They bought a lot of stuff, and then eventually it collapsed, because it doesn’t bring anything useful for society. AI does.” But while one half of the odd-couple relationship has clearly moved on, the other is still clinging to the bond they once shared. As the price of bitcoin soared in 2020 and 2021 companies poured money into buying more mining equipment. Much of it was financed by debt. Back then, interest rates were low and money and energy was cheap. But the crash in the price of bitcoin lowered overall profitability, as did rising energy costs. And if you bought a bunch of graphics cards to mine ether two years ago, the blockchain’s move to a greener system in 2022 left you in the dust. Looking around for a credible story to tell, crypto miners talked of hitching themselves to the cloud computing trend. With demand for energy across economies becoming increasingly acute, some — perversely — got paid by authorities NOT to mine bitcoin, and that proved more profitable than actually mining it. But now AI is potentially offering a helicopter out of Saigon. Nvidia is still running hard to keep up with demand. “The companies that have shifted their priorities are not chip designers like Nvidia, but instead crypto mining companies that had purchased a bunch of chips for mining ethereum and now have pivoted to servicing the AI market instead,” Meserole said. A rebrand is well and truly under way, too. Mining companies such as HIVE Blockchain Technologies and Riot Blockchain have changed their names to ditch their blockchain baggage, becoming HIVE Digital Technologies and Riot Platforms respectively. Companies such as Canada’s Hive are sat on 38,000 GPU-based cards so it would not be a surprise to see a couple bought up, especially as their stock prices are depressed. Still, repurposing GPUs adapted for crypto mining is not straightforward. But removing excess capacity from the market is likely to have knock-on effects for bitcoin. Mining bitcoin has become progressively harder as the cost of mining the industry’s flagship token has increased all year because the bitcoin hash rate, or the amount of computing power needed for the network to process transactions increases. This risks pushing the business of mining bitcoin and other tokens even further into the hands of a rich few who can buy GPUs in bulk. Competition for the latest tools is likely to be tougher, especially if the seller doesn’t really believe what you’re doing has much value. What are your thoughts on Nvidia’s results and the lagging crypto mining market? As always, email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com. Collapsed crypto exchange FTX has plans to appoint Galaxy Digital, the investment giant led by US billionaire Mike Novogratz, to help manage and sell the company’s digital tokens in an effort to make creditors whole. The investment group was selected because of its “extensive experience in areas relevant to digital asset management and trading”. A reminder: Galaxy disclosed a near-$77mn exposure to FTX two days before the Bahamas-based exchange filed for bankruptcy in New York. For the 7,436th time, central bankers have warned against the risks associated with crypto assets: the Consultative Group of Directors of Financial Stability, which includes central bank representatives from countries including the US, Argentina and Brazil, said crypto had amplified rather than reduced financial risks in less developed countries. My colleague Laura Noonan has the story here. Remember Tornado Cash, the crypto mixing service that allegedly laundered more than $7bn in three years and helped North Korean hackers evade sanctions? This week, US federal prosecutors charged two in connection with operating the service: Roman Storm and Roman Semenov. As I noted last year, when the grand decentralised crypto worldview meets the US sanctions regime, the US sanctions regime wins. Speaking on the charges, US attorney Damian Williams said: “While publicly claiming to offer a technically sophisticated privacy service, Storm and Semenov in fact knew that they were helping hackers and fraudsters conceal the fruits of their crimes. Today’s indictment is a reminder that money laundering through cryptocurrency transactions violates the law, and those who engage in such laundering will face prosecution.” Label anything “AI” and it will generate interest, it seems. In the world of alternative crypto tokens that are not bitcoin or ether, coins that are linked with AI projects are the only basket of cryptocurrencies delivering positive returns so far this month. Other baskets, including exchange tokens and decentralised finance tokens, are trending firmly in the wrong direction. This, of course, is not very surprising considering the total value locked in decentralised finance projects has dipped below $40bn, a far cry from its almost $180bn height in late 2021.

Scott’s away this week so you’ve got me, and I’m taking a look at the promise and progress of tokenisation. Ask people in traditional finance about what they’re doing in crypto, and the chances are you’ll hear them enthusiastically reply: “Tokenisation is really interesting!” Hunt away from the headlines and you’ll find plenty of Wall Street’s biggest names exploring this idea. This week Citi became the latest large institution to take a step into tokenisation by allowing big-money clients to turn their deposits into tokens. Asset managers from BlackRock to Abrdn, and investment banks including JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are also either investing in tokenisation companies, or themselves exploring how to turn traditional assets such as bonds and funds, into digital versions. Even BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink, a contender for the title “King of Wall Street”, has said that securities tokenisation will herald the “next generation” for markets. So what is it? For the uninitiated: at its simplest, tokenisation is when a digital asset or “token” represents the ownership and other information about a traditional asset, such as a bond or fund. The tokens live on a distributed ledger and can hold lots of digital information, such as the asset’s ownership history, transaction, trading and regulatory details. Depending on the set-up, the token and its information can be held publicly or on a private blockchain. But technology is a world where lots of things are “interesting”. Some things quickly fall apart when they come into contact with reality and become a shake-your-head memory, like NFTs and the metaverse. Others, like the iPod and the internet, fundamentally changed the way we consume music and information. If it is to be the latter, we’re still only in the first stirrings of the revolution. While the tokenisation buzzword has been around for a good few years, just $500mn worth of digital bonds were issued in the year to September 12, according to S\u0026P Global Ratings, a mere drop in the vast debt market ocean (up to August this year, about $5.3tn worth of US bonds had been issued, according to Sifma). “We’re still in the early days of tokenisation,” said Amarjit Singh, a partner at EY, but added that “it’s great to see firms dipping their toes in the water”. One such firm is US asset manager Franklin Templeton, which manages $1.4tn worth of assets. The Californian firm runs a tokenised money market fund and it has made efficiencies in the way it processes dull but crucial administrative tasks. “For money market funds, each day there is some corporate action that is taking place in a fund. Interest rate accrual . . . dividend payout . . . Each time an action happens, the transfer agent updates the records,” according to Sandy Kaul, the money manager’s head of digital asset and investor advisory services. “The benefit of doing this on blockchain has been you’re only updating one transaction record, not multiple [records].” Hamilton Lane, an $820bn investment manager, has launched multiple tokenised funds. That has allowed them to tap “individual investors today who only want to operate with a digital wallet and they don’t want to do things in a non-digital world”, according to Erik Hirsch, vice-chair of Hamilton Lane. But these types of real world efficiencies are proving a hard sell. For many, mentioning the word “blockchain” inevitably conjures up the negative image of the crypto world. “When I say ‘token’ to people, too many people think crypto and I think making it clear that these are not related worlds, that alone honestly has been a surprising hurdle,” said Hirsch. Kaul noted that other asset managers had a lot of worries about following suit. “You need the wallet system, you need the infrastructure, you need the regulatory clarity.” Big firms are outsourcing the hard technology work. Hamilton Lane has turned to US fintech Securitize to do much of the heavy lifting for its tokenised funds. Hirsch said going through one set of anti-money laundering checks when setting up on Securitize had really cut costs for both Hamilton and its investors. “How traditional private market funds work, they’re not easy, there’s lots of lawyers, know your customer and anti-money laundering processes that are complicated. If you want to do five funds you have to go through five of those processes,” but with a tokenised fund it’s one and done, he said. Still, the question remains as to whether tokenisation is an iPod or an NFT. For it to really take off, there has to be demand. In spite of all the research papers and conference panels, the relatively few deals suggests there aren’t enough institutional investors clamouring for tokenised bonds, funds or equities yet. Nor is there appetite for fund managers to go through the long and arduous process of creating the digital securities when they can avoid the hassle by buying the same funds the same way they normally do. As Hirsch admits, the funds “exist in token world and non-token world. We didn’t create unique things just for the token world.” That’s a reflection of the limited tokenised-only demand. “To get there, it’s a huge leap from where we are now,” said EY’s Singh. What’s your take on tokenisation of assets? Email me at nikou.asgari@ft.com US billionaire Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital is setting up shop in Europe, enticed by both London and the EU’s progress in creating crypto regulations — a stark contrast to the US. Tether, the world’s biggest stablecoin issuer, resumed lending out its coins to customers, less than a year after it said it would cease the controversial practice. It said it was to prevent customers from needing “to sell their collateral at potentially unfavourable prices, which could result in losses”. Hong Kong’s dream of becoming a crypto hub has turned sour after police arrested at least 11 people in connection with a widespread fraud at exchange JPEX. In crypto, even those tracking hackers can get hacked. Data provider Nansen was hit with a data breach, it said on Friday. It estimated that just under 7 per cent of users’ email addresses were exposed and a smaller amount had their blockchain addresses exposed. What do you do when your crypto chief executive of a son is giving you a mere $200,000 annual salary, rather than the $1mn you were expecting? Call on his mum for back-up of course! That’s what Joseph Bankman did when his son — alleged fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried — wasn’t giving him a high enough salary, according to a court filing by the administrators of FTX, citing an email. “Gee Sam, I don’t know what to say here . . . Putting Barbara on this.” The disclosure is part of a lawsuit FTX filed against Stanford professors Bankman and his wife Barbara Fried, for misappropriating funds from the collapsed crypto exchange. As well as a juicy wage, SBF’s parents allegedly spent money on property, furnishings and flight tickets, among other lavish expenses. Since the US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Binance US in June for violating securities laws by selling unregistered securities to investors, volumes on the exchange have collapsed. Compounding its woes, the venue’s chief executive departed last week and 100 jobs were cut, about a third of its employees, leaving the exchange not just barely trading but with bare operations too.

Grayscale was the first issuer to act, filing on May 9 to launch the Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF, based on the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, behind bitcoin. Direxion, Roundhill Investments and Bitwise followed on May 10 with their own versions, filings show, while Valkyrie lodged an application on May 12. The Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet approved any ether futures ETFs. At least one firm — Kelly Strategic Management — filed for an ETF that would have invested in ether futures. Soon after, however, the firm withdrew its application. The SEC, however, has given the green light to ETFs that invest in bitcoin futures. The now-$928mn ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) was the first to launch in October 2021. This article was previously published by Ignites, a title owned by the FT Group. The SEC has rejected bids for physical bitcoin ETFs due to the potential for fraud and manipulation. SEC chair Gary Gensler has called bitcoin a “Wild West” market that leaves investors less protected than stock and bond markets. If approved by the SEC, the five ETFs will invest primarily in ether futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the filings show. Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the ethereum network, a “decentralised network of computers that operates on cryptographic protocols”, Grayscale’s filing notes. The funds will not invest directly in ether or any digital assets. The five ETFs’ investment strategies are largely the same, prospectuses show. They will invest in wholly owned subsidiaries organised under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Representatives from the issuers did not respond to requests for comment. “No news is good news for bitcoin futures ETFs, and it’s a good sign for the prospect of futures-based ether ETFs, as well,” said Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar. “There isn’t any evidence that bitcoin ETFs were a failed experiment for the SEC, so this may be the right time for these funds to be approved.” Shortly after it launched, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF amassed $1bn in assets at a faster pace than any previously launched ETF. However, its net asset value plunged 63.7 per cent in 2022. Since its inception, market depreciation has erased $1.3bn in investor assets. Other bitcoin futures ETFs, such as ones from VanEck and Valkyrie, have struggled to keep up. The VanEck ETF has just $41mn in assets and Valkyrie’s has $30mn, respectively, according to FactSet data. There was a “good case” for the SEC to approve the ether futures ETFs for the same reason that they approved the bitcoin futures ETFs in the first place, noted Matt Apkarian, associate director for product development at Cerulli Associates. “The fact that these are digital asset futures doesn’t really change what the SEC needs to see relative to any other futures-based exchange-traded products,” Apkarian said. Grayscale might also be calling the SEC’s bluff in regard to its statements in favour of futures-based crypto ETFs, Armour noted. In June Grayscale sued the SEC after the regulator rejected its bid to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. The firm claimed in the lawsuit that the SEC had no grounds to reject a spot bitcoin ETF after approving futures ETFs. The suit is ongoing.

Roundhill and Direxion do not currently offer any crypto-related products. Bitwise, meanwhile, runs a $477mn 10 Crypto Index Fund and $70mn Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ), which invests in companies that derive most of their revenue from the crypto ecosystem, not crypto directly. In March, Bitwise launched the Bitwise Bitcoin Strategy Optimum Roll ETF (BITC), a futures ETF designed for long-term investors. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see this become somewhat of a winner-take-most scenario like we saw with BITO,” Apkarian said, referring to ProShares’ Bitcoin futures ETF. “I think the first-mover advantage is likely why we are seeing so many firms trying to launch so quickly right now.” *Ignites is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

He has advised several CBDC projects. In the late 19th century, there was controversy in England over what some saw as a usurper to the established monetary order — paper banknotes. At the time, the use of paper currency to complement gold and silver coins was seen by opponents as unduly disruptive and prone to causing instability. During 1891, the Financial Times reported that banknotes in England, unlike in Scotland, were met with such suspicion that it was difficult to use them in day-to-day payments. A similar debate is under way on the development of central bank digital currencies, which is gathering pace around the world. CBDCs are set to transform how payments can be conducted. About 11 countries have launched a CBDC, while 17 are running a pilot programme on them, according to a tracker from the Atlantic Council. A further 33 have one under development and 39 are carrying out research on CBDCs. But some CBDC critics say they are not needed because the current system works, and they may bring unforeseen risks. This seems short-sighted, not taking into account future payment needs. The case for CBDC is a pragmatic one. They extend what central bank money can do, enhancing its utility to ensure it remains future proof. Part of a broader trend towards increasing diversification in payments, CBDCs support financial innovation and promote competition. That is a matter of fairness too. Since offering payment and settlement in central bank money is an advantage, alternative payment systems should have access to it. Central banks currently issue banknotes for the general public and reserves for interbank high value payments. Banknotes are a physical token or bearer instrument and rely on the cash infrastructure including ATMs and cash registers. Reserves are book-entry or scriptural monies similar to a commercial bank deposit and live on account-based payments systems. A CBDC is a digital token that typically circulates on blockchains or other platforms based on distributed ledgers to record ownership. In March, there will be key test for them — an EU pilot for market infrastructures based on digital ledger technology is scheduled to go live. It is meant to trial the adoption of trading and settlement of tokenised securities before regulation is amended to accommodate them. DLT platforms offer many out-of-the-box capabilities and advantages. In the convoluted process of conventional securities trading, trade execution, clearing and settlement entail separate and multiple operations. These activities also often involve different entities. In DLT-enabled securities trading, trade execution and settlement are one and the same. That is, the swap of a security token for a money token is the settlement. Tokens can be exchanged on the basis of delivery versus payment instantly, meaning both legs of the transaction have to succeed, or neither do. Instant settlement would mean no open positions, no use of clearing, proceeds are immediately available and there would be no need for central counterparties and other risk mitigation measures. CBDCs have also been instrumental in exploring new approaches to foreign exchange trading. In conventional foreign exchange transactions, the funding and settlement of trades are divorced. Processed through correspondent banks, long delays are common. Recommended CBDCs outline an entirely new architecture, facilitating cross-border and offshore payments in an instant. They simplify, speed up and de-risk foreign exchange trading. This may allow CBDCs from smaller economies to play a more prominent role, leading towards more diversified international payments and reducing the reliance on the very narrow set of national currencies today. It may be one of the biggest contributions of CBDCs. This may well be the year that will see the major adoption of CBDCs for securities settlements made real and important advances in the use of them for foreign exchange trading. The crypto world, a heavy user of blockchains, has seen difficult times lately. Central banks have remained undeterred to deploy the technology to facilitate CBDCs. It is an affirmation that cryptos and blockchain are two different things. Central bank money has not seen many innovations since the adoption of modern banknotes. But now these institutions have a rare opportunity to shape the evolution of money itself. .","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ousmène Jacques Mandeng","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-01-26","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/0f179850-56ec-46d6-9b87-d2734dceb2a2","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fd95e33c0-c53f-4e2a-a01c-63cb1044571b.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Central bank digital currency: blockchain could upend banking","INTRO":"Banks must lead industrialisation of their services or risk further erosion of earnings from core activities","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Banking remains remarkably stuck in old ways. The model has hardly changed for decades. Banks fund themselves partly with deposits and then lend at higher rates, trying to capture transaction fees from areas such as payments. But as some central banks trial their own digital currencies, important changes to the industry approach. Initially, sleepy banks allowed fintechs to snatch large chunks of the payments chain from banks. Core banking franchises could suffer the same fate unless banks can get ahead in new areas such as distributed ledger technology, also known as blockchain. For all their bad press, cryptocurrencies have at least demonstrated the efficacy of blockchain technologies to corral large amounts of data cheaply. Industrialisation of banking services such as consumer finance, mortgages and savings is a logical next step. Banks must lead this process or risk further erosion of earnings from core activities. As much as two-thirds of European bank industry’s net interest income could be at stake, thinks Andrea Filtri of Mediobanca. His conclusions follow an analysis of standardised products prone to disruption at 12 of the largest banks by revenues. To adjust to the disruption, bank cost-to-income ratios would need to fall from around half today to below 30 per cent. Using blockchain to cut expenses could help. Though the technology gets much hype, practical applications are few. One is Spunta, which connects Italian banks for accounts reconciliation. Applying its system to a hypothetical single blockchain for all standardised banking services reduces costs by a staggering 99 per cent. That is a simplified example. But the implications are clear. Should central banks adopt digital currencies, the use of blockchain could become widespread. Adapting to this disruptive technology will be profitable for banks that remain. That potential for greater efficiency should be a temptation for banks everywhere. Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

The biggest blunder came from the Australian Stock Exchange, which in November abandoned a plan announced seven years ago to upgrade clearing and settlement of shares to a blockchain-based platform. The exchange booked a A$250mn ($168mn) charge and apologised after admitting it needed to start the project again from scratch. Other initiatives in insurance, banking and shipping have also collapsed, suggesting that shared digital ledgers may fall flat in the quest to reform cumbersome operations. Even proponents of the technology warn that adopters should be prepared for multiple failures. “We are forever coming up with new ideas and killing them if they’re not appropriate,” said David Newns, head of Six Digital Exchange, which issued the first digital bond on a distributed ledger in November. “We’re in the invention space, so we have to think of new things with the expectation that a lot of those ideas will fail.” In July B3i, a consortium of 15 insurance and reinsurance companies, ceased activities and filed for insolvency. The project had aimed to reduce inefficiency in premium and claims settlement, and place contracts on blockchains. We.trade, another blockchain consortium of 12 banks focusing on trade finance also entered insolvency in June. The project had included Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Santander, Société Générale and UBS. Most recently, Maersk and IBM announced in late November they were discontinuing TradeLens, a supply-chain blockchain solution for the shipping industry, saying it had not “reached the level of commercial viability necessary to continue work and meet the financial expectations”. The failures have come alongside the crisis that has engulfed many of the crypto companies that tried to build their businesses trading and lending digital tokens such as bitcoin. That culminated in the collapse in November of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange — a failure that has undermined the case for buying tokens in the hope of making a profit. Still, some banks remain committed to blockchain technology. “There’s lots of negative sentiment about cryptocurrencies, most recently because of FTX,” said Mathew McDermott, global head of digital assets at Goldman Sachs. “That has nothing to do with the underlying technology.” Goldman, rivals such as JPMorgan and other financial institutions are still open to blockchain technology, citing its potential for efficiency gains and cost savings. JPMorgan has promoted its Onyx digital asset platform, which links other banks and financial institutions such as Visa, and handles payments linked to about $1bn of assets a day in currencies and bonds. But even some of those groups that have gone furthest with blockchain are cautious about its ultimate potential. In November, the European Investment Bank issued its second digital bond using the technology — a €100mn two-year deal arranged by Goldman Sachs, Santander and Société Générale. Using the technology can potentially help streamline issues around documentation and payments but Xavier Leroy, senior funding officer at the EIB’s non-core currencies and special transactions division said the advantages were so far limited. “Given that we are in the initial stages, at the moment there aren’t many [benefits] — it’s mostly about potential for the future,” he said. Some blockchain-related projects are also highly reliant on existing systems rather than replacing them, particularly so-called distributed ledgers that allow a select group of actors such as banks to share information on an immutable record. This activity is related to blockchains and crypto assets but does not involve creating and verifying transactions in return for token rewards — a crucial difference from the blockchain on which bitcoin and other tokens are based. HSBC, for instance, describes the FX Everywhere system that it uses to settle currency with Wells Fargo — which has handled more than $200bn of five currencies — as “blockchain-based”. Even so, its distributed ledger technology (DLT) relies on Traiana, a well-established market infrastructure, to act as the first step in the system. “There is a definition element. Even though we say DLT, people hear blockchain, blockchain, blockchain,” said Mark Williamson, global head of FX partnerships and propositions at HSBC. FX Everywhere uses consensus algorithms, cryptographic signing and other crypto-related processes. But it “doesn’t require a blockchain”, Williamson said. It also represents a tiny proportion of the overall business that HSBC and Wells Fargo handle in their currency trading operations. A group of technology experts in June told US lawmakers that such “append-only” digital databases were not new. “They have been known and used since 1980 for rather limited functions,” they said. Recommended Responsibilities to shareholders and regulation can also inhibit banks from using the types of blockchains that underpin tokens such as bitcoin. These blockchains generally require maintenance by networks of computers that use vast amounts of power, in a controversial process called “proof of work”, but shareholders and regulators are pushing companies to invest in projects that are more environmentally friendly. Banks are equally conscious they would have to navigate the different ways jurisdictions recognise tokenised investment products. In December, another Swiss stock exchange, BX Swiss, said it had completed a test trade of tokenised assets on a distributed public blockchain. However, it admitted it would require a separate market licence from the Swiss regulator to proceed. “The challenge is when a set of institutions come together and individual shareholders need to be committed to the journey,” said Keith Bear, a fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. “If priorities change and they don’t hit targets, projects fail.” Letter in response to this article: Here’s another diagnosis of recent blockchain mishaps / From Alisa DiCaprio, Chief Economist, R3; Former Chair, Fintech Committee at the US Department of Commerce, New York, NY, US","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martha Muir","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-12-30","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/6d049669-1fac-40d8-bd24-955de5d29730","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fb46d4740-4af1-4709-95fd-1d05be4cd059.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain may have a green future regardless of crypto","INTRO":"Scandals like FTX should not detract from the experiments going on with the technology elsewhere","DETAILED_CONTENT":"This month might not seem the perfect moment for an institution such as Goldman Sachs to be championing the benefits of “blockchain” or “tokenisation”. After all, these buzz words first shot to fame in the cryptocurrency sector, which has lost two-thirds of its value during the past year. And the recent implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire is likely to leave many traditional financiers shying away from digital assets — if not deriding them as a fraud. Yet when green activists, politicians and scientists assembled at COP27 this month, Rosie Hampson, an executive director at Goldman Sachs, was happily talking of both. In recent months the Wall Street bank has joined forces with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Bank for International Settlements and other financial institutions, to launch a capital markets initiative known as “Genesis” (a name it unfortunately shares with the struggling crypto broker). This Genesis aims to use blockchain and digital tokenisation to help investors who purchase climate-related bonds track the associated carbon credits in real time. “[With] Genesis we are thinking about how you can use blockchain, smart contract technology and IoT devices to support green bond contracts,” Hampson told a COP side event. She noted that this could change the process from “book building all the way through to primary issuance, asset servicing and . . . the secondary market component.” Or as Bénédicte Nolens, of the BIS, echoed in a recent podcast: “It is actually hard to sell a green bond [today]. But if you can attach the future carbon offset [with tokenisation] then it becomes a lot more attractive to the end investor.” This did not cause a splash at COP. No surprise, perhaps. Many green activists hate the whole concept of blockchain technologies, since early iterations of this guzzled energy. And the type of young(ish) anti-establishment evangelists who have rushed into cryptocurrencies in recent years generally dislike the idea of central bank involvement. But investors should take note. For while Genesis is still just a pilot, it is symbolic of a far bigger point: although the crypto collapse has left investors reeling, it has not stopped experiments with blockchain and tokenisation. Moreover, these are now reaching into some unexpected places, with growing government support. The World Bank is currently developing a utility for carbon credit registries that uses a blockchain system called Chia. And in mainstream central banking, tests are under way for wholesale (ie bank-to-bank) central bank digital currencies. The HKMA, for example, is currently working with the People’s Bank of China and other central banks on a so-called mBridge project to enable them to swap assets instantaneously. In Europe, the Banque de France and the Swiss National Bank have unveiled Project Jura, a foreign exchange CBDC pilot. And while these initiatives are still just pilots, they represent “a completely new architecture”, as Ousmène Mandeng, an Accenture consultant, recently told a meeting of the Euro 50 group in Washington. Or as Adrian Tobias of the IMF echoed: “The key things we have got from crypto are the ideas of tokenisation, cryptography and distributed ledgers. They are very important technologies and there is a lot of experimentation going on.” Unsurprisingly, the players driving these experiments are keen to distance themselves from scandals like the FTX implosion, by stressing that they are operating with extensive establishment oversight. They also emphasise that they are trying to deploy these technologies to solve real-world problems — rather than simply using them for their own sake. The Genesis initiative, for example, is trying to solve the problem that the carbon credits market today is so fragmented and opaque it is hard for investors to track potential greenwashing. Thus while Chinese issuers have sold $300bn of green bonds, transparency around this is very low. However, by using a co-ordinated distributed computerised ledger (ie blockchain), the BIS and Goldman Sachs say it would be possible to eliminate double counting and verify the carbon credits at source. Similarly digital tokenisation should make it possible to simplify bond distribution and pull retail investors into the market for the first time, by breaking bonds into tiny fractions. Or so the argument goes. Could this be done without digital assets technologies? Perhaps. Banks could theoretically sell fractions of green bonds using existing processes. They might also be able to create a single computerised global ledger for carbon credits if they collaborated with each other and the public sector. But the hard truth is that these sensible initiatives are not in place right now, while the mere advent of cryptocurrency is sparking a rethink of existing practices among legacy players as well as digital evangelists. And this may end up producing benefits, even if blockchain itself is never adopted at scale. This will not make mainstream investors any less suspicious of crypto. But it does illustrate a bigger theme: when disruptive technologies have emerged in the past, be they the railway or the internet, it is not always the first-order consequences that matter. It is still to early to judge whether or not digital assets can change the world — or make it green. gillian.tett@ft.com","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Gillian Tett","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-11-24","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/76234c49-cb11-4c2a-9a80-49da4f0ad7dd","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F705b0b8d-40de-4a76-bd62-bc838d0c9d44.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The great crypto crisis is upon us","INTRO":"Any regulation needs to look at what tangible economic benefits the industry actually offers","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The writer is economic adviser and head of research at the Bank for International Settlements There is a bitter irony in the turmoil currently gripping the crypto universe. Crypto was born in the depths of the great financial crisis of 2008 as a backlash against the failings of the conventional financial system, with its overleveraged shadow banks and daisy chain of leverage and maturity mismatch. The original Bitcoin white paper published that same year sold a vision in which money was refashioned as a self-sustaining system of peer-to-peer transfer without the need for intermediaries. However, today’s upheaval bears all the hallmarks of precisely the failings that the industry’s early proponents railed against. As firms collapse and coin prices crash, the unravelling of this new daisy chain of over-leveraged shadow crypto banks is now in full flow. While we survey the wreckage and plot a course for the policy response to rein in the sector, we need to keep in mind some key facts. Crypto operates under the banner of decentralisation, but it is highly centralised in two crucial respects. First, many supposedly decentralised protocols turn out to be highly concentrated in terms of who actually governs and controls things. Often, it is the founder and a small number of venture capital backers that are in charge — as evidenced by the implosion of the Terra stablecoin in May. In most instances, crypto is decentralised in name only. Second, centralised intermediaries, such as Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX, play a pivotal role as the gateway into the crypto world from the conventional financial system. They channel the flow of new investors, which is the oxygen that keeps these speculative dynamics alive. BIS research in this area has highlighted how crypto only really works when this is happening. To the extent that recruiting new investors is key to the survival of crypto, centralised intermediaries are crucial to propping up the edifice. The current collapse of FTX, and other falling dominoes in the sector, has led to much soul-searching among crypto promoters. Predictably, we are hearing calls for the industry “to go back to its roots” and be reborn in a purer form. The vision is to turn back the clock to the days when crypto was the preserve of a small group of enthusiasts rather than something marketed as a mainstream financial product. In this vision, it would be more like a niche hobby among a small minority of followers, rather than entering our living rooms through television advertising in an effort to draw in retail investors. This pure form of crypto, which imagines getting rid of centralised intermediaries, would have only a very small footprint. But crypto would not have grown to its current size without these entities channelling funds into the sector. Rather than standing in opposition, centralised intermediaries and crypto feed off each other. For this reason, any policy intervention now taken to mitigate crypto’s impact will need to take account of this mutual dependence, as well as the role that stablecoins play as the gateway from the conventional financial system. Some say “just let crypto burn”, but the idea that it will disappear of its own accord may be wishful thinking. When financial conditions change, even a much diminished sector that is the preserve of purists could still provide the embers for the renewed entry of centralised intermediaries. Any intervention would need to overcome one key challenge: if policy allows crypto to intertwine itself with the mainstream financial system, it will usher in something that has been avoided so far. In particular, if stablecoins are brought into the regulatory perimeter, their role as the entry point to the rest of the crypto ecosystem will need to be addressed. Policy should guard against letting them become the “cuckoo in the nest”. The new standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision on banking sector activities in crypto are a significant step in the right direction. More generally, the approach to regulation will need to distinguish the underlying economic function of crypto from what it looks like on the surface. Even during the worst excesses of the subprime mortgage boom, the daisy chain of leverage ultimately led to real world activity — most obviously buying a house with money. Crypto, on the other hand, is largely self-referential; its activities deal with trading other types of crypto and have little reference to tangible economic activity. Ultimately, any public policy response needs to start with a realistic assessment of the economic value that flows from blockchain technology. Blockchain’s returns have been remarkably meagre considering the early hype. One after the other, projects that have explored its potential benefits have come up empty-handed. A more promising approach is through central bank digital currencies that operate within the broader digital monetary system. This is an approach that builds on the trust embedded in central bank money, and could serve public interest in a future monetary system. The technology benefits flow to real world economic activities rather than just other types of crypto. The economic benefits of decentralisation should also be scrutinised more effectively. We are now seeing what happens when an industry rests simply on an article of faith.

What the distributed ledger technology needed, Singapore decided, was the rhetorical skills of former UK prime minister Boris Johnson to burnish its battered image, and here he was at a glittering gathering of the blockchain industry in a five-star hotel last week. Blockchain in particular and innovation in general, Johnson explained, is always scary at first. “Humanity has been paranoid about this since the Titan Prometheus gave us the first flame,” he said, mixing classical reference and technological detail. Johnson was giving the keynote speech for the International Symposium on Blockchain Advancements to 80 or so crypto enthusiasts who had braved Singapore’s tropical thundery showers to hear his insights. It felt a fitting location for the event in the same week that Singapore’s state-owned fund Temasek was facing scrutiny for ploughing $275mn into the collapsed crypto exchange FTX after eight-months of due diligence failed to flag up any big concerns. It is clear there was never enough paranoia or fear, one nonplussed conference-goer said after an hour of Johnson’s musings on Brexit, Australian submarines and his time at the Telegraph. Beyond the free canapés and macarons, the event was hard to read as anything other than a plea from the blockchain industry to be taken seriously. Every sector is entitled to seek the endorsement of disgraced former leaders at times, but Johnson’s paeans of praise for Singapore Slings and his room at the famously expensive Raffles Hotel, delivered alongside his lauding of the potential of blockchain to a half-filled ballroom of men in suits, unsurprisingly was not the panacea for its woes. One delegate, who gave his name as Kai and said he worked at a local crypto custodian start-up, was excited that someone “so famous” was speaking. What about Johnson’s position on digital currencies and the potential of blockchain? “Oh I don’t know about that,” Kai said with a nervous laugh. A rare female attendee admitted that she was actually a journalist mainly trying to find out how much Johnson was being paid to headline the conference. Against this backdrop, Britain’s former prime minister jovially assured the room of “blockchain pioneers” that they were in the right place, going on to remind his audience that technology is “morally neutral”. He dwelt at length on how doctors erroneously claimed in the early days of the railways that the rattling and jolting of trains was likely to cause sexual excitement, why the City of London is “the most productive place on Earth”, and something unclear about nuclear-powered vacuum cleaners. But it was not obvious how these digressions would bolster his case for blockchain. He did eventually circle back to the technology and cryptocurrencies. He said he has “seen some pretty shocking headlines about this whole venture and we need some way of holding people to account”. But no sooner had he raised the subject of recent events in the cryptosphere than he moved swiftly on to topics closer to his heart: Brexit, the Ukraine war and green technology. Then came his finale. “I will make a strong argument that the UK will become even more attractive as a place to invest once we deliver on all that Brexit stuff.” On blockchain, he added, he could not comment further without more details. The blockchain enthusiasts seemed less than enthused. Someone showed enough interest to snap a photo only to be admonished by a man who rushed over hissing there was to be no photography. The interviewer tried valiantly to bring Johnson back to blockchain. What was his overall message for innovators in the industry? “Apart from Singapore, which is a fantastic place for innovation, come to London. Come to the UK . . . It’s a fantastic country . . . it rains more in Rome by the way,” he replied. “I look forward to watching the progress of the blockchain industry with fascination,” he added to bemused applause. mercedes.ruehl@ft.com","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Mercedes Ruehl","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-12-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/c5763ff7-0652-4e8f-bd2d-6fa584aa85cb","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Ff68bcf1f-8a67-42b7-8295-ee9257c9ac93.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Finematter digital certificates smooth way for circular jewellery economy","INTRO":"Platform aims to increase transparency on provenance of pieces from smaller makers, boosting resale potential","DETAILED_CONTENT":"An online platform that aims to be what one of its founders calls a “360 home” for fine jewellery is due to launch in the US today. The expansion of Finematter — a showcase for independent jewellers that is already available to customers in the UK and Europe — comes ahead of its planned rollout of technology that will enable jewellers to issue digital certificates with sales from their own sites, not just those made through Finematter. Big brands increasingly are creating tamper-proof digital certificates on the blockchain to provide authentication for jewellery and transparency on production. Finematter hopes its hybrid-blockchain solution will be used more widely across the industry. The start-up has been issuing digital certificates of provenance, detailing the maker, along with the origin of precious metals and stones, with pieces sold via the platform since July. It is working with five jewellers to test further integration of the technology with their sales systems ahead of allowing partner makers to use the certificates free of charge for sales through their own websites, later this financial quarter. “As a small designer, I didn’t anticipate when I started my line eight years ago that I would be running into the amount of copyright infringement, trademark theft, and design theft that I have,” says Leigh Miller Newman, owner of Los-Angeles based Leigh Miller, which is part of the trial. “I love the idea of a digital certificate because it adds another layer of authenticity to the product that is challenging to offer otherwise. “I don’t know that it’ll reduce [copies], but I do have hope that it would give customers that purchase through myself or through Finematter peace of mind that they do have an authentic piece.” Caroline Chalmer, a former chief operating officer at Global Fashion Agenda, a Copenhagen-based non-profit organisation focused on sustainability in fashion, launched Finematter in late 2020 with co-founder Mie Ejdrup. Financial backers include angel investor Henrik Holmark, a former chief financial officer at Danish jewellery brand Pandora. Finematter’s aim was to “take a tech approach to the jewellery industry” and establish a platform to connect independent jewellers directly with customers, says Chalmer, the company’s chief executive. The platform takes a commission on sales made through its website, although she declines to disclose the percentage. The site launched with 20 jewellers and now showcases more than 100. Of these, 32 per cent are based in the US, 32 per cent in the UK, and the remainder elsewhere in Europe. However, until today’s expansion, only customers in the UK and Europe have been able to use the site. “We have quite a few partners that are based in the US and we’ve seen how we’ve been able to help them generate sales and new connections in Europe,” says Chalmer. “We want to do the same the other way round and, of course, the US is one of the largest jewellery markets. “We’ve been seeing a steady increase in our organic traffic [ie through search engines] from the US over the last few months [to about 20 per cent], despite not having launched there yet, so it’s already a significant share. That to us indicates a tremendous appetite.” I love the idea of a digital certificate because it adds another layer of authenticity to the product that is challenging to offer otherwise Finematter introduced replating, repairing, resizing and refreshing services in the UK at the start of last year in response to customer demand, with jobs allocated to participating partner jewellers. These services will also be offered in the US. This side of the business accounts for only a small percentage of sales by value (the average spend on services is £60, compared with an approximate average order value of £700 for new jewellery) but it is 35 per cent of order volume. Finematter recycles unwanted jewellery in the UK. There is an 800-strong waiting list to use the platform, according to Chalmer. Not all these jewellers will be allowed on to it; to date, about 20 per cent of applications processed have been accepted. Makers must meet selection criteria related to design, durability, value and sustainability. These include being a designer-led business and having supply chain transparency. London-based ethical jeweller Pippa Small joined in June, giving her brand exposure in Scandinavia for the first time (as she had not had a wholesaler there). She was encouraged by the fact that Finematter is “pursuing this route of improving transparency”, takes care to explain jewellery terms to customers and has clear labelling about material sourcing. She says that, whereas jewellery sold in department stores in the past was “separated from its story straightaway”, because salespeople did not know its history, having a certificate means this information will always “stick”. It also reinforces the idea that jewellery’s value continues beyond its owner. “It is the way it was always throughout time thought about . . . [and] passed down the generations but, increasingly, it’s become trend-driven and something more temporary,” she says. Chalmer agrees that, as well as helping jewellers “get new sales across the line”, digital certificates encourage longevity in jewellery, by making it easier for owners to insure, repair or resell pieces. She says a “smart contract” will be incorporated into the certificate before it is rolled out to jewellers so that, if a piece is later sold on the secondary market, a percentage of that sales fee, which she declines to disclose, kicks back to the original maker. “We have ambitions for the industry to work in a more circular way and the certificate is really the main building block for that mission,” says Chalmer.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Kate Youde","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-01-27","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/5568bd6b-99df-4c8b-91bc-e0b49011da80","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fe1c4d8b3-0a02-4d2b-b1a1-47d85f83b903.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Time for a reset of the crypto opportunity","INTRO":"Disruptive behaviour by some should not be allowed to spoil the opportunity in digital ledger technology","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The writer is chief executive and president of BNY Mellon Events of the past few weeks offer a cautionary tale to anyone following the crypto space. Blockchain technology and its resulting cryptoassets were built upon the promise of a revolution in finance but, amid the latest market disruption, it’s time for a reset and review of the opportunity. Cryptocurrencies have dominated the headlines, but they are a small part of the world of digital assets. To fully realise the untapped potential of the emerging digital asset ecosystem, it is incumbent on leaders of the public and private sectors to work together to accelerate a smart regulatory framework that unites the traditional and digital asset systems, rooted in two fundamental principles. The first is a recognition that regulation should enable the financial industry to prudently embrace innovation. Over the past two centuries, the world has seen many generations of financial technologies. Digital ledger representations of traditional assets such as cash, bonds and equities could be an important progression, as the original computer ledgers and real-time payments were from paper before them. This can lead to improvements in accuracy of record-keeping, easier handling of certain asset types such as real estate and loans and speedier, more efficient settlement. The distributed ledger technology underlying cryptoassets can be used to underpin new market infrastructure that offers benefit to the financial system. The central bank digital currencies and tokenised bonds being explored by major jurisdictions are just a few examples of the efforts to harness the benefits of this new technology. Just last month, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Monetary Authority of Singapore announced a joint effort to investigate how wholesale central bank digital currencies can improve the efficiency of cross-border wholesale payments involving multiple currencies. Exploration and innovation around digital ledger technology should thus be encouraged, not punished, in future regulatory frameworks. The second principle is to maintain the basic tenets of client protection, orderly markets and clear regulatory guidelines — regardless of the new technology, asset class or type of entity servicing it. Our established frameworks for market health and safety in the US were borne out of a series of depressions. While the progression of banking and securities regulation has not always been linear, it has remained rooted in these tenets. Digital assets operating outside those principles risk undermining the broader financial system. The fallout from co-mingled client assets, poor disclosure and missing internal controls should remind us that while the cast of characters and products may change, the script of financial market disorder remains painfully familiar. Although technology has evolved, certain established concepts should apply to all market participants and assets regardless of their technological wrapper. These include good governance, client asset segregation, clear record-keeping, security and technology standards, capital and liquidity requirements, limits on extreme leverage, anti-money laundering protections, strong risk management and regulatory guardrails. Today, banking institutions already operate within a perimeter of regulation. While conferring both privileges and obligations, this perimeter breathes what is arguably the most important currency into the global financial system: trust. Investor and public-sector confidence derive from the knowledge that the game has rules. Without trust in our financial system, we will have nothing useful. Worse still, without the resulting confidence in the system, we may suppress the opportunity to embrace an exciting technology that could help move the industry forward. With a majority of institutional investors interested in tokenisation, distributed ledger technology may represent the next financial frontier. Certain elements of the digital asset space have conflated disruptive innovation with generally disruptive behaviour, but they should not be allowed to spoil the opportunity for everyone else. A comprehensive regulatory framework is needed, but much of the underpinning already exists and can be extended from the regulation of traditional assets. There is a path to be found. We should embrace digital asset innovation, and align it to established rules and measured regulatory principles in order to protect customers and promote resiliency. In so doing, we also protect the most precious asset of all — confidence in our financial system.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Robin Vince","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-12-02","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/3db177f2-d187-4632-b94d-268f9d2598eb","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fb3a83c25-5b42-4cf5-8b20-0b0c2d0a8fbc.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How technology can help redraw the supply chain map","INTRO":"Certain innovations show promise in dealing with current supply chain challenges, but companies must know which problems they want to solve first","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Supply chains face a rethink. Geopolitical fissures have disabled the just-in-time model, unwinding decades of globalisation. The danger of overreliance on one large manufacturing base, China, has been exposed by the pandemic. Early on in the Covid outbreak, Fortune observed that 94 per cent of Fortune 1000 companies had experienced supply chain disruption. Added to this, many companies in the UK have been hamstrung by Brexit. Multinationals had the resources to prepare for Britain’s departure from the EU and, in critical sectors such as pharmaceuticals, many received government help to increase inventories and set up alternative sourcing. Small and medium businesses without financial clout, however, have been severely affected. Other countries did not have the UK’s additional impediment but they still experienced shipment delays. The August 2022 Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, collated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, showed that while delivery times had reduced in the previous four months, pressure was still high. This left the chain vulnerable to disruption or even to fluctuations in seasonal demand. Against these stresses, consumers continue to expect greater choice delivered quickly, cheaply and, increasingly, more sustainably. Even as disruptions continued, global trade for 2021 reached a record high in value, according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development. Suppliers should aim to meet the challenges that accompany this demand. To do so effectively, factors such as resilience, reliability and flexibility of the supply chain should be treated as more important than cost and efficiency. Visibility can help to solve problems. An accurate overview of the chain will mean that disruptions can be identified and dealt with. This will give a degree of resilience, says ManMohan Sodhi, professor of operations and supply chain management at Bayes Business School London. At the consumer end of the chain, traceability can fulfil shoppers’ demands for sustainability. Most companies recognise the need for better visibility but only a few can achieve it. In 2020, SupplyChainBrain, the supply chain management information resource, said most enterprises could view just 20 per cent of their chains — it recommends 70 to 90 per cent visibility. SupplyChainBrain says digitisation is “no longer optional” if we are to avoid severe business consequences. You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser. For the best results, supply chains should be digitally integrated from the most upstream commodity and component supplier to the final customer. Manual inputs would be turned into digital data that is consolidated, legible and visible throughout the system. The costs of not embracing digitisation are considerable, according to a study in 2021. It said the average annual cost to an organisation of manually entering data averaged $1mn in the organisations it polled, while more than $600,000 was spent in manual entry of supplier invoices. The importance of a digital supply chain strategy is well understood but, due to the complexity, most companies struggle with implementation. Transmetrics, an AI logistics software provider, says the logistics sector is notorious for its heavy use of manual processes and large volume of disparate data that can be costly to centralise. The result is that holistic digital integration is extremely challenging. Supply chains are also disrupted by technology silos between and within companies, as well as the lack of standardisation in data — a barrier that organisations including GS1, the champion of the barcode, are working to dismantle. Many companies are eager to deploy technology-enabled solutions. A survey conducted in 2022 by SAP, the software solution provider, found that within the next year or two, 70 per cent of UK businesses plan to adopt the latest technology to try to overcome supply chain challenges. 💾 View and download the entire report Older technology is already adding value. Some solutions that have evolved over decades, such as robotics and supply chain optimisation, have lowered costs and improved efficiency. Systems based on legacy software have emerged to improve supply chain visibility. Wincanton, the supply chain solution provider, has developed an application that applies new modules to existing technology. Its system can track goods from order placement to arrival at a consolidation centre. This “control tower” capability is still being developed and some manual elements remain. How a company approaches digital transformation is critical to success. Change should be viewed as an opportunity rather than a threat — and businesses must be prepared to fail as they learn. Michael Feindt, an adviser at Blue Yonder, the specialist in intelligent supply chains, says that while a move towards greater use of technology can be hampered by fear, this is less prevalent in South America and Africa — perhaps because there is more to gain in less developed markets. A supply chain upgrade should be a stepped process rather than a simultaneous, wholescale overhaul. Adoption of new technologies, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT), should be incremental, not least because these are still poorly understood and sometimes seen as a panacea, which they are not. Early adopters will undoubtedly experience disappointment. Most importantly, as Sodhi’s research emphasises, companies must first identify the problems they face and then, second, clarify their strategic goals. Technology will certainly help companies to become more adaptable and flexible, reduce costs and errors, optimise asset usage and speed up processes and communication. It will free workers from repetitive tasks to roles that require judgment and experience. Yet only when the right solutions are applied to defined problems can supply-chain technologies achieve any of the many aims. “Whatever the prioritised list of needs or expected benefits you seek and whatever your organisational constraints . . . you bring that to the vendor and ask them which they can or cannot do”, Sodhi says. He emphasises that the onus is on suppliers to identify solutions and, if necessary, to undertake their own pilot schemes to test nascent technology. Having the right organisational structure can improve outcomes and prevent a failure of experimental technology from going on to affect the entire business. Paul Durkin, chief customer and innovation officer at Wincanton, says his company has improved by splitting its technology function in two. One part addresses the challenges that face the existing business while the second identifies opportunities and products based on emerging technologies. He says “this creates bandwidth” for product development without neglecting current projects, thus creating more solutions for customers’ problems. The two parts come under one division and they unite to implement viable solutions. “There is no technology we have taken that hasn’t met expectations, but there are technologies that we have to be ready to consume as an organisation,” Durkin says. He adds that people are key. “In some cases [we may be] ready from a technology point of view; in [other] cases that might be from a people point of view. It’s the combination of people and technology that make it work.” Even once a technology solution has been identified as the right one, it is important to understand its capabilities. Feindt says: “Data-driven AI can help [in the] short term but for long term planning it gets more difficult. That is because the [likelihood of] unprecedented events becomes larger with longer timeframes.” In other words, AI cannot overcome the fundamentals of statistics nor predict the unpredictable. “Once an event has happened, software can help [you] adapt fast,” Feindt says. “For instance it can predict how consumer behaviour will develop and the necessary execution.” It can also rapidly assemble data about current circumstances, such as blockages at ports, helping companies to act quickly to find alternative products or suppliers. In the early days of the pandemic, machine learning (ML) could outperform humans. As the latest data came in, ML made use of them to come up with the best response. ML quickly learnt that this was not at all like a holiday period. Some customers initially feared that their software would be unable to cope with the unprecedented situations caused by the pandemic. Machine, however, turned out to be far faster than man in understanding and reacting to the flood of data. AI and ML also measured predictions against actual outcomes, learning as it went. While unpredictable events are inevitable, technology can devise scenario planning to help supply chains withstand shocks. It will optimise inventory management by incorporating levels of uncertainty and can help organisations reach strategic goals, for example, minimising wastage. Ultimately, networks will be able to be envisioned, designed and tested for resilience through scenarios where parts of the chain are “attacked” and contingencies brought into play. This could also help with the relocation of supply chains, such as from China to other parts of Asia, with systems optimised for site location, capacity, inventory management and customer response. To outline some of the technologies that can make a difference, this report looks at the strands of a typical supply chain to show which solutions add value and where, and which hold promise for the future. Companies should focus on what technologies do, not what they are, advises Cambridge university’s Centre for International Manufacturing. Echoing Sodhi, it says that a business’s strategic objectives — better delivery, better products, increased efficiency — should drive decisions on which part of the supply chain needs investment and the technology to be deployed. IBA Group, the outsourcing and software services company, says it can be better and less stressful for management, and therefore more successful, to upgrade facilities than to switch to an entirely new infrastructure. Procurement and fulfilment are entwined even though they are at opposite ends of the chain. Based on actual orders or predictions about orders, the former sources materials and goods to ensure that demand is satisfied through fulfilment. The more digitised a company’s procurement data, the better it can integrate with suppliers. If other suppliers are similarly enabled, the improved connectivity will boost visibility and responsiveness along the chain. The amount of data available for consumer behaviour is growing fast. According to an Ericsson report this year, total global mobile data traffic reached 67 exabytes a month at the end of 2021. This is expected to more than quadruple to 282EB a month in 2027. With the integration of information from suppliers and customers, AI and ML can provide demand forecasts and statistical analysis faster and more accurately than humans. Higher demand for a new type of product in a region can be identified early, which provides insights that can then be applied predictively to neighbouring markets. Data analysis can help to manage price movements and find cheaper sources. Supply chain planning is not new but a digitised system will allow more extensive scenario modelling. This will help companies work out how best to continue should part of a chain break, or to identify when alternative suppliers may be needed. As with visibility, such planning improves resilience. Companies that hold good quality data will have a significant advantage. The resilience of sourcing will be further enhanced when impending supply failures can be identified through automated monitoring that uses natural language processing. This could involve, for instance, the use of information gleaned from the web about extreme weather or political events. To some extent, this is already provided by “control towers”. These are less automated cloud-based data repositories that rely on both manual and automated sources to give companies an improved view of their chains. Control towers can, for example, give early warning of when an external shock is about to trouble a supplier. While control towers are already in use, continued manual inputs, data quality and the security of transfer between companies stand in the way of full automation. They are expected to be a strong growth area: the control tower market was worth $6.5bn in 2021, according to Grand View Research, and this valuation is predicted to grow at a compounded rate of 20 per cent a year between 2022 and 2030. Automated analysis that uses natural language processing and ML can also optimise supplier contracts, provide items to review or action and ensure that procurement terms are in alignment and standardised. Similarly, automation of repetitive tasks such as invoicing can reduce human error and speed up processing times. ML can also analyse invoices to prevent fraud. The efficient production of goods relies on a glitch-free manufacturing process. Equipment failure, poor management of input materials and bad scheduling all cost time and money. Solutions in this area are intended to ensure that downtime is minimised and the use of time and materials is optimised. Sensors can monitor anything from equipment function to product flow and help companies select more efficient production schedules. Combined with ML, sensors can predict the need for equipment maintenance and say when a particular piece is likely to fail. Smart sensors can spot quality issues based on data inconsistencies and decide when to call for human oversight. Want the best factory layout? Digital twinning can help. This is used to create a virtual replica of existing plants and work sites. It can provide insight into the best design, for example when new machines are being installed. One of the more mature technologies available for use in supply chains is robotics. Functionality has become increasingly sophisticated and the use of robots has spread far beyond its traditional heartland in the automotive sector. Data from the Association for Advancing Automation show that in 2021, sales of robots rose 28 per cent year on year to $2bn. This was triggered by a shortage of workers during the pandemic and was 14 per cent above the 2017 sales record. Non-automotive sectors represented 58 per cent of the total. 3D printing is useful for companies that produce work in small-scale batches near to their end markets. This is becoming more common in high-precision, low-volume industries such as customised medical devices, aerospace and aviation as well as those producing prototypes and spare parts. While the IoT grows bigger and stronger by the day, systems built on the more mature RFID technology (radio frequency identification) can offer near real-time monitoring of goods in transit. This allows accurate scheduling of handling and delivery and the most efficient use of fleets of lorries or vans. For refrigerated items, tracking enhances quality control by giving near-continuous temperature readings. In April 2022 Hapag-Lloyd said that all of its standard containers would have trackers within months, offering greater visibility of this part of the chain. Various software providers now offer control towers, which combine third party data and algorithms to solve transport problems. These can be especially helpful when delays occur: storms can be tracked and routes altered almost straight away. When dealing with mundane events such as traffic jams, technology can identify alternative routes far faster than people can. One drawback, however, is where a system still relies on data that is manually input. Currently when disasters affect trade arteries — the blocking of the Suez Canal by a container ship in 2021 is one example — it can take longer for companies to reconfigure schedules if their processes are not fully automated. The more data a system has, the faster it can optimise alternative plans. At some stage, natural language processing and standardised announcements — of changes to Covid regulations, for instance — should facilitate more automated data collection. AI can speed up mundane tasks such as choosing a carrier. It can assist logistics planners by narrowing down possible routes. The process is similar to that of an individual consumer who uses Google Flights to select a plane ticket. Predictive algorithms can also make sure that assets, for example containers, are in the right place at the right time. AI improves data analytics, capacity estimation and network analysis. Digital twinning uses AI and the IoT to make transportation more efficient. In the Port of Rotterdam, for instance, sensors in a digital twin help to plan mooring and unloading schedules, taking into account the state of the tide and weight of cargoes. In the long run, DHL envisages that digital twins of entire routes will be possible, all using real time information. This will make autonomous deliveries more feasible. Blockchain is said to have the potential to revolutionise much of the supply chain by providing transaction verification. Its promise to solve border logjams caused by Brexit have yet to materialise, however, and with limited evidence of its value or applications, any wide scale adoption should be treated as speculative. Warehouses operated by Ocado, the grocery technology company, show how end to end integration can add value. Systems based on its Smart Platform — which was developed in-house to meet its own business needs — are sold to grocery companies worldwide. Robots have added value to this part of the chain for decades and they have become increasingly sophisticated. Robots enabled with sensors, ML and AI can load trucks and pallets and move boxes. Ocado’s state of the art warehouses reduce downtime, as their robots monitor their own “health”. At Amazon, robots do everything from lifting heavy loads to fast and accurate picking and packing. Stock levels are based on actual orders and predicted demand — and this is where AI can bring savings. Historical data and pattern analysis have helped Ocado to reduce food wastage. It is down from the industry average of 2 to 3 per cent to 0.6 per cent. Last mile delivery can make or break customer satisfaction levels for a consumer-facing company. Besides the technologies already outlined, which help to predict demand and ensure that goods are available for delivery, software can optimise route planning as customer orders are received. For the past few years street robots have delivered fast food in London and other European cities. We can expect to see more autonomous vehicles and drones being used within a few years. Fully digitised supply chains not only enable efficiencies in existing businesses, they can also enhance revenues by focusing on what customers may need or wish to buy. Within procurement, ML and algorithms can make use of customer buying patterns and help to sell more products. Digital sales channels are no longer simply nice to have, they are essential for companies to reach digitally savvy consumers and tailor products for them. As demand increases for products whose sustainability is verified, traceability will give an edge to the consumer-facing companies that are among the first adopters. ◉ Cyber threats Greater digitisation in the supply chain is not free of risk. Data loss, information security and hacking are all threats. A report on the 2021 state of the supply chain for the software industry by Sonatype, which sells supply chain software, reported that the number of cyber attacks in the sector rose from 216 in 2015 to 12,000 in 2019, a 650 per cent increase. ◉ Expectations shortfall Disappointment can be a danger, a trend with technology that is shown by the Gartner hype cycle. With any early stage technology there is limited understanding. Failing to match the organisation’s need to the right technology will inevitably cause disappointment. The benefits provided by IoT, AI and blockchain are all still indistinguishable to most companies, as their utility is misunderstood. Sodhi of Bayes Business School London says that, to increase the odds of success, users must recognise that not all problems can be solved by every technology. “Each of these technologies are useful for something but they are not useful for everything . . . People think whether they get blockchain or AI or IoT that all their needs in the supply chain will be met. What they are actually thinking is what they need, they are not thinking what the technology will provide or not provide”. He likens making a choice from what is on offer to a homeowner being presented with a fridge, microwave and vacuum cleaner and choosing just one to fulfil all their needs. “If I buy a microwave to clean the floors and I open it and close it to pick up the dust from the floor, it might kind of work but that’s not what it was designed for”. The problem is exacerbated by limited knowledge-sharing among users. For technology applications to be refined and developed, more companies should share their experiences about what works and what does not. ◉ Talent mismatch Companies that are fearful of change risk poor implementation if they fail to achieve buy-in throughout an organisation. A lack of training will hamper progress. In some instances, a generational shift may be required for successful adoption. Experts stress the importance of the right personnel being involved in commissioning new software. Too often CEOs are sold so-called all-in-one solutions whose functionality they do not understand. Technology can help with the challenges that face supply chains. For greater adoption to be a success, however, companies must know which problems they want to solve. They must recognise that any solution is simply a tool that must be applied and used correctly by skilled people trained in its use. If there are problems in a supply chain, these need to be identified and addressed as early as possible. Even with the best technology, there is no substitute for communication and transparency. Early intervention can save companies’ relationships with their customers. Internet of things (IoT) The IoT consists of sensors that make goods “smart”. These can both send information and communicate with each other. The IoT is used in the supply chain for tracking and monitoring. Blockchain Blockchain is also known as distributed ledger technology. It allows for the digital recording of transactions and tracking assets in a business network. It introduces trust where this is scarce. The verifiability of transactions can help to reduce fraud). Artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics These involve statistics at a huge scale processed at a blistering speed. They can help with warehousing and inventory, improving sourcing relationships and predicting demand AI and machine learning ML is a facet of AI that applies an algorithm to data. It then taps into previous experience and then accomplishes tasks without human involvement. The algorithms can, for instance, make predictions, form personalised recommendations and recognise images in photos. Examples of ML with which you may be familiar include TikTok recommendations, photo portrait recognition and sentence completion. Robots and automation This covers the physical side of distribution centres and includes optimising storage, moving stock and picking and packing. It is increasingly sophisticated. 3D printing This involves the creation of three-dimensional objects by a machine that uses a computer model. It applies layers of substrate (plastics, liquids or powders) to create physical goods. It allows for the making and replication of extremely complex shapes that cannot be constructed by hand.

But as well as the slump in crypto assets, he faces questions from regulators","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Yat Siu is no stranger to controversy. Over the years, the serial technology entrepreneur has been kicked off the App Store, delisted from a stock exchange and has clashed with his auditors. But Siu, through his Hong Kong-based Animoca Brands vehicle, has become the pre-eminent investor in the world of blockchain-based gaming, presented by its promoters as the next big thing in the global games industry. He has sold his backers a vision of digital property rights in video games, where players can own their in-game items as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) recorded via blockchain, earn as they play, and profit from trading with other players. The collision of crypto and gaming has been one of the most-hyped potential uses for blockchain technology. As crypto boomed in 2021, the 49-year-old rode the speculative wave as Animoca sold NFTs linked to a portfolio of investments in almost 400 start-ups. A funding round in 2022 featured a $5.9bn valuation and the backing of some of the leading names in the investment world. You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic.

But as a “crypto winter” set in over the industry following a string of corporate disasters and a collapse in asset prices last year, Siu still faces serious questions over Animoca’s business model, regulatory compliance and governance. The company has become a test case for whether any of the potential innovations from blockchain will survive the crypto sell-off. If it stumbles, so too may the industry that Siu has helped will into existence . “When the predominant business is issuing tokens from zero and selling them to retail, it’s not an easy business to sustain long term,” says Antanas Guoga, a former Animoca investor. “Probably 99 per cent of the tokens are going to zero.” But if Siu proves his sceptics wrong, Animoca’s hundreds of investments could put it at the centre of what some think will be a revolution in gaming that proponents claim will take power away from distributors and put it in the hands of players. “He’s proven again and again to be the guy who can get out of any situation,” says another associate more bullish about Siu’s prospects. When the pandemic hit in 2020, Siu was at the helm of a little-known Hong Kong app developer that had just been delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange. Animoca, perennially lossmaking, had meagre revenues and a record of churning out largely forgettable mobile games, along with a grab-bag of investments in unloved blockchain ventures. Its mainstay for years had been mobile games based on well-known franchises like Garfield or Thomas the Tank Engine. Animoca would license the intellectual property rights and package them into free-to-play games. Siu, cheerful and self-deprecating, has been a fixture of the Hong Kong start-up scene for decades. He was born and raised in Austria, trained as a musician before becoming a programmer and then began launching companies after moving to Hong Kong in 1996. One former employee calls him down-to-earth. “A lot of people in crypto buy Lambos . . . he goes hiking with his wife.” You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser. As dotcom mania ramped up he launched an online messaging service called Outblaze, later described by BusinessWeek as a venture that had “outlasted the bubble”. Siu sold the messaging assets to IBM in 2009 and along with a core of Outblaze lieutenants, pivoted to mobile games. Animoca punched above its weight partly by playing the App Store’s rankings. “What we figured out is that if we launch an app every week, and cross promote, we’ll always be the top,” he says. The games often appeared to users under different publisher names. Apple viewed the tactics as manipulation and removed the company’s apps in 2012. Even though Animoca was allowed back in by 2013, the reputational effects lingered. “We actually became, a little bit, pariahs,” he says. The following year, he listed Animoca by reversing into a listed shell company in Australia and by late 2017 was experimenting with investments in AI and crypto tokens. Siu was an early investor in the company behind the original NFT bubble, CryptoKitties, which involved trading virtual cats. He describes his investing strategy as ecosystem building — the more blockchain-based businesses he backs, the more likely it is that the market as a whole will grow. He acquired one start-up, Leade.rs, in an all-share deal in part to evangelise about digital property rights to its backers, who included LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman. Besides the CryptoKitties supernova, Siu’s esoteric investments seemed unlikely to ever pay off. Animoca lost money and was constantly fundraising small amounts. To preserve cash, Siu generally structured investments as share swaps or threw in crypto tokens as consideration. “He’s incredibly creative and flexible in his ability to make deals,” says Mikhael Naayem, the co-founder of Dapper Labs, the company behind CryptoKitties. But when Covid-19 arrived, prompting governments and central banks to inject trillions of dollars into the global economy, crypto speculation boomed and suddenly Animoca had hit the big time. In the seven months to April 2022, the company reported $721mn in income from NFT sales and gains on investments. It valued its start-up portfolio at $1.5bn and said it had a further $4.2bn of “digital asset reserves” not counted on its balance sheet. “Was it smart? . . . We were just lucky,” says Siu. “We were just executing the business, and it just happened. I would love to take credit.” The bonanza was largely down to a few bets that Animoca made back in the doldrums of 2018 and 2019. These included OpenSea, an NFT trading platform, the SandBox, a virtual world where players can buy “land” and build their own games, and Axie Infinity, the token-based game that critics claim is akin to a pyramid scheme. Siu had been among a handful of backers of start-ups that were suddenly popular with investors. For founders, funding from Animoca was a sign of credibility, that “you’re tuned into the ecosystem”, as one mobile gaming executive puts it. Animoca further boosted its revenues by issuing new tokens or acquiring tokens issued by its portfolio companies cheaply and then selling them at high prices. “If you got into crypto with some sort of dollars behind you in 2017 and 2018 . . . you did insanely well by no fault of your own,” notes one banker who works with crypto companies. “You could have thrown a dart at a token and gotten 20x.” Siu raised hundreds of millions of dollars from high-profile investors on the back of that dart throwing. Multiple funding rounds culminated with the two-tranche deal in 2022 that valued the group at $5.9bn and was backed by Sequoia China, Winklevoss Capital, London’s Kingsway Capital and Soros Fund Management. Animoca also created NFTs from traditional franchises and brands, a skill Siu had been “honing . . . for many years in free to play [gaming]”, the mobile gaming executive says. One project involved Formula 1 NFTs tied to a game called Delta Time launched in 2019. Players could buy their own virtual cars. A big buyer was Guoga, a poker player and Lithuanian politician who spent an in-game token worth $77,000 on a single car in December 2020. But the collapse in the crypto market was as dramatic as its rise, and the impact has been clear in the token markets on which Animoca built its success. Delta Time closed last year after Formula 1 declined to renew the rights. The virtual cars are all “worthless” now, says Guoga, adding that he sold his own Animoca shares “at the top” last year. “The market seemed to be very inflated”. Cryptocurrencies may have rallied so far this year, but of the 13 tokens Animoca lists on its website as those it issued, 11 are down by more than 90 per cent since their peak. The other two have fallen at least 30 per cent. OpenSea, one of the jewels in Animoca’s portfolio and valued at $13bn in January 2022, saw its NFT trading volumes also plummet 85 per cent last year. Animoca shares, which had peaked in January 2022 at around A$4.60 a share on a secondary market for private companies, PrimaryMarkets, last traded at A$1.40. The retreat of money from the speculative fringes of the technology sector also focused attention on how few people were actually participating in crypto. Sandbox, considered Animoca’s best shot at a breakout hit, said in December it had 30,000 daily users. Top mainstream games typically count their daily users in the millions. Sandbox’s chief operating officer Sebastien Borget says the company has kept growing despite the crypto downturn. “The activity of the metaverse is not dependent on the cycle of the cryptocurrency markets,” he says. Sandeep Nailwal, the co-founder of blockchain platform Polygon, says his industry is still “very very small, minuscule”, especially relative to valuations being secured in 2021 and 2022. “The valuations are way off . . . orders of magnitude overvalued,” he says. In September, Siu announced a $110mn funding round that reflected new realities. Investors led by Singaporean sovereign wealth fund Temasek stumped up a convertible loan note rather than straight equity. “Everyone basically got pretty terrified,” he says of last year’s crypto collapse. The note is a three-year loan at 10 per cent, according to Siu. “It’s not cheap, but it’s not crazy.” But Siu’s enthusiasm for crypto and his freewheeling investment approach has also been a source of trouble for Animoca over the years. In March 2020, the Australian Securities Exchange terminated Animoca’s listing. At the time, the company cited a letter from the exchange complaining of governance failings, novel financing contracts, and its heavy involvement in crypto. But the letter, seen by the Financial Times, said Animoca’s disclosures and crypto investments had violated no fewer than 17 of ASX’s listing rules. The exchange accused the company of having a “wilful disregard” for its regulations, and expressed “serious concerns that [Animoca] does not have adequate systems and controls in place to manage its reporting and disclosure obligations”. Siu says the ASX just “didn’t like crypto” and that “when they decided to go after us, they just threw the book at us”. He adds that a detailed response to its criticisms was met with a cursory reply. The exchange did not respond to a request for comment. Though delisted, Animoca still has thousands of shareholders and is obliged to file public accounts in Australia. Its last set of numbers ran to the end of 2019 and it only filed them last year — shortly after being convicted and fined A$50,000 by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission for failing to do so previously. Animoca had failed to respond to Asic’s complaint; Siu calls the oversight “a bit of a shitshow”. He says the Asic notice had not been collected from a service address because of Covid-related travel restrictions. The company has received an extension to the end of March for its 2020 accounts and says it will file its 2021 and 2022 figures “this year”. The delays in filing stem in part from tussles with its auditors, disagreements that Siu blames on novel questions about accounting for crypto assets. Complaints from Animoca’s former auditors, Grant Thornton, appeared more prosaic, according to a March 2020 letter seen by the Financial Times, which was triggered by Animoca not “providing quality information in a timely manner” relating to the 2019 accounts The accountancy firm, which had audited Animoca since it listed, painted a picture of undocumented and opaque dealings, including with related parties, and said there was “little if any documentary evidence available [to] support the investments made” by Animoca. “Our audit procedures to date have indicated significant risks of management override of controls, potential for undisclosed related party transactions and undisclosed commitments for expenditure,” it added. Animoca said it addressed the points to Grant Thornton’s satisfaction and that the Covid pandemic caused problems and delays with audits at many companies. But it still replaced Grant Thornton with DFK Collins, a smaller Australian accountant, at the end of 2021. “GT struggled with our business . . . they didn’t really understand it,” Siu says. He acknowledges that Animoca didn’t have all the documentation the auditors wanted, but says that was to be expected given the nature and size of the investments he was making. You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser. “It is not like we go through three months due diligence on a half a million dollar investment,” he says, arguing it’s natural that there’s no formal valuation report on such deals. “I don’t think if we were in America, dealing with a tech auditor, that we would have had these issues.” But former employees, people who have run Animoca portfolio companies, and others with knowledge of the company gave similar accounts of a business with chaotic internal processes and weak governance, where decisions were made largely on the basis of Siu’s gut feeling. Historically, Animoca has been staffed by long-time associates of Siu, they said. The company was incubated by Outblaze, where Siu’s wife had been head of HR. Its head of venture investing is James Ho, Siu’s brother-in-law, whose personal fund was among the co-investors in a start-up that Animoca backed in 2021. Animoca said such co-investments were common industry practice In September, Animoca hired a new chief financial officer, group HR director and head of legal. Evan Auyang, who joined as group president of Animoca in 2021, says the company has significantly expanded its finance and legal capacity and professionalised its operations. He says that when he joined, he asked Siu whether he was “ready to have a team around you who would challenge him, and he welcomed that.” Animoca is in the midst of trying to raise a venture fund as big as $1bn, though it’s unclear if there is enough demand. Siu says the fund could act as a follow-on investor in the deals that the company has already backed. In November, after the FTX collapse, Siu released fresh financial details to reassure shareholders his company was solid. He said Animoca had $214mn in cash, digital assets of $940mn and “off-balance sheet digital reserves” of $3bn. He says it has no debt, is “cash flow positive” and is generating revenue from a range of activities. In the coming 18 to 24 months, he claims Animoca’s blockchain-gaming bets will be vindicated by mass adoption. Meanwhile, he is already pursuing new lines of business around his “big northstar” of digital property rights. One new push is NFTs created by teachers. “We’re trying to create a financial asset class out of content created by teachers so that they can participate in capital formation,” he says. Last month, Animoca also led a seed investment into the relaunched MoviePass, the cinema ticket service that collapsed in 2020. Siu attributes his fascination with true digital property rights in part to his experiences with Apple back in 2012. “It’s definitely made me feel much more stronger about the risk of centralised platforms,” he says. And despite the chaos in crypto markets, he’s outwardly unfazed. “It’s pretty chilly, but it’s not as cold as it was four years ago.” Data visualisation by Cleve Jones This article has been updated with the correct title for Sebastien Borget","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Kadhim Shubber Jemima Kelly Chan Ho-him","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-02-05","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/029dd01f-eaf5-493c-b195-299408b62469","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F270a8932-8efe-4732-9f6a-48ec9d66b5c3.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Australian stock exchange apologises for dropping botched blockchain upgrade","INTRO":"Pioneering project’s failure threatens to leave country behind UK and EU, critics say","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Australia’s stock exchange has apologised for abandoning a years-long plan to upgrade its clearing and settlement system to a modern blockchain-based platform after a series of delays. The Australian Securities Exchange’s move to drop the upgrade of its clearing housing system calls time on a project that critics say has cost the country its head-start in developing a more efficient trading system. Damian Roche, chair of ASX, apologised for the disruption caused by the botched upgrade. “We have concluded that the path we were on will not meet ASX’s and the market’s high standards. There are significant technology, governance and delivery challenges that must be addressed,” he said. Australian regulators had granted ASX control of the project to foster more efficient trading. In contrast, the European Union has launched a technology pilot to trial distributed ledger technology for share trading and the UK Treasury is set to do the same. The project, launched seven years ago, has been beset by repeated delays of the system’s implementation. ASX will book a A$250mn ($168mn) charge after admitting it needed to start again. Philip Lowe, the governor of Australia’s central bank, said that the banking industry had incurred significant costs and that any writedowns would need to be fully borne by ASX. “The announcement by ASX after many years of investment by both ASX and industry is very disappointing. ASX needs to prioritise developing a new plan to deliver safe and reliable clearing and settlement infrastructure,” Lowe said. Banks and financial services companies are estimated to have spent up to A$150mn preparing for the upgrade. The decision to abandon the blockchain upgrade followed a review by Accenture that showed major deficiencies in the design of the software, developed by a company in which ASX has a stake, and questioned its ability to ever launch. David Ferrall, head of trading platform FinClear, laid the blame on ASX and regulators who “blindly” accepted that the upgrade would deliver on its original promise. “It is not the technology that’s the problem. It is the implementation,” he said, noting that his company has developed trading platforms using the same system that ASX has aborted. Ferrall said that the replacement for ASX’s upgrade could be obsolete by the time it arrives in two to three years. Recommended “We’re now falling behind the rest of the world,” he said, arguing that other markets such as the UK and EU have created “sandboxes” to promote innovation outside the traditional clearing houses, something Australia failed to do. He said there was a risk that regulators could force a break-up of ASX by separating its exchange from its clearing operations. “That would be to the long-term benefit of the market and to the detriment of the ASX,” he said. ASX shares closed flat on Thursday but have fallen by almost a quarter this year to a market cap of A$13.6bn.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nic Fildes","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-11-17","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/d7980d58-b24c-4948-ab59-8199d16052b6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F5f58914b-a154-4beb-9c69-1d4aadc32023.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, crypto’s ‘corporate raider’","INTRO":"The Binance founder’s actions left Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX filing for bankruptcy","DETAILED_CONTENT":"On Tuesday afternoon Changpeng Zhao, chief executive of the world’s largest crypto exchange, picked up the phone to his one-time partner turned arch rival Sam Bankman-Fried. He was ready to negotiate a $600mn truce in a public feud that had rocked the crypto industry. But Zhao swiftly decided to throw a lifeline to FTX, Bankman-Fried’s company and the chief challenger to his own, Binance, in the fierce competition to dominate the offshore market in risky and complex digital asset trading. FTX had been swamped by customers demanding their money back, and urgently needed billions of dollars to stay afloat. Zhao agreed to rescue FTX and acquire his rival. But, only a day later, he abandoned the deal. On Friday Bankman-Fried’s $32bn empire filed for bankruptcy in the US. The collapse of FTX instantly tipped the balance of power in the $1tn crypto market. “[Zhao] coming out and attacking the token I think will go down as one of the greatest corporate attacks that has ever happened,” said Jon de Wet, chief investment officer at digital wealth manager Zerocap. “It’s private equity corporate raider stuff.” Zhao denies having a “master plan” to take over FTX. In just five years, Binance has boomed into an industry titan with a constellation of global affiliates — many in Zhao’s name. Last month alone, it processed $2.8tn in crypto coin and derivatives transactions, according to CryptoCompare data. The 45-year-old, universally known as “CZ”, was estimated to be one of the world’s richest people before the crash in crypto prices cut his fortune to $17bn, according to Forbes. Interviews with former employees, business partners and industry peers paint a portrait of a divisive entrepreneur on a relentless drive to grow at all costs. Several of those who worked with him said security and regulatory compliance were sacrificed in the race to dominate. Binance said: “In this fast-growing industry, we continually strive to evolve and ensure regulatory compliance and account holder protection.” Zhao, who declined to be interviewed, is venerated by an army of have-a-go investors who rush to take selfies with him. But while his “Binance Angels” spread the company gospel, equally vocal opponents criticise the exchange for money they say was lost during a series of technological outages at the height of 2021’s crypto market mayhem. Several former employees described a driven leader who pushed them to the edges of their comfort zone. Zhao’s tough character was on display this week when he said he would sell around $600mn in FTT, a token issued by FTX, which Binance had held since exiting an early equity investment in the company. This move knocked the token’s price, with FTX enduring a record $5bn of customer withdrawals on Sunday. Bankman-Fried alluded to the tussle on Twitter. “At some point I might have more to say about a particular sparring partner, so to speak. But you know, glass houses. So for now, all I’ll say is: well played; you won.” Zhao says the sales were a prudent move to avoid losses and the abortive takeover a good-faith effort to prevent market panic. “Did CZ seize an opportunity? Yes. Did CZ orchestrate everything? No. FTX put themselves in this position, ultimately,” said a senior executive at a trading firm. Born in China, Zhao is a Canadian citizen who spent his teenage years in Vancouver where he worked at McDonald’s. After studying computer science, he worked on trading software, including for the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In 2013, he moved into crypto, launching Binance four years later. Early on, Zhao repeatedly insisted that the company had no fixed headquarters, in line with crypto’s decentralised ethos. In fact, staff worked out of Shanghai and Tokyo but were warned not to wear Binance-branded clothing to the office, or reveal where they worked on LinkedIn. After a 2019 security breach, staff complained in chat messages seen by the Financial Times that users were “pointing out our clear negligence” and “extremely lax Know Your Customer security and procedures”. A former business partner said Binance “talked a big game” on anti-money laundering and KYC controls but was “resistant to throwing human resources at compliance issues”. Regulators have since censured Binance in a string of financial capitals, including the UK, which warned last year that the crypto behemoth’s “complex and high-risk financial products” posed “a significant risk to consumers”. Some viewed Zhao as an ambitious successor to Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. “Apple was selling computers, we were trying to reinvent the financial system,” said a former employee. But a former business partner said internal rivalry made Binance unpredictable and, at times, chaotic. “There was a conscious decision to let people battle for supremacy. It’s a very Machiavellian vision of leadership that I think CZ has embraced,” the person said. In a blog post about his leadership style, CZ said: “Controlled chaos is a type of structure.” After clashes with regulators, Zhao pledged to scrap “decentralised” organisation and establish a normal home base. “I am a technology entrepreneur and we are doing this pivot into a fully-regulated financial business,” he said last year. But his conversion to financial orthodoxy has yet to be completed. Binance said it has invested heavily and added 500 staff in compliance and law enforcement, but has not unveiled a regular corporate structure or headquarters.

The funds were launched in the heady days of 2021 — just in time for them for them to face the full force of 2022’s market fury, Morningstar Direct data show. The findings, from data provided exclusively for the Financial Times, exclude the performance of leveraged and inverse funds, which are not designed to be held over the long term. All five focused on the once high-flying cryptocurrency sector or the related field of blockchain, in a new illustration of academic claims that thematic funds have a tendency to launch near the peak of their theme, just before returns head south. “Specialised ETFs are launched just after the very peak of excitement around popular investment themes. Over the years following the launch, the underlying assets shed some of their initial overvaluation, and so do the prices of specialised ETFs,” wrote Rabih Moussawi and colleagues in an academic paper initially released last year. “Specialised ETFs appear to cater to over-optimistic investors,” said Moussawi, associate professor of finance at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. The heavily hyped ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which lost a record $1.2bn of investors’ money in the 12 months after its eagerly awaited arrival in October 2021, has garnered many of the headlines. Its travails have been far from unique, though, with a number of smaller ETFs sporting still larger losses in percentage terms than BITO’s 70.4 per cent maiden-year plunge, even if their losses in dollar terms were smaller by dint of their diminutive size. The worst performer was the France-domiciled Melanion BTC Equities Universe Ucits ETF (FR0014002IH8), which invests in crypto-adjacent companies such as Marathon Digital Holdings, Riot Blockchain and MicroStrategy. It launched in October 2021, the same month as BITO and just weeks before global markets peaked, only to tumble 76.9 per cent in the subsequent 12 months. Likewise, the US-listed Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH), which entered the fray in July last year, plummeted 76.7 per cent in its first year of operation. Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO), another October 2021 hatchling, was not far behind, sinking 73.7 per cent, while the First Trust SkyBridge Crypto Industry and Digital Economy ETF (CRPT) shipped 69.4 per cent in the 12 months to this September. “Blockchain investments are closely aligned with bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general but they come with added risk of equity exposure,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at consultancy VettaFi. “Companies that are connected to the broad ecosystem have faced challenges as the price of bitcoin has fallen sharply and the demand for the technology has not grown as fast as expected by investors. They are being punished just as much or even more so than bitcoin futures-based products themselves,” he added. The only other non-leveraged or inverse ETFs to have had a worse maiden year than BITO are the Xtrackers MSCI Russia Capped Swap ETF (XMRD), which lost 75.1 per cent in the year to December 2008 as the commodity supercycle crumbled, and Canada’s Horizons US Marijuana ETF (HMUS), which saw 75.3 per cent of its assets go up in smoke in 2019-20. In a demonstration, however, of the risks of holding leveraged and inverse vehicles over a long period, the worst ever debut year for any ETF, according to Morningstar, was chalked up by the Dublin-domiciled Leverage Shares 3x Roku exchange traded commodity (ROK3). Anyone who held the fund for 12 months from ROK3’s launch in June 2021 would have seen 99.92 per cent of their money evaporate, magnifying the 76 per cent slide in the US streaming platform’s share price during the period. A similar story of the risk of holding products designed for the short term can be found in the fortunes of the Switzerland-domiciled 21Shares Short Bitcoin ETP (SBTC), which took the opposite side of BITO’s bet, but over a different time period. SBTC would have lost investors 86.2 per cent in its first year, because its birth in January 2020 was just as bitcoin began its vertiginous climb, rising by 285 per cent. The Morningstar data also suggest a terrible first year does not necessarily sound the death knell for a fund, however. The SPDR Portfolio S\u0026P 500 Growth ETF (SPYG) fell 53.8 per cent in its first year of trading in 2000-2001 but has since bounced back to become a $12.2bn fund. Likewise, the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) tumbled 56 per cent in 2008-2009 but now has $4.5bn of assets and the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) slumped 68.2 per cent in the same year but now holds $2.2bn. Even ProShares has experience of this; its UltraPro Short QQQ (SQQQ) now has $4.8bn of assets, despite losing 68.1 per cent in 2010-2011. Kenneth Lamont, senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar, believed the crypto sector could be another to bounce back. “The people that I speak to who invest in bitcoin are still reliably bullish because the potential use cases haven’t changed,” Lamont said. “A lot of those involved in the industry have just regathered themselves for the next bull run. Whether that will arrive or not who knows, but if there is an investment case for bitcoin there will perhaps be an equilibrium found.” Click here to visit the ETF Hub","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Steve Johnson","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-10-28","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/61c15ce0-7d36-4602-9c54-fd8e5909a4ef","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F09bd65c3-2de7-4e46-a513-da95d531dcf1.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ether miners repurpose tools following the ‘Merge’","INTRO":"Consumers plan to reuse energy-intensive equipment for alternative services","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ether crypto miners are looking to repurpose technology made obsolete by last month’s “Merge” for other energy-intensive activity, potentially blunting the crypto project’s effort to slash its carbon footprint. Companies and small investors that lost out following the success of the Merge are turning to mining other cryptocurrencies, hosting services in the cloud and even heating their homes to make use of their equipment. The Merge, one of the most ambitious projects in crypto history, transformed the running and upkeep of the popular Ethereum blockchain by moving from a “proof-of-work” system to one known as “proof of stake”. That switch drastically slashed the amount of energy needed to mine new ether tokens and maintain the ledger that tracks all Ethereum deals. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin claimed the transition would cut worldwide electricity consumption by 0.2 per cent. But that has left many investors who bet against the Merge happening with stacks of redundant IT equipment. Many are looking to repurpose their energy-intensive machines for other computing services. Ether miners use tech that contains graphics processing units (GPUs), computer chips that can handle high volumes of data and are more adaptable than bitcoin mining machines. Large companies such as Hut 8 Mining and Hive Blockchain Technologies have said they will turn to cloud computing. “Tracking the consequences of the Merge becomes worse if you consider that graphics cards have uses outside of mining, like cloud computing, AI and gaming,” said Alex de Vries, founder of the Digiconomist crypto analytics site. “It could be near impossible to track.” Many ether miners were ordinary consumers as it used less power than bitcoin. “There’s a huge retail base in Ethereum mining, because it’s much easier to run a GPU in your house than a bitcoin mining machine,” said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer of Luxor Technologies, a mining and analytics company. Chris Kyle, director of marketing at Flexpool, a mutualised crypto mining group, is planning to use his 86 GPUs to heat his Vancouver home. The units are roughly the size of a computer keyboard, and graphics card temperatures can range between 40C and 90C. “Now that it’s getting cold I’m going to turn them back on . . . all the energy you put in them gets turned into heat so it makes sense to just run my GPU instead of turning the heating on.” Some are mining other energy-intensive cryptocurrencies. Around a fifth of the computing power that was devoted to mining the old Ethereum blockchain has been switched to alternative coins, such as Ethereum Classic, Ravencoin and Ergo. However, the influx of new miners has increased competition, squeezing an industry already struggling with high energy costs. “It is extremely unlikely mining these coins is profitable anymore as margins will be squeezed to an extreme,” said James Check, a lead analyst at Glassnode, a blockchain data and intelligence company. Others are waiting for a pick-up in prices. Jon Hartwig, a manufacturing engineer from Iowa, spends his evenings and weekends dusting and checking the wiring of his 600 GPUs. Recommended “A lot of miners are holding on to their gear . . . I’m going to sit on it and wait until the next thing that comes along,” he said. Mark D’Aria, chief executive of Bitpro Consulting, which resells used mining equipment, said the volume of GPUs sold on the platform had risen 30 per cent in the month since the Merge, and prices had not fallen “as much as I thought they would”. “More people are selling . . . but it has slowed a lot after those first two weeks. There are an enormous amount of graphic cards out there waiting for someone to figure out what to do with.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martha Muir","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-11-01","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/9d899118-eede-4c74-b81d-bf4bf945fa1a","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fef00294a-adb2-4821-9273-b4e4e36b7f66.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Crypto miners hit hard in digital asset industry’s downturn","INTRO":"High energy costs and flat coin prices push companies close to the edge","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Crypto mining companies are coming under heavy pressure from this year’s digital asset downturn as the high cost of energy and the flatlining price of coins pushes more names close to the financial cliff edge. Nasdaq-listed Core Scientific warned last week it could file for bankruptcy protection as its cash resources would be depleted by the end of the year. On Monday, London-listed Argo Blockchain echoed that gloomy outlook, saying it may be forced to cease operations after a critical fundraising fell through. Those warnings came only weeks after US’s Computer North, which operated data centre services for miners, filed for bankruptcy, owing up to $500mn and blaming tough market conditions. Their dire financial situations show how crypto mining — the process by which coins are generated and transactions are verified — is next in line to feel the impact of the crash in the price of popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin over the past 12 months. The act of employing a large network of computers to work together to solve cryptographic calculations that verify cryptocurrency transactions. Typically, one party will solve the puzzle, known as a hash, that creates the next block in the chain. The others will verify it. In return for maintaining the blockchain, miners are rewarded with new tokens for being the first to solve the cryptographic proof. They also collect transaction fees. Read more in the FT crypto glossary. The downturn has already claimed a series of once-prominent crypto firms such as lending platform Celsius Network and Three Arrows Capital, the hedge fund. “The crypto winter is having negative ramifications for the overall ecosystem, including the miners. It’s a chain reaction as this long cold crypto winter continues,” said Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities. Industry analysts and executives have questioned the sustainability of mining especially after prices of leading tokens have been rangebound since June. Bitcoin has rarely risen above $21,000 after reaching a high of almost $70,000 late last year. Miners play a crucial role in the operation of so-called “proof of work” tokens such as bitcoin. They verify new blocks on blockchains, effectively taking on the role as guarantor that deals are trustworthy in a system that bypasses third parties such as banks and exchanges. In return for mining, they are rewarded with new tokens. Ether, the world’s second-biggest crypto token, recently moved away from the type of system that requires miners. Many miners were enticed by ever-rising prices for coins. When the price of bitcoin crashed in 2021, companies poured money into buying mining equipment, including fast computers that suck up large amounts of power. Hut 8, a mining company, added 9,592 machines for mining in the first quarter of 2022, increasing its capacity by nearly a third. The extra mining capacity has arrived on the market just as the price has tumbled, meaning miners are racing harder to win the token. Bitcoin’s total hashrate, the computing power directed towards mining, has increased by 57 per cent in the last year to a record 260 exahash — or quintillion — operations a second, according to Hashrate Index. The high cost of energy has also caught many out and punctured miners’ ambitions. Miners race against each other to solve complex mathematical puzzles and earn bitcoin. They expend large amounts of energy regardless of whether or not they claim the bitcoin before their competitors. Argo admitted that energy costs for its Texas facility were nearly three times the average price for August. That has been exacerbated by the threat of energy blackouts in the US. In July, Argo, Core Scientific and Riot Blockchain scaled back their Texas operations, as demand for energy threatened to overwhelm the power grid. “The bottom line is the competition has been increasing recently, even though power costs are high and the bitcoin price is kind of stable . . . I think they are still profitable, but the profit spreads are shrinking,” said Chris Brendler, a senior research analyst at DA Davidson, an investment bank. He remains positive on some miners, including Stronghold Digital Mining, which has shed more than 95 per cent of its value in the past year. Conditions may not improve in the short term. Since the Ethereum “Merge” in September made Ethereum mining effectively obsolete by switching to a different system for transaction verification, companies such as Hive and Hut 8 said they planned to fill their capacity with bitcoin mining. Moreover, in less than two years the rewards for mining bitcoin is expected to halve, in a four-yearly event that is preset into bitcoin’s code. “The only way for miners to increase their bitcoin production through the upcoming halving is to grow capacity much faster than their competitors,” said Jaran Mellerud, an independent crypto mining analyst.

The Ethereum blockchain is one of the world’s most widely used digital ledgers, and is the main platform for Web3, non-fungible tokens, and decentralised finance. While the Merge is unequivocally good news for the environment, it brings the Ethereum blockchain’s other problems into even starker relief. Rather than relying on centralised intermediaries such as a bank to approve transactions, blockchains rely on what is known as a “consensus mechanism”. Before the Merge, Ethereum used the “proof-of-work” consensus mechanism. This involves so-called “miners” using enormous amounts of electricity to power computers to make repeated guesses of the number that will allow them to add a block of transactions to the blockchain. The winning miners are then compensated with cryptocurrency for their work. The bitcoin blockchain still does it this way. Verification of bitcoin transactions uses more energy than entire countries like Norway; in areas where lots of bitcoin mining occurs, local populations have suffered from rising energy costs and noise pollution. Ethereum’s shift to a “proof-of-stake” system avoids these environmental costs. Ethereum now uses an algorithm that randomly selects someone to create a new block to add to the blockchain. The party is chosen from those who have staked their ether (the Ethereum blockchain’s native coin) for the chance to do the work and be compensated for it. The more ether someone stakes, the more likely they are to be chosen to create the new block. This creates incentives to acquire even more ether, and it seems reasonable to predict that any blockchain that relies on proof-of-stake will start to concentrate the ability to process transactions in just a few hands. Staking is already a highly centralised business involving some of the industry’s largest companies, such as Coinbase, according to data provider Nansen. More centralisation seems inevitable. Remember that the whole point of having a blockchain with a consensus mechanism is to avoid having to rely on centralised intermediaries to verify transactions. Without meaningful decentralisation, one has to wonder if all the other problems associated with Ethereum are worth it. For example, the Ethereum blockchain is notorious for congestion at peak times, which manifests in slower transaction processing times and fluctuating transaction fees (which are known as “gas fees”). At peak times, gas fees can be prohibitive for users trying to complete smaller transactions (in May 2022, average daily gas fees reached nearly $200), but the Merge has not changed the way gas fees are calculated or charged. Such congestion adds to another problem. Users can pay validators higher fees to have their order executed first within a block of transactions. This is a cost on users which benefits the bigger validators which will be chosen to create more blocks of transactions, and will therefore have more opportunities to pocket higher fees. A validator may even insert their own transaction ahead of others in order to profit from market movements, a practice known as MEV or “maximal extractable value”. The Merge will also not make the blockchain more secure. Ethereum’s claims that it will do this assume that the Merge will increase decentralisation. But if the reverse is true, there are risks. A report commissioned by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency found proof-of-stake blockchains can be successfully manipulated if the number of validators is too small. The shift to proof-of-stake also increases the legal uncertainty around the status of ether. Prior to the Merge, US Senator Debbie Stabenow proposed a bill that lists ether as an example of a “digital commodity” falling outside of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s jurisdiction (in the US, securities are regulated by the SEC, whereas the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has oversight over the commodities markets). However, now that stakers pool their ether together in the hope of being compensated from the Ethereum blockchain’s gas fees, a stronger case can be made that ether are securities and not commodities. The SEC might have something to say about Ethereum’s claims about its decentralisation and its benefits.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hilary Allen","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-10-19","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/3746542f-3f13-46c7-a236-586dffed3b61","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F97ead572-d4ed-4754-b620-62f3f9f5f1a1.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Wait, wasn’t bitcoin supposed to solve this?","INTRO":"Back2basics","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Jill Gunter is a co-founder of blockchain company Espresso Systems. Previously, she was a venture capitalist focused on crypto. She started her career as a trader at Goldman Sachs. A popular refrain among crypto advocates over the years has been “bitcoin solves this”. But the same phrase has also become a popular meme among critics of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. Sceptics offer the phrase in reply to overzealous crypto acolytes who try to apply blockchain technology to everything from salad provenance to social media. “Bitcoin solves this,” they eye-roll, gesturing to the fact that no amount of blockchain will be a panacea to the problem at hand. Over the last week, as crypto exchange FTX crumbled into bankruptcy amid revelations of misappropriation of customer funds, imaginary marks and risky bets, crypto’s proponents and detractors alike have turned that phrase into a question. “Wait, wasn’t bitcoin supposed to solve this?” After all, cryptocurrency was invented explicitly to counter Wall Street’s opaque and overleveraged practices. The original Bitcoin whitepaper proposed a system that would end the reliance on trusted financial institutions, reduce fraud and protect consumers. At the moment, this couldn’t feel more ironic. But not having to trust anyone is a seductive promise! According to Gallup, trust in government, media, banks and beyond has been in a steady decline for decades, but really, all you need to do is log on to Twitter this week and check out the chaos to see that society has a trust problem. It is little wonder that blockchains with their vows to obviate the need for trust have captured the imagination of many. And to their credit, I think blockchains and their “decentralised finance” (DeFi) applications have actually delivered on this promise. Individuals can custody their own crypto assets, audit the ledger of transactions by themselves, and even participate as keepers and overseers of the whole system. Millions of people now only need to rely on code. These cryptocurrency users might have lost sleep this week as they watched the value of their assets plummet, but at least they weren’t worried about whether they’d ever get access to their funds again, as they have with centralised crypto exchanges like FTX. While FTX’s customers scrambled and failed to withdraw their funds, users of major decentralised finance products like Uniswap, Compound, and Aave had continuous access to their assets and benefited from orderly and transparent processing of their trades, transactions, and, yes, liquidations. For the users who hold their own coins and only trade on decentralised finance platforms, crypto came through. It turns out that blockchains can mitigate the risks posed by intermediaries! Unfortunately, not all crypto holders have taken advantage of these properties. That’s because there are major trade-offs. In order for crypto users to gain the benefits of blockchains, they must use new and clunky products that carry their own risks. The stakes are high if they make any mistakes, and they will only have themselves to blame. The man who famously threw away hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin in a garbage dump was “acting as his own bank”. As he demonstrates for us, there’s a major drawback to being your own bank. You have no recourse, no customer support, and no one to sue if you lose from your own negligence. DeFi users also take on the risks inherent to an anarcho-utopia (or dystopia?) where code is law. If a user makes a typo in the address to which they are sending their assets, there is no way to undo that. Similarly, if a hacker finds a bug in the code of a DeFi product and extracts user funds, the victims will have little protection. It is like the ultimate “finders keepers.” The technology is still in a state where these types of hacks happen all the time. For many users, it is not worth the inconvenience and the risk to gain the benefits of “trustless” systems like those of DeFi. Users who do not want or need to hold their own crypto can do it the old fashioned Wall Street way: they can trust a custodian. Custodial exchanges not only enable crypto users to cash in and out of coins and tokens, they also hold on to users’ assets as deposits. Of course users who hold and trade on exchanges are not really using crypto. They aren’t deriving any of the features crypto was designed to offer, like self-custody and censorship-resistance and transparency. They are just holding or speculating on whether “number go up” or “number go down”. Still, it’s fair to say that millions of users benefit from the convenience of holding their assets on these exchanges. Today it turned out that at least a million of those users — namely the ones who used FTX — would have been better off if they had taken advantage of crypto’s value proposition and held on to their funds themselves. And the grim reality is that despite bitcoin and other blockchain products offering alternatives, as of today, the cryptocurrency market has created more intermediaries than it has eliminated. For the last several years, no one has really cared about the genuine utility that may be found in crypto. With global floods of easy money pouring into asset classes of all kinds, and pushing people further out the risk spectrum, entrepreneurs, developers, and investors found themselves incentivised to play into the building of a large speculative bubble as opposed to delivering durable value. Too much of the time, energy, money, and attention that has gone into crypto over the past few years has gone toward building gambling markets around magic beans — instead of creating products taking advantage of the openness, transparency, and autonomy that the tech offers. FTX and its violation of user trust serve as the starkest reminder the industry could ask for in returning it to its original vision. The demise of FTX feels like the end of crypto at the moment, but it may become the catalyst to drive the industry to the areas where cryptocurrencies and blockchains can solve real problems. Already, many more custodial exchanges have announced that they will take advantage of the transparent nature of blockchains to provide the public with a cryptographic “proof of reserves”. This is a great example of leveraging the technology for its true utility: improving accountability. It feels optimistic in this hour of shame and darkness, but one can hope that crypto might actually deliver on a more open and transparent system so that in a decade we will look back and be able to say: bitcoin solved this.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jill Gunter","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-11-15","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/0c2a55b6-d34c-4685-8a8d-3c9628f1f185","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fe60a6f46-1868-4bd6-aa90-1610f6bc0121.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"FTX balance sheet, revealed","INTRO":"“Hidden poorly internally labled ‘fiat@’ account . . .”","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The Financial Times has seen a copy of an FTX balance sheet dated to Thursday, November 10, which shows the bankrupt crypto exchange had only $900mn of assets it could easily sell, despite having $9bn of liabilities.

In the case of that grab bag of magic beans shitcoins crypto “assets” (for want of a better term) you’ve assembled, that might involve moving them away from somewhere vulnerable to hacking. In doing so, you might make some unconventional decisions! Occasional Alphaville contributor Dan Davies has a theory on where this might leave you: Or actually they\u0027ve shifted it to a cold wallet, and there\u0027s someone in the Bahamas who is nervous about the fact they have no insurance for the $5bn flash drive in their hotel safe We’re sure this will produce hilarity when details eventually emerge (things are unfolding, etc), and we want to stress that a lot is unknown at the moment. But this did provide us with a neat excuse to do some wallet inspecting. (Buried lede begins.) Earlier this month, we revealed FTX’s shoddy balance sheet. This showed that it was roughly $8bn short of its liabilities and its assets were mostly chaff. We also shared their extremely confident “term sheet”. (Side note: FTX management tracks down $1.24bn in cash holdings) But there’s more! Moderately less excitingly, other documents extracted from FTX’s data room included a list of all the hot (ie internet-connected) wallets held by FTX US. The data were held in an Excel file, which according to its metadata was initially created by Gary Wang, FTX’s chief technical officer and co-founder. The file version we have was last modified on November 10th at 13:39:36. Here is the first sheet (as obtained, with the exception that FTAV has sorted the values by size, and added asset/liability totals at the bottom): These aren’t overly exciting on a surface level. As you might expect, FTX US’s hot wallet tokens assets matched its customer liabilities. Meanwhile, it was about $13mn short of its liabilities across a range of currencies (which feels small, relatively speaking). (It’s worth a quick reminder about what FTX offered, which was at least partially a wrapper service to allow normies to do crypto trading through derivatives without really getting their hands dirty.) More interestingly, the document also includes a list of all of FTX US’s hot wallet addresses at the time it was created. These addresses are perhaps best thought of as being like individual current accounts, with each one sending or receiving crypto within the bounds of its blockchain protocol. Here are the top few rows: All in all, there are 76 unique (in terms of either wallet name or coin held) entries in this sheet, and a further 47 across further sheets (there are some entries that appear to be duplicates). Here, for example, are FTX US’s various hot wallets containing bitcoin: Working through desperate, blind groping systemically, FTAV naturally went straight to the top, following the money from FTX US’s biggest BTC address — row 12 above. This address is catchily hashed as 36mSujwwRR4LM5m2MtsjimuKzJRb1FehW4. At the time it was added to the sheet, it contained 977.8218867 bitcoin, worth about $15.9mn at the time. We’re gonna call it a completely random name as it is basically unimportant. 🥁 Hello, Suman! Let’s learn about you. Suman’s address hash is all we need. Thanks to the magic of the blockchain, transparency is easy! Per Blockchain.com, Suman has handled two transactions in its life: — At 11:48 on November 10th, it received 978.02192791 BTC from address 3Fb79abn2MKhyYdSHXhFmDFdwDDti6fhP9, which we’ll call Naseem. — At 12:16 the same day, it sent 977.82188672 BTC to 12 addresses, incurring a small fee. — The biggest share by far (976.99792909 BTC) went to bc1qj2lwyjey8vl85stky7fhfvs572nv8akclkudxn, which we’ll call Zheng. So, big chunk of money goes from Naseem to Suman, sits with Suman for less than half an hour, then mainly goes off to Zheng. All we’ve learned at this point is that the address listed in Wang’s wallet document was incorrect — Suman had in fact been emptied about an hour before the version we obtained was made. FTAV initially tried to work Naseemwards, aka backwards through time. Going back through dozens of addresses, it was a similar story: a large block of BTC landed, remained in the address for a very short period, and then moved on. Naseem held the BTC for about an hour . .. . . . the account before him had it for about the same . .. . . . and so on. Sometimes, the movement included several small payments, but often it was only split two ways: the big chunk, and what appears to have been a small fee. Frequently, this fee was of 0.2 BTC, and went to address 1BejpJzSYnydbvbpar1qwrjjMLuQY1c5DF. We’ll call this address Jo. Jo frequently participates in big block transactions to bc1qm34lsc65zpw79lxes69zkqmk6ee3ewf0j77s3h, which is a big (like, $1.5bn of BTC) hot wallet that may be controlled by Binance. So, it looks like FTX US was moving its money frequently, though not with any immediately discernible pattern and sometimes seemingly with little clear purpose, and in the process possibly leaking money to Binance through handling fees. It’s not clear how far we’d have to go back to find the end of this pattern (if you know a good way to do so, please let us know!) Still, this is weird, right? Giving up, and cursing ourselves for having never learned to code, we headed Zhengwards (ie forward in time). Again, similar quick movements, with dozens in a row. In a couple of instances, bigger blocks came off and went to 17QyR2ixNj1AgpD5ZuXubvSJ3gPPQVcsvp, aka Ayolede. Ayolede appears to be some kind of intermediary address — more than $3bn of BTC has flown through her, though she was empty at time of pixel. She has previously been featured by Whale Alert, a site which tracks big crypto transfers. But the biggest part of the Suman block kept going, moving through dozens and dozens of transactions. Until, suddenly, it stopped. At 22:03 on November 11, address 38ijhiFYiBWKo2p48K78Gmpx5nspUQnqAw (Merlyn) transferred 736.20098821 BTC of the 736.21102453 BTC it had received ten minutes earlier to bc1q8umytnw6dh6f909c9r53ae4n08uqmtyw88v0ge (Jessy). Jessy then chilled for about six hours, before sending all they had to 325gSHHe7UGvzEc9kGx43VqPboXUVwa26i, which behindthename.com has called Wisdom, at 4:38am on November 12 — about fourteen hours after FTX Group (including FTX US) declared bankruptcy. Let’s end with some Wisdom. Wisdom contains, at time of pixel, 3871.694 BTC, which was worth, at time of pixel, about $62.6mn. We can assume that FTX wants Wisdom to have this money. After all, FTX claimed to control Suman, a link in the link in the chain that led to Wisdom. Wisdom has already gathered a bit of attention online (this roughly feels like in Monty Python and the Holy Grail when they finally discover the grail castle only to find the French are already there). ZachXBT (an “on-chain sleuth” who is likely much better at this than us) reckons this address is controlled by “white hat” (aka non-evil) hackers. Whitehat 0xd8019a114e86ad41d71a3eeb6620b19dd166a969 0x97f991971a37D4Ca58064e6a98FC563F03A71E5c 6b4aypBhH337qSzzkbeoHWzTLt4DjG2aG8GkrrTQJfQA TYoZM8LALfUqm4EXzB7oKmwqusWtXTBhY6 325gSHHe7UGvzEc9kGx43VqPboXUVwa26i \u003efunds withdrawn later on \u003efunded via CEX \u003efunds sent to multisig Much to consider. So what did we learn? — blockchains are hard — the money is resting We can hypothesise that, with unlimited time and resources OR simply learning to code, following other Sumans might lead us to further Wisdoms. But exactly what Wisdom is, and how many other addresses like that exist, could be one of the many revelations of the coming weeks. Could Wisdom be, as floated thousands of words ago, on a cold-storage USB drive being held by some mid-ranking FTX staffer who has been locked in their Bahamas flat eating nothing but takeaway for two weeks? Only time, and lawyers, may tell. For those people who deposited with FTX US, they’ll be hoping Wisdom is on their side.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Louis Ashworth","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-11-24","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f5cf03d7-4227-4721-8878-79c4cabef80c","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fb0e783a6-9e67-4252-82d0-b4f37a3b455c.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Farewell SBFweet prince","INTRO":"FTX surrenders to Binance in crypto’s most hostile takeover","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Peace in our time! 1) Hey all: I have a few announcements to make. Things have come full circle, and https://t.co/DWPOotRHcX’s first, and last, investors are the same: we have come to an agreement on a strategic transaction with Binance for https://t.co/DWPOotRHcX (pending DD etc.). The cold war gripping cryptoland has suddenly turned very hot. Binance has stepped in to non-bindingly rescue rival cryptocurrency superpower FTX from a liquidity crunch it was widely considered to have helped create. This afternoon, FTX asked for our help. There is a significant liquidity crunch. To protect users, we signed a non-binding LOI, intending to fully acquire https://t.co/BGtFlCmLXB and help cover the liquidity crunch. We will be conducting a full DD in the coming days. It’s a reverse ferret from SBF, who was talking on Monday about how “a competitor is trying to go after us with false rumors”. All friends now though. Apparently. 5) I know that there have been rumors in media of conflict between our two exchanges, however Binance has shown time and again that they are committed to a more decentralized global economy while working to improve industry relations with regulators. We are in the best of hands. The trigger to surrender was FTX’s native token FTT slumping to new lows. TheBlock reported around 9am EST that FTX hadn’t done any on-chain withdrawals on Ethereum, Solana or Tron blockchains since 6:37am EST: Crypto exchange FTX, which is currently fighting a battle with rival Binance, seems to have stopped processing clients’ requests for withdrawals, according to on-chain data. The last outgoing transaction from FTX on the Ethereum blockchain took place at 6:37 a.m. ET, more than two hours ago, data from Etherscan show. It’s a similar story on the Tron and Solana blockchains as well, on-chain data show. Skirmishes had begun over the weekend, when Binance said it would dump its FTT tokens in response to “recent revelations”. This appeared to refer to claims about the fragility of Alameda Research, the FTX-linked trading firm, due to its reliance to FTT and other third-tier tokens. Caroline Ellison, chief executive of Alameda, had suggested on Twitter that it could buy Binance’s FTT holdings at $22 per coin. Binance’s Changpeng “CZ” Zhao publicly rejected the proposal by making passing reference to Luna, the algo-stablecoin that collapsed spectacularly in June. I didn\u0027t say that. It was a question, not a commitment. I think we will stay in the free market. We still hold LUNA (now LUNC) today. 😂 FTX\u0027s only option left was direct intervention to support its sort-of currency and discourage shouts of fire within its very crowded theatre. Support never arrived, however, and FTT slumped below $15. The full story’s over on the FT mainsite. SBF and FTX’s official Twitter accounts were uncharacteristically quiet through the drama. But CZ did find time to like this tweet. Only $BNB is surviving the sea of red today. CZ is showing everyone who’s boss. pic.twitter.com/P84LGWV28u Note: this post has been substantially revised post publication in an attempt to keep pace with breaking news","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-11-08","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/62d8e718-8b55-40df-8599-eeda13c59d3b","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F32525e7c-0833-4b5f-8acc-738420895cd6.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Binance blockchain suffers $570mn hack","INTRO":"World’s largest crypto exchange targeted in security breach","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Hackers have stolen around $570mn in tokens from Binance, in a rare blow to the world’s biggest crypto exchange and another dent to the troubled digital assets industry struggling to regain trust after a collapse in prices. Binance initially estimated on Friday that tokens worth about $100mn to $110mn had been taken, pausing the operation of the affected blockchain for approximately eight hours. However, the exchange later disclosed that the hacker had taken around two million of the cryptocurrency BNB, Binance’s own digital token, with a value of around $284 each. The hack targeted BSC Token Hub, a bridge between two Binance systems. It comes at a time when digital assets are trying to recover from a credit crisis that wiped nearly two-thirds off the value of its most high-profile tokens such as bitcoin. Industry data have also indicated that theft from projects is soaring this year. Cyber criminals had taken nearly $2bn this year to the end of July, nearly double the total in the first seven months of last year, according to data from Chainalysis. High-profile thefts included $600mn from the blockchain behind popular crypto-gaming platform Axie Infinity. Many hacks have been traced to state-sponsored actors in North Korea. Binance’s position as the world’s largest crypto exchange means Friday’s exploit represents a significant blow to the digital assets industry. In a series of social media posts Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s founder and chief executive, told users: “The issue is contained now. Your funds are safe. We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide further updates accordingly.” Binance asked the affected network’s validators, who secure the system, to pause their work. The funds were taken from BSC Token Hub, a bridge that allows customers to transfer tokens tied to one chain to another. The hack exploited a weakness that created extra BNB tokens on the network, according to Zhao. Many of the world’s most widely used blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum, run on separate technologies or use different tokens. That means investors and developers cannot easily move their tokens to a different blockchain to use or trade them elsewhere. Binance’s security team and other crypto network operators have steadily been freezing the stolen assets. By Friday afternoon a Binance spokesperson said there was around $100mn of unrecovered funds. Binance Smart Chain allows the world’s largest crypto exchange to open its doors to let developers build applications that use smart contracts, based on Binance’s own token. Binance launched the new chain in September 2020, at a time when the crypto industry was seeing widespread interest in decentralised finance projects.

Today, we’re taking stock of Solana, a blockchain touted as the next Big Thing. What a difference a year makes. Last October the token that represented the Solana blockchain was well on its way to an all-time high of nearly $250. I was about to interview Anatoly Yakovenko, one of its co-founders, at a Solana conference in Lisbon intended to showcase all of its wonderful advances and potential. I bumped into an old friend attending the conference who said Solana had “made a pretty meaningful difference to [his] year, financially”. The hype was infectious. A few months later, the sober Bank of America said Solana “could become the Visa of the digital asset ecosystem”. Now, Solana’s native token trades at just $33. The applause from the indulgent audience at the conference is just a memory. This week brought a reminder of why, when the blockchain suffered an outage lasting several hours. The root cause was a malfunctioning node — the pillars that hold up the blockchain — that caused duplications on the network. It was resolved by effectively . . . *checks notes* . . . turning off the blockchain and turning it on again. Anyone who was running projects on Solana could not process any of their transactions while the network was down. Obviously, this is pretty embarrassing for a network that has touted itself as the answer to a problem that would allow blockchain technologies to rival the scale and reliability that traditional financial institutions demonstrate every day. Bitcoin is designed to process blocks every 10 minutes or so. Costs tend to rise sharply when lots of people want to use them. That makes blockchains useless for mass take-up by consumers. Solana promised it could handle 50,000 trades per second, a scale that could rival credit card operator Visa or the Nasdaq stock exchange while still keeping the costs at a fraction of a cent. But reliability issues on Solana are becoming something of a habit. Thousands of crypto accounts linked to it were drained in August in an apparent hack. According to data from CryptoCompare, Solana has been down for 6,422 minutes this year, equivalent to more than four days. Admittedly, the bulk of that time is down to an outage in January but it has been out for six hours this month already. By contrast, Nasdaq has been up for more than 99.9 per cent of the time this year. After last week’s outage, Solana users vented on social media with a mix of anger and resignation. “As usual”, “shut down the chain completely” and “no need to post anything. We are aware that Solana goes offline every few weeks.” Solana’s supposed scalability has attracted traditional finance. One of Wall Street’s more eye-catching forays into crypto is Pyth, which collects and distributes data on stock, conventional currency, crypto and commodity deals for decentralised trading. The data have been supplied by high-frequency traders such as Jump Trading and DRW Cumberland and exchanges including IEX and LMAX. Pyth is built on Solana. Just this week Chicago derivatives exchange Cboe Global Markets agreed to supply data to Pyth. Helpful as this may be, it only goes to show how far Solana is from being “the Visa of crypto”. Big financial institutions are happy to use it as a live testing ground for their own crypto ambitions; it’s low-risk but not an immediate contributor or threat to revenues. But if a new-ish technology such as blockchain is going to supplant existing financial systems, it has to offer something better than what has gone before. What’s your take on Solana? Will it ever take off, or is the game over? Email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com. The Securities and Exchange Commission continues its march against crypto, settling charges with celebrity Kim Kardashian for promoting an “ethereum max” token. The social media influencer and celebrity A-lister agreed to pay $1.3mn in penalty fees but didn’t admit or deny the SEC’s findings. Crypto’s great resignation continues. Celsius Network’s co-founder Daniel Leon has stepped down. This week my colleague Kadhim Shubber revealed that former Celsius head Alex Mashinsky took $10mn out of the bankrupt lender before it froze customer accounts. Binance became the latest in a very, very long line of crypto hack victims this week. Early reports indicate the exploit caused between $100mn and $110mn worth of losses. Read our story here. Europe has tightened existing crypto prohibitions against Russia in the wake of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Now all crypto asset wallets, accounts and custody services irrespective of the amount held will be banned. The FBI has issued a warning against “pig butchering”. It’s not a form of animal cruelty but usually involves scammers making contact on social media or dating applications, gaining their trust before persuading victims to make deposits into fraudulent crypto schemes. In recent weeks Terraform Labs chief Do Kwon has been cheerfully asserting on social media that he isn’t hiding (but without revealing his whereabouts) and even suggests he goes for walks, seemingly without a worry. This week his tone changed when asked about a report that South Korea had frozen almost $40mn of his crypto assets. He claimed the story was a “falsehood” and an example of why crypto was popular in countries that weaponised state institutions against their own people. “Reap what you sow — revolutions start from within.” The USDC stablecoin, run by Circle, has been losing market capitalisation in the past two months, according to data from CryptoCompare. It is now at $46bn compared with $55bn in July. The market cap of Tether’s USDT and Binance’s BUSD, the industry’s other two big stablecoin players, have both risen in the same period. An important macro point: dollar interest rates today are higher than they have ever been in the era of crypto. US Treasuries are offering about 4 to 5 per cent and stablecoins nothing. In a post-crypto-crash crypto-crash world, fiat may just be the more compelling option.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Scott Chipolina","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-10-07","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/2d0e558e-2323-410b-a7d9-a3ecd24dd062","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F40722d68-bb74-4b7d-8b74-13ca6aa001d8.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Moody’s blockchain blind spot","INTRO":"Reports of the technology’s adoption are greatly exaggerated","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Eighty one of the world’s 100 biggest publicly traded companies by market cap have “adopted blockchain in their business model,” rating agency Moody’s exclaimed last week. A (very) quick check of the relevant data suggests the figure is a tad overblown. Per Moody’s: Many companies are testing and adopting blockchain technology solutions for their business. For example, financial institutions are developing blockchain infrastructures to transfer funds among subsidiaries at lower costs, higher speed and lower overhead to keep track of money inflow by means of an electronic distributed ledger. Manufacturing firms are employing blockchain to improve the traceability of goods and commodities across the whole supply chain. As of September 2021, 81 of the top 100 publicly traded companies had adopted blockchain within their business model . . .  It’s unclear whether Moody’s analysts read the press release from which the figure was taken all the way to the bottom: the claim becomes more and more diluted the further one scrolls. The data came from wide-eyed blockchain analysis company Blockdata (tagline: “Accelerating. Blockchain. Adoption”). First, its list of 81 companies “includes those who are in a research phase, meaning they are exploring opportunities and deciding on which technologies they could use for their blockchain initiatives”. “If we remove the research phase,” the post continues, “we find that there are still an impressive 65 companies who are actively developing blockchain solutions.” The claim is watered down even more in a separate post. It turns out only 44 of the top 100 companies have “actively pursued blockchain strategies” in the past year. Just five of those 44 companies are “financials”. Tortured English aside, Moody’s assertion that “we are witnessing the rapid adoption of financial institutions developing blockchain infrastructure to increase the speed and efficiency of fund transfers” simply does not stand up.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"George Steer","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-10-10","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/bed8eb61-a173-48c9-b7ce-0c02ca930652","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fcacd35a6-a0c4-46af-8de3-79daa530267b.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Asia’s crypto craze spurs swath of fund launches","INTRO":"ETFs and mutual funds have hit the market despite regulatory concerns about retail access","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools The crypto craze among Asian investors is spurring asset managers in the region to seize opportunities to woo them over with their products despite tightening regulation, Cerulli Associates notes in a new report. A number of cryptocurrency and blockchain-focused funds that invest in the broader universe without directly investing in cryptocurrency have been rolled out this past year in Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea, while Australia has seen the region’s first exchange traded funds with direct exposure to bitcoin and ether. “For investors, the growing number of mutual funds and ETFs coming to market help to widen product choices or even legitimise crypto investing by providing arguably safer routes to accessing this asset class, compared to direct crypto investing,” said Ken Yap, Singapore-based managing director for Asia at Cerulli. “Crypto funds offer an important asset-gathering opportunity for managers,” Yap added. This article was previously published by Ignites Asia, a title owned by the FT Group. Regional regulators have been cracking down on the asset class, however, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore curtailing retail access to crypto in August and Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission overhauling advertising rules for digital asset companies. South Korea also does not currently permit local players to tap services from cryptocurrency exchanges. This environment of increasing regulatory scrutiny and market volatility, however, would be “key selling points” for asset managers in providing crypto-related funds, rather than products that have direct exposure to the asset class, said Yap. The growing regulation has not stopped Asian managers from seeking opportunities in this space, with a number of Korean firms taking steps to grow their digital asset capabilities. In January, Korea’s Mirae Asset Financial Group announced plans to roll out a digital assets business that would initially target custody services for cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens and eventually create loans and funds tied to digital assets, the Korea Economic Daily reported, citing industry sources. That push came amid rising demand for such services. KB Asset Management, South Korea’s largest bank, announced in February that it had created a digital asset management preparatory committee to explore the development of digital assets and artificial intelligence funds. KB AM rolled out the KB Global Digital Chain Economy fund, the first strategy in the country that focuses on investments in blockchain technology companies, in September last year. Generation Z and millennials were fuelling the interest in crypto in South Korea, said Cerulli. Singapore is also seeing strong interest among young investors, with Cerulli citing a survey from last year that found 51 per cent of those aged 25 to 44 were more willing to invest in crypto, while only 36 per cent of those aged 45 and over showed the same interest. At the start of the year, BNY Mellon Investment Management was preparing to launch Singapore’s first retail-oriented fund that invests in the blockchain universe, amid growing interest in crypto assets and related technology among local investors. Thailand and Vietnam have also emerged as hotbeds for retail cryptocurrency investments in south-east Asia, even in the face of a global market rout and tightened regulations imposed on the highly volatile sector. Thailand recorded $135.9bn in crypto value transacted in the 12 months to June 2022, while Vietnam had $112.6bn, according to a report published by blockchain data platform Chainalysis on September 21. Crypto has also drawn interest from high-net-worth individuals, with Cerulli reporting that some private banks and family offices in both Singapore and Hong Kong are “seeing interest in direct crypto investing or crypto ETFs”. There is demand from distributors as well, with Cerulli’s survey indicating that they want asset managers to “develop niche product ideas that offer long-term opportunities, including technology themes such as blockchain and crypto”. ETFs are seen as another way to give even more retail investors access to crypto. Australia has emerged as a regional leader in the crypto ETF space. Australia’s first three cryptocurrency ETFs started trading in May. The Cosmos Purpose Bitcoin Access, 21Shares Bitcoin ETP and 21Shares Ethereum ETP ETFs went live on Australia’s alternative exchange, formerly known as Chi-X Australia, that month. In June, the Hong Kong arm of South Korea’s Samsung Asset Management rolled out what it called the first-ever global blockchain-related ETF in Asia.

You are likely to have been told to “have fun staying poor” as you’re “never gonna make it”; your criticisms have probably been dismissed as mere “FUD” (fear, uncertainty and doubt); and you may well have been informed that you are in fact nothing more than a “salty no-coiner”. But there is another slightly more sophisticated flavour of counter-criticism finding its way into my inbox with increasing regularity these days. It usually starts with something designed to appease — some kind of agreement that crypto is immoral, a scam, or some version of a Ponzi scheme. But then it quickly changes course, to explain that none of this applies to bitcoin. Bitcoin, the bitcoiners tell me, is not crypto. And, you understand, crypto bad, bitcoin good. Very very good. “Bitcoin is a lifeline for so many people around the world,” one altruistic bitcoin holder said to me recently. “Please stop lumping it in with crypto, which is morally reprehensible.” Recommended I recently suggested that one way of practising the art of “intellectual humility” is to “steelman” your opponents’ position — that is, rather than finding their weakest points and arguing against those, you present the strongest version of their argument possible. And so I’m going to try to apply this technique here, before explaining why I believe they are wrong. Why do the “bitcoin maximalists” — the purists who argue that bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that has value — make this claim? They state that the organic way that bitcoin came into being cannot be replicated and that, while bitcoin can be copied, it will always have a first-mover advantage and thus cannot be unseated. They point out, too, that there was no market for bitcoin when it was invented, and so the network was maintained not for profit but by people who believed in the value of the system — unlike later coins, some of which were issued by big corporations. Bitcoin arose not as a way to make money, but out of a libertarian internet subculture that believed technology, specifically cryptography, was key to driving social and political change. Maximalists also say that bitcoin’s incentive mechanism, the energy-intensive “proof of work” mining process that rival Ethereum just last week moved away from, is the only way of ensuring a truly decentralised system. But while you can see why bitcoiners might be keen to distance themselves from the plethora of scams and failures that have occurred in cryptoland, their arguments don’t stand up. First, it doesn’t matter what bitcoin’s origins were — the people who push it now have the same financial incentives as those pushing any other crypto token. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, might have intended it to be used as money, but that does not make it so — it fulfils none of the necessary criteria, and instead operates in a pyramid-shaped structure that relies on constantly recruiting new members. Second, bitcoin is not in fact decentralised — not only do miners group together to form “mining pools” but wealth is also hugely concentrated. On Tuesday, MicroStrategy announced that it had bought another 301 bitcoins, meaning this company alone now holds almost 0.7 per cent of the entire supply. Third, a “first-mover advantage” does not always last. Other crypto tokens already have various features that bitcoin does not, and there has been renewed talk of a “flippening”, in which Ethereum’s value overtakes that of bitcoin due to the former’s switch to a less carbon-intensive form of mining. Finally, there is not even agreement on what bitcoin is. For the vast majority it is the digital coin also known as “BTC”, currently changing hands at around $19,000. But there are other versions that have split off, such as the one promoted by Craig Wright, the man who claims to be Satoshi and who says BTC is a scam. The real reason bitcoin maximalists want to separate bitcoin from the rest of crypto is to create the illusion of scarcity in a world where there is none. CoinMarketCap now lists more than 21,000 different crypto tokens, which bitcoin maximalists call “shitcoins”. Of course they do — if there is infinite supply, how can there be any value? This is still the core problem of crypto, and bitcoin cannot solve it. This is not to say that there aren’t some crypto projects and tokens that are better than others. But a spade, no matter how shiny, is still a spade. And bitcoin, I’m afraid, is still crypto. jemima.kelly@ft.com","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-09-22","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/7911af3b-938a-4437-8465-da874de58455","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F4749eb35-7e22-42b6-91df-83373880d40a.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ethereum’s merge: a Netscape moment for Web3?","INTRO":"Five issues that will determine the significance of the crypto world’s switch","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Has Web3 just had its Netscape moment? The launch of the first web browser in 1994 was a turning point for the internet. Now, if crypto enthusiasts are to be believed, the switch by the Ethereum blockchain to a new system for validating transactions — a move known as “the merge” — is an equally historic moment for what has become known as Web3. Moving away from its previous, energy-intensive validation mechanism puts Ethereum on a more sustainable long-term path. For the network that has become the main platform for blockchain-based applications like non-fungible tokens and decentralised finance, that is certainly significant. But nine years after Ethereum was launched, there is still a long way to go. Here are five issues that will help to determine whether or not the merge will one day be seen as a significant moment in the history of the internet. First, the new validation mechanism, known as proof of stake, doesn’t on its own do anything to solve one of Ethereum’s biggest problems: that it can handle only 15 transactions per second (tps), a bottleneck that has led to very high transaction fees. The merge at least clears the way for the network’s next big step, scheduled for the second half of next year. Called “sharding”, this would involve splitting the Ethereum database into 64 fragments. Since every computer on the network would no longer need to keep a record of every transaction, it would greatly increase overall capacity and speed. There are still big, unresolved technical questions about how this will work. Also, sharding will not be a complete solution. A 64-fold increase would lift the network’s capacity to nearly 1,000 tps — still some way off the 7,400 tps capacity of the Visa network. The promise of Web3 is to use blockchain technology to mediate every online interaction, meaning far greater capacity will be needed. Second, the merge brings with it a whole set of unknown risks. Essentially, a market currently worth $200bn is being shifted on to entirely new foundations, with new mechanisms and new roles for market intermediaries that haven’t been tested in real-world conditions. Rather than the risks, many market participants are likely to be more focused on the potential for higher returns. Under the new proof of stake system, holders lodge their ether as collateral to validate transactions in return for “staking rewards”. That has turned a previously unproductive asset into one that now offers a yield — something that many investors are likely to find attractive. But at this stage, it’s anyone’s guess whether the yield will compensate for the new risks — not to mention the huge volatility in the cryptocurrency itself. Third, the build-out of a broader layer of market infrastructure on top of Ethereum is still in its infancy. So-called layer-two networks, like Polygon and Optimism, act as “roll ups”, batching up many individual transactions themselves and lodging only a single entry back on the Ethereum blockchain. Along with sharding, Ethereum’s backers claim this might lift overall capacity to 100,000 tps. The companies that operate on top of Ethereum in this way could themselves become powerful new intermediaries in the blockchain world — something that runs counter to the ideal of decentralisation on which crypto is founded. This leads to the fourth point: as the broader Ethereum system evolves, its backers will have to ditch some of the crypto world’s ideological baggage in favour of a greater pragmatism. The challenge will be to work out which ideals can be compromised in the interests of a more workable system. Recommended The emergence of influential new intermediaries could also give governments a new point of leverage over the system. For instance, if large numbers of holders turn to crypto exchanges for help with staking, then those exchanges would play an important role in validating transactions. That could expose them to political pressure to block certain transactions in pursuit of financial sanctions. Fifth, and finally, improving the underlying blockchain infrastructure will do nothing to solve Web3’s biggest challenge: demonstrating why this technology is needed in the first place. The optimists claim that, with the merge completed and work well under way on solving Ethereum’s scaling challenges, effort will shift increasingly to building the consumer-friendly experiences needed to draw large numbers of users. That means devising things like crypto wallets and marketplaces for digital assets that are easier for ordinary mortals to use. It also means coming up with entirely new applications that could not have worked as well on the existing web. The Ethereum merge doesn’t provide any clues about what those uses might be. But, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, it at least shows that Web3 has got to the end of the beginning. richard.waters@ft.com The capacity of the Visa network has been updated to reflect the most recent figure available.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Richard Waters","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-09-15","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f56c48ef-b3ea-4bc4-afbb-2773253a3dd4","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Ffd85602b-f5a3-4f99-8a83-e438604467d2.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Hedge funds race to bet on outcome of Ethereum ‘Merge’","INTRO":"Laying wager on rise in ether price becomes ‘one of most crowded trades in crypto history’","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The looming switch of the Ethereum blockchain to a new, greener system has sparked a frenzy of trading by hedge funds racing to place bets ahead of one of the biggest events in the short history of cryptocurrencies. Traders have been scooping up options on ether tokens — the flagship crypto coin trading on Ethereum — betting on price volatility or protecting themselves against sudden sharp moves ahead of the “Merge”. The Merge has been a long-awaited event in the crypto industry and will change how new transactions are verified on the Ethereum blockchain. A clutch of traders are wagering the switch to a new system will slash the network’s energy consumption as much as 99 per cent, opening up ether tokens to mainstream investors who have until now been wary of a network with an energy usage roughly equivalent to that of Finland. “This has been one of the most crowded trades in crypto history,” said James West, chief executive of Globe Exchange, a crypto derivatives exchange. Many of the trades have been placed in the options market, where West said “a lot of smart money [is] buying”, with many expecting that a successful switch will push ether prices higher. The total number of outstanding option contracts on exchange Deribit, which accounts for 97 per cent of ether options open interest on exchanges, has risen from 1.2mn at the start of the year to more than 4.6mn by Wednesday. About 80 per cent of these contracts are call options — a bet on a higher price in which an investor has the ability to buy ether at a fixed price for a set period of time — while the remainder are puts, or bets on lower prices. It’s a sign of “massive bullish sentiment”, according to Deribit chief commercial officer Luuk Strijers. Some even believe the Merge could help ether supplant bitcoin as the world’s biggest cryptocurrency. The total value of bitcoin in circulation is $390bn, compared with less than $200bn for ether, according to the FT Wilshire Digital Assets Dashboard. “The mere anticipation of ether overtaking bitcoin” could become “self-fulfilling and unstoppable”, said Anders Kvamme Jensen, co-fund manager of the AKJ Digital Assets fund, who said funds he invests in are betting on the Merge using options. Some investors have, meanwhile, been constructing options trades to try to profit from potentially huge price volatility from the Merge, regardless of whether that price move is up or down, Strijers said. But such has been the industry hype around the Merge, other traders had set up strategies that bet the price of ether would rise sharply before the event but then sell off if the Merge happened. As a result, some bought shorter-term call options paying out if ether hit $2,500 and funded that by selling longer-dated calls paying out at $3,000, according to Ed Hindi, chief investment officer at hedge fund Tyr Capital, who acts as a market maker in crypto options. However, that trade has not played out as expected. While the price of ether has rallied from less than $1,000 in June to $1,600 this week, that is still some way short of where the shorter-term options would pay out. Fearing they could now be hit if ether rises sharply after the Merge and trigger the options they sold, traders have been racing to cover their positions, according to Hindi. Recommended The market has been “way too bullish” ahead of the Merge, and “way too bearish beyond the Merge”, he said. Many investors already holding ether have tried to protect themselves from a sell-off if the Merge does not pan out, for instance if it is delayed or there are technical problems, by also using futures contracts to bet that its price will decline. This type of trade, known as shorting, effectively protects them from price movements. According to Kaiko Research, the so-called funding rate, a measure of the direction of traders’ collective futures positions, in ether is at its lowest level in more than a year, averaging minus 0.6 per cent. That usually signals that investors are focused on going short. Traders are also hoping that this bet of holding ether while shorting the futures could allow them to pick up some extra tokens, while protecting them from market volatility. Investors who hold ether when the Merge occurs are entitled to tokens that are still based on the older transaction processing system, known as proof of work. While the Merge is set to move Ethereum to the more energy-efficient proof of stake model, some market participants who oppose the change will continue operating on the old system — something known as a “fork” — meaning those coins may hold some of their value. Jay Janer, founding partner of KPTL Arbitrage Management in the Cayman Islands, is running this trade because he believes trading the options has become too expensive. “If the fork occurs, we would get the proof of work token for free,” he said.

The upgrade, known in the industry as the “Merge”, which changes how new transactions are verified on the Ethereum blockchain, completed on early Thursday, said co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Ethereum powers large swaths of the Web3 world, which includes applications such as digital collectibles and decentralised finance systems. The milestone, which has been promised by developers for many years, was hailed as one of the most significant moments in crypto’s short history by fans, who planned “Merge parties” in cities around the world and followed live-streamed watch parties on social media. “This is the first step in Ethereum’s big journey towards being a very mature system. There are still steps left to go,” Buterin told developers. The Merge marked a high-stakes test for the crypto sector after the crash in token prices this spring wiped $2tn off the value of digital assets and shook faith in the market. Changing the architecture that underpins the $200bn ether cryptocurrency, the flagship token on the Ethereum blockchain, and tens of billions more of related assets and applications is fraught with risks from technical hiccups to squabbles among participants in the decentralised network, even after the Merge was completed. Its backers expect a successful Merge will boost confidence in Ethereum, launched in 2015 by Russian-Canadian programmer Buterin, and the multitude of tokens and projects that run on its blockchain, as well as blunt criticism over its energy consumption. However, Ethereum developers said they would need to monitor the network over the coming hours and days to ensure the upgrade is working smoothly. “It is a complicated task,” said Edouard Hindi, chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund Tyr Capital. “One forgotten fine tune . . . could lead to a lot of volatility, and the market is in a panicky mood.” The Merge represents just one step in a plan sketched out by Ethereum developers to overcome limits on the network’s capacity, which are seen as a major hurdle to achieving mainstream adoption of decentralised finance. “[The Merge] solves one issue but it does not solve a heck of a lot of other issues,” said Lars Seier Christensen, co-founder of Saxo Bank who now runs a blockchain project called Concordium. Ethereum, like bitcoin, has so far relied on network participants solving complex maths problems to validate new blocks, a process called proof of work. Ethereum’s energy consumption was similar to that of Finland. The Merge refers to the moment when the existing Ethereum blockchain linked with a new network where transactions are validated by a group of individuals and corporations that have staked their own tokens as collateral for the security of the network, a system called proof of stake. Critical intelligence on the digital asset industry. Explore the FT’s coverage here. The Ethereum Foundation estimates that replacing proof of work will cut the blockchain’s energy consumption by about 99.95 per cent. It will also eliminate the need for Ethereum miners, companies that make money from validating new blocks via proof of work. Anticipation of the Merge has helped boost the price of ether, which has risen about 75 per cent from its low point in June. The token also gained ground against bitcoin, which has recovered just 15 per cent over the same period. Ether declined 5.9 per cent to $1,501 after the Merge late on Thursday. However, the years-long effort to complete the upgrade underscored the difficulty of making improvements to the Ethereum blockchain. Transactions on the network are still hampered by slow speed and high costs, which critics have said limits the system’s ability to grow. Hindi said the Merge was “just one step in the right direction. There are three or four more steps. It is a two- or three-year process. It’s a big, big plan that is being rolled out and we will have a lot of surprises on the way, good and bad ones.” Click here to visit Digital Assets dashboard","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Joshua Oliver","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-09-15","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/e7c2c6f3-50ac-4fdf-b037-050ab40a4a86","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F10ac15dc-c739-4316-8372-9888acd0d170.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ethereum: environmentally friendly ‘Merge’ update is just the first step","INTRO":"Ether tokens have jumped nearly 50% from their lows but the crypto winter has not broken","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ethereum’s upgrade was years in the making. The blockchain platform has successfully switched from approving transactions via maths problems to crypto holdings, a change known as the Merge. The new “proof of stake” model should reduce energy use by more than 99 per cent. Hailed as a make or break moment for crypto, the Merge has helped to lift ether tokens nearly 50 per cent from their June low point. But prices remain well below last year’s high point. The crypto winter has not broken. Ethereum’s Ether is the second best known digital token after bitcoin. Merging the main network with an ethereum network that already uses proof-of-stake transactions could help to overhaul crypto’s reputation as an environmental disaster. But while the Merge was technically difficult it has not changed much for most ether holders. Energy requirements for the blockchain have been cut but fees have not fallen. Transaction times have not improved. It is possible that the switch to proof of stake will encourage more decentralised-finance applications to run on the ethereum blockchain. Then again, they may wait for future updates designed to expand capacity. Investors remain more fixated on inflation and removing risk from their portfolios. The change could also give more power to validators with a large pool of ether they can put to work, earning a return for “staking” their tokens. Just as proof of work mining benefited groups with access to major computer power, proof of stake will benefit those with an existing haul of tokens. The minimum required stake is 32 ether — equal to just under $48,000. There are risks. Tokens may be confiscated if transactions are invalid and stakes cannot be withdrawn until the next software change, which could be a year away.

If there is one thing the crypto community has in good supply, it’s promises. In the relatively short history of digital assets — starting with bitcoin in 2009 — evangelists have trailed a list of innovations that, they say, could solve inflation, revolutionise business, or provide a financial lifeline to people living under authoritarian regimes around the world. In response, critics of the largely unregulated industry have highlighted its links to criminal activity and huge carbon footprint, not to mention the financial ruin it has brought to many vulnerable people — the same ones industry representatives often claim they want to help. The faithful now have an opportunity to prove their critics wrong. On the horizon is arguably crypto’s most ambitious project yet, dubbed “the Merge”. The term describes the moment when the Ethereum blockchain will merge with a system called the Beacon Chain. Ethereum is the most popular platform for parts of the Web3 — or “new internet” —world that have tried to enter the mainstream, such as NFTs and decentralised finance. When the Merge happens, probably sometime this week, the stage will be set for innovations intended to address some of the harshest attacks on the industry. These are high stakes for a project that most people outside the crypto world have never heard of — and that many who have only vaguely understand. If the fusion goes off without a hitch, Ethereum will shift from a “proof-of-work” system to one known as “proof of stake”. Proof-of-work systems such as the bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are kept secure by powerful computers. These “nodes” race against each other 24/7 to solve complex mathematical calculations in order to validate each new block of transactions added to the chain. The system defends against individual nodes being able to corrupt the blockchain, but it also demands an immense amount of energy to run. That translates to a carbon footprint too big for environmentalists and crypto-sceptics to stomach. By contrast, in a proof-of-stake system such as the one Ethereum is moving to, the blockchain doesn’t need powerful computers for its security. Instead, individuals or companies act as the validators, staking their own ether tokens (the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain) as collateral against bad behaviour. They are incentivised to do so by rewards, including the chance to earn fresh ether. You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser. Some see the Merge as a historic moment that will take crypto mainstream by drastically reducing the industry’s levels of energy consumption — the Ethereum blockchain’s annual level is currently estimated to be as high as that of Finland. “This is a pretty critical step for the infrastructure to actually scale, in order for Ethereum to become what it can become — a 24/7, global permissionless capital market,” says Avichal Garg, partner at early stage venture firm Electric Capital. Noam Hurwitz, a software engineer at Web3 development platform Alchemy, describes it as “the biggest milestone to date of proof [the developers] can execute on their road map”. But to others, the shift represents a betrayal of the blockchain’s fundamental characteristics — to be an open, transparent and decentralised network, self-policing by design and controlled by no group of individuals. The Merge will not revolutionise the whole Web3 world, and it will not directly solve many of the biggest problems facing the Ethereum blockchain, such as high transaction fees and slow transaction speeds. Still, after years of talk, a successful Merge at least sets the scene for future innovation, particularly by allowing the Ethereum blockchain to scale and handle heavier workloads. This is good news for the applications that build their businesses on the blockchain, such as the NFT marketplace OpenSea, or decentralised crypto exchanges like Uniswap. Charles Storry, head of growth at crypto index platform Phuture, who works in the niche worlds of decentralised finance and Web3 tech, is full of optimism. It “is massive for Ethereum and the wider crypto community, because it unlocks new applications which wouldn’t be possible in the existing system, increases scalability and radically improves Ethereum energy efficiency,” he says. “We’re just getting started.” Despite the hype, whether the Merge really heralds the mainstreaming of crypto projects is a matter of serious doubt. This year’s turmoil in crypto markets has tainted the mood: a crash in coin prices wiped about $2tn off the total value of cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based ventures have been caught in its wake. Some of the biggest companies in the sector have declared bankruptcy this summer, including hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and lending platform Celsius. Tumbling valuations in the tech world have also threatened to reach deeper into the crypto and fintech sectors. Ethereum is not the only blockchain in town. Others — such as the bitcoin blockchain — will still use proof-of-work systems after the Merge. According to estimates by Cambridge university, the bitcoin blockchain consumes so much energy that if it were a country, it would rank in the world’s top 35 by energy consumption, surpassing Belgium and Finland. So why does the Merge matter if other blockchains are still guzzling energy and harming the environment? Alex de Vries, founder of the website Digiconomist, claims the Merge could shed approximately 99 per cent of Ethereum’s current energy consumption. Even if bitcoin’s dirty climate record is set to continue, de Vries argues any progress towards greening the industry is better than none: “You can’t say we have cleaned up cryptocurrency when the biggest polluter is still out there . . . but I would say this is a massive step forward at the very least . . . the outside world also needs to see that this is possible.” Many of the “second layer” projects that are built on the Ethereum blockchain (such as NFTs and decentralised finance platforms) will also be affected. “It makes Ethereum greener, which is important because that has actually been a stumbling block to adoption,” says Alkesh Shah, crypto and digital asset strategist at Bank of America. “Many people [who would otherwise] use those digital assets don’t because of the energy use and the negatives for the environment.” “It’s going to dramatically reduce the carbon footprint for the whole industry,” says Ilan Solot, a partner at venture capital firm Tagus Capital. Should the Merge successfully inoculate Ethereum against criticism from environmentalists, pressure will grow on its main rival, bitcoin. If one of the two most prominent blockchains can ditch its dirty reputation, why not the other? Ethereum core developer Preston Van Loon, who co-founded Prysmatic Labs, a team of software engineers dedicated to building the Ethereum blockchain, says the Merge cannot come soon enough. “Proof of stake has been coming soon since 2016 . . . it’s almost a meme at this point,” he says. “I feel like [the energy cost] is really a barrier to global scale, people are not going to use it if they know it has such expensive energy costs.” The carbon footprint problem has been a persistent hurdle to efforts to push blockchain technology to mainstream users, says Ryan Wyatt, former head of gaming at YouTube who now runs blockchain gaming company Polygon Studios. The Merge “really does away with that in its entirety,” he says. “You can then focus on what the other points of friction are for onboarding the next billion users into Web3.” But others in the industry say Ethereum’s problems with slow transactions and high fees will continue to disqualify the blockchain from driving any kind of Web3 revolution. “I don’t understand this insistence of using something [Ethereum] that at its core, doesn’t work very well,” says Lars Seier Christensen, co-founder of Saxo Bank who now runs a proof-of-stake blockchain called Concordium. What is more, there is no guarantee the Merge will even work from a technical perspective. The process has already been set in motion and will happen once a pre-determined target on the blockchain is reached — currently expected to happen as early as Tuesday. The Merge will be gradual, more like the sun coming up than switching on a light. “It’s almost like changing the engines on a plane whilst flying it . . . a significant engineering feat,” says Edward Machin, a senior lawyer in Ropes \u0026 Gray’s data, privacy and cyber security practice. Even if the big moment does come off without a hitch, there are plenty of risks that lie in wait. The first is a theoretical one: dubbed the “51 per cent attack”. Post-Merge, the Ethereum blockchain will be secured by a group of individuals by virtue of the ether tokens they have staked. That means, in theory, that any group or individual who gains control of 51 per cent or more of the staked ether on the blockchain would effectively control the system. It is an unlikely scenario — not least because it would probably be prohibitively expensive to own over half the staked ether on the blockchain. But also because an attacker would lose their staked holdings if they tried to meddle with the chain. “I would think smaller blockchains may have a higher risk for that,” says Shah. Recommended Still, the danger is there and crypto sceptics have witnessed enough hacks and collapses not to dismiss it. “It’s a high stakes test . . . The hackers aren’t going to come out until it’s live,” says crypto critic and angel investor Liron Shapira. Another critic, software engineer Stephen Diehl, says it is dangers such as these that make people who are considering investing in crypto markets think twice, because “there is this underlying platform risk where, unlike [with] physical commodities, crypto assets can simply cease to exist due to technical black swan events.” A more immediate problem is the tail risk of a whole series of market mechanisms that have yet to be tested in the wild. “Humans are pretty bad at pricing tail risk. I think most people are probably not thinking about [it], and there are a lot of risks here,” says Garg of Electric Capital. The most urgent concern for many Ethereum backers is the existential question that proof of stake presents to “decentralisation” — a sacred tenet among advocates of blockchains. According to DeFi Llama, a popular analytics website, the Ethereum blockchain holds over 50 per cent of the total value of the decentralised finance industry, which champions direct peer-to-peer transactions and is meant to remove all need for third-party intermediaries such as banks or brokers. Like other blockchains, Ethereum is meant to be censorship-resistant. Its design is supposed to hold out against powerful individuals or entities seeking to exert control over other participants. But in its new guise, safeguarded by a collection of individuals or companies, Ethereum loses that autonomy. “You have what is a shining beacon of decentralisation but in a new model it will be more centralised than people think,” says Machin. This problem has become clearer since the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac) last month imposed sanctions against Tornado Cash, an Ethereum-based platform that the government accused of facilitating billions-worth of laundered crypto. The staunchest of crypto’s libertarian army had said the heavy hand of government would prove ineffective against the kinds of “smart contracts” — computer software designed to automate transactions — that run on decentralised platforms. Yet, sanctions have proved effective after all. In the weeks since Tornado Cash was targeted, transactions on the platform nosedived. That worry is bound to cross the minds of Ethereum’s future guardians, including exchanges Binance and Coinbase, and staking platform Lido Finance. According to Nansen data, these companies are already some of the biggest Ethereum staking players around, and thus will be trusted to secure the network post-Merge. Last month, Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong said his exchange would likely quit the staking business before censoring the network. As guardians of the Ethereum network, these entities will have to decide whether or not to validate and process blocks of transactions that may contain transactions coming from entities under sanctions such as Tornado Cash. That hardly sounds like the censorship-resistant utopia envisioned by the idealists — although critics of bitcoin point out that the concentration of miners (who are overwhelmingly based in certain countries such as the US and Russia) in that blockchain also amounts to a centralised system. If the Merge does usher in a new era of centralisation, those idealists may have to pack their bags and leave. “If people are worried . . . OK, great, go somewhere else,” says Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at asset management firm Arca. There is another reason for optimism: since July, the price of ether — as well as of other popular cryptocurrencies — has partly rebounded, giving investors some respite following a turbulent few months. When BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, launched a bitcoin private trust last month, it signalled that the beleaguered industry might already be repositioning itself for the next bull market cycle. If the price of digital assets — and, more specifically, ether — should revive, then it is likely that the post-Merge Ethereum blockchain will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of another crypto bull run. “I like to call it the lazy man’s ETF,” says Dorman. “By owning ether, you now have exposure to stablecoins, you have exposure to NFTs, you have exposure to decentralised finance.” Even so, Dorman is not convinced that wider interest in decentralised finance will necessarily follow from the Merge. That, he feels, is “a separate conversation”. “Do [people] want to take loans through [DeFi] rather than walking into a bank? Do people want to trade digital collectibles rather than traditional baseball cards or stamps? All those factors, user growth, transaction growth, volume growth, those are independent of the Merge,” he says. Ultimately, answers to these questions will become clear once the Merge happens. Plenty of dry-run merges have taken place on “testnets” — essentially non-live blockchains — the most recent just last month. But there’s nothing quite like the real thing.

Not by investing directly in volatile cryptocurrencies, mind. Abrdn, the UK investment group, recently bought a stake in digital assets exchange Archax. BlackRock is opening direct access for clients to crypto exchange Coinbase. Schwab has launched a crypto-linked exchange traded fund. Sceptics will say asset managers are scrambling to exploit an immature, speculative market, when unwary customers betting on cryptocurrencies are still vulnerable to hype or even fraud. Underlining the risks, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, a big Canadian pension fund manager, has written off what it conceded was a premature investment in bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius Network. BlackRock’s chief executive Larry Fink was an early bitcoin critic, opening him to charges of, at best, inconsistency. But when he was sniping at bitcoin in 2017, crypto’s foundations were more fragile than now. It is hardly surprising that companies such as BlackRock, which is also developing a spot bitcoin trust for institutional clients, should look to cater to new groups of investors. Asset managers need to be open to multiple futures of finance. Cryptocurrency could become a legitimate way of hedging sophisticated investors’ portfolios, like other alternative assets such as wine or gold. It could still pay to have some exposure. But whether or not cryptocurrencies recover their earlier levels, the history of markets suggests that something useful usually remains after bubbles burst. By investing in the market’s superstructure now, asset managers can also prepare for the possible advent of central bank digital currencies, which offer some of the promised upside of crypto with the security of backing from central banks. They are improving their understanding of the underlying technology, such as blockchain. And they may put themselves in a position to hire innovative and fintech-adept young staff made redundant by shrinking crypto companies. In other words, it is perfectly possible to embrace the technology, entrepreneurial spirit and innovation of crypto while remaining at arm’s length from the asset class itself. As for ordinary investors, the growing ties between high finance and crypto seem a step away from digital currencies’ origins as a tool for tearing down the establishment. But at least by filtering their investment through orthodox institutions, they limit their exposure to theft and fraud. Even so, cryptocurrencies are still broadly unsupervised, hold the potential to contribute to wider market instability and are a risky home for the savings of retail investors used to more solid regulatory protection. Recommended The obvious solution is to put in place firm guardrails, as this newspaper has repeatedly suggested. Unfortunately, different agencies and countries have divergent attitudes. Financial entrepreneurs and innovators will naturally seek to exploit such differences. For example, crypto companies are lobbying to ensure cryptocurrencies are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates derivatives, rather than the more hawkish Securities and Exchange Commission. In what remains a buyer-beware market, asset managers’ involvement provides a thin layer of additional security. Their interest could bolster surviving crypto companies that wish to win access to institutional clients. But with asset managers’ power comes a responsibility to help the crypto market grow up, and to help protect more vulnerable investors while it does.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"The editorial board","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-08-21","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/1f795e5d-c2cf-4e91-89f1-6d5544a8a3db","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F10a9608c-f4d8-47b8-bceb-f2bd7d7f9742.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Crypto and climate change: can web3 help get us to net zero?","INTRO":"New tech ventures want to use blockchain to clean up a messy carbon market — but critics fear more greenwashing","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Last year, a British oil exploration company and a tech start-up joined forces on a project to permanently lock away untapped fossil fuel reserves in Greenland. The idea was simple: the energy company, Greenland Gas and Oil, would not extract oil from an area on the east coast that it had exploration licences for. Instead it would monetise keeping the oil in the ground via a partnership with the tech company, Carbonbase, which works on offsetting carbon emissions. The mechanics were more complex. The partnership aimed to sell NFTs, digital collectibles that come with ownership certificates, linked to the unexplored land. The profits would then be used in part to compensate the energy company and the oil would stay underground. And, since the Greenland government had stopped issuing new exploration licences, the energy company would not be able to simply apply for another and tap a different part of the country. The pitch to buyers was that they could be sure their NFT investment was doing some environmental good. The tokens would also be paired with a new type of “non-production” carbon credit the venture hoped to develop, which owners could use to compensate for their own emissions. But, after months of discussions, the partnership ran into problems. Carbonbase and Greenland Gas and Oil did not agree on how to structure the joint venture. Carbonbase also discovered that the country of Greenland had never successfully produced any oil, a fact that they said undermined the whole idea. Pursuing the project “would have destroyed our public reputation” and looked like “greenwashing”, says Max Song, founder of Carbonbase. Eric Sondergaard, chief operating officer at Greenland Gas and Oil, concedes the scheme was not “perfect” and that it would have been better if an oil producing company was “turning off the flow of oil or gas from a wellhead”. But, he says, it was easier for a group not yet tapping reserves to win investor backing for such a proposal: “once the [oil] development wheels are in motion, it is harder to convince shareholders to opt for a blockchain alternative.” The attempt is just one example in a mass of tech ventures that hope to fuse concerns about global warming with the public’s interest in Web3 technology. A surfeit of start-ups have burst on to the scene this year, variously promising to “green” bitcoin, make NFTs sustainable and solve niggling problems in carbon markets once and for all. These projects range from the relatively mundane to the outlandish and wacky, with interest coming from major corporations as well as fringe groups. One River Digital Asset Management launched “the world’s first carbon-neutral crypto asset fund” last year, while the world’s largest meatpacking group, JBS, has developed a blockchain platform to trace its cattle supply chain in an effort to combat deforestation. Diamond miner De Beers is using blockchain technology to track the provenance of its gems. Many new initiatives focus on the booming market for carbon offsets — each of which is supposed to represent a tonne of carbon permanently removed or avoided from the atmosphere. They have soared in popularity in the past 18 months as companies seek to compensate for their emissions. WeWork founder Adam Neumann’s venture Flowcarbon, which received funding from Andreessen Horowitz earlier this year, is one of a range of efforts to produce carbon tokens, which can either be used to compensate for emissions like traditional carbon credits or traded on certain crypto exchanges. The trend for “tokenising” carbon offsets, or converting them into the sort of fungible, digital tokens familiar to crypto traders has been notable: millions of credits have been digitised since late 2021. Used well, analysts say Web3 technologies could bring greater integrity to the carbon market and help verify the credentials of products labelled as “sustainable”. But critics say complicated new initiatives could just as easily exacerbate existing problems in two unregulated markets (offsets and crypto finance), lure more people into a space with its own big emissions problem, and contribute to more greenwashing. William Pazos, cofounder of AirCarbon Exchange, says some new groups are not displaying “the level of rigour that’s necessary” to come up with credible climate solutions. “They are ticking the boxes: the climate box, the blockchain box — all these buzzwords that potentially could make them very wealthy.” It was only a matter of time before advocates of blockchain — the distributed digital ledgers on which cryptocurrencies run and that have been hailed as solutions to everything from poverty to identity theft — turned to climate change. These supporters say the technology, which keeps an unchangeable record of transactions, can bring greater clarity to the messy market for carbon offsets. “Distributed ledgers are going to help with transparency” and with tracking the purchase and use of credits, says James Cameron, policy adviser at Systemiq, the advisory group. Carbon-crypto initiatives might also be a way for retail buyers, who have traditionally found it difficult to buy offsets, to access the market. But Pete Howson, who researches environmental technologies at the UK’s Northumbria University, says he fears some tech pioneers “don’t understand the way the carbon market works”. The sector is notoriously complicated, with its own well-rehearsed problems: a lack of liquidity, opaque pricing and concerns about the quality of credits. Since the late 1990s the decentralised market has only become more complicated as it has grown. Thousands of projects that generate offsets exist, such as tree planting schemes that can sell credits either directly to end users or via middlemen. Different project types are governed by various complex rules, set by one of a number of third-party carbon offset standard setters such as Verra. Some offsets are of a reliable quality, but others may not deliver the climate benefits they promise. That makes it hard for non-experts to know what to buy, who to buy from and what to pay. The blockchain community is the latest to take up the gauntlet. Tokenising credits has become a popular starting point. The process can involve some mystifying jargon, but the goal tends to be the same: the creation of digital versions of existing offsets that are simpler for people to understand, more liquid and transparently priced. Carbon tokens have been launched by companies including Toucan, JustCarbon and Moss.Earth. Hype about the prospect of the tokens has bubbled up on social media. But the tokens have also drawn the attention of corporate investors: last year Anthony Scaramucci’s alternative investment firm SkyBridge Capital bought nearly 40,000 of Moss.Earth’s tokens to offset the “historic carbon footprint” of its bitcoin holdings. Adrian Rimmer, cofounder of JustCarbon, says the design of carbon tokens is easier for non-expert buyers to understand than the traditional offset market, which he describes as “horrible”. “It requires an unfeasibly large amount of knowledge,” he says. And while traditional offsets can come from thousands of different environmental projects and are difficult to compare, each of the new digital tokens on offer — JustCarbon’s JCRs or Moss.Earth’s MCO2s, for example — are uniform and trade at the same price. Each company decides on a range of offsets, such as any from forestry schemes, that can be converted into its standardised token. Not everyone is convinced. Louis Redshaw, managing director of carbon consultancy Redshaw Advisors, says adding another layer of complexity to the already confusing carbon market is probably “not making it better”. Blockchain may be no more useful for elucidating the process than “a good spreadsheet”, he says. Redshaw insists the complicated nature of many projects is reason enough to be wary: “If you can’t understand what it is you’re getting into you shouldn’t get into it,” he says. Steve Zwick, a senior media relations manager for Verra, the offsets registry, says creating standardised tokens from a broad category of offsets masks key information, such as which project a credit came from. Such details are important, since some offsets are of dubious quality. “That transparency element is critical, especially now with new buyers coming in. You’ve got to make sure the labelling is right,” says Zwick. Critical intelligence on the digital asset industry. Explore the FT’s coverage here. While buyers of Moss.Earth’s tokens know they are underpinned by credits from a list of forest protection schemes published by the company, they do not know which specific project a given token is linked to. The group said its design ensured token fungibility. Last year Vaughan Lindsay, chief executive of offset seller Climate Impact Partners, told the Financial Times that efforts to make credits fungible “remind me of collateralised debt instruments . . . If you keep rolling stuff up, you have no idea what you’re buying.” Another risk is the temptation to use the tokens for financial speculation. Offsets are supposed to be bought to compensate for specific emissions, rather than endlessly traded. But the owners of tokenised credits can easily be swept up in the powerful currents of decentralised finance. Verra banned the tokenisation of certain credits in May. In August it launched a consultation about designing “anti-fraud measures” for crypto-carbon — new rules that could allow tokenisation to resume. Toucan’s tokens soared in popularity at the end of last year, largely because buyers can convert them into a new cryptocurrency, Klima. But experts pointed out that many of the millions of credits underpinning Toucan’s tokens had remained unsold for years due to quality concerns. Toucan said it had tightened up its rules about which credits could be tokenised. “If people are bundling credits and selling them, what’s important is the underlying credit,” says William McDonnell, chief operating officer of the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market, an industry group that is drawing up rules for what constitutes a “good” credit. “Whether it’s tokenised or not, what’s important is the quality of the credits.” Fiorenzo Manganiello, a professor of blockchain technologies at Geneva Business School, warned of scams targeting those looking for “green” crypto. “I’ve been approached three or four times by people saying they’re selling ‘green’” tokens they claimed were backed by carbon credits, he says. “In reality, they [looked like] a pump-and-dump scheme.” Then there is the broader threat posed by a turbulent crypto market, which crashed this year. The value of Toucan’s “BCT” tokens fell from a high of nearly $9 last year to around $1.50 in August. Moss.Earth’s MCO2s dropped from more than $17 in January to under $4 this month, while JustCarbon’s JCR moved from nearly $40 in May to around $24 in August. The crypto-climate crossover goes beyond carbon tokens. Shoppers can now participate in metaverses where they are encouraged to purchase virtual versions of fashion items such as clothing, instead of buying in the real world. Conservation-linked cryptocurrencies are also appearing, such as one developed by Estonia-based Single.Earth. The group generates “Merit” tokens, which landowners earn each time they store 100kg of carbon in their forests. Their woodland must be at least 20 years old to be eligible, and Single.Earth monitors the process using satellites and machine learning. However, since there is no penalty for landowners who later cut down the trees, except that they do not earn more tokens, the stored carbon could be released back into the atmosphere. Merit Valdsalu, Single.Earth co-founder, concedes this is a concern, but says she hopes the prospect of earning more tokens will incentivise landowners to keep trees standing. The elephant in the room is the energy consumption involved in many crypto and blockchain transactions. Minting bitcoin, for example, requires huge computing power, which often runs on coal-generated electricity. That issue is drawing more attention. This year, the US Office of Science and Technology Policy called for evidence on the energy and climate implications of digital assets. Enthusiasts have pushed back against this characterisation of crypto, arguing that many coins and blockchains are much less energy intensive than bitcoin. But the perception of digital assets as a gas-guzzling, carbon generating problem is so prevalent that an NFT auction by the UK arm of conservation charity WWF was abruptly cancelled in February following a backlash. Despite such criticisms, many analysts do see a role for digital technologies in the fight against climate change and are encouraged by the interest in sustainability from some in the crypto community. The “recognition of the energy conundrum by major players . . . could signal a turning point for the crypto market in adapting greener algorithms,” wrote HSBC analyst Camila Sarmiento. Banks and exchanges are exploring a middle ground between the traditional carbon market and the crypto-carbon crossover. AirCarbon Exchange has designed smart contracts that could allow credits to be sold in smaller quantities than one tonne of carbon. That could be useful for people making small, regular purchases, such as offsetting a taxi trip, says Pazos. “Just like we see calorie counts on food [packaging], we’re going to see carbon counts on all types of different activities.” Lenders including NatWest, Standard Chartered and BNP Paribas have developed a blockchain-based settlement platform, Carbonplace, which aims to make buying offsets simpler and enhance the traceability of transactions. Buyers receive tokens representing credit ownership, which include the details of the offsets — not digital versions of the credits. Even the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has taken an interest: it supported the creation of the Climate Chain Coalition initiative in 2017, which works to “advance blockchain . . . and related digital solutions” to mobilise climate finance and action on climate. But for now, the proliferation of new companies and the “low barriers to launching new projects” make it “hard to understand who you want to work with,” says Claudia Herbert, from the advisory group Carbon Direct. “We’re seeing the lessons of the [real-world offsets market] being relearnt.” Where climate change meets business, markets and politics.

You might wonder whether one of Silicon Valley’s biggest venture capital funds might themselves be trying to grab as much money and power as they can but no, really, it’s you they care about. “My hope is through Web3, we can return to . . . a much more decentralised distribution of power and control,” Chris Dixon, head of the firm’s $7.6bn crypto fund, told the FT’s Tech Tonic podcast. “Facebook, Instagram . . . They figured out a way to have other people create their content and take basically all of the money,” he said. This is bemusing. Isn’t a16z at the very heart of Big Tech, having massively profited from Web2? Is co-founder Marc Andreessen not still on the board of Meta — the company that owns both Facebook and Instagram — and doesn’t he still own millions of dollars’ worth of shares in it? And anyway, isn’t the whole point of venture capital to generate returns? Why does this company — and the tech sector more broadly — feel the need to insist that their raison d’être is saving the world, when in reality they are simply out to make as much money as they can? Shouldn’t it be OK to say that? Dixon in fact went still further. Web3, he said, wouldn’t just follow the old Google mantra of “Don’t be evil” — which was quietly abandoned a few years ago — because this relies on fallible human beings sticking to it. Making the internet run on blockchains instead, and introducing new financial incentives in the form of crypto tokens, would actually somehow mean this idea was built into the system: “That’s a very, very important concept in Web3: ‘can’t be evil’ instead of ‘don’t be evil’.” Now this, of course, is a farcical idea, as a quick glance at some of the projects that a16z’s crypto fund has invested in can demonstrate. While Dixon insists that in this new vision of the internet, “data is controlled by users”, one of his investments, Worldcoin, has been collecting biometric data from people in developing countries in return for crypto tokens and has been accused of deceptive marketing. Worldcoin’s chief executive told BuzzFeed News that the company “will improve” communication and marketing. The extractive practices of a more mainstream investment, Coinbase, helped the crypto exchange rake in $3.6bn of profits in 2021. The truth is that the lofty claims made by a16z are part of a have-your-cake-and-eat-it culture that we have all helped create. We so demonised the “vampire squid” banks in the aftermath of the financial crisis that the business of making money became seen as ugly and immoral. Cue young business school graduates — the young are the most likely to demand a job with “purpose” — shunning investment banking for Silicon Valley, which offered them not only free beers and ping pong tables, but the chance to feel they were making a difference. “Big Tech was saying ‘we’re better than finance’,” says Martin Walker, director of banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management. “They were more socially conscious and you could get all kinds of stuff for free . . . but what we have learnt is that Big Tech does not give away things for nothing. They’re either trying to build monopolies or they’re trying to extract value from people in some other way.” Since the explosion of ESG, too, investors want to be told they are putting their money into projects that are doing good — whether or not that is true is somewhat beside the point. Recommended What this all means is that companies are spending more of their resources on optics, leaving them with less time and money to focus on doing something that might actually be of value. We live in a society so obsessed with how things appear that in the US today there are more than six “flacks” — as my profession affectionately calls PRs — for every journalist. Further, by creating the expectation that companies must tell us they exist to do good in the world rather than to turn a profit, we are making them better at telling us lies. That makes it harder to tell fact from fiction, and thus to hold these firms to account. From the giants of Silicon Valley to the grifters of the crypto casino, the world of tech should try being a little more honest with itself and with the rest of us. We should allow them to tell it to us straight — if we don’t, we are complicit in building a culture that does not value the truth, and in which the critical line between reality and fakery become increasingly blurred. jemima.kelly@ft.com","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-08-24","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/0948f1a9-ad0b-4126-9ae8-5ce4e212c07e","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fc5f543e0-1e51-4c08-8671-f6904d11bb0c.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BlackRock pushes into crypto market with bitcoin private trust","INTRO":"Asset manager to offer investment vehicle only to institutional clients in the US","DETAILED_CONTENT":"BlackRock has announced the launch of a spot bitcoin private trust, deepening a push into digital assets as the crypto industry is recovering from the fallout of a credit crisis. The world’s largest asset manager said in a blog post on Thursday that the private trust would be available only to institutional clients in the US, but gave few other details. US regulators have repeatedly rejected proposals to offer spot bitcoin exchange traded funds that would be open to retail investors, citing the need for investor protections. The move by BlackRock potentially puts the investment house, whose chief executive Larry Fink has publicly criticised bitcoin, into competition with Grayscale, the world’s biggest investment vehicle for cryptocurrencies. It comes as the crypto industry deals with the fallout of an acute drop in the price of assets such as bitcoin, which has lost two-thirds of its value since its all-time high last November. The total market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies dropped from around $3.2tn to less than $1tn in that time. “Despite the steep downturn in the digital asset market, we are still seeing substantial interest from some institutional clients in how to efficiently and cost-effectively access these assets using our technology and product capabilities,” BlackRock said in a statement. “The launch of BlackRock’s bitcoin fund is a sign of how far crypto has matured as an asset class,” said Sui Chung, chief executive of crypto index provider CF Benchmarks. Earlier this week BlackRock agreed to join its Aladdin investment technology platform to Coinbase, the crypto exchange. The network is widely used in the fund management industry to link asset managers, insurers and banks to markets. Other fund managers are also dipping their toes into the crypto market. In recent months Schroders picked up a stake in the crypto-focused fund manager Forteus while Fidelity announced it would allow investors to add cryptocurrencies to their portfolios in 401(k) retirement schemes. Recommended However, BlackRock’s pivot to digital assets marks a significant evolution from previous comments made by Fink. In 2017, the chief executive said “bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world”, adding “that’s all it is”. BlackRock’s bitcoin embrace also follows the firm’s previous calls for global environmental, social and governance standards in a bid to bolster sustainability efforts. Bitcoin — which runs on an energy-intensive blockchain system — has been criticised for its carbon footprint and broader impact on the environment. What does the future hold for digital currencies?

It explains how Sam Bankman-Fried’s Central Bank of IP wants to “strip out the brokers that for the past 40 years have acted as intermediaries between customers and the exchanges where deals are done.” SBF formally pitched his idea of automated risk management to US regulators in March. His proposal involves using the 24-hour trading of leveraged crypto futures as a proof of concept to gain the confidence of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Anyone familiar with CFDs and spread betting will by now be wondering what all the fuss is about. Accounts with upfront margin and algorithmic liquidation have been part of the scenery in European markets, and globally for forex, for almost as long as the means have existed. The problem here is America. The CTFC still needs to get comfortable with the concept of leveraged borrowers managing their own risk, which isn’t incontestably compatible with the Commodity Exchange Act. FTX has been lobbying the CTFC for a rule change after last year buying LedgerX, a US futures and options exchange that under current rules has to ask for customer collateral in full (or close to full). FTX wants to offer them leverage, but it doesn’t want to be reliant on futures commission merchants (FCMs), which are the market’s repo men. FCMs have remained because they’re quite useful. Placing a gatekeeper between the exchange and the customer helps pool collateral, and is meant to ensure that clearing houses will have enough to cover any default. Gatekeeping also provides a degree of human discretion to the big decisions, such as when Citigroup was given free pass in March 2020 after missing a margin call. FTX wants to bypass all that. “Dramatic improvements in technological infrastructure over the past twenty years” mean customers should be given direct access to exchange and clearing services, then be taken out of losing positions by a disinterested algorithm. Real time margin monitoring would shut down accounts in 10 per cent increments, with FTX laying off its risky positions where possible to “liquidity providers” and backstopping against catastrophe with its own $250mn cash fund. SBF cites FTX’s own trading history (August 2020 to date) as evidence that such a risk management system works, and that it’s better to boil the frog with regular small liquidations than occasional big ones. Regulators who were calling for god-view futures market monitoring in the wake of the GFC are invited to see on FTX’s dashboards a microcosm version of how it might have looked. Blockchain gets mentioned in passing because its fans believe distributed ledgers are good at instant, frictionless capital transfers. SBF has talked about how smart contracts etc are a “really beautiful experience” when applied to risk management but really, any talk of protocol improvement is incidental at best. Hurdles are all regulatory, not technical. Under the hood, FTX is just as centralised as the average tradfi trading shop; its application letter to the CFTC doesn’t mention blockchain at all. All that’s left then is the argument over whether risk management by algorithm is positive or negative for market stability. But is FTX really the right company to be leading it? After all, SBF didn’t get rich by making crypto less volatile, he got rich by making fiat easier to lose. Crypto lobbyists have seized on the London Metal Exchange’s nickel omnishambles in March as an example of the problems caused by human intervention — while critics have argued that LME’s autocratic style might be a symptom of Hong Kong-Chinese ownership rather than structural failings. It’s not difficult meanwhile to find examples of when algos failed spectacularly to offset risk, such as in 2015 when Switzerland scrapped its currency ceiling and crashed much of the retail CFD industry. Regulators and tradfi firms have so far been wary of the crypto lobby’s charm offensive. As Alphaville noted at the time, a CFTC’s round table in May included a rather exasperated contribution from Chris Edmonds, ICE’s chief development officer, after Coinfund managing partner Chris Perkins used the infallibility of the big shops as an argument in support of FTX’s proposal. (Perkins was in charge of Citi’s clearing unit in March 2020 when its margin call was waived.) A cynical take is that US tradfi has been resisting innovation to protect its profit centres. The more rational take is that futures pricing has real-world consequences for global industry and agriculture, so doesn’t deserve the same risk tolerances as applied to dogecoin. And crypto liquidations appear to be a profit centre in their own right. Moreover, FTX is lobbying to influence its preferred pick for industry regulator, should the US government ever follow through on proposals to put crypto trading within a legislative structure. Blockchain is, and always will be, mostly irrelevant to the wider argument. FTX wants the legitimacy of regulated markets while using the same centralised systems it has developed in crypto to boil the frog and harvest the dead. What FTX has to do is to now convince participants that its preferred mechanisms of modernisation won’t just encourage retail-driven gambling, manipulative volatility and arbitrary financialisation. What’s needed most is a clear presentation of the potential upsides, because right now the evidence from its core market isn’t great.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Bryce Elder","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-07-20","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/0ec27aa0-61ef-4fad-ba9b-21e82094e9b7","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fuploaded-files%2FTechTonic%25202048x1152-270047bd-22e8-487c-b6b1-b9f42facef4d.jpeg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"A sceptic’s guide to crypto: the church of bitcoin","INTRO":"Is crypto a cult?","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Your browser does not support playing this file but you can still download the MP3 file to play locally.

The Investment Association, the trade body representing the UK’s asset management industry that oversees close to £10tn for clients worldwide, will call on Thursday for the government and City regulator to work “at pace” to approve blockchain-traded funds that will issue digital tokens to investors instead of traditional shares or fund units. Significant cost savings for end investors could be achieved by using the digital ledgers known as blockchain, to drive multiple efficiency improvements in the existing laborious processes involved in buying and selling mutual funds, according to the Investment Association. The group will also propose the creation of a new task force to examine how distributed ledger technology could accelerate the creation of new products and services as well as allowing more investors to customise their portfolios with holdings in private companies and cryptocurrencies. Chris Cummings, Investment Association chief executive, said it was vital that policymakers, regulators and investment industry participants should work together to “drive forward innovation without delay”. “Greater innovation will boost the overall competitiveness of the UK funds industry and improve the cost, efficiency and quality of the investment experience,” said Cummings. Recommended Blockchain-traded funds, also known as tokenised or on-chain funds, could be rolled out as early as the end of the second quarter of 2023 if regulatory approval was expedited by Financial Conduct Authority. California-based Franklin Templeton launched the first US mutual fund to use blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership in April 2021. FundAdminChain, a financial technology group, is working with the London Stock Exchange and four global asset managers to develop live tokenised funds for the UK market. “Asset managers have realised that there is potential to generate alpha [market-beating returns] via tokenisation. Tokenised funds can deliver more transparency, instant settlement, improvements in data and analytics which will contribute to a more efficient system for investors but we need regulatory support to ensure that the UK remains competitive with other jurisdictions,” said FundAdminChain chief executive Brian McNulty. The Investment Association is also calling for the FCA to assess whether traditional mutual funds should be allowed to own cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, as well as other digital assets. However, any new assessment of the suitability of cryptoassets for inclusion in funds sold to retail investors would require the FCA to carry out a full consultation, a lengthy process that would delay regulatory approval. The total value of the cryptocurrency market has tumbled by more than $2tn from the record high of November 2021 as global investors have deserted speculative financial assets. The collapse has alarmed regulators and prompted multiple calls for stricter rules to protect investors. “The recent volatility highlights the importance of defining the ‘rules of the road’ for cryptoassets, which will help to mitigate the risk of harm to consumers,” said Cummings. In a speech in April, John Glen, then City minister and economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government wanted to “remove disincentives” that prevented UK fund managers from holding cryptoassets in their portfolios. “By making [the UK] a hospitable place for crypto, we can attract investment, generate swaths of new jobs and create a wave of groundbreaking new products and services,” said Glen.

Critics say blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are too energy-intensive to play a role in finance. The riposte of ethereum developers is The Merge. They aim to combine the main ethereum blockchain network with another system to slash power consumption. The Merge promises to edge digital assets, whose prices have taken a battering, closer to the financial mainstream. A successful dress rehearsal in August means the change could take place in coming weeks. Like bitcoin, ethereum uses a proof-of-work model in which complicated equations must be solved in order to unlock new digital tokens or validate transactions. This drains a great deal of computer power. Estimates of energy consumption vary. But bitcoin is reckoned to use as much as 150 terawatt hours yearly, 0.65 per cent of the global energy supply. Ethereum would burn up about 75 Twh annually. The Merge means ethereum will shift to proof-of-stake in which users verify transactions using their existing assets. This requires less power — 99.95 per cent less according to community-created information site ethereum.org. Token owners can invest their capital via staking, loaning out digital assets to validate transactions. The annual return for staking is about 3.85 per cent on proof-of-stake blockchain network Solana, according to estimates from Coinbase, a crypto platform. Ethereum, a larger network with more transactions, could provide higher returns. Ethereum.org predicts 7 per cent. Ethereum’s digital token ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin. However, the gap is substantial. Ether’s market value is about half of bitcoin’s, according to data from CoinGecko. Like all cryptocurrencies, the price has retreated from a record high last year as interest rate rises reduce demand for risky assets. It is down 60 per cent from its high point, just below bitcoin’s 65 per cent drop. The Merge could reduce the gap by propelling ether’s price. It jumped more than a tenth after a test network completed a simulation of the switch planned for the main network. The update has been delayed before. Even if it occurs, not everyone plans to adopt it. Some miners who stand to lose out are making plans to run the old version of ethereum — something known as a fork. But such a move will not be widely supported. Reducing crypto’s energy use is a widely shared goal. What does the future hold for digital currencies?

However, most cryptocurrencies are too volatile for this and there are also issues with central bank digital currencies. CBDCs may not be based on the distributed ledger technology of blockchain or be available for retail use. They might also be slow to materialise. As a result, stablecoins or e-money tokens have taken off to meet the market’s demands. Stablecoins come in many varieties. We believe the only ones likely to function as a medium of exchange in the foreseeable future are the most widely used type — those pegged to a fiat currency with the issuer holding reserves. Issuers offer to redeem their tokens on demand, claiming they are fully backed by reserves to meet this pledge. The tokens, which do not pay interest, are usable as money in blockchain applications and trades in them can be settled on a near-real-time, peer-to-peer basis. In addition to being a medium of exchange, they serve as collateral in DeFi. Issuers of these stablecoins have thrived while nominal interest rates have been near zero. With high positive interest rates, the opportunity cost of holding zero-interest stablecoins increases and the issuers lose business. With significantly negative rates, the value of safe reserves declines but the tokens are still redeemable at par. Issuers face insolvency and must invest in riskier reserves for a chance to survive. If stablecoins are no longer fully backed by safe and liquid assets and are widely used, this creates financial stability risks. Suppose the issuers could pass on their interest earnings (or costs if rates are negative) on reserves to the token holders on a one-on-one basis. If interest rates are high, stablecoins are a competitive liquid store of value. If they are significantly negative, the issuers’ liabilities shrink along with their reserve; the issuer remains solvent. Stablecoins could be sustainable in all interest rate environments. There is a problem though, at least for the EU with the Regulation on Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) that is expected to come into force in 2024. This proscribes the paying of interest on money tokens. That would force issuers to adopt a business model that is only sustainable with near-zero interest rates. We see no sensible reason for the ban but such regulation will force stablecoins to evolve. Shares in a regulated retail money market fund, issued as security tokens on a public blockchain under the applicable securities legislation, might be an alternative. Like stablecoins, they would be pegged to a unit of fiat currency but would pay interest. Like MMFs that seek to maintain a constant net asset value, they would be at risk of self-fulfilling runs if investors rush to sell tokens, triggering further sales. As a result, they should have access to central bank lender-of-resort facilities such as MMFs. This sort of fund sits outside Mica and is allowed. It is telling, however, that one needs to circumvent Mica to design a stable stablecoin. Tokenised deposits offered by commercial banks are another possibility. Banks would administer deposits on a distributed database rather than their own. In legal and economic terms, these are identical to conventional deposits; they do not fall under Mica and can pay interest. Tokenising deposits would enable peer-to-peer settlement and make commercial bank money usable in blockchain applications without impacting the broader financial system. Tokenising commercial bank deposits has advantages over alternative stablecoins. They can fall under existing deposit insurance schemes and may qualify as legal tender in some jurisdictions. Finally, banks have access to the central bank as lender of last resort; widening the scope of assets that the token holders’ funds can be invested in while maintaining sufficient liquidity. If interest rates deviate significantly from zero, stablecoin issuers are likely to apply for banking licences to benefit from the regulatory advantages. Existing banks will probably introduce tokenised deposits in order to compete. Stablecoin issuers, as intermediaries, will probably be only a temporary phenomenon. What will remain is commercial bank money with enhanced technical functionality. Willem Buiter and Anne Sibert co-authored this article What does the future hold for digital currencies?

Solana and several other platforms linked to the blockchain were on Wednesday investigating an apparent hack that affected at least 7,767 digital wallets, the computer programs that store traders’ crypto tokens. The Solana Foundation, a non-profit focused on the growth and security of the Solana network, told the Financial Times that it “does not appear” that the exploitation had affected its core infrastructure, but rather was caused by a bug “in software used by several wallets popular among Solana users”. The apparent hack marks a fresh setback for Solana, which has been touted as one of the potential long-term winners of the crypto industry because it was built to handle thousands of trades a second but has faced a series of outages in recent months. The Solana Foundation said on Wednesday that “engineers from multiple ecosystems, with the help of several security firms, are investigating drained wallets on Solana”. In many recent crypto hacking episodes, users did not receive their funds back since transactions typically cannot be reversed on blockchains. Critical intelligence on the digital asset industry. Explore the FT’s coverage here. Phantom, a wallet app built on Solana, and Solana non-fungible token marketplace Magic Eden were among the providers that said they were affected in the apparent hacking incident. The Solana Foundation said wallets that allow traders to hold their coins offline rather than using online applications did not appear to have been affected. Solana Labs, a developer of the Solana blockchain, is backed by big groups in traditional and cryptocurrency markets including venture capital company Andreessen Horowitz, high-speed trading shop Jump Trading, and Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research. Solana is designed to process up to 50,000 trades a second, a scale far in excess of rivals including bitcoin and ethereum, and on a par with established traditional financial services such as the Nasdaq stock exchange. In January, Bank of America analysts said Solana “could become the Visa of the digital asset ecosystem”. However, Solana has suffered processing glitches that have tarnished its reputation. The entirety of the Solana network went dark for four hours in June, an outage that was documented on the network’s official status website. The blockchain’s eponymous native coin has tumbled almost 80 per cent this year, bigger than the drops sustained by its larger rivals bitcoin and ether.

For the remaining lucky few, allow me to explain. Web3 is the inexorable destiny of the internet — the magical fabric from which blockchain-based decentralised dreams are made and dystopian big-tech nightmares destroyed. The future is bright; the future is “append-only” databases. The central thesis of Web3 is that because the internet has become so centralised — with power concentrated in the hands of a few, and users powerless over their own data — we need a more distributed, egalitarian, open system. So far, so reasonable. But the minute you look beneath the surface, gaping holes appear in the Web3 vision. Its techno-utopian advocates say they want to harness the alleged power of blockchains — the immutable databases that underpin bitcoin and other tokens — to create a democratised internet where you control your own data and are no longer reliant on the big tech giants. Web3, the argument goes, will allow you to “own a piece of the internet”. Naturally, the “decentralised” apps and organisations that operate in this brave new world are powered by crypto tokens: all you need to do is buy them. In truth, Web3 has become just the latest marketing term used to try to prop up and repackage the overlapping ideas of crypto, non-fungible tokens, and “decentralised finance”, which all seemed brilliant innovations until the whole market started to tank. No matter that blockchain — once touted as the solution to everything from corrupt elections to supply-chain fraud — has totally failed to live up to the hype and only proved its usefulness as the enabler of the crypto casino. This time will be different. It is hard to even discuss Web3 because it is, like many similar overhyped concepts, a very nebulous term. I had a somewhat heated exchange last weekend with someone who claimed that Web3 was about banks processing data to predict your divorce and downgrade your credit rating before you realise your spouse is having an affair. That, I argued, was about Big Data and artificial intelligence, which has nothing to do with blockchains or distributed ledgers. But just like the metaverse and the “Fourth Industrial Revolution” before that, Web3 often seems to be used to mean something along the lines of “techy stuff that could do stuff in the future”. The term itself comes from the idea that we have had two iterations of the web: the first, launched in the early 90s, lasted for just over a decade and consisted mainly of static web pages that were not interactive. The second, arriving in the early 2000s and continuing to this day, allowed users to upload their own content to the web, but in so doing, the user unwittingly became the product. Perhaps the most disingenuous and pernicious aspect of Web3 is the lie that it is truly about decentralisation. Its biggest backers are Andreessen Horowitz — or a16z — a venture capital firm with billionaire co-founders and assets under management of more than $28bn, which launched a $4.5bn Web3 fund earlier this year. Leaving aside the fact that launching a multi-billion-dollar fund seems like quite some concentration of wealth, this firm also happens to be a major Web2 investor: it has, for instance, a stake in Meta, formerly known as Facebook, on whose board a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen still sits. “Power . . . is just becoming re-centralised in the hands of a small few other investors, in some cases the same exact people who hold so much power in the current web,” according to Molly White, a software engineer and author of the “Web3 Is Going Just Great” blog, who is one of Web3’s leading critics. “I do think there are ways to achieve decentralisation on the internet,” she tells me. “But I see those solutions necessarily as being based in societal and policy change rather than in pure technological change.” Meanwhile, firms like a16z-backed crypto exchange Coinbase — which, until recently, was raking in hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of profits every quarter — are positioning themselves to be “the default gateway to the Web3 ecosystem”. Rather strange that an internet that is all about openness and decentralisation would need a corporate behemoth to provide entry. Web3 is not about making the internet fairer or less liable to exploitation by greedy fat cats, it’s actually the very opposite: it’s about introducing yet another layer of financialisation to the web. The reality, therefore, is actually far more simple than the jargon you will have to sit through when someone is explaining it to you. Web3 is just the newest way of serving up the same old crypto bullshit, and it stinks just as badly as ever. jemima.kelly@ft.com","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-07-14","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/454257b4-a64b-4d83-a419-fb0ea744df1a","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F86656c54-210f-45cc-9801-3ba3d88b617b.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Will the crypto crash derail the next web revolution?","INTRO":"Advocates argue that the blockchain technology that underpins digital assets will withstand the recent fall in values","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ethan Buchman, co-founder of blockchain network Cosmos, is doing his best to sound stoic. Since January, the collapse in cryptocurrency prices has wiped 80 per cent off the value of the atom tokens that underpin Cosmos, slicing $10bn from their total worth. “Some people get shaken out, some people get scared,” Buchman says of the price collapse in the tokens, which are used to secure the network. “But others see it as an opportunity to double down on what they believe in.” “It is always a scary moment for everybody [when markets crash],” adds Joseph Lau, co-founder of another blockchain company, Alchemy. He insists that the falling crypto prices don’t mean that all the projects involved are doomed, or that developers working on them will lose interest. The fall in prices doesn’t mean crypto projects will not get “traction in the long term”, says Lau. The people working on them “are building no matter what the prices are”. But if Lau and Buchman are wrong, the crypto revolution could be stopped in its tracks. This year’s market collapse — part of a broader retreat from risky financial assets in the face of rising interest rates — could seriously weaken the incentives that have made crypto one of the hottest corners of the tech world. No two tech manias are exactly alike. But the market collapse and the claims that it will not derail the crypto revolution recall another seminal moment in recent tech history: the dotcom boom and bust at the turn of the century. Both bubbles were sparked by a supposedly revolutionary technology that would weaken control over online activity by the political and business establishment, ushering in a decentralised online world in which power would flow to the people. In crypto’s case, something that began as a vision of digital money around bitcoin has broadened into a movement known as Web3. It holds that the same underlying blockchain technology, which records and tracks crypto assets, will support a new generation of user-controlled online services that will dethrone today’s internet giants. Decentralised finance is an umbrella term for a collection of crypto asset projects that aim to do away with a centralised intermediary — like a bank or an exchange — to provide financial services. They use a new form of distributed application, known as a DApp, to execute common services such as lending, savings accounts and trading coins. There are also close parallels in the financial busts. The total value of all cryptocurrencies peaked in November last year before falling around 70 per cent, cutting $2tn from their value. Bitcoin, which accounts for some 42 per cent of the $900bn that remains, may dominate the headlines, but many other digital assets make up the crypto world. In the eight months after dotcom stocks peaked in early 2000, publicly traded internet companies are estimated to have lost $1.7tn, or 60 per cent of their value. Stephane Kasriel, the head of commerce and financial technologies who oversees blockchain efforts at social media group Meta, is among those who argue that when the dust settles, crypto mania, like the dotcom bubble, will turn out to have been the manic precursor to a more stable and lasting tech revolution. “A lot of these technologies go through the same hype cycle,” he says, with early euphoria and speculation followed by a bust. But, he adds, like the web at the start of the century, the underlying blockchain technology is something that “solves a real problem for people” and will be “useful for the world in general for a very long time”. That is not a universally held belief. Exactly what that “something” is — or what uses it could be put to that are not already possible with today’s technology — is not absolutely clear. So far, crypto tech has been used mainly for financial speculation, criminal activity, decentralised finance or DeFi (which exists outside regulation) and the creation and trading of unique digital tokens called NFTs, which have been through their own boom and bust. “A lot of the language [about decentralisation] is an almost exact replica of what we talked about in the 1990s,” says Martha Bennett, who at the time was head of advanced technology at UK insurance group Prudential. But she points to a fundamental difference between the early days of the world wide web and Web3 now: “We already had lots of utility by 1995 — we had email, we had lots of information online. With Web3, we have none of that.” Bennett, who now analyses new technologies at Forrester Research, says it is probably still too early to judge whether anything lasting or useful will survive. But a growing chorus of critics in the tech world argue that — unlike with the dotcoms — the tech underlying crypto has no redeeming features at all. A group of 26 computer scientists and academics wrote to members of the US Congress in May to warn that the technology was “risky, flawed and unproven”. Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert and one of the authors, says that any application built to run on a blockchain would be more practical, cost-effective and secure if it was based on other technologies: “Whatever it is you’re doing, it’s better without blockchain,” he says. The crypto boom drew its power from new technology, anti-establishment social forces and powerful financial incentives that combined in an era of loose money to produce an explosive mix. With that era apparently over, it is now entering a challenging new phase. Summing up the case against crypto and Web3, Phil Libin, a computer scientist and former chief executive of Evernote, the note taking app, describes the forces that inflated the bubble as: “80 per cent greed, 20 per cent ideology and zero per cent technology”. A blockchain co-founded by Vitalik Buterin, a Canadian-Russian computer scientist, Ethereum is at the centre of Web3 efforts to turn blockchains into more than just a database of transitions. Its technology can hold assets, enables programmers to code functions for buying and selling into smart contracts, and also provides the building blocks for most DApps for finance. Ether, the token associated with Ethereum is the world’s second-most actively traded cryptocurrency. The enthusiasm for crypto in the tech world rests on a belief that blockchains — open, distributed databases that can in theory be updated by anyone — represent a new foundation for online activity. Public blockchains use specially designed “consensus mechanisms” so that participants can agree updates are accurate. Fans claim these blockchains — and the cryptocurrencies used to validate the updates — will be the foundation for a new set of online services in which users, rather than corporations or governments, are in control. Yet even Web3 advocates admit that existing blockchain technology is woefully inadequate when it comes to supporting mass online services. The Ethereum network, which is at the centre of much Web3 activity, can handle a maximum of only 30 transactions a second, while newer, faster networks such as Solana have yet to prove themselves. The technology is difficult to use for non-experts and is beset by unresolved privacy, security and legal questions. Supporters say this is the result of technological immaturity rather than any fundamental flaw. Juan Benet, chief executive of Protocol Labs, whose Filecoin network acts as a decentralised marketplace for computer storage, compares today’s blockchains to the early days of cloud computing. The cloud was already the subject of widespread interest in the tech industry in the 1990s, he says, but it “took 20 years to build” before it was seen as a serious alternative. A similar technological “maturation” lies ahead for crypto, he predicts. In the process, however, the ideal of decentralisation imagined by crypto enthusiasts risks being diluted to the point where there is little to distinguish it from the technology it is seeking to replace. One widely touted switch could see “proof of work” mechanisms (which involve “miners” competing to solve cryptographic puzzles to verify new entries on the blockchain and consume vast amounts of power) replaced by “proof of stake” systems (where people who already own a cryptocurrency control how the network is governed). By definition, proof of stake systems hand most of the power to the wealthiest, undermining the ideal of distributed power that crypto systems are meant to enshrine, says Libin. The new tech infrastructure being built on top of blockchains is designed to make them easier to use and able to handle many more transactions. But it also threatens to weaken their decentralised nature. It could give rise to a new set of dominant companies that act as the “gatekeepers” controlling access to the technology in the same way that the Big Tech companies rule today’s online world, says Bennett at Forrester. Any creeping centralisation of Web3’s supposedly distributed computing platform would echo the trajectory of the web that preceded it. The open communication protocols on which the internet is based prevent any government or organisation from exerting control. Yet the system has left plenty of opportunity for private companies to build empires on top of tech foundations that promised, but failed to deliver, a more democratic online world. This helps to explain why, despite the rhetoric that casts Web3 as an existential threat to the existing internet giants, companies such as Meta are dipping their toes into the blockchain pond. “It’s always been a combination of things that are centralised and things that are decentralised,” Kasriel says of the technology on which the social networking company, previously known as Facebook, is built. Its plans now include creating a blockchain that enables software developers to keep control of the digital content they want to post to Meta’s networks. In proof of work systems, groups known as miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles in order to validate transactions, with the winner earning rewards in the form of cryptocurrency. These systems, which include bitcoin, are widely criticised because of the huge amount of energy used in trying to compute the result. Proof of stake systems randomly select someone to validate transactions from among a group of people who already hold the cryptocurrency and have “staked” their holdings, or posted them as collateral, with the networks. This uses much less power than proof of work, but it concentrates control in the hands of the wealthiest crypto owners. Ethereum is in the middle of a long-delayed switch from proof of work to proof of stake. The company does not really need to use a blockchain for this idea, says Kasriel. At a technical level it could achieve the same result in other ways. But giving up control through a blockchain would help to assuage those who don’t trust Meta to look after their interests, he adds. Even so, critics such as Schneier argue that the shortcomings of the technology are so great that it has little practical use. And if the promise of a decentralised online world turns out to be largely illusory, then there is nothing left to recommend the technology. If serious doubts remain about the long-term usefulness of the technology behind Web3, there is less uncertainty about the forces the crypto boom has already unleashed. The combination of idealism and greed has been every bit as potent as the euphoria that ruled during the dotcom bubble. According to supporters, the large number of people already committed to the sector will make it impossible to ignore. “A rule of thumb on the internet,” says Avichal Garg at Electric Capital, an investment firm specialising in Web3 start-ups, “is that if 100mn people are doing something, then it is worth paying attention to.” At the heart of the mania are the cryptocurrencies and digital tokens that are embedded in blockchain networks. The willingness of people to ascribe value to these — either because, like bitcoin, they are believed to have some of the characteristics of money, or because they are central to online networks that may one day support new, decentralised digital economies — has propelled the boom in the cryptocurrency market. The soaring value of these digital assets provided a way to finance blockchain projects such as Cosmos and to attract talent to the industry. It has also drawn internet users to the first consumer services that are being built on blockchains. These include so-called “play to earn” games where participants have the chance to earn tokens that they can later sell on. These new financial incentives could solve a perennial problem faced by online consumer start-ups, says Vinod Khosla, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist: how to attract enough people to get a new service off the ground, triggering the network effects that make online services more valuable as more people start to use them. Recommended Critics argue that using tokens to spark online interaction gives users a financial motivation to take actions that were previously freed of commercial incentives. This could lead to a “financialisation” of online services that turns every interaction into a chance to profit. Ryan Wyatt, a former head of gaming at YouTube who now runs blockchain gaming company Polygon Studios, says this criticism fails to reflect the highly diverse nature of online services. Out of the huge number of people who play games online, only a relatively small number need to participate in blockchain-based games for them to be a success, he says. Yet while the rising prices of digital assets acted as a powerful draw on the way up, now that prices are falling there is a fear they could act as a big drag on the way down. The price collapse will also hit the finances of blockchain projects that have benefited from the rising value of their tokens. Many sell tokens to generate cash and hold their reserves in the form of cryptocurrencies, leaving them seriously exposed to a collapse in crypto prices. Backers still claim that a profound change in what users demand has occurred and that it is a phenomenon that will outlive the bubble. The expectations of a generation of internet users have already been changed by crypto, says Wyatt, who believes people will not accept online services that leave them without any control or a share in the profits. Organisations including Cosmos and Alchemy claim that collapsing crypto prices have not weakened the resolve of the developers building their networks. According to the believers, the fact that it is hard to anticipate the ultimate uses of the technology behind crypto and Web3 should not be a concern. After all, many of the things that underpin today’s online world — from Facebook’s social network to the mobile internet triggered by the iPhone and Amazon Web Services’ cloud computing platform — didn’t see the light of day until well after the dotcom bust. “If it takes 10 years to see the Amazon of Web3, that’s fine,” says Wyatt at Polygon Studios. “That’s a multitrillion dollar company that would be on-chain. I think we would be pretty happy with that.” ","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Richard Waters Hannah Murphy Scott Chipolina","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-07-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/fd5d2d6a-3c31-44f2-bec0-7c52262aa3fa","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F73415621-7c68-49b9-8fad-3cd143307843.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Schroders takes minority stake in digital assets-focused manager Forteus","INTRO":"FTSE 100 asset manager to explore issuing digital tokens to investors instead of traditional shares or fund units","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Schroders has bought a minority stake in Forteus, an investment manager focused on digital assets, to explore issuing digital tokens to investors. The FTSE 100-listed asset manager, which oversees £731.6bn on behalf of customers, said on Tuesday that it had invested in the Zurich-based company, which specialises in blockchain technology and digital investments. The deal is part of a push by Schroders to develop research in the sector and to form a strategy for tokenisation, the process of issuing digital tokens to investors instead of traditional shares or fund units. “We’ve seen peak mutual fund,” said Schroders chief executive Peter Harrison in an interview. He noted that money was shifting from mutual funds to personalised portfolios, adding that this would increase with the growing adoption of ledger technology. The investment comes as crypto markets have been nosediving, with analysts likening it to the 2008 financial crisis for the digital asset sector. Tightening central bank policy has led investors to flee high-risk assets, prompting a brutal sell-off in risky tokens since the beginning of the year. The total value of crypto markets has fallen from a peak of more than $3tn in November to less than $1tn, while bitcoin — the largest cryptocurrency — has shed about 70 per cent of its value. The market crash has returned crypto prices to levels not seen since 2017 and has stricken several large companies and projects, including crypto lender Celsius, which filed for bankruptcy in the US last week. Harrison said he was not concerned about the sell-off. “This deal is not about cryptocurrencies. It’s about how do we get tokenisation mainstream.” He said that the focus was on blockchain “as a means of ownership” rather than cryptocurrencies “as a means of payment”. Forteus is the fund management arm of Numeus Group, a digital asset investment firm based in Switzerland run by Nobel Gulati, former chief executive of Two Sigma Advisers. The deal comes as Britain’s asset management industry is pushing the government to establish a new class of fund employing blockchain technology. The Investment Association, the UK’s asset management trade body that oversees almost £10tn, is calling for the government and City regulator to work “at pace” to approve blockchain-traded funds. These would issue digital tokens to investors instead of traditional shares or fund units. Blockchain technology can open access to assets such as alternatives, usually the preserve of wealthy investors, because once they are tokenised the investment minimums can be lowered.

The dominance of non-fungible tokens in these markets has also drawn most of the attention. Many believe that the next big breakthrough will be to designate ownership for virtual goods in the metaverse. But what if NFTs could also provide solutions in cumbersome, archaic systems for securing property rights, thus unlocking value from tangible assets? Such possibly transformative uses of NFTs are only vaguely starting to take shape on the economic and legal horizons. Technically, they are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated. Unlike cryptocurrencies, they cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency. By “twinning” an NFT with a particular version of a digital work, it becomes possible to differentiate it from its myriad other versions and thus ascribe a distinctive value to it, conferring proof of ownership on a single identifiable holder. NFTs already represent and “tokenise” physical objects, items such as artworks and luxury goods, expanding the attributes of their ownership into the digital world and permitting more efficient and secure transactions. Experiments in real estate are now being undertaken as a new way of providing needed liquidity in a system that has historically been hostage to transaction costs. The fact that NFTs can act as immutable proof of ownership and provenance could help solve a persistent problem when it comes to property in developing countries. Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto argued early on about blockchain’s potential to establish a cost-effective mechanism for formalising property rights for the poor. This would, he estimates, unlock $10tn of formerly “dead capital” around the world. It also seems increasingly possible that the joint ownership and crowdsourcing investment of NFTs could be used to support the preservation of world heritage sites, national artistic masterpieces or threatened biodiversity zones. Practitioners are still trying to understand how exactly NFTs fit into or disrupt existing legal notions and, consequently, what the applicable legal and tax treatment should be. Fractional ownership and instruments for the syndication of property rights are not a new concept: NFTs are merely their latest avatar. The novelty, however, is that these blockchain-based tools provide the prospect of disintermediated (financially and administratively) new markets for creators and holders of otherwise non-marketable physical assets. This prospect raises important issues of governance. Even if each NFT representing a particular value stake in the associated asset can be easily and individually traded, what is the basic framework needed to guarantee the preservation and integrity of the underlying asset as a whole? When do they become security instruments? What are the rights of holders as regards the asset and what obligations do they have with respect to any other holders? Well-documented challenges remain elsewhere, including the reliability and security of blockchain, the interoperability of different blockchains and, extremely importantly, the big environmental footprint of NFT minting. Fraud and market manipulation are also on the rise. Regulators are hesitating as to the right approach, mindful of the need not to stifle innovation while attempting to exercise oversight. Neither the EU’s markets in crypto assets regulation nor the proposed US crypto bill make any explicit reference to NFTs. These technical, legal and regulatory considerations should be grabbing much more of the debate. It is not impossible that NFTs could become important new instruments of fractional asset ownership, well beyond digital art, and into the realm of more tangible repositories for creating and distributing wealth. For now, however, they remain in a state of flux.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Marina Niforos","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-06-20","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/85361539-2421-42e1-8194-7846f71b163a","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fdf03d2ce-9475-48bd-a7ec-38a82a46d0e1.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"No, Russia won’t replace Swift with the blockchain","INTRO":"Because don’t be daft, honestly.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Have you heard that Russia’s developing a blockchain platform for international payments to replace the current Swift system? There’s a good chance you have, but if you haven’t you soon will, because the story has been stuck in a holding pattern above the news agenda for weeks. It loomed back into view this morning via coinbro churnalism and tweets such as this one, from Watcher.Guru to its 1.1mn followers: JUST IN: Russian government organization has created a blockchain platform for international payments to replace the current Swift system. It all stems from an appearance by Rostec, Russia’s state-owned military technology developer, at a digitisation conference in Nizhny Novgorod that ran on the first three days of June. Rostec’s software battalion, Novosibirsk Institute of Software Systems (NIPS), used the event to announce “the CELLS industrial blockchain platform”. Here’s the press release fed through Google translate: One of the central elements of the [CELLS] platform has become a digital system for making payments in national currencies, which can provide a real alternative to SWIFT in international settlements. The multifunctional system provides international payments, multicurrency transactions, user identification and storage of digital currency. Blockchain technology in combination with certified cryptographic information protection tools provide a high level of IT solution reliability. “The digital payment system on the blockchain platform can be used as a full-fledged replacement for SWIFT, providing high speed, security and irrevocable transactions. The system will make it possible to switch to settlements in national currencies, eliminate the risk of sanctions and ensure the independence of the national financial policy for clearing participants ,” said Oleg Yevtushenko, Executive Director of Rostec Group. NIPS has some form with bold predictions. In 2019 it presented to the same conference a “roadmap for the development of blockchain technology in Russia” that involved chaining the entire machinery of state at a cost of up to 85bn rubles ($1.5bn). Council budgets, transport infrastructure, the industrial complex and municipal elections would all be put on distributed ledgers to somehow deliver an estimated economic benefit of up to 1.64tn rubles within five years. Deploying a platform such as Ethereum in the Kremlin “is not a sign of dependence on foreign solutions”, since access to the source code cannot be limited for political reasons, Kommersant quoted NIPS as saying in May 2019. Between that date and now, for perhaps obvious reasons, the focus has switched to a proprietary system. Not much information is in the public domain about the CELLS blockchain other than what’s on a product website. From that we learn it uses uses proof of authority mining, which does away with the whole competitive mining thing and relies on a small fleet of validators. There are benefits to this approach, including that transactions are nearly as quick, secure and power efficient as in a conventional database. The downside is a degree of centralisation that’s the opposite of blockchain’s theoretical USP, in return for a system that’s slightly worse than the one it replaces. The Swift cross-border money transfer network routes 42mn financial messages a day to connect more than 11,000 institutions and 4bn account holders in at least 200 countries. NIPS’s proposed replacement is arguably over-specified, reportedly handling up to 100,000 transactions per second, though capacity is really not the problem here. None of the hurdles is technical. It’s all about the Benjamins, as Claire Jones explains: About half of all global payments are made in dollars. Along with about 90 per cent of trade finance. When instructions are sent via networks such as Swift, many of those dollar payments need to be made between institutions that do not have accounts with one another. What that means is that a correspondent bank — probably with operations in the US, policed by the American authorities — will act as an intermediary.... Even for transactions that are legal, parties are unwilling to take the risk of alienating the US authorities by processing payments for businesses based in countries that have fallen foul of Washington. Which is the bottom line. And what are the chances that any non-Russian counterparty would adopt a mystery meat ledger that’s centrally controlled by a company that parades its tanks through Red Square every May 9? Ноль.

Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Friday In crypto land, breathless pitches about technologies that will transform the industry are 10-a-penny. For once, one that might partially justify the hype is around the corner. In the past few years conversations about the future of crypto usually alight on a semi-mythical event at an undetermined date known as the “Merge”, and involves Ethereum, one of the industry’s premier blockchain networks. It matters because it confronts one of the sharpest criticisms of crypto: that the industry guzzles vast amounts of energy when the planet desperately needs to reduce its consumption. After years of talk, the Merge is tentatively pegged for mid-September. There’s a bit to unpack, so first, the basics. The Ethereum blockchain is one of crypto’s great hopes because it aims to make digital ledgers more than a simple database for transactions. But like the bitcoin blockchain, it sucks up a lot of energy. The developers behind Ethereum have long talked about their solution, which is to change the way the transactions on the blockchain are verified. To use the industry jargon, it would move from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain. Ethereum would no longer be secured by energy-intensive mining, but by individuals (called “validators”) dedicating their own capital on the network itself. But will the shift work as intended? Alex de Vries — better known by his “Digiconomist” moniker — has high hopes, telling me “it’s hard to say how things will look . . . but a 99 per cent reduction in energy use seems realistic”. De Vries estimates that the Ethereum network’s carbon footprint is currently comparable to Finland’s. These hefty climate costs have prompted regulators to slam the proof-of-work system that underpins both Ethereum and bitcoin. Last year, EU lawmakers almost banned cryptocurrency mining outright, and should the Merge come off without a hitch, regulators in Sweden are already waiting in the wings to retrain their sights on the controversial industry. “Regulators are literally waiting for Ethereum to be successful in moving to proof of stake before cracking down on proof of work”, de Vries said. A meeting between Sweden’s financial services watchdog and environmental agency last year hints at some of the thinking. “If Ethereum is able to shift, we could legitimately request the same from bitcoin. We need to protect other crypto coins that are sustainable,” the minutes read, according to freedom of information requests* by news site netzpolitik.org. But it might be easier said than done. Bitcoin — which still uses a proof-of-work system — is by far the world’s most actively traded crypto token and, despite the recent crash, there are plenty of bitcoin defenders. Then, of course, bitcoin’s apparent success as a secure network has to be considered. In a crowded field of security failures, bitcoin has never been hacked, unlike a series of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies that allegedly represent the greener future of the industry. So it is not impossible that the Merge is a success but the criticism of crypto’s environmental impact doesn’t go away. It may even sharpen scrutiny laid down by regulators. I’d like to hear from you. Will the Merge change your view on Ethereum? And what does it mean for bitcoin’s future? Email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com. It’s been a difficult week for those who preach the immutable resistance of blockchains. After one digital token protocol called Nomad was compromised to the tune of $190mn, thousands of crypto wallets linked to the Solana network were “drained”. Crypto exchange Coinbase forged a deal with BlackRock, giving the asset management giant’s clients greater access to crypto. The partnership is the latest sign of traditional investors pivoting to digital assets, even after a dramatic sell-off across the crypto market. At a time when the likes of Robinhood and Coinbase are cutting back staff, Ripple is going full speed ahead on recruitment. After starting the year with roughly 500 employees, the company aims to increase its headcount to 850 by year-end. “The last 18 months or so have been our most successful and fastest growth period to date,” Ripple’s Europe managing director Sendi Young told me this week. Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor is stepping down from his role as chief executive of MicroStrategy after the software company reported a near $1bn impairment charge on account of its relentless bitcoin purchases over the past couple of years. Saylor believes his new role as executive chair will help him “focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy”. Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of prominent crypto platform Polygon, had some choice words that likely offered little comfort to those who lost funds in this week’s hack of wallets linked to Solana. “My heart goes out to Solana community members who lost their life savings in the ongoing attack. Stay strong, these are the growing pains the entire blockchain industry has to go through. These moments, if handled correctly, lead to a lot of strength for any ecosystem.” The Ethereum Merge looks set for next month, and crypto prices have risen in recent weeks. In the past month, bitcoin and ether, the native token on the Ethereum blockchain, have rallied by about 15 per cent and 45 per cent respectively. These points make this a good week to take stock of how much of the broader crypto market bitcoin and ether represent. According to data compiled by Crypto Compare, the industry’s two flagship cryptocurrencies make up 62 per cent of the broader crypto market. Interestingly, the crypto crash has done little to change things. Bitcoin remains firmly in the top spot with 43 per cent of market share, just as it was at the start of the year. Ethereum is at 19 per cent, down 2 percentage points year to date. *This newsletter has been amended to clarify that the meeting minutes became public as a result of freedom of information requests by netzpolitik.org.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Scott Chipolina","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-08-05","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/fa881a77-1e88-4982-99c9-0d64c37b6a8a","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F630a7ad3-a67e-4e6e-8482-9d6fe6120c09.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"OpenSea/NFTs: experimentation is no match for security","INTRO":"Platform for selling digital collectibles needs to provide a secure marketplace given that it charges for its services","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Undeterred by the collapse in cryptocurrencies, OpenSea is offering investors a new way to participate in non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. The marketplace company is allowing customers to buy these digital certificates of authenticity, often related to artworks or sporting triumphs, using multiple assets. The payment bundles may even include NFTs themselves. Using one NFT to buy another is of debatable value. It does little to improve liquidity. It could also create risky feedback loops, as in many other asset classes. Notional dollar values for NFTs could push each other upward in growing isolation from anchoring transactions in real greenbacks. NFTs are receipts for digital assets recorded with blockchains. Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, which are meant to confer ownership for online monkey cartoons, are among the best known. Bored Ape buyers have access to members-only social media. Last year, one simian NFT reportedly sold for $3.4mn. Funding for start-ups connected to NFTs reached $7.4bn in the first quarter of the year, according to PitchBook data. Investors hope NFTs have utility beyond Twitter profile pictures and a speculative price boom. The popularity of NFTs has transformed OpenSea. In January the marketplace raised $300mn at a $13.3bn valuation, up from $1.5bn six months earlier. Coinbase launched an NFT marketplace in April but has a fraction of OpenSea’s trades, according to Dune Analytics. OpenSea’s NFT trades are hailed as a tangible example of web3, touted as a decentralised financial wonderland. Of course, OpenSea is itself an intermediary. It charges a 2.5 per cent fee on transactions. But with cryptocurrencies crashing, NFT sales volumes have been falling too. Dune Analytics says OpenSea’s monthly trading volume almost halved between January and May, to $2.6bn. The sector has also been hit by an insider trading scandal, reports of NFT theft, and copyright problems. Artists say their work is sometimes plagiarised. OpenSea needs to focus on cleaning up scams. It may be uncomfortable with tightening its rules. These are, after all, not very decentralised. But OpenSea is charging for a service. Its first priority should be to provide a secure marketplace.

Most are foreseen accidents, though some may be engineered in their image. To safeguard the overall blockchain industry and crypto market, TRON DAO Reserve will withdraw 2.5 billion #TRX out of binance. That’s Tron, which is a blockchain network in the Ethereum model. It includes a $700mn-ish valued token, usdd, that has been among crypto’s most obvious targets for attack in recent weeks. Usdd (launched on May 5) is a decentralised algorithmic stablecoin that applies a near-identical arbitrage mechanism to Do Kwon’s Luna/Terra coin (which collapsed on May 10). Tron’s white paper for the coin was deleted and rewritten this month to add a promise of “guaranteed over-collateralisation using various mainstream cryptocurrencies”. (The old version is on Web. Archive.) Usdd finally broke the buck late last week: Justin Sun, Tron’s permanently online founder, has pinned the blame on the network’s native trx coin becoming a crowded short: Funding rate of shorting #TRX on @binance is negative 500% APR. @trondaoreserve will deploy 2 billion USD to fight them. I don\u0027t think they can last for even 24 hours. Short squeeze is coming. pic.twitter.com/VRExM6UK70 Sun is crypto’s most tenacious publicity hound. A vanity website leans heavily on his role as “Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the WTO in Grenada”, which last week allowed him to talk blockchain at the WTO’s Ministerial Conference. (Tourism, which pre-pandemic provided more than half of Grenada’s GDP, wasn’t mentioned.) In 2019 Sun paid $4.6mn to have dinner with Warren Buffett, then cancelled, then on rearranging gave Buffett a phone loaded with bitcoin. A year later he was sucking the exhaust fumes of the NFT high-art bandwagon while self-identifying as a meme-stock bagholder. Any entrepreneur so reliant on self publicity will be vulnerable to the law of diminishing returns. That’s how it was with Sun’s earlier attempts to shore up confidence, with reserve injections providing no more than short-term relief. The market response to a withdrawal of deposits for the sanctity of crypto has been much more positive: That’s because stated reserves aren’t Tron’s problem. The plummeting value of its native token is basically irrelevant to everyone but hodlers, because the usdd stablecoin is (on paper) more than fully collateralised by Tron’s $1bn of USD Coin and $140mn of Tether reserves. Tron’s problem is that it’s a lobster pot. There’s no redemption mechanism for usdd. Once you’re in, there’s no way out other than through secondary market trading. The only arbitrage opportunity on offer for usdd hodlers is to swap the tokens for a dollar’s worth of newly minted trx. Sun and the Tron grand council are the only ones with direct access to the reserves, so can choose whether to restore the peg or flip in and out of whatever asset will generate the most noise. Pulling Tron’s trx deposits out of Binance therefore looks like an attempt to choke off liquidity in what is the crypto equivalent of a very heavily shorted small cap. It’s not a Terra/Luna arbitrage breakdown or a rug pull, though their similarity of appearance is probably not coincidental. It has a lot more in common with the simple meme stock-style manipulation of supply and demand. Sun, however, has been very keen to make the shorters think otherwise: Deploying more capital - steady lads Deploying more capital - steady lads Further reading: The many escapes of Justin Sun — The Verge","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Bryce Elder","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-06-15","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/3810bc35-b9da-47b2-93ad-2ec2899c869b","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F5938ac41-c853-4805-ba71-d7227fd09877.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"CBDCs now hold wholesale appeal for central bankers","INTRO":"The slow nature of current cross-border payments systems creates an opportunity for blockchain technology","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Elites rarely welcome upstarts. So when financiers and policymakers recently gathered in Davos for the World Economic Forum meeting, crypto schadenfreude was in the mountain air. Earlier this year, when crypto was booming, numerous digital assets companies booked space on the Davos promenade to advertise their power and brands. But just beforehand, the terra and luna stablecoins collapsed, and the price of tokens such as bitcoin tumbled. Cue establishment chatter about a “crypto winter” — and general sneering about digital Ponzi schemes. But amid the sniping, investors should have taken note of another important — if less discussed — theme in the digital asset debate: namely that the world’s big central banks are becoming more interested in using distributed ledger technology, or blockchains, themselves. This is not because they like the retail central bank digital currencies that normally grab headlines. Yes, the mighty People’s Bank of China is testing this, along with some smaller emerging market countries, including Jamaica. The European Central Bank is pondering it too, as François Villeroy de Galhau, the French central bank governor told Davos. However, most western central bankers are wary of creating retail CBDC — ie letting citizens hold digital central bank cash — because they fear the implications of being responsible for their data and/or dislike the idea of disintermediating commercial banks. The crash of terra has also reduced any sense of urgency. So, too, the fact that mobile payments are making it increasingly easy, fast and efficient for citizens to use fuddy-duddy fiat currency. But what is sparking establishment interest is using CBDC for wholesale cross-border payments, to move funds between financial institutions and central banks. “We believe in wholesale [CBDC] and we have run nine experiments [with these],” de Galhau told the WEF, noting that although “retail CBDC is where the public interest is”, this misses the point. Or as Ravi Menon of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which has been experimenting with CBDC for seven years, recently told an important central bank meeting in Zurich: “We are barking up the wrong tree with retail CBDCs. The tree we should be barking up is wholesale cross-border CBDCs.” This might not be what most politicians or ordinary citizens want to hear, given the arcane inner workings of wholesale markets. But it matters, since the shift in emphasis is driven by two key factors. One is a recognition that current cross-border payment systems are achingly slow; so much so that Roberto Campos Neto, the Brazilian central bank governor, recently told an IMF meeting — only partly in jest — that it has been faster to move money from São Paulo to London by boarding a plane with bags of cash than using official bank channels. However, if central banks “scale up [wholesale CBDC] and achieve atomic settlement you can make cross payments at close to zero cost and the benefits are huge”, as Menon said in Zurich. Or as Kristalina Georgieva, head of the IMF, told Davos: “CBDC are not yet internationalised, but this is where the opportunity is.” There is, in other words, a genuine use case. The second attraction is cultural: a wholesale CBDC can be organised by a club of central bank technocrats without needing much debate with politicians, or voters. This does not make it easy to create wholesale CBDCs on a large scale. Far from it. The technology hurdles remain daunting. Wholesale CBDCs may also require central banks to cede a little sovereignty since using distributed digital ledgers means they no longer control fiat currencies in the traditional manner. That requires mutual trust. However, the central banking tribe that convenes around the Bank for International Settlements in Basel does generally trust each other — and more than their own domestic politicians. More than a dozen cross-border wholesale CBDC experiments have occurred, not just with the French and Singaporean central banks, but countries such as Switzerland, South Africa, Thailand, China and the United Arab Emirates. It is not clear (yet) whether these can scale up. One key block, as Georgieva stressed in the Zurich and Davos meetings, is that there is still no “interoperability” between these separate pilots. But if this does emerge — ie scaleable systems are created — there would be further interesting implications. One is that future historians might conclude that the most significant long-term consequence of distributed ledger technologies for finance was not bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Instead, it lay in deeply dull corners of banking, like wholesale payments. They might also decide that while distributed ledgers were presented as a tool that could rip power away from establishment institutions, this innovation actually reconsolidated them in some ways. The Davos elite is usurping the dream. Of course, bitcoin maximalists would retort that this is precisely why CBDCs are a bad (if not unworkable) idea; their assumption is that central banks cannot continue to hoard monetary power. Maybe so. But the real moral of all these discussions is that “blockchain” can mean a multitude of different — and sometimes contradictory — things. gillian.tett@ft.com Sign up for Gillian Tett’s Moral Money newsletter, ft.com/newsletters ","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Gillian Tett","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-06-02","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/610e111e-71a2-4182-ad30-da49530a12f6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F43091ea7-8865-46b7-9d9c-3257505f9a20.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The crypto plan to save our souls","INTRO":"Imagine a Web3 blocktopia where ‘souls and communities convene bottom-up’","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Packed with references to DAO-on-DAO “vampire attacks” and sentences like “we also do not assume non-transferability of Souls across humans”, a whimsical paper on the future of Web3 from Eric Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin makes for quite the ride. As far as these technologists are concerned, the world lacks any hopeful vision of the future. “We’re heading either for a Peter Thiel-inspired anarcho-capitalist dystopia or a Chinese government-style top-down surveillance system,” Weyl told FT Alphaville. Web3’s “radically democratic” horizontality constitutes a potential third way. Yet the internet’s ill-defined next iteration needs plenty of work if it’s going to supplant what we already have, the trio write. At its core, Web3 today still “centres around expressing transferable, financialised assets”. What it lacks is any way of “encoding social relationships of trust”. Pseudonyms are great, in other words, but they don’t inspire confidence. “Persistent identities” are a must. Enter “soulbound tokens”, or SBTs for short. (Ohlhaver acknowledges that a rebrand may be required. ) As in World of Warcraft, where “soulbound” items are those that can’t be traded with other players, SBTs represent similarly non-transferable (and revocable) credentials. In theory, these would be issued by institutions like universities, companies and foundations then deposited in users’ wallets (aka “Souls”) as proof of past achievements. Or, as the paper puts it: Imagine a world where most participants have Souls that store SBTs corresponding to a series of affiliations, memberships, and credentials. For example, a person might have a Soul that stores SBTs representing educational credentials, employment history, or hashes of their writings or works of art. In their simplest form, these SBTs can be “self-certified,” similar to how we share information about ourselves in our CVs. But the true power of this mechanism emerges when SBTs held by one Soul can be issued — or attested — by other Souls, who are counterparties to these relationships. Once users can stake their reputation on the blockchain, the possibilities are endless. Forget decentralised finance. A truly “decentralised society” — where “souls and communities convene bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to produce plural network goods across different scales” — would finally be within reach. Grasping the damn thing is another matter entirely, however. “I don’t expect most people will buy into our long-range vision,” Weyl said. “We need to give people breadcrumbs to follow. We want to get to a world where people are issuing SBTs, but they’re not going to do that because they want to build a radical future. That’s not what’s going to appeal to them immediately.” So what might? One example appears early in the paper: An ecosystem of SBTs could unlock a censorship-resistant, bottom-up alternative to top-down commercial and “social” credit systems. SBTs that represent education credentials, work history, and rental contracts could serve as a persistent record of credit-relevant history, allowing Souls to stake meaningful reputation to avoid collateral requirements and secure a loan. Loans and credit lines could be represented as non-transferable but revocable SBTs, so they are nested amongst a Soul’s other SBTs — a kind of non-seizable reputational collateral — until they are repaid and subsequently burned, or better yet, replaced with proof of repayment. What could possibly go wrong? Erm, quite a lot, as it turns out. The authors admit their bottom-up social credit system could be used to “automate red-lining of disfavoured social groups or even target them for cyber or physical attack, enforce restrictive migration policies or make predatory loans.” But hey, what’s one more dystopia between friends? DeSoc does not need to be perfect to pass the test of being acceptably non-dystopian; to be a paradigm worth exploring it merely needs to be better than the available alternatives. Whereas DeSoc has possible dystopian scenarios to guard against, web2 and existing DeFi are falling into patterns that are inevitably dystopian. FTAV asked David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50-foot Blockchain, what he made of the prospect of a blockchain-based social credit system designed to facilitate unsecured lending. Suffice to say, he was far from impressed. Everything about the “soulbound” paper is fractally wrong and bad. Even if any of this could actually work, it’d be the worst idea ever. What Buterin wants to implement here is a binding permanent record on all people, on the blockchain. It’s Black Mirror’s “Fifteen Million Merits”, except he seriously thinks this is a good idea. Considered as a tech startup, Ethereum is a huge success. This does not mean any other idea from its creator is worth taking seriously, except as a threat. Equally sceptical was Martin Walker, director of banking and finance at the Centre for Evidence-Based Management. The simple answer is don’t use a blockchain or lend money to people hiding behind a pseudonym. It really is that simple. This is where [Buterin’s] lack of understanding of the real world comes into things. For example unsecured lending (which can obviously go wrong) works because: 1. Banks make great efforts to identify who they are lending money to 2. Banks understand the borrowing history and other information about the credit history of the potential borrower. 3. Loan agreements (particularly for large amounts) are very detailed and have all sorts of covenants and conditions. They specify the seniority of debt, what sort of information the borrower has to provide the lender, conditions on how much other debt they can take on etc. What Buterin, Weyl and Ohlhaver have done is come up with a complex solution to a problem they created, Walker said. Soulbound tokens, however clever, do little to mitigate the risk of a loan going bad. “I see the uncollateralised lending thing, even though it could go wrong in several ways, as potentially better than our current lending environment,” Weyl said. Extending credit on the blockchain isn’t what excites him or his co-authors, he added — it’s simply “an illustration to people that are super close to the existing ecosystem” of how SBTs could be used to do the “basic things they want to do”. And yet there remains a chance that less high-minded actors confuse the means with the end. The road to web3 will be paved with good intentions.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"George Steer","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-06-01","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/c10bc6f7-abbe-45dc-9367-042186c3336f","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fd5d8c6ff-0bce-43bb-aa1c-857ae28b8f6b.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Luna crash sends a chill through decentralised finance market","INTRO":"Ether has lost a third of its value over the past month as confidence in DeFi hits ‘historically low levels’","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Traders are shifting away from investments linked to decentralised finance, in the latest sign of how the $40bn collapse of cryptocurrency luna has sent shockwaves through a key portion of the digital asset market. Ether, the world’s second-biggest crypto token and a proxy for sentiment on the $100bn DeFi market, has shed more than a third of its value over the past month. Its fall is significantly more severe than the 23 per cent decline for bitcoin, the oldest and most valuable digital token by market value. Many crypto advocates consider DeFi to be one the most promising innovations in the digital asset industry, with projects aiming to operate without centralised intermediaries such as banks through the use of automated systems that dole out control to the biggest stakeholders. However, the failure last month of luna, and its linked stablecoin terraUSD, highlighted the risks of investing in DeFi projects and the potential for catastrophic flaws in the design of programmes that underpins their operations. “Confidence in the crypto ecosystem and decentralised finance remains at historically low levels” after the breakdown of terra and luna, said Sipho Arntzen, an analyst at Swiss private bank Julius Baer, adding that, “we expect no swift recovery for now”. Stablecoins act as lubricants of transactions in DeFi markets, and the wipeout of terra was seen as a particularly strong blow to confidence in the sector. Terra was designed to match the value of the US dollar through a financial relationship with sister token luna, in contrast to other major stablecoins that claim to be backed by portfolios of reserves. Ether’s fall is a sign of how the crash in terra and luna has sent a chill through the wider DeFi sector, analysts said. The token price is tied to investors’ expectations for the future of DeFi since many of the computerised financial apps in the decentralised market are built on the Ethereum blockchain where ether resides. Investors drained $56mn from Ethereum investment products in May, taking this year’s total net outflows to $250mn, according to data from digital asset manager Coinshares. Bitcoin products, in contrast, have drawn $369mn of net inflows in 2022. “As [Ethereum] primarily aims to provide the infrastructure for the emerging world of decentralised apps, we believe that these drawdowns are symptomatic of a loss in confidence in the broader DeFi ecosystem,” Arntzen said. Recommended Some investors argue the hit to ether also reflects a reassessment of the future demand for multiple facets of the crypto industry, such as digital collectibles known as non-fungible tokens and borrowing and lending protocols, which also often use the Ethereum network. “Ethereum, like Netflix or any stock, reflects expectation of future demand,” said Ilan Solot, partner at Tagus Capital. He said investors were doubting the level of future demand on the Ethereum network as the economic outlook darkens. “If the Federal Reserve is tightening [monetary policy], the world is in recession, and people need to pay $4.5 per gallon of gas, they’ll have less to invest in DeFi or spend on blockchain games,” he added. Investors have also soured on risky assets more broadly, said Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush. He said DeFi was “caught in a general risk-off tornado”. Derivatives markets suggest that investors remain nervous about the near-term prospects of ether, despite optimism about bitcoin’s path. While options markets signal a positive tone for bitcoin over the next month, investors see difficult trading conditions for ether on the same time horizon, said Adam Farthing, chief risk officer for Japan at market maker B2C2. “The market has become much more cautious of ether due to its recent performance and in a way it hasn’t for bitcoin,” he said. Bitcoin still enjoys a reputation among some investors as a hedge against inflation, despite losing more than half its value from its November high. Another challenge facing Ethereum is the network’s long-awaited shift to a different kind of blockchain system called proof of stake. This shift is expected to relieve frustrations surrounding Ethereum’s longstanding transaction fees and clunky processing speeds. Ingo Fiedler, co-founder of Blockchain Research Lab, said Ethereum’s blockchain shift “could go wrong as any code change is risky for any software”. He added that there may be unknown risks that will come to light only once Ethereum’s new system is tested in the real world. “We saw this flight to safety from terra to [rival stablecoin USD Coin] and into assets people perceive to be more established, and so I think that anything that’s new, or overly technical, will probably have people a little standoffish,” said Teana Baker-Taylor, vice-president of policy and regulatory strategy at crypto firm Circle.

Dashed is the notion that crypto assets are immune to shifts in macroeconomic fundamentals and serve as hedges against inflation. The mayhem has shone a harsh light on decentralised blockchain-based finance, as weaknesses in its basic precepts are coming into focus. For all its promise in democratising finance and broadening financial access, the emerging reality suggests a concentration of economic power, while the risks fall largely on those investors least able to handle them. But the crypto shakeout might help the long-term viability of blockchain-based finance by damping rampant speculation while prodding regulators to act expeditiously. Decentralised finance, or DeFi, is built on three principles. It features decentralised architectures, with public digital ledgers maintained on multiple computers and synchronised in real time. Decentralised trust involves the validation of transactions through public consensus mechanisms rather than by trusted intermediaries. Finally, and crucially, decentralised governance is underpinned by a collective interest in maintaining the system’s integrity and security. Bitcoin is a good (albeit primitive) example of DeFi. These principles are proving incompatible with functionality. Cryptocurrencies that work well as mediums of exchange are in fact centralised. Stablecoins are typically backed up by reserves of fiat currencies, issued by a private party that validates transactions and keeps centralised accounts, and with operating rules set by the issuer. Meanwhile, algorithmic stablecoins, ostensibly backed by other cryptocurrencies but still managed by their issuers, have stumbled badly in recent weeks. Decentralisation is proving illusory even in crypto assets such as bitcoin. A handful of computing consortiums now dominate the process of validating bitcoin transactions and ownership is concentrated as well. The very design of some systems, which are more efficient than bitcoin’s inefficient “proof of work” consensus protocol, is leading to concentration of governance. “Proof of stake”, an alternative consensus mechanism which requires users to pledge a “stake” of digital currency, allows for quicker decentralised validation of a far greater volume of transactions than proof of work. But this system is also vulnerable to capture by a small group that acquires a large stake. Although it is not in the group’s interest to compromise the system’s integrity, they could shift the rules to their advantage. Cryptocurrencies and DeFi are useful under authoritarian regimes and in societies where the government machinery has broken down. For countries such as El Salvador and the Central African Republic, the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender provides a better alternative than any domestic currency could. But DeFi’s promise of creating new financial products and services, broadening access and undercutting traditional financial intermediaries remains a mirage. Existing institutions are co-opting the new technologies. Permissioned blockchains controlled by one or a small group of institutions are helping to improve traditional finance, but in turn could concentrate power among a choice few institutions and limit competition. Much of DeFi involves fully or even over-collateralised financial instruments. This helps maintain trust and financial stability but is hardly conducive to broadening access. After all, lack of collateral is a major stumbling block for indigent households and small-scale entrepreneurs seeking access to credit and other financial products. Moreover, the lack of financial literacy and investor protection has inflicted heavy losses on unsophisticated investors who failed to understand the risks (or ignored them) and invested heavily in crypto assets. Regulators must act swiftly to head off the risks associated with decentralisation, while limiting unintended concentration of power. They must also corral DeFi products and services that have escaped oversight because of their technological novelty. The notion of community self-interest leading to self-correcting mechanisms that limit risks, and contentions that these products are by design safe and secure, are not tenable. A well-designed dose of regulatory oversight might be just the tonic needed to bring stability to this sector, prevent it from exacerbating existing inequities and allow us to glean the benefits of these new technologies while limiting the risks.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Eswar Prasad","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-05-31","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/16a16b95-cb76-41cb-91ff-1da746642749","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7ea3f1eb-6596-44fd-8c07-a379e571b0f9.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Money Clinic Podcast: Surviving the ‘Crypto Crash’","INTRO":"As two young investors reveal the extent of their crypto losses, could more be done to protect consumers?","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In the past few weeks, the crypto industry has been shaken by a $40bn wipeout with many so-called “stablecoins” proving themselves to be anything but. The problems started with Terra and Luna, a linked set of digital tokens popular with crypto traders, but the growing fallout has hit the value of more established cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. On the Money Clinic podcast this week, presenter Claer Barrett talks to two young investors who have lost significant sums of money dabbling in unregulated assets. In Bangalore, 29-year-old Subbaiah could only watch in horror as his $7,000 crypto holdings were reduced to a few hundred dollars following the collapse of Luna. Not only has he lost his life savings, he still has to repay money he borrowed on credit cards to boost his trades. In London, 34-year-old listener Dan has seen thousands of pounds wiped off his holdings in bitcoin and ether. Although he had limited his stakes to a small percentage of his overall portfolio, the crash has shaken his faith in crypto’s long-term investment potential. Scott Chipolina, the FT’s digital assets correspondent, and Ilan Solot, a partner at crypto group Tagus Capital, discuss what the future could hold for crypto as an asset class, what more could be done to protect consumers — and the steps investors can take to protect themselves.

The French bank has joined a blockchain-powered network run by its US rival, which has already attracted more than $300bn of deals since its launch in December. The arrangement represents the first steps in efforts to use digital tokens in one of the crucial links of the global financial system. The repurchase, or repo, market is used by investors to borrow high-quality assets for a couple of days, and by central banks to conduct their monetary policies. Three-quarters of deals are backed by government bonds, according to the Bank for International Settlements, making the market a key source of high-quality collateral for banks to fund their balance sheets or find the funds to support their derivatives positions. JPMorgan’s blockchain allows banks to lend out US government bonds for a few hours as collateral, without the bonds leaving their balance sheets. Post-crisis regulatory requirements demand that banks hold large amounts of liquid assets — which can be bought and sold easily even during times of market stress — such as Treasuries as a safety buffer. By tokenising these assets banks can temporarily turn them into collateral for a few hours, but without lowering their safety buffers, which are calculated at the end of each day. The token represents a digital version of a Treasury and borrowers can exchange it for cash. Details such as the length of the loan and settlement time are governed by a smart contract, which ensures that the cash is in the borrower’s account and that collateral locked up against loans is released at the end of the deal. More than $300bn worth of such short-term loans have taken place on JPMorgan’s blockchain technology platform Onyx Digital Assets since December 2020. Joe Bonnaud, global markets chief operating officer and head of engineering at BNP Paribas, said the two main-use cases for the bank were securities financing and intraday repo. “This is not just proof-of-concept work, we see this as part of our efforts to utilise the technology for the whole trading and operations lifecycle as the market evolves,” he added. Scott Lucas, head of markets DLT at JPMorgan, said that the bank was exploring other fixed-income assets against which traders could borrow. “We are looking at broadening the set of eligibility criteria in addition to US treasuries,” Lucas said. More participants are joining the platform, including banks and their clients from Europe, the UK and Asia. JPMorgan has made a big push into digital assets in recent years despite its chief executive Jamie Dimon often hitting a critical note about digital assets such as bitcoin. The bank’s Onyx unit has been experimenting with deploying blockchain technology across traditional markets, with a former senior executive in the division Christine Moy recently noting that JPMorgan was the first bank to provide regulated crypto exchanges with bank accounts. In mid-February, JPMorgan also became the first major bank to set up a presence in the metaverse. Aside from broadening its collateral criteria, the bank is also looking at ways it could provide its professional clients with access to new markets. Tyrone Lobban, head of Onyx Digital Assets at JPMorgan said that the bank was also exploring the possibility of using Onyx as a gateway to decentralised finance markets for institutional investors.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Eva Szalay","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-05-23","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/422ad311-846e-4a0b-9c43-e6008800fc6b","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F17200f17-4874-4284-bb47-b379541fb75f.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Big banks like blockchain","INTRO":"And readers reply on bear markets","DETAILED_CONTENT":"This article is an on-site version of our Unhedged newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday Good morning. Ethan here; Rob’s out sick. All eyes were on JPMorgan’s investor conference yesterday. On top of raising its 2022 interest income target, it put in a much-needed good word for the health of the consumer. Consumer credit, executives said, largely looks strong. JPMorgan stock rose 6 per cent, dragging the market up. Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and ethan.wu@ft.com. “It’s blockchain, not bitcoin” was something you used to hear more often. The idea was that bitcoin was a mostly trivial project with an interesting technology at its heart. Enterprising companies would extract the value blockchain had to offer and bitcoin would become irrelevant. But as crypto expanded past bitcoin, people dropped the refrain. Google searches for “blockchain not bitcoin” peaked in 2017. Five years on, here’s a story from the FT’s Eva Szalay: BNP Paribas has joined JPMorgan in using digital tokens for short-term trading in [repo] markets . . .  JPMorgan’s blockchain allows banks to lend out US government bonds for a few hours as collateral, without the bonds leaving their balance sheets. Post-crisis regulatory requirements demand that banks hold large amounts of liquid assets — which can be bought and sold easily even during times of market stress — such as Treasuries as a safety buffer. By tokenising these assets banks can temporarily turn them into collateral for a few hours, but without lowering their safety buffers, which are calculated at the end of each day. The token represents a digital version of a Treasury and borrowers can exchange it for cash. Details such as the length of the loan and settlement time are governed by a smart contract, which ensures that the cash is in the borrower’s account and that collateral locked up against loans is released at the end of the deal. More than $300bn worth of such short-term loans have taken place . . . since December 2020. If you’re a long-term holder of (say) ethereum, is this good news for you? It doesn’t look like it. What it looks like is a mainstream institution using blockchain in a way that won’t do anything to encourage adoption of any cryptocurrency. Unlike most popular tokens, JPMorgan’s blockchain is “permissioned”, meaning it gets to select who can participate in the network. It is, in other words, not decentralised. Ethereum-style “smart contracts” are involved, but that’s about it. There is one theory of how this could benefit the crypto ecosystem, though. The idea is that once banks start trading a few assets as tokens, the efficiency gains will prove enticing enough that they’ll want to move other assets on to a blockchain. Some will go to private blockchains such as JPMorgan’s, but existing public chains such as ethereum can compete for that business too. Perhaps public blockchains could start looking better than private ones. As one proponent of this “asset tokenisation” idea explained to me: The banks are going to effectively disintermediate themselves. Not happily, there’s going to be a big battle, but that’s ultimately the direction we’re going in. One important difference between JPMorgan’s blockchain and a public one, however, is the law. JPMorgan can sign agreements with its partners laying out what happens if there’s a glitch or dispute — smart contracts backed by dumb contracts. Are smart contracts on the open internet legally enforceable? It’s unclear. The larger point is that if decentralised crypto — as opposed to a blockchain run by a bank — is going to play a big role in markets, that will involve dealing with some very centralised institutions. Yesterday’s letter made the point that a bear market is a time for greed. Long-term prospective returns are improving. As signs of capitulation and indiscriminate selling emerge, so do buying opportunities. But a number of readers cautioned that we are likely to be a very long way from capitulation. A bubble that took more than a decade to inflate will take more than a few months to deflate. One FT commenter wrote: I fear that when all is said and done, we will look back at these times and say “remember how [at] minus 20 per cent we thought we were close to capitulation? The adjustment was barely starting”. About 100 days since the S\u0026P 500 peaked in January, another reader, Paul Hodges, looked back at how long it took past overvalued markets in 1928 and 1998 to bottom out: We expect it to take a similar 650-700 days to bottom — with obviously some major rallies, or “false dawns”, on the way. Brian Coleman, a former Goldman Sachs trader, argued that the standard bear market playbook may not work this time. “This does not feel like a traditional bear market. It’s been eerily orderly”, with corporate results and economic conditions not yet consistent with recession. It might be, he suggests, that what we are seeing is not, or not only, a bubble deflating but a shift in market paradigms, with a generation of low interest rates, globalisation, growth and relatively free markets coming to an end. The end of the coronavirus pandemic, with all its economic peculiarities, muddies the picture further. In all, history may be a poor guide to what happens next. He thinks we need to “focus on known unknowns”: If there is an elephant left in the room, it has to be (as always) in opaque parts of the markets. And the last man standing in this regard seems to be privates [private equity and debt]. We have all read about privates not wanting to test valuations, so they raise convertibles etc. Let’s see where that goes . . .  Our friend Dec Mullarkey at SLC Management is more optimistic: The sell-off has been broad and deep as investors and companies handicap how aggressive the Fed will be . . . History suggests these monetary episodes don’t end well, but equity markets are pricing a very nasty outcome with an overwhelming number of industries getting pummeled . . . The sell-off has been remarkably non-discriminating. But markets generally need a macro reason to turn. A quick retracement in inflation would help. Therefore, could be a sideways market for a while. To be more optimistic, what we need to see is “a hint that investors are becoming more discriminating on value as they pore over the wide swath of beat-up valuations”. And on Monday, we saw one such hint, as bank stocks rallied after JPMorgan raised its outlook for interest income, “an indicator of a conservative quality buyer deciding the dividend yield looks attractive given the backdrop of solid balance sheets. Feels like an encouraging step, indicating investors are becoming more comfortable picking over areas that have been savaged.” Rana Foroohar is sick of Davos.

The maggot-infested meal struck a chord with the disgruntled Shanghai public weeks into an indefinite lockdown without access to basic food and medical supplies. One student penned an angry response that quickly became a symbol of silent resistance, spreading across social media platforms. Censors deleted reposts of his outburst on the microblogging site Weibo, but the expletive-laden message was immortalised online after being turned into a small piece of digital art preserved on the blockchain. The incident spawned a series of non-fungible tokens, a form of digital artwork, which have spread during the Shanghai lockdown as a way to preserve criticism of the city’s Omicron outbreak beyond the reach of censors. China’s censors have been at the forefront of the information battle during the country’s worst coronavirus outbreak in two years. They have systematically erased critical articles and posts on mainstream social media sites about the heavy burden of the strict lockdown measures. But the growing popularity of blockchain technology has presented a fresh challenge to the country’s censorship regime. Once data is sent to a blockchain network, it cannot be deleted or altered by higher authorities. The country’s internet police worked in a frenzy to erase the viral “Voice of April” video from domestic social media, a six-minute protest video documenting the suffering experienced by people in Shanghai cooped up at home. Just as the video was taken down from Weibo and the messaging app WeChat, tech-savvy netizens uploaded snapshots of the video to the blockchain, casting them into NFTs. “Censors cannot delete information from the blockchain,” said Barney Tan, head of the school of information systems and technology management at UNSW Sydney. One Chinese blockchain enthusiast said the technology has become more user-friendly in the past few years, making it easier to upload and read articles on the decentralised database. “People have been posting critical articles on the blockchain, so the government cannot delete them. It’s happening more now because blockchain technology is getting better,” the person added, who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. But Tan noted that even though censors cannot scrub out information from the blockchain, “they can still block access to it” by preventing people from sharing links on social media. Chinese citizens have found creative ways to adapt to online life under censorship. The blockchain enthusiast noted that in many of his WeChat groups, friends were sharing censored articles flipped upside down to avoid algorithmic screening. However, censors are typically only one step behind, quickly discovering the attempts to avoid censorship and ensuring that new leaks of sensitive information do not spark wider online protests. The goal is to prevent critical posts “from becoming viral or politically mobilised,” explained Rogier Creemers, an expert on China’s digital technology at Leiden University. Liu Lipeng, who used to work as a censor for Weibo before moving to the US, said censors do not solely rely on deleting posts. “Now they also spread fear” to stop sensitive information leaking online, he said. In Shanghai, which is now in its eighth week of lockdown, residents have recorded videos of pandemic workers warning them against spreading “false rumours” about life under lockdown. Liu said the measures had stifled public discussion in Shanghai. China’s censorship has been more effective during the financial city’s current lockdown than during the initial outbreak in Wuhan two years ago, Liu added. He noted that several prominent critics and whistleblowers emerged during the early months of the lockdown, including writer Fang Fang and doctors Ai Fen and Li Wenliang. “In Shanghai, no one dares to speak up publicly,” Liu said. This month, a leaked article from a prominent Shanghai law scholar condemning the city’s lockdown policies as unconstitutional appeared to break the silence. Professor Tong Zhiwei from Shanghai’s East China University of Political Science and Law warned that the city’s lockdown measures would lead to “some kind of legal disaster”. Recommended “Pandemic protection needs to be balanced with ensuring people’s rights and freedoms,” he wrote, casting doubt on the legality of some of the city’s heavy-handed measures, including forcing residents living in the same apartment block as a positive Covid-19 case to move into centralised quarantine facilities. Tong’s article circulated on Weibo and WeChat for several hours before censors deleted it. But by that time, it had already been permanently etched into the blockchain. The article is still visible to people in China with the technological knowhow and time to find it. But experts said that from a censorship perspective, in an age where people are inundated with information, it is enough that the sensitive information has been banished to an inaccessible corner of the internet. “The information control system is never going to work perfectly. But in China, it works well enough to limit information to a small number of computer nerds,” said Creemers. “From the perspective of regime integrity and stability, the censors have reached their goal,” he added.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Eleanor Olcott Gloria Li","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-05-19","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/04f5fb11-f635-45b0-a067-96756e01af19","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fa68d65b2-d513-4acf-9949-7e2783669626.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Nomura prepares to launch crypto subsidiary","INTRO":"Japan’s largest investment bank is setting up unit with 100 staff by 2024","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Nomura is to launch a new company to help institutional clients diversify into cryptocurrency, decentralised finance and non-fungible tokens, despite a recent run of volatility in the crypto market that has raised fundamental questions over its safety for investors. According to people with knowledge of the company’s plan, Japan’s largest investment bank will combine a number of digital asset services under a single wholly-owned subsidiary that will have a staff of about 100 by the end of 2024. Last week, Nomura successfully executed its first bitcoin futures and options trades on Chicago-based futures exchange CME by DRW’s crypto-trading arm Cumberland. The unveiling of Nomura’s plans, which have been under discussion for four years, coincides with a spectacular crash in the value of some of the world’s most prominent cryptocurrencies, sparking concerns about the entire crypto market. While crypto investors are keen to interpret the recent volatility as a “correction”, the bitcoin price last week slumped below $30,000 for the first time since last summer and tether — the largest stablecoin — failed to maintain its link with the US dollar. The new company, which will be run by current Nomura executives but will hire extensively from outside, will allow the Japanese brokerage to compete with other major global banks already offering institutional clients services and products linked to bitcoin, stable coins and other digital assets. Nomura joins Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of New York Mellon and other global financial institutions that have all become active in the cryptocurrency market in recent years.

Despite the risks associated with digital assets, Nomura executives said that interest from institutional clients was strong and would continue to grow as the market for cryptocurrencies, NFTs and other assets grew attractive as a means of diversifying more traditionally run portfolios. “Any asset class at the moment that has discounted cash flow is all under huge stress in an inflationary environment. But I think . . . many managers will be looking and thinking about potentially allocating towards blockchain technology and blockchain opportunities,” the Nomura executive said.

Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the digital asset exchange FTX, said the proof of work system of validating blockchain transactions, which underpins bitcoin, was not capable of scaling up to cope with the millions of transactions that would be needed to make the cryptocurrency an effective means of payment. “The bitcoin network is not a payments network and it is not a scaling network,” said Bankman-Fried. His comments came as the fast-growing cryptocurrency market was hit by a punishing sell-off that left bitcoin down by more than 35 per cent since January, at its lowest level since late 2020. Bitcoin is still seen by some crypto enthusiasts as a way to conduct everyday transactions. Countries such as El Salvador and the Central African Republic have adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender. But recent research by academics in the US found that Bitcoin has scarcely been used for daily payments in El Salvador, despite the rollout of bitcoin ATMs and other measures to encourage its use. The 30-year-old billionaire, who has expanded FTX into one of the world’s largest virtual asset exchanges, said an alternative type of blockchain known as proof of stake, or other technological innovations, would be required to create a functional crypto payments network.

To send questions, reply below https://t.co/mC48dfhapI Ethereum has been working to move to a proof of stake system, which is intended to be less energy-intensive. “Things that you’re doing millions of transactions a second with have to be extremely efficient and lightweight and lower energy cost. Proof of stake networks are,” said Bankman-Fried. His criticisms of bitcoin underscored serious environmental concerns about the amount of energy needed to run proof of work crypto systems. Some European regulators have called for a ban on the systems owing to their carbon emissions. Mining bitcoin consumes more energy than many countries, including Norway and Sweden, according to Cambridge university’s Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. Recommended “It has to be the case that we don’t scale this up to the point where we’re spending 100 times as much eventually as we are today on energy costs for mining,” Bankman-Fried said. FTX has used carbon offsets to compensate for the company’s emissions, which Bankman-Fried said was worthwhile but not a complete solution “because you just run out of things to offset at some point”. But despite his views on bitcoin, Bankman-Fried said he still believed the world’s biggest digital asset had a place in the crypto market. “I don’t think that means bitcoin has to go,” he said, adding that the token may still have a future as “an asset, a commodity and a store of value” akin to gold.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Joshua Oliver","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-05-16","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/0064e0a2-2210-45de-b366-b0439cb575a2","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fe1029ea6-fc91-4506-869f-b0987d54cadf.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Can blockchain smooth global supply chains?","INTRO":"Digitising shipping processes throws up a range of regulatory challenges","DETAILED_CONTENT":"From finance to art, blockchain enthusiasts have long claimed the technology can transform a range of industries. But, now, lawyer Martyn Huckerby believes the technology could help solve the global supply chain crisis. Huckerby is head of competition law at Tiang \u0026 Partners, a Hong Kong-based law firm. And, recently, he led a team of lawyers as they helped establish the Global Shipping Business Network (GSBN), which was launched last year with the aim of increasing digitisation in the global logistics industry. “There are a lot of challenges in the [shipping and logistics industries] at the moment,” he says. “The founding members [of GSBN] have seen an opportunity. “It is the kind of thing most lawyers would like to have the chance to work on. And it is something that will hopefully help the world,” he adds. The supply chain is a very fragmented market with participants who largely rely on paper The global supply chain certainly needs assistance. From the outbreak of Covid-19 to the war in Ukraine and China’s recent lockdowns, a string of extraordinary events has upended the system that ensures the smooth movement of goods across the world. GSBN’s aim is to use blockchain to build a repository of digital data on global trade flows that will help “streamline operations across the entire supply chain”. To try to achieve this ambition, Huckerby and his team had to tackle a number of legal and regulatory obstacles, not least because some of the founding members are Chinese state-owned companies. “The supply chain is a very fragmented market with participants who largely rely on paper,” explains Bertrand Chen, chief executive of GSBN. He believes digitising logistics will speed up trade. “The biggest issue is: how do we share the data?” Blockchain — a technology typically associated with cryptocurrencies — is a catch-all term for a type of encrypted digital ledger used for recording transactions. Law firms face challenge of taking political stance on clients US-China rift becomes a legal feud Legal ideas that boost business in the Asia-Pacific region Tech skills help transform lawyers’ working habits GSBN, whose membership comprises eight shipping and port operators across the world, hopes to use it as the backbone for a secure database that various businesses can contribute to, and draw insights from. From supermarkets across the world struggling to fill shelves to carmakers waiting for parts, fractures have emerged quickly in the network of manufacturers, shippers and financial institutions that work together to deliver goods. By helping these businesses to work collaboratively, GSBN believes that its technology may “simplify global trade for all”. However, the prospect of some of the world’s largest shipping and port groups pulling together to share proprietary data was always likely to raise questions about the project’s compliance with competition laws. In the context of the political environment, we had to tread very carefully Convincing US regulators to get on board has been a particular challenge, given nervousness among officials in the country about the integration of Chinese technology into international infrastructure. GSBN, based in Hong Kong, counts Chinese state companies Cosco Shipping and Shanghai International Port Group among the alliance, for instance. “In the context of the political environment, we had to tread very carefully,” Huckerby says. But he notes that GSBN received the go-ahead in July 2020 from the US’s Federal Maritime Commission, which regulates international ocean transportation. Addressing regulators’ concerns was made more complicated by the Covid pandemic. Because GSBN is international in scope, Tiang \u0026 Partners had to ensure the project was compliant with a range of national antitrust laws — and, in one case, that meant testimonies being given to Chilean authorities via video chat. The use of a technology so closely associated with crypto was also likely to make regulators wary. “Because GSBN is based on blockchain technology, we are dealing with issues the competition regulators have not seen before,” says Huckerby. [Authorised users] will only see the data they are supposed to see To Chen, though, the technology is key to the project’s success. “Blockchain is actually the most inefficient way to store data — we don’t want to do it if it’s not essential,” he says. But the encryption technology ensures that GSBN management cannot read the data and that authorised users will “only see the data they are supposed to see”, he explains. In July 2021, GSBN announced it had launched a service called Cargo Release in China. It said that, by eliminating the need for the exchange of paper documents, the time taken to process forms to release cargo in Shanghai has been cut from two to three days to less than three hours. The service has since been rolled out across south-east Asia and in Rotterdam, the EU’s biggest port. More recently, GSBN has announced the launch of a finance advisory group with Singapore’s DBS, HSBC bank, and Bank of China, to consider how banks can use its data for risk assessment when providing financing to the shipping sector. GSBN’s products are still in the early stages, but both Huckerby and Chen argue that blockchain has a long-term role to play in global supply chains. With other blockchain projects for the shipping industry in the works, however, there is no guarantee that GSBN’s project will emerge as the blockchain tool of choice. “It does not have to be us, we are not that arrogant,” says Chen. But, he adds: “We believe that long term, the industry has to adopt some form of technology. Blockchain has to stay in the industry”.

WINNER: Mori Hamada \u0026 Matsumoto The firm advised cloud-based video management platform Safie on its initial public offering, which included a rarely used feature called oyabike, which allocates securities at the behest of the selling shareholder. Normally, a “gun-jumping” rule pertains that prohibits solicitation of shares prior to an IPO. However, partner Katsumasa Suzuki convinced the Japan Securities Dealers Association that oyabike could be used to include cornerstone investors that commit to investing a fixed amount of money or shares, without breaching this rule. The approach has been replicated in other recent IPOs and increases Japan’s appeal as a listing location. Anand and Anand The firm represented US-based hotel chain Renaissance Hotel Holding in a long-running trademark infringement case in India. The firm appealed against an earlier decision by the Supreme Court of India that had stated there was no copyright infringement. The lawyers successfully argued that there is no other relevant factor in whether copyright has been infringed besides which business registered the copyright in India first. The judgment in January 2022 ended 14 years of litigation by the client and has clarified the law for brand owners. Baker McKenzie TV boxes, or “illicit streaming devices”, are commonly sold in Malaysia to stream television and films illegally. Acting for television company Astro, the firm successfully argued in the Kuala Lumpur Intellectual Property High Court that selling these boxes is copyright infringement. The decision contributed to an amendment to the Malaysian Copyright Act in December 2021 that makes it one of the first countries in the Asia-Pacific region to legislate specifically against illegal streaming technology. Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas The firm advised the Indian government on its sale of heavily indebted national airline Air India. A previous attempt had failed in 2018 because of lack of buyer interest. The firm restructured the parameters and processes of the divestment to attract bidders. In 2021, Air India was sold to Tata Group, the country’s largest conglomerate, following recalibrations to reduce the buyer’s exposure to the airline’s debt. King \u0026 Wood Mallesons Since 2020, the firm has worked on behalf of more than 115 private equity funds launching in Hong Kong under the Limited Partnership Fund Ordinance — legislation enacted that year to bolster the private equity market in Hong Kong. Partner Jingjing Jiang negotiated with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Hong Kong’s de facto central bank, and the Companies Registry to obtain an amendment to the Ordinance. This allows funds to have multiple managers, aligning the regime with other jurisdictions and making it a more attractive proposition to the funds. Lander \u0026 Rogers Property lawyers collaborated with the firm’s innovation team and Australian blockchain company BeNext to develop a user-friendly contract that gives real estate agents authorisation to act on behalf of sellers. The lawyers consolidated the varied legislation across Australian states to standardise and simplify the agreement. Using BeNext’s platform, real estate agents can draft, store and track contracts digitally. Nagashima Ohno \u0026 Tsunematsu In March 2021, Japanese messaging app Line reported that its users’ personal information had been accessible to a Chinese subsidiary since 2018, leading to public outcry. The firm’s crisis management team, led by Daisuke Fukamizu, determined that, although there was no breach of contract, internal procedures at Line had to change. The case resulted in proposals from the firm and client for improving Line’s corporate data governance, which other Japanese companies are also implementing. WongPartnership The firm advised HSBC in the bank’s provision of rescue financing to interior design company Design Studio Group, including a “roll-up” — or conversion — of pre-existing debt, whereby all or part of the rescue financing proceeds go towards paying off the pre-existing debt owed to the rescue lender, which is upgraded to a super-priority debt. The High Court of Singapore had not previously approved a rescue financing structure that included a roll-up. By successfully arguing its case, the firm set a precedent that financial institutions in the region can use when financing other distressed companies. Case studies in best practice.

WINNER: Tiang \u0026 Partners In 2021, Tiang \u0026 Partners law firm, collaborating with PwC Consulting in Hong Kong, helped a consortium of shipping carriers and terminal operators to create Global Shipping Business Network, a non-profit blockchain platform for shipping-industry data. The project raised a number of competition law questions, including securing antitrust clearances relating to many countries. But the use of blockchain provides security because it allows data to be amalgamated for collaborative automation projects without being shared between unauthorised parties. The first tool launched on the platform, Cargo Release, automates the documentation for cargo to be released at a port. In trials in Shanghai, the tool cut the process time from up to three days to a couple of hours. Allen \u0026 Gledhill The firm advised on CapitaLand’s S$10.3bn restructuring in 2021, to separate the property developer’s real estate and fund management units. CapitaLand’s real estate development business was put under private ownership of CLA Real Estate Holdings, and the rest of the business listed separately as CapitaLand Investment Management, in order to maximise shareholder value. It is unusual for a privatisation, demerger and listing to take place in one transaction in Singapore. Corrs Chambers Westgarth The firm advised on the US listing of Tritium, an Australian company that designs and manufactures fast chargers for electric vehicles. This was the first time an Australian company has listed in the US by merging with a US special purpose acquisition company — a so-called de-Spac structure. The firm project-managed the Australian side of the deal, negotiating with the regulators and working out the structure. Tritium DCFC received a $1.2bn dollar valuation. Dechert The firm advised on the delisting of asset manager New Century Asset Management’s real estate investment trust (Reit) from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in August 2021. As the first delisting of a Hong Kong-listed Reit, the team had to ensure fair considerations were given to unit-holders, negotiating details with the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong. This created a template for the dissolution of Reits, which has since been replicated. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer In January 2022, telecoms providers Indosat and Hutchison 3 Indonesia announced a $6bn merger to form Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, Indonesia’s second largest telecommunications company. With support from local Indonesian law firm HHP, Freshfields devised a merger structure and led on drafting agreements and obtaining regulatory approvals for a public merger between unrelated parties — a market first for Indonesia. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer The consumer finance arm of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, one of Japan’s largest banks, acquired a $1bn, 49 per cent stake in FE Credit, a Vietnamese consumer loan provider. On behalf of the bank, the firm’s cross-border team negotiated with Japanese and Vietnamese regulators to complete a deal that provides a model for future Japanese finance and fintech investment in Vietnam. Latham \u0026 Watkins Following the January 2020 revision of the implementing rules in the Philippines Real Estate Investment Trust (Reit) Act, the firm advised on five Reit offerings, including the very first one. Representing real estate company Megaworld, Benjamin Carale, a partner at the firm, led a team that developed the blueprint for Philippine Reit offerings, with more due to be announced this year. Pinsent Masons The firm advised Ventia, the Australian infrastructure operations and management company, on its successful bid for a 25-year operations contract for the state of Victoria’s largest road and tunnelling project: the North East Link. The bid model, which is also being replicated elsewhere, included a unique risk allocation framework and an adaptable plan to allow for more energy efficient technologies that become available over the lifespan of the project. The contract is worth A$15bn. S\u0026R Associates In the first Term Loan B facility debt financing involving an Indian company, the firm enabled Oyo, a hotel, hospitality and tech company, to raise funds from a pool of global investors. The firm created a structure that navigated Indian exchange and control regulations and raised $660mn. This means of financing has since been replicated by other Indian businesses. Sullivan \u0026 Cromwell The firm helped telecoms company China Mobile list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in January 2022 after it was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. This initial public offering was the first time a Hong Kong incorporated and listed company has listed in mainland China. The firm navigated a variety of complex legal issues including revising China Mobile’s constitutional documents to comply with both Hong Kong and mainland Chinese laws. China Mobile’s Shanghai IPO raised $7.5bn.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Oliver Telling","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-05-12","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/536c4e3f-bb25-4137-884e-5a7273b02865","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F3ae1d605-5ca0-4004-93bf-65702b0d01af.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"First crypto ETFs to launch in Australia underwhelm on debut","INTRO":"Funds from ETF Securities and Cosmos beat rivals to market despite delays","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools The culmination of a five-year battle to launch the first spot cryptocurrency exchange traded funds in the Asia-Pacific region has been greeted by muted demand. Bitcoin and ether ETFs managed by Sydney-based ETF Securities, in conjunction with Switzerland’s 21Shares, started trading on Thursday on the Cboe Australia exchange. Fellow Sydneysiders Cosmos Asset Management’s bitcoin feeder ETF also launched the same day on the same exchange. The listings mark the latest stage in the globalisation of exchange traded products investing in “physical” cryptocurrency, which have hitherto only been available in Canada, Brazil and a swath of European countries. US regulators have only permitted futures-based crypto ETFs so far, while the UK has not even done that. The Australian launches come five years after ETF Securities first approached regulators with the idea of launching a crypto ETF in 2017. However, the end of the lengthy gestation period comes just as digital currencies have fallen out of favour, with bitcoin falling below $30,000 for the first time since July this week — cementing a 50 per cent slide from November’s highs — and turbulence erupting in the market for so-called stablecoins such as Tether and TerraUSD. ETFS 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (EBTC) saw total trading volume of A$1.4mn in its first two days and ETFS 21Shares Ethereum ETF (EETH) A$1.2mn, with the Cosmos Purpose Bitcoin Access ETF (CBTC) seeing volume of A$648,000. “In our view, the lower-than-expected trading volumes owe to the state of the crypto market,” said Kanish Chugh, head of distribution at ETF Securities. “The prices of cryptocurrencies have fallen sharply the past seven days. Stablecoins are under attack, with Terra imploding. This has sent ripples throughout the crypto industry.” Chugh also pointed to the “unprecedentedly high” margin requirements for crypto ETFs set by clearing house ASX Clear, which “have made it very expensive for brokers and platforms to support trading”. ASX Clear set the margin requirement for crypto ETFs of at least 40 per cent in order to cover settlement risks, due to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. “The lack of broker and platform connectivity has meant many Australian investors who want to buy bitcoin and ether ETFs cannot do so,” said Chugh. “We understand some influential brokers are pressuring the clearinghouse to change the margin requirements.” Nevertheless Chugh remained upbeat, saying: “Australian investor interest in cryptocurrencies has not waned in recent months even as we have seen underperformance. And with bitcoin’s recent sell off as well, it may present an opportunity for investors who have been looking for attractive entry points into this new asset class”. The single largest source of buying in early trading was Commsec, the largest self-directed trading platform in Australia, he noted. Recommended ETFS and Cosmos will be hoping to secure “first-mover advantage” in the market, with New York-based VanEck expected to launch a rival product on the ASX, Australia’s primary exchange, in the coming weeks, and Canada’s 3iQ Digital Asset Management to debut another ETF on the Cboe Australia exchange. Both ETFS and Cosmos had been planning to launch their funds two weeks ago, only for a last-minute problem to emerge with what 21Shares chief executive Hany Rashwan called a “downstream infrastructure provider”, believed to be a prime broker or clearer. The products take different approaches. CBTC is a feeder fund that buys units in the $1.1bn Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC), which listed in Toronto in February 2020. In contrast, EBTC and EETH invest directly in the underlying securities. They have been built in partnership with 21Shares — the largest crypto ETP manager in the world with more than 30 products and $2.5bn of assets under management — which provides research and operational support. All three vehicles have annual fees of 1.25 per cent. ETF Securities said the funds were a “major step in the mainstreaming of cryptocurrency ownership”, allowing investors to trade and own crypto in a “tightly regulated environment with government oversight”. “Up until now, Australians wanting to buy bitcoin or ether have been forced onto unregulated crypto exchanges, which come with weaker investor protections,” it added. For his part Rashwan saw the listing an “early entry point to the entire APAC region”, given Australia’s role as an Asia-Pacific investment hub. Rashwan, who launched the first crypto ETP in the world in Zurich in 2019, added that 21Shares was “looking at several dozen countries around the world” in a quest to launch more such vehicles. “We are expanding beyond Europe,” he said. Established North American crypto managers are also keen to muscle in on the Australian — and wider Asian — market even if they have been beaten to the punch timing wise. The planned offerings from 3iQ, which claims to be Canada’s largest manager of digital assets, with $2bn, will also be feeder funds. The 3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin Feeder ETF and the 3iQ CoinShares Ether Feeder ETF, also due to be listed on Cboe Australia, will purchase units in two existing ETFs listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. VanEck also has experience in the field, running a bitcoin futures ETF and private spot bitcoin fund in the US, and more than a dozen spot crypto exchange traded notes in Europe, alongside a wide range of other offerings. Its proposed Australian ETF will invest directly in bitcoin and be listed on the ASX, which last week formally added digital assets to the list of eligible underlying assets for funds listed on the exchange. Arian Neiron, chief executive of VanEck Asia Pacific, was unperturbed about rivals getting to market first. “For something as commoditised as bitcoin, it will come down to the quality of the product and the price. The ASX was our choice of exchange and we’re confident that’s the way to go,” he said. Because Australians primarily invest via superannuation schemes, Neiron said “they have a conservative disposition. They want a strong brand and a strong balance sheet that is global and [a fund] that is on the main board of the ASX.” Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Steve Johnson","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-05-15","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/16eaf1b9-08fb-4454-a4eb-ac662cdd8590","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F67b98cc1-e8e3-4fb9-8317-b726197b961d.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Web3 is yet to take off despite the hype","INTRO":"So far, it’s hard to discern mainstream uses for this technology","DETAILED_CONTENT":"If the tech movement known as Web3 represents the internet’s next big gold mine, then why aren’t we hearing more about the truly useful applications that will be built on this new platform? And why aren’t more developers flocking to it to make their fortune? Those questions hang uncomfortably over Web3 as the boom in crypto assets — which supposedly greases the wheels of the new applications this movement will create — rages on. Something like $1tn has leaked out of the crypto bubble since November, but there is still $2tn left. What are the ultimate uses of these digital assets that justify such a large number? The case for Web3 rests on the belief that a blockchain-based technology platform will become the foundation for a new class of applications, with digital tokens mediating interactions of all kinds in a so-called “trustless” online world. There will be no digital gatekeepers to set the rules or take the lion’s share of the profits. Users will be in control. So far, though, it is hard to discern mainstream uses for this technology. The main applications — non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralised finance — are founded almost entirely on financial speculation and regulatory arbitrage. When the speculators take a bath and regulators decide it’s time to close the loopholes, what will be left? A truism in Silicon Valley has always been that if you want to know where the next big ideas will come from, look to where the capital and the smart developers are going. In the case of Web3, there’s certainly been no shortage of capital. But relatively few developers have decided to hitch their fortunes to this particular bandwagon. According to a recent study by Electric Capital, around 18,000 developers were working actively in the crypto world at the end of last year. That may sound like a lot. But as Tomasz Tunguz, a venture capitalist at Redpoint, points out, it is nothing next to the 16.4mn developers working in JavaScript, the main programming language for the current generation of web applications. Even the figure of 18,000 may exaggerate the true picture: the number of people spending at least 10 days a month working on Web3 is under 5,000. One explanation for this is that too few developers have mastered the new languages needed to build decentralised applications. That, says Tunguz, limits the rate at which Web3 companies can grow, but the problem should ease as more tools are created that make life easier for engineers working in this field. This is only part of the wider upgrade needed to make Web3 technologies more practical. Ethereum — so far the dominant blockchain for running decentralised apps — can handle a maximum of around 30 transactions a second, a bottleneck that has driven up transaction fees. Much of the money pouring into new crypto ventures in recent months has been directed towards the infrastructure needed to build and run blockchain-based apps. Yet this revolution has already been years in the making. Ethereum was launched almost seven years ago. The first wave of Web3 developers drawn to crypto crested in 2018, when bitcoin first peaked. Only around a fifth of those people are still actively working in the field. The latest wave is nearly twice as big, but how many of these developers will keep the faith if another crypto winter sets in? The delays might matter less if it was clearer what Web3 was actually for. When the world wide web emerged in the mid-1990s, it was possible to imagine activities of all kinds moving online for the first time, from shopping to watching movies. And that was before anyone even dreamt of giant new internet markets such as search and social networking. The case for Web3 rests not so much on the “what” as the “how”. Decentralisation is itself said to be the draw — the chance to reinvent many of today’s online activities in a new form. The idealism isn’t likely to last long if the mass of online users don’t see some tangible results, other than the chance for rampant financial speculation and meme-making. Also, today’s crypto fortunes are concentrated in the hands of relatively few, challenging the idea that this movement will spread wealth more evenly. The financial conditions that fuelled the crypto boom are starting to recede, as inflation takes hold and interest rates start to rise. A similar situation brought an end to the dotcom bubble, laying waste to most of the start-ups, though a handful of truly groundbreaking companies such as Amazon, Yahoo and eBay lived on.

This new version of the web is built with blockchain technology, which is based on the concept of decentralisation and allows for more transparency. Blockchain supports digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The art, fashion, gaming and finance worlds are already exploring the potential of this new realm. From Starbucks’ plans to launch NFTs for coffee drinkers to gain access to “experiences” to Gucci auctioning an NFT to raise money for Unicef USA. However, the complexity of the space and lack of engineering knowhow to create tokens have been a barrier to participation — many people just don’t know where to start. I am a late adopter, but I am fascinated and decided I needed to learn much more. A friend of mine told me about a community she was part of called Astro Girls Society. With a collection of 3,888 painted “Astro Girl” NFTs, it is an initiative to bring women into Web3 and is the perfect place to learn from other NFT owners. Of course, the first condition of joining was to purchase an Astro Girl NFT, which I did through NFT marketplace OpenSea. As a member, I have access to learning sessions. More importantly, the artists who design the NFTs receive a portion of funds generated from their sale. But selecting an NFT is like picking out art — you won’t know if it will go up in value, so buy something you really like that grants you access to a community you value. Once I found the NFT I wanted (“Peaceful Saturn”, with purple hair and covered in stars), I bought it using MetaMask, a cryptocurrency wallet. I was then accepted into the Astro Girls Discord channel — an online group hangout. And so the learning began. Recommended The gaming world’s transition to web3 is probably the easiest for beginners to understand. Sandbox, started in 2012, is a gaming metaverse where players can build, own and monetise their games. Sand, a utility token built on blockchain technology called Ethereum, is used for transactions and interactions. For those struggling with the concept of owning real estate in the metaverse, Sandbox helps to put it into context. You need to own digital land in order to build digital assets. If you have experience of online gaming platforms Roblox or Minecraft, it is similar to being responsible for building up a patch of the game that others can experience. Web3 is also changing approaches to recruitment. TechTree, a hiring marketplace, has built an online community for developers that incentivises them to refer the best developers for jobs using “bounties” as a reward. For anyone tired of recruiters pocketing commission, or referring friends for jobs and receiving no reward, this is a solution. The platform makes you feel as if you are in the “metaverse” and bounties can either be cashed in or given to a charity. But the intersection between Web3 and finance is one that could really accelerate positive change, reducing inequality and increasing economic participation. For example, in Africa “the potential and importance of DeFi [decentralised finance] can’t be understated”, says Yele Bademosi, the co-founder of Nestcoin, a Nigerian start-up focused on making cryptocurrencies accessible. Those in hard-to-reach communities lack access to bank accounts and other financial services, but Bademosi adds that anyone with an internet connection and a smartphone can access stablecoins and savings accounts. Stablecoins are less volatile cryptocurrencies pegged to an asset or to a fiat currency. There are downsides, however. Some blockchains use algorithms that require enormous computing power and are therefore energy intensive. Further, while blockchain is considered highly secure, it is not impenetrable. High-profile hacks include the more than $300mn worth of ether, another cryptocurrency, stolen from Wormhole, a bridge that facilitates the movement of crypto from one blockchain to another. These concerns are not to be taken lightly, but the opportunity to redistribute power and widen access to finance, and even job opportunities, is exciting.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"June Angelides","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-05-09","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/91a96ce3-6bec-42fe-a174-d293d4be0b60","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F3283dc6e-5696-46d1-8478-3b6e71dae2eb.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Rishi Sunak wants Britain to be a “global hub” for crypto. Sigh","INTRO":"Because being a global hub for other dodgy assets has worked out so well.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Oh, Rishi. What a pity! Where did those simpler times go, where you were content to just sit there looking all dishy in your hoodie, perfecting your P-Diddy-style celebrity autograph? Why must you insist on being so fishy? It feels like you are starting to take the Royal mickey! Yes, we are referring to Monday’s news that the Right Honourable Rishi Sunak, Chancellor of the Exchequer, is following in the right honourable footsteps of the “world’s coolest dictator”, El Salvador’s bitcoin-bro president Nayib Bukele, by commissioning the Royal Mint to issue an NFT in a bid to turn Great Britain into the world’s number 1 crypto nation. Why is the Treasury doing this at such a time of trouble? This must be somehow connected to Britain’s cost-of-living crisis or something equally serious, right? Almost. The NFT will serve as “an emblem of the forward-looking approach the UK is determined to take”. So a blockchain-based digital receipt for a JPEG that you don’t actually own is emblematic of Britain’s future. Just marvellous. From our Rishi on Monday: We\u0027re working to make the UK a global cryptoassets hub. We want to see the businesses of tomorrow, and the jobs they create, here in the UK. Today @JohnGlenUK set out how we are going to encourage crypto investment and technology in UK markets. 👇https://t.co/MdZ5IOLZtH In the speech Sunak is referring to (the whole thing is worth reading in full but please make sure you have not just eaten), economic secretary John Glen sets out which side the Treasury is on when it comes to the debate around crypto. Here’s an excerpt (with our emphasis): If there is one message I want you to leave here today with, it is that the UK is open for business — open for crypto businesses. We’re still right on the cusp of this technology breaking through. But there isn’t even consensus on what the implications of crypto are . . . when or whether we’re going to reach some kind of steady state . . . or even whether crypto itself is a good thing. There’s a massive debate between the sceptics and the evangelists, and there are a wide range of views in between. Some people worry deeply about crypto . . . and about how it’s going to harm consumers . . . or provide a platform for illicit activity free from government oversight . . . or drive-up carbon emissions. Others say it’s the best thing ever. They argue that crypto could do things like revolutionise global finance . . . by making financial exchanges more transparent, efficient and democratic, and placing currency in the hands of people not nations. That leaves us here in the UK with a big question to answer: How are we going to respond? Our answer is this: If crypto-technologies are going to be a big part of the future, then we — the UK — want to be in, and in on the ground floor. We’re not sure about you, but to us it rather feels like the Treasury is choosing to ignore all that boring stuff about illicit activity and carbon emissions, and instead to embrace the side that thinks crypto is “the best thing ever”. The side that thinks it will make financial exchanges “more transparent, efficient and democratic” (groan) and who believe in “placing currency in the hands of people not nations” (bigger groan). After some fluff about how the UK will ensure that “regulators have the right tools to manage the associated risks” and how the government would be “looking closely at energy usage associated with certain crypto-technologies” (that should do it), the crypto-evangelism intensifies: We see enormous potential in crypto . . . and we want to give ourselves every chance to take maximum advantage. We aren’t going to lower our standards, but we are going to maintain our technologically neutral approach. Having robust and effective regulation won’t hinder innovation, it’ll actually boost it — by giving people and businesses the confidence they need to think and invest for the long-term . . .  We have a detailed plan . . . we are, I am, determined to learn quickly . . . and the government will lead the way in harnessing the potential of blockchain and supporting the development of a world-best crypto ecosystem . . .  There’s a genuine opportunity to build on our strengths in fintech, seize the capitalist energy which has already made UK financial services what it is . . . and use it to unleash the potential of crypto-technologies. That’s right, lads, seize that capitalist energy! Unleash the potential of crypto — the UK is wide open for business! WAGMI!

The dream of instantaneous, automated, transparent and decentralised online transactions is encouraging fresh investment in networks. Solana, launched in 2020 and backed by Silicon Valley venture capital company Andreessen Horowitz, has grabbed attention as the blockchain with a business case. Like Ethereum, it enables smart contracts to be built using its technology. But where Ethereum is slow, only able to handle 13 transactions per second, Solana boasts that it is both faster paced and lower priced. The co-founder of Ethereum claims Solana is paying users more to validate transactions — effectively paying for speed in a way that he says is not sustainable. Sounds like sour grapes. Interest in Solana can be seen in prices for its tokens. The cryptocurrency is now the world’s sixth-largest digital coin according to CoinGecko. A fresh upswing has sent the price up by about a third in the past week. Boosters include use for non-fungible token (NFT) collections and inclusion on large cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. But at $136.50 it remains below the $259 November peak. Like every cryptocurrency, volatility is constant. Investment in blockchain technology requires faith that this represents the building blocks of the next phase of life online and not simply a mechanism for launching more frothy digital currencies. Solana’s ability to support decentralised applications and the idea that it is scalable are the real draw. It is, however, a work in progress. In addition to volatility and the nagging question of future regulation, there are valid concerns about security following outages and legitimate queries about just how decentralised Solana is, particularly when the founding team of Solana Labs accepted a large portion of tokens distributed. It is not even clear that multiple blockchains are necessary. Ethereum’s head start could leave Solana trailing far behind.

Two recent job ads show Spotify is recruiting people to work on early stage projects related to “Web3”, a tech buzzword for a blockchain-powered network that some crypto enthusiasts hope will wrestle control back from the Big Tech platforms that dominate today’s internet. Spotify is the latest tech giant to venture into NFTs and head off potential competition from crypto start-ups. This week, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg confirmed a Financial Times report earlier this year that Instagram would soon start to support NFTs. Other social media companies, including Twitter and Reddit, are also working to build new features for displaying or trading NFTs. NFTs use blockchain technology to certify ownership of digital assets. The vast majority of the $17.7bn worth of NFTs traded last year were for visual artworks, games and collectibles, according to market tracker Nonfungible.com. But even as the frothy NFT market has shown signs of deceleration in recent weeks, many in the crypto industry have tipped music as a breakout new application for NFTs this year. That could include selling digital albums or using NFTs to unlock perks at gigs, from merchandise to backstage passes. Musicians such as rapper Snoop Dogg and DJ Steve Aoki have already become prominent NFT collectors, while Kings of Leon and Grimes have sold NFTs of their music. Major labels Warner and Universal have forged partnerships with NFT projects, including a virtual band featuring characters from the Bored Ape Yacht Club. Start-ups including Royal and Catalog have begun selling NFTs created by musicians, often pitching the crypto tokens as a more lucrative alternative business model compared with streaming services such as Spotify, which pay out fractions of a penny for every time a song is played. Recommended Spotify’s recruitment in the sector appears to be at an exploratory stage. It pointed to Web3 in a recruitment notice for an engineer on its “experimental growth” team. “This small and full-stack team is responsible for driving growth through new technologies, like Web3,” the ad said. A separate Spotify job listing, for a manager in its future-gazing “Innovation and Market Intelligence” group, shows the music streaming service is looking for a candidate with experience in “content, creator, media, web3, and emerging technology industries” to “help define Spotify Moonshots”, a term for ambitious new projects. A Spotify spokesperson declined to comment on its NFT plans. These Web3 hires would not be Spotify’s first foray into crypto tech: the company was an early collaborator on Facebook’s ill-fated cryptocurrency project, Diem. When what was originally dubbed Libra was unveiled in 2019, Daniel Ek, Spotify’s chief executive, told a company podcast that cryptocurrencies and blockchain could allow users of “a service like Spotify . . . to be able to pay artists directly”, especially across international borders or in regions where few people have traditional bank accounts. “That can open up massive opportunities where all of a sudden, a user in Japan might pay a creator in Argentina. And that opens up huge opportunities for how we can further our mission,” Ek said at the time.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Tim Bradshaw","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-03-17","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/6584f6df-b1eb-48ba-abab-02917cfdd50a","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F133a19f3-0960-41e1-ac6c-e08efd26dae1.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Euroclear/Fnality: tokenised stocks and bonds have clear advantages","INTRO":"Deal paves way for financial institutions to approve and settle digital securities trades using a distributed ledger","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Mass mobilisation is needed for any successful revolution. On Monday, Euroclear added a little extra weight to the movement to bring new digital assets into the mainstream. The clearing giant is investing in Fnality, a payments consortium whose members include Nasdaq and UBS. The deal paves the way for financial institutions to clear and settle dealings in digital securities using a distributed ledger system. Euroclear, in common with other traditional finance institutions, cannot afford to get left behind as digital assets are used more widely. Blockchain-based securities could supplant the conventional stocks and bonds Euroclear handles. They may feature as proxies for the latter as well as outright alternatives. Existing systems of clearing and settlement involve verification by a centralised body that are both time consuming and costly for participants. Proponents say that it, in contrast, it should be possible to settle large volumes of digital asset transactions using blockchain technology in real time, much faster and more cheaply. Nearly instantaneous transactions clearly bring benefits. But the biggest savings could come from reductions in cash liquidity requirements for participants. Using synthetic central bank digital currencies, another potential development, would enable this change. This reduces the financing strain and cost for banks on either side of transactions and in theory lowers overall financial stress from funds tied up in the system. Euroclear settled almost a quadrillion (1,000 trillion) euros of securities transactions last year. It has chosen Fnality for a reason. Set up in 2019, the payments company already has the backing of some of Europe’s largest banks, including Barclays and Santander.

The Ethereum blockchain has become one of the world’s most widely used digital ledgers, but it is facing challenges from rivals such as Solana, which has set lower transaction fees to draw in users. Lubin told the Financial Times that Solana, which pitches itself as a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum, was paying outsized rewards to users who validate transactions on the network compared to the revenues generated by those transactions. Solana needs to “figure out a more sustainable business model for the network”, Lubin said. “That’s natural,” he said. “All the projects in our ecosystem essentially fake it until they make it, or they die.” The fast-growing blockchain project has faced doubts before. Some critics have argued that Solana sacrifices security for greater efficiency, and the network has experienced multiple significant outages. In response to Lubin’s criticism, Solana Labs, the company that developed the blockchain, said that “simply looking at protocol revenue doesn’t tell the full story of the long-term performance” of a blockchain’s economic model. Lubin’s comments came as tech investors make big wagers on new projects trying to create more efficient alternatives to Ethereum — including Avalanche, Near Protocol and Solana — in a race to capitalise on growing mainstream interest in cryptocurrency applications. ConsenSys, a cryptocurrency software company led by Lubin and closely tied to Ethereum, said on Tuesday it had more than doubled its valuation to $7bn in a new $450mn round of financing. The company has soared in value as an influx of new users turned to its products to navigate Ethereum. Ethereum is the most widely used digital ledger for rapidly expanding areas such as decentralised finance and non-fungible tokens. Lubin has become one of the project’s loudest advocates on Wall Street after playing a hand in the network’s development. Recommended MetaMask, an app developed by ConsenSys with more than 30mn monthly active users, has recorded almost $330mn in transaction fees since late 2020 through a feature that lets users swap between cryptocurrency tokens on Ethereum, according to public data. Venture capitalists invested the new money in ConsenSys Software, an entity Lubin created with the help of JPMorgan during a restructuring that was finalised in 2021. It comes after almost three dozen former employees of its Swiss-incorporated predecessor company, ConsenSys AG, recently challenged the legality of the restructuring and requested a special audit. The employees have alleged the deal undervalued the intellectual property behind MetaMask and other key products transferred to the new entity. Lubin said ConsenSys had been “extremely open” about negotiating with the former employees and “understanding their concerns”, and the company’s products were effectively “pre-monetisation” at the time of the transaction. “It’s a very different world in our ecosystem as we’re crossing the chasm into mainstream adoption than it was during the darkest moments of Covid,” Lubin said. ParaFi Capital, a cryptocurrency venture firm backed by KKR, led the new round of funding in ConsenSys. Microsoft, Singapore’s Temasek and SoftBank’s second Vision Fund also invested. ConsenSys declined to comment on whether Lubin or other shareholders sold any shares in the financing.

None of which could save it","DETAILED_CONTENT":"On June 24 2021, Jay Powell and Janet Yellen sat down for their weekly breakfast amid the austere surroundings of the US Treasury building on 1,500 Pennsylvania Avenue. There was only one major question on the agenda: should they give the green light for a global cryptocurrency designed by Facebook? The chair of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury secretary were both DC veterans; Powell had replaced Yellen at the top of the Fed. But neither had had to make such an unusual decision. An alliance of tech companies led by Facebook proposed to launch a product it hoped would profoundly change the world. Rather than adhering to the social media giant’s one-time mantra “move fast and break things”, executives had come to Washington to ask permission first. Powell laid out his position with his customary precision. As Fed chair, he told Yellen, he was willing to give the go-ahead for Facebook and its partners to trial Diem, as the digital currency backed by the US dollar was called at the time. He knew the Treasury had concerns, not least the possibility that such a currency could become a vehicle for money laundering or grow so popular as to threaten global monetary stability. But on balance, his staff thought Diem was designed carefully enough to avoid such outcomes and would have the added benefit of setting industry standards. The social media company’s reputation was sullied in Washington, following a series of controversies over data privacy, misinformation and alleged censorship. During his presidential bid the year before, Joe Biden said he had “never been a big fan” of Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg, describing him as “a real problem”. And prominent Democrats and Republicans alike had already spoken out against Diem specifically. A cautious operator, Powell wanted backing from Yellen, who is close to the president and popular among progressives. After weeks of deliberation, Yellen had made up her mind: she was out. “Yellen told him it was his decision to make, but that she would not protect him from the political fallout if he did so,” says one person briefed on the conversation. “And that was the end of Facebook’s digital currency.” Diem’s leadership would spend the next six months in a last-ditch drive to rescue the project that began by attempting to woo government regulators, then trying to browbeat them and, in a final folly, exploring working with Zuckerberg’s one-time nemeses. But this January, Diem confirmed that it was winding down for good. The remains of Zuckerberg’s digital money dream would be sold to a little-known Californian bank for $182mn, marking one of the most spectacular, if little-noted, failures of his career. Over the past few months, the Financial Times has spoken to some 30 people involved with the project, including executives, developers, lobbyists and the regulators and politicians who ultimately killed it. (Many of them spoke on condition of anonymity because Facebook requires employees and partners to sign non-disclosure agreements.) What emerges is a picture of Silicon Valley executives who thought they could charge into finance and make billions, if only they could surmount technical and regulatory barriers. What they failed to realise was that the very fact Facebook had conceived the idea, doomed it. As one government official involved in the process puts it: “Diem spent years trying to reverse engineer their project to fix all of its faults. But they could never fix being linked to Facebook. It was their original sin.” Meta, as Facebook has since been rebranded, is one of a handful of tech companies now threatened with much stricter regulation, even break-up, by US politicians and regulators who have come to see it as a malignant force in American commerce and democracy. Nowhere has the divide between Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill been more clearly exposed than in the tortured downfall of Diem. David Marcus was soaking up the Caribbean sun. It was the winter of 2017, and the dapper, French-born executive was on holiday in the Dominican Republic. Marcus, 48, was the head of Facebook’s Messenger app and a close confidant of Zuckerberg’s. His silver hair and slick suits set him apart from his younger, scruffier colleagues. Peers jokingly called him the “George Clooney of Silicon Valley,” and he was seen as powerful within the company. Lying on the beach, Marcus indulged in some blue-sky thinking. What if he could find a way to create a global digital currency and integrate it into Facebook? Marcus was no stranger to the worlds of start-ups and digital payments. He sold his first company at 27. In 2011, a subsequent mobile payments start-up he founded was acquired by PayPal for $240mn. Within nine months, he was PayPal’s president. In 2014, Zuckerberg recruited him to run Messenger, which he’d help grow to more than 1.3bn users. But three years on, he was restless. Meanwhile, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies had become useful tools for dark web criminals as well as the lofty obsessions of programmers and utopian technologists. But they had yet to be adopted by any big corporations. For Facebook’s more than two-billion-strong user base, crypto could offer a convenient and cheap way to move money around the world, Marcus thought. For the social media company itself, it could provide a treasure trove of data about what people spend their money on. Interrupting his holiday abroad, Marcus texted Zuckerberg to outline his ruminations. Intrigued, the CEO gave his blessing to explore the idea further. So Marcus began methodically crafting a tool beloved by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs: a memo outlining the new project’s objectives, defining success and quantifying how to get there. Morgan Beller was a 24-year-old whirlwind. Fast-talking and animated, she had been a partner at venture capital group Andreessen Horowitz before joining Facebook’s corporate development team in 2017. She was also a fierce blockchain advocate, who spent the latter part of that year trying to shop the technology to whichever Facebook executive would listen: why wasn’t the company embracing decentralisation and open protocols for its users? Could it get into bitcoin mining? Should Facebook groups be able to issue their own digital tokens? “It’s a really big company and taking really big risks is hard,” she tells the FT. “To give Facebook credit, the leadership was very receptive and very open. I didn’t have anyone say no, at least to meeting and brainstorming.” In early 2018, Marcus and Beller joined forces. At first, they worked in a small, empty room, walls adorned with whiteboards, on Facebook’s main campus in Menlo Park. Soon they moved to a larger, more secluded building on the outskirts of the company’s headquarters. Only employees with particular passes — the crypto experts, engineers and economists they brought on board — could access the facility. Their top-secret project was codenamed Libra. The team was “paranoid about leaks”, says Beller and was “like a secret Swat operation”. This would be the first of several incarnations, each intended to conform to the difficulties and demands of launching a digital currency from within Facebook. Initially, the dream was for Libra to be like bitcoin, a currency owned by no one group and built on open-source technology. This would allow individuals to store, spend and transfer money across borders with close to zero transaction fees. Unlike bitcoin, it would be backed by something real: a reserve of low-risk assets including bank deposits in various currencies and US Treasuries. (This kind of crypto is known as stablecoin.) Facebook declined to comment. Marcus, who also declined to be interviewed, wrote in a statement: “Libra was about building a protocol for money on the internet to enable people and businesses who are currently left behind by the current system to access sound digital money and cheap payments.” To get the project off the ground — before it was to become fully decentralised — leadership was needed to develop the technology. Marcus and Beller were conscious that Facebook alone should not be seen as directing the effort. So they created a non-profit association, also called Libra, of which Facebook was to be one of many members. To avoid appearing US-centric, it would be technically based in Switzerland, a more neutral financial centre that was also an emerging crypto hub at the time. (Marcus and Beller continued to work primarily from California.) For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click The set-up proved convincing. By mid-2019, Marcus and Beller’s pitching had brought on board some 28 companies and non-profits, including Uber, Vodafone, Spotify, Visa and Mastercard as founding members. Each would have equal voting rights and pay $10mn into the reserve; each would guide the project’s development and, eventually, integrate Libra into its services, bringing the digital coin to consumers worldwide. On top of being an equal founding member, Facebook would build its own digital wallet for the coin. Marcus would sit on Libra’s board but also run the digital wallet in a new Facebook subsidiary called Calibra. For Facebook, the possible multibillion-dollar commercial opportunities were clear: user transaction data, more engagement, more ecommerce, a slice of fees from transactions. “That was always their advantage,” says one regulatory official. “This would create tremendous opportunity and a lot of money for them. But if Facebook was going to be the reason it was very successful, they were also going to be the reason it would fail.” The Old San Francisco Mint is a neoclassical granite slab of a building sitting amid high-rise office blocks and upmarket hotels close to the city’s theatre district. Constructed in the 1860s, the Mint was one of the few buildings that survived the great quake of 1906 and resulting fire. It is a behemoth of permanence that once held one-third of the country’s gold reserves; now it’s a venue for corporate events. It was here that Marcus chose to host the press launch of his new project in mid-June 2019. In the interim, Facebook had gone from relatively under-scrutinised to the black sheep of Silicon Valley, as a result of repeated scandals, including the Cambridge Analytica revelations, which stoked concerns about users’ data privacy. In this light, Marcus and Beller had thought it wiser to ask for permission and share their plans publicly. “We took some of the lessons learnt in other jurisdictions and said, we’re gonna do this as we would think a regulator would want a company like Facebook to do this,” says one staffer involved. After a tour of the vaults, journalists were called in to a cavernous, high-ceilinged room to watch Marcus give one of his characteristically slick slideshow presentations, revealing the plan in full. The Libra sign in astrology signifies the scales of justice, he explained. Libre is French for free. “Freedom, justice, money, that’s all this is about,” he said. Throwing the launch at the Mint made for terrible politics. American politicians were already worried about a Facebook cryptocurrency encroaching on the power of the US dollar. Seeing it launched in a building that used to make those dollars only exacerbated their concerns. One person who spoke to Zuckerberg about the plans in its earliest days says, “It comes back to Zuckerberg’s inability to understand how the world sees Facebook: ‘From the people who ripped your data off, they can now get into your wallet.’” During a bruising week in July 2019, the extent of the political backlash became clear. First, came the dreaded Potus tweet. “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,” president Donald Trump wrote on July 11. Four days later, Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin repeated that message at a press conference, warning: “[Libra] and others have a lot of work to do before they get us comfortable.” The following day, Marcus addressed a congressional hearing for the first time. His testimony in front of the Senate banking committee was a chance to reset, to show members of Congress that he was listening to their concerns and that Facebook was willing to make changes to accommodate them. Marcus had barely settled in his seat — much less spoken — when the onslaught began. Sherrod Brown, the gravelly voiced Democratic senator from Ohio, set the tone. “[Facebook] is like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches,” he said. “Facebook has burned down the house over and over and called every arson a learning experience.” Republican senators were just as hostile. “I don’t trust you guys,” said GOP senator Martha McSally. “Instead of cleaning up your house, you are launching into a new business model.” Marcus blinked slowly from behind his rimless glasses as he soaked up round after round of criticism. If he believed he was seeing his passion project collapse in front of his eyes, he gave little sign of it. But many watching from the outside believed that was exactly what was happening. “The attacks were absolutely bipartisan because both sides agree: you don’t mess with the money,” says David Gerard, author of Libra Shrugged: How Facebook Tried to Take Over the Money. “This is what happens when the dreams of bitcoin bros meet reality.” By the late summer of 2019, sentiment among Libra’s backers was that something needed to change. When the Wall Street Journal reported that Visa, Mastercard and others were getting cold feet, Marcus felt compelled to rebut the notion of disharmony between members. “I have no knowledge of specific organizations plans to not step up,” he tweeted on October 2, “commitment to the mission is more important than anything else”. The next day, executives from the consortium’s member companies met in the National Union Building in Washington DC’s Penn Quarter. According to multiple sources involved, some members had begun to feel spooked by the political backlash. Facebook had, they believed, underestimated the scrutiny Libra would draw and had overpromoted members’ involvement. Facebook, meanwhile, wanted members to be more vocal in their support. The gathering was particularly pressing because Libra backers were due to signal their continued support by signing a so-called declaration of membership. Amid the tensions, some Libra staffers failed to notice that representatives from one member — PayPal, where Marcus had been president — weren’t there. The next day, PayPal announced it was pulling out, arguing Facebook had not done enough to address regulators’ concerns. The news blindsided Libra’s top management. Things were going to get worse. Days later, Brown and his Democratic Senate colleague Brian Schatz wrote to Libra’s remaining payments members — Visa, Mastercard and online payments processor Stripe — warning them that if they remained part of the scheme, they could expect increased Congressional scrutiny. “It’s as close to a Sopranos threat as you’ll ever read,” one Libra insider says. Within a matter of days, Libra lost 25 per cent of its members, Visa, Mastercard, Stripe and eBay among them. Back in Silicon Valley, Marcus was wounded. He realised that, for his dream to have a chance of surviving, he would have to make major concessions. For the next 18 months, Marcus did just that. First, he removed himself from the limelight. His attempted Washington charm offensive had only further lashed Libra to Facebook. Even Zuckerberg acknowledged the problem. “I understand we’re not the ideal messenger right now . . . I’m sure people wish it was anyone but Facebook putting this idea forward,” he told US lawmakers in 2019. “But there’s a reason we care about this. Facebook is about putting power in people’s hands.” To underscore its independence, Libra turned to Stuart Levey, the former Treasury official in charge of the US government’s efforts to stop terrorism financing. In May 2020, Levey was made the Swiss non-profit’s new chief executive. The 58-year-old had been appointed by George W Bush but had stayed on under Barack Obama, making him one of a handful of political appointees to serve both Democratic and Republican presidents. Levey, who peers describe as statesmanlike but also lively, headed HSBC’s legal team in the intervening years, so was well versed in financial regulation. Libra also tapped Steve Bunnell, former chief of the criminal division at the US attorney’s office and justice department counsel, to become its chief legal officer. Both hires were a coup. “The people were really extraordinary, some of the very best,” says Ari Redbord, who was the senior adviser to the Treasury deputy secretary and the under-secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the time. “They basically put together the team that regulators would want to hear from when they are looking [at] how you’re going to build out a compliance programme.” There was also a rebranding. Libra was renamed Diem, while Calibra — Facebook’s digital wallet — became Novi. Marcus took a back seat within the Libra association to focus on building Novi. Beller left Facebook and joined a venture capital firm. Under Levey’s direction, Diem shrunk. To placate European and US regulators, the project’s scope was narrowed to the creation of a digital currency backed one-for-one by the dollar rather than a basket of currencies and other low-risk assets, which some were concerned might challenge the dominance of the dollar. A team of crypto engineers spanning Europe and Silicon Valley worked feverishly to build a system to monitor transactions for signs of money laundering or sanction breaking. They also came up with ways to prohibit anonymous transactions and vet the outfits that could build services to support Diem currency. By now, the world was in the pandemic’s grip. Would-be schmoozing turned into Zooms. Diem’s future was being thrashed out over video calls, as regulators bombarded the project’s leadership with detailed queries. Some Diem staffers found there were so many officials, they often did not know which agencies were present. Even by government standards, it could be tedious work. Redford recalls extended calls “going through line by line the very technical compliance programme they were building in response to the Treasury’s requests”. All of which started to seem worth it by spring 2021. By then, Levey and the rest of the senior team, including Marcus, felt confident enough to test issuing a small amount of Diem currency as well as trialling a version of the Novi digital wallet. The test would be available to a small group of users, but the team was jubilant at the prospect, according to several people involved at the time. Reaching the major milestone required the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, Finma, to approve Diem’s licence. The application papers were on the regulatory agency’s desk, and Finma had convened a college of more than 20 regulatory watchdogs from around the world to guide it through the process. It just needed the final green light from the US Treasury. It was at this point that the Treasury issued its first devastating “No”. Officials told Finma and Diem that they were requesting a temporary delay of the pilot. The Biden administration was still settling in, they said, and needed time to review the project. Levey was indignant, convinced that these were not substantive concerns. Dante Disparte, Libra’s head of policy and a key point man for members, quit in frustration. Levey was not finished yet; he felt he could still answer any lingering concerns the Treasury held. So Diem morphed again. Levey relocated the Swiss-based project to the US and began working with US-regulated bank Silvergate to issue Diem currency, an overhaul designed to further placate regulators. Now, if the US government wanted to intervene, it could do so thanks to the regulatory relationship it had with Silvergate. To Levey, and even some within the Fed, this seemed to be the final missing piece. Diem executives informed the Fed and the Treasury that another launch was scheduled for June 29 2021. But it was not to be. After Yellen’s intervention, the Fed relayed the message to Silvergate and Diem. In a testy phone call, the Fed’s general counsel Mark Van Der Weide told Levey that the government was uncomfortable condoning any project until it had put a “comprehensive regulatory framework” for stablecoins in place, and he expressed nervousness about a coin with the potential to “massively scale” as Diem might. According to Diem staffers, something seemed off about Van Der Weide’s delivery during the call. He was stiff, almost robotic. When they compared notes with colleagues at Silvergate, they found that a call they’d received from Van Der Weide had played out in a suspiciously similar way. They concluded that the official must have been reading from a script; both groups felt slighted. The Fed and the Treasury both declined to comment. “It was a last-minute rug-pulling exercise, the night before the proposed launch date,” says one person who was involved. Diem’s team was blindsided and “immensely fucked off”. Bruised and frustrated, Levey retaliated using a method that only has traction in DC: a strongly worded letter. The missive, which has not been previously reported and has been seen by the FT, is addressed to Yellen and Powell and is dated July 6 2021. In it, Levey berates regulators for blocking the project, outlining all the steps it had taken to appease them. Previous requests to meet Yellen and deputy Treasury secretary Wally Adeyemo had been declined “without explanation”, he wrote. Now he was demanding a meeting with both for an opportunity to be heard. “While Diem continues to welcome engagement and scrutiny, we also deserve fair and equal treatment,” Levey continued. “Stopping a limited, legally permissible pilot while other stablecoins grow unchecked is neither fair nor equitable.” The current status quo would mark a “death knell” for the project, he added. Recommended The requested meetings never materialised. Behind closed doors, some who worked on the project argue the episode was more than just unfair. Neutral regulators had strung them along and were then swayed by a combination of politics and the interests of big banks, they believed. “It’s kind of like a banana republic,” says one Facebook staffer involved. “Here you have the Federal Reserve that’s supposed to be an independent central bank for the US government, appointed to set terms that span over the course of presidencies to take politics out of money. It is a shame that politics came into play.” Even some regulators remain sympathetic to Diem’s plight. “For years, we treated Facebook like we were pulling the wings off a fly, while doing nothing about these others,” says one senior official, citing dozens of other stablecoin projects that make up the $127bn market. “Not allowing Diem to go ahead was worse than a crime, it was a blunder.” Inside the US government, Levey’s letter did not land well. The link to Facebook remained front of mind. The Treasury department would not bend to Diem’s timeline, whether the demand came via the earnest visionary Marcus or the seasoned pragmatist Levey. The letter was “like you had a friendship, and it went bad and they were detailing their grievances”, one official scoffs. The person adds, “What they were after was always fantastical.” And so Diem entered the final “Hail Mary” phase of its doomed existence. Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss are the identical twin Olympic rowers who knew Zuckerberg at Harvard in the early 2000s. Their feud and lawsuit over the idea for Facebook was memorably fictionalised in the 2010 film, The Social Network. The suit was settled for $65mn in 2008 and, in the interim, the Winklevii founded Gemini, a crypto exchange and stablecoin group, and became bitcoin billionaires. After the humiliating Fed rejection (and bow-out from Silvergate) in June, Diem executives had one last contingency: find another stablecoin issuer that was instead regulated at a state level. New York has its own crypto regulatory regime under the eye of the New York Department of Financial Services. Enter Gemini. Diem had a long history with the crypto company. When Marcus and Beller were initially reaching out to potential partners, they had held talks with Gemini about how it might be involved in the initiative — for example, by listing the Diem coin on its exchange. But now, according to multiple people familiar with the matter, Diem’s leadership explored working with Gemini to actually issue the currency. The NY DFS team at the time — particularly then-superintendent Linda Lacewell — welcomed the tie-up, details of which have not been previously reported. The irony of Zuckerberg’s company possibly counting on the Winklevii to act as white knights was not lost on staffers. “The amount of power you are giving up by bringing in Gemini shows how desperate they were,” one government official involved says. But when New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who had been battling allegations of sexual harassment for weeks, resigned, Lacewell went with him. The furtive Gemini plan was scuppered. Then came what some insiders deem the final mis-step. Marcus, who had been watching from the sidelines, re-entered the picture when he decided to launch a pilot of Facebook’s Novi digital currency wallet in October. Instead of using Diem, the trial would rely on Paxos Dollar, a rival cryptocurrency. The move was designed to relieve some of the pressure on Diem but instead engendered a vicious political reaction from Congress, which still saw the two initiatives as inextricably linked. “All hope was lost,” says one member, when the Treasury put out a report in November on stablecoin issuers “that limit affiliation with commercial entities” in order to “address additional concerns about systemic risk and concentration of economic power”. Internally, this was read as a direct message to Facebook. Diem’s investors had become fatigued by the process. Zuckerberg had grown exasperated with negative news cycles when he wanted to focus on casting the company as innovative, according to those close to him. At times, he wanted to hold back and wait before trying to launch the various pilots. But eventually he also conceded defeat, alongside Marcus. “Mark is a smart businessman. There’s only so much money you’d throw at it,” says one former senior Meta staffer. By the end of the month, Diem began to consider pursuing a sale. Where Libra had entered public discourse with a bang, Diem collapsed with a whimper: when Levey delivered the news over Zoom in a mid-December 2021 meeting, the three dozen or so participants on the call fell silent. Marcus had already resigned from Facebook several weeks earlier. Those close to him say he was despondent. “If walls mysteriously keep popping up that you don’t know about,” says one senior Facebook staffer who worked with him, “there’s only so many times you can keep walking down that same path.” Diem received interest from several US banks, including Silvergate, which on January 31 bought its remaining assets to pursue its own stablecoin plans. To the extent it has one, Diem’s lasting legacy may be that it focused the attention of regulators on digital currency. “It forced regulators and governments to start to educate themselves on the technology and stimulated venture capital investment in other initiatives because there was such a frenzy of focus,” says Lisa Ellis, head payments analyst at investment research group MoffettNathanson. Levey declined to comment but provided a statement reading in part: “What Diem demonstrated is that it’s possible to build an efficient blockchain-based payment system that explicitly prohibits anonymous transactions and includes robust controls to protect consumers and combat crime.” Recommended But Marcus has still not achieved what he had set out to. “This mission that motivated the team to challenge the unacceptable status quo — against all odds — for a better system, remains as relevant today as it was on the first day of that journey,” Marcus wrote in his statement to the FT. In a tweet, he said he welcomed “another chapter with a maybe more ‘acceptable’ promoter driving the vision forward” — a concession that Facebook’s brand destroyed his vision. “With David Marcus, I sensed a bit of: ‘We will be able to survive on the pure charismatic goodwill that we are bringing with this project,’” says one person who worked with him. “I think they thought good faith would carry the day.” Facebook is now busy with a new grand project: its plan to build a metaverse where billions of people could one day gather as avatars. Novi staffers have been instructed to focus on what digital currency might look like in this virtual world. “What are we supposed to do?” says one former Facebook employee, who laments Diem’s demise. “Sit back and just do ‘likes’? Companies are supposed to grow, we have shareholders to deliver to. That’s the ethos of Silicon Valley.” Hannah Murphy is an FT tech correspondent. Kiran Stacey is an FT Washington correspondent.

As a university student, Blau dropped his finance studies and turned down an internship at asset manager BlackRock to pursue a DJ career. Years later, he has combined his dual interests — music and finance — into a business aimed at disrupting the record industry through blockchain technology. On Tuesday he teamed up with longtime friend Diplo, the popular electronic musician, to sell 20 per cent of the streaming royalties of a song to fans in the form of digital tokens. “I’m just fascinated with the idea of there being value for the ownership of music,” Thomas Pentz, known professionally as Diplo, told the Financial Times. “The more people behind your record, whether its fans or investors who are interested in the technology, it’s great to have more people on a team.” In recent months the hype surrounding Web3 — the buzzword for a decentralised, blockchain-powered iteration of the internet — has swept the music industry, drawing the world’s largest music companies to the fray and fuelling hope that non-fungible tokens will become a new source of money for musicians. To sell an NFT, musicians assign their song, video or other piece of media to a digital token. The token is sold through an online auction enabled by blockchain technology, which keeps a record of the transaction. Beyond songs or images, NFTs could also be used to sell perks such as backstage passes or meetings with stars. Head-spinning examples abound. Rapper Snoop Dogg in February sold an NFT attached to Bacc on Death Row, his latest album, that reportedly generated more than $40mn in sales in just five days. DJ Steve Aoki claims he has made more money through NFTs than he did from a decade’s worth of advances from record labels. “Some of these valuations are out of control. As an investor, I’m seeing a lot of it and have to laugh occasionally,” said a senior executive at a major music label. But after getting knocked over by the internet via the advent of file-sharing company Napster two decades ago, the big music companies are looking to get ahead of technological change this time around, making them willing participants in the market. Universal Music, the group behind Taylor Swift and Drake, has struck partnerships to create NFTs for its artists — including a virtual band featuring characters from the Bored Ape Yacht Club — as have rivals Sony and Warner. After spending more than half a billion dollars buying the copyrights to Bob Dylan’s songbook, Universal and Sony are now working with the musician to sell Bob Dylan NFTs. Spotify has been drawing up plans to add blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens to its streaming service, the FT reported earlier this month. “There’s been a lot of waxing and waning of irrational exuberance around this space”, said Jonathan Dworkin, senior vice-president of digital strategy at Universal. “As the smoke now starts to clear, there’s some really interesting opportunities . . . there’s a real revenue opportunity” he said, pointing to the ways tokens can directly connect fans with artists. But so far, most participants in music NFTs are crypto enthusiasts rather than ordinary fans, and the market is tiny — taking in just $83mn in primary sales last year, according to industry blog Water \u0026 Music. There are plenty of sceptics. “It feels like the music industry is desperately trying to find a way to insert itself into NFTs without actually thinking: what is the underlying use case?” said Mark Mulligan, analyst at Midia Research. Mulligan argued it is hypocritical of musicians to sell streaming royalties to fans, after years of complaints over the minuscule payments artists themselves receive in streaming royalties. “If you sell someone a fraction of that fraction, and charge them a lot of money for it because it’s an NFT, I’m not sure how it would be a valid investment.” Diplo maintained it is a good investment for music lovers. “For a fan, what you can do is buy merch, you can buy tickets for a concert . . . but really, this is what you’re a fan for. You’re a fan because of the music.” Most of the $17.7bn worth of NFTs traded last year were for visual art, games and collectibles, according to market tracker Nonfungible.com. While the NFT market itself has shown signs of slowing with daily trading volumes on OpenSea, the biggest marketplace for NFTs, falling since the start of the year, some people view music as a space ripe to break out this year. Royal, Blau’s company, is among the most prominent of a crop of music blockchain start-ups that aim to revolutionise the industry. Through Blau’s personal connections — and Silicon Valley optimism around blockchain — Royal secured $55mn from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Peter Thiel, without ever making a pitchbook. Blau, who last February sold $12mn in NFTs attached to his songs, wants to scale that into a business through which ordinary fans can own music, “as opposed to just record labels, private equity and hedge funds”. 0.004% of streaming royalty rights 0.05% of streaming royalty rights plus more music 0.7% of streaming royalty rights and a meeting with Diplo Royal’s project with Diplo, for example, offers fans the option of paying $99 for a token representing 0.004 per cent of the streaming royalty rights to “Don’t Forget My Love”, the first single from his recently released album. For $999, you receive 0.05 per cent of the royalty rights, as well as an “exclusive DJ mix,” while $9,999 gives you 0.7 per cent of the royalties and a meeting with Diplo at a concert. These tokens do not equate to owning the copyrights to songs. Asked whether this is a good investment for fans, Blau said that there is an emotional attachment to the ownership, as well as the possibility of betting on the success of an artist before they become a star. “In real estate . . . if you own a single family home there’s the rental income and then there’s the actual asset appreciation, right?” he argued. Another longtime music label executive said that some of these projects “haven’t hit because people are concerned about the exploitative nature”, referring to the questionable investment value of streaming royalties. “There’s a lot of detractors that say: there’s only rich white dudes that are doing this and driving up the price of NFTs. “But I don’t think we can discount that technology is evolving,” the executive added. “We’ve been in playlist land for the past decade. I think that blockchain tokens are going to be fundamental to our world in 10 years, and anyone that says that’s not true is not looking back on history.” For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Anna Nicolaou","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-04-01","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/879ae372-bb3b-4aa1-a264-ce32304a77d9","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F2cf9b9dc-b41c-4f87-ae38-4ff6b052d384.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Web3 allows tech to indulge in its love of both speculation and idealism","INTRO":"Catch-all term suggests digital utopia but may really be a way to rebrand crypto investment","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Does it seem as though Web3 sprang into existence just a few months ago? It is the same here in San Francisco. All of a sudden a mythical digital utopia is being referenced in earnest by some of the biggest companies in the world. This is not by accident. Web3 was willed into being by tech investors. But it has given the wider sector a much-needed jolt of optimism. That optimism was on full display at ETHDenver, the biggest crypto conference in the US. Held in snowy Denver last month, the event had a distinctly low key aesthetic. The main stage looked like it had just finished hosting a warehouse party. Most attendees turned up in hoodies and jeans. Because I wore a smart coat I was frequently mistaken for an event organiser. But ETHDenver was also one of the most good-natured conferences I have ever been to. So what if the price of ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, had crashed from a high of $4,815 to less than $3,000. The ethereum blockchain on which it is built was going to save the world! No one mentioned money. The focus was co-operation online. “I believe that this is the mechanism for a new society,” said one speaker. “This is how we create a pluralistic civilisation,” declared another. Elon Musk’s younger brother Kimbal appeared on stage to talk about philanthropy. Vitalik Buterin, the 28-year-old Russian-Canadian co-founder of ethereum, spoke of a culture focused on new ideas. Does that sound confusing? It was. If you have trouble wrapping your head around Web3 that is because it is still an amorphous catch-all used to cover cryptocurrencies, the metaverse, non-fungible tokens and the idea of a community-driven, “decentralised” internet. Some of this is new, some not. The idea of users owning the internet goes back decades, though the term Web3 is credited to ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood in 2014. It reached critical mass last September when tech venture capitalist Chris Dixon published a Twitter thread describing it as a distinct new era of the internet. First came Web 1 (1990s decentralised internet), then Web 2 (Big Tech circa 2005-20), now Web3. The dates are an invention, just like the dividers used to describe one generation as boomers and another as millennials. But they are a neat way to think about the timeframe in which large tech companies took power and to imagine a different future. That future hinges on blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. In some ways, Web3 is really a way to rebrand crypto investment. Bitcoin’s volatility and lack of real-world application mean it is still dismissed by some as a fad. Web3 is presented as something more high-minded and tenable: a way to use the same mechanism to change the way the world works.

It is seeking to raise up to $4.5bn for new crypto funds. It is also helpful for companies seeking a new start. The same month Dixon was posting tweets about Web3, Facebook rebranded to Meta and declared its future was in the metaverse. There is a further connection. The company expects users to access the metaverse via virtual reality hardware like its own Oculus headsets. Dixon led Andreessen Horowitz’s early investment in Oculus. Does this add up to a spur for radical, positive change? Or is it just a new way for tech investors and companies to pull in money? Maybe it’s both. In Web3, tech has finally found a new way to indulge in its love of both speculation and idealism.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Elaine Moore","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-03-04","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/29ef0840-38f8-4ac2-a076-be0654c7f6ae","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F9f46d5c1-0ff4-4aac-a649-4da286ea46a1.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How NFTs could democratise fine art","INTRO":"Plus, the true size of the NFT world is tiny and HM Revenue \u0026 Customs seizes £5,000 of crypto assets","DETAILED_CONTENT":"This article is an on-site version of our #fintechFT newsletter. Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Monday Greetings, readers, from a very blustery London (and to US readers, a happy President’s Day)! One topic that’s been on my mind over the weekend is the continued importance of independent journalists in crypto-scoops. See “on-chain sleuth” Zachxbt, who uncovered that the co-founder of Quadriga and convicted felon, Michael Patryn, was involved in running a decentralised finance product. Even as media coverage of cryptocurrencies has ballooned, these blockchain detectives remain significant — news sites understandably can’t cover every new coin in depth. It certainly feels like a more tangible example of decentralisation in action than the freewheeling talk of Web3. In this week’s edition, Milan correspondent Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli talks about NFTs linked to physical art, I interview Asher Ismail at Uncapped and two NFT stories make it into our Fintech Fascination section. As ever, drop Imani (Imani.Moise@ft.com) or myself (Sid.V@ft.com) your emails with thoughts and suggested topics for coverage. Have a great week! In the distant past of 2018, there was talk that the blockchain could one day be a tool for the art world. A report from the University of Oxford and the Alan Turing Institute noted that digital ledgers could be useful for establishing provenance, but concluded that at the time blockchain was “more a narrative than any specific technology”. Fast forward two years and we’re in the midst of a the non-fungible token boom based on blockchain technology. Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks are two of the best known examples, but there are dozens of other NFTs in the space. Critics may quibble about the quality of some of the most popular examples, or point to the questionable practices of those selling works from creators who have not given their consent — but art is probably the most ubiquitous use of NFTs today. Virtual clothing for games and virtual worlds is currently a smaller if growing ecosystem, while the idea of NFTs for contracts, mortgages and legal purposes remain largely abstract. A Milan-based start-up, Aesthetes, is launching a new type of NFT, which it says will link the physical art world to the blockchain by connecting to a digital artwork and to a physical one. The NFTs will be based on artworks owned by Aesthetes or third parties. The company also says that it will make the buyer the full owner of the digital artwork, which they could go on to resell. They would also own a share of the physical artwork, which they can similarly successively resell for a profit. Aesthetes will manage the NFTs, but also be the curator for the physical artworks. The company’s stated aim is to make the art market “more democratic”. “We want to break the concept of elitist access to art in order to make it [accessible to everyone],” said co-founder Claudia Cimaglia. Unlike most NFT platforms which are powered by ethereum blockchain, the Milanese start-up employs XRP Ledger, a decentralised public blockchain which it says allows for NFT transactions at a lower cost and with a much lighter impact on the environment. Cimaglia and co-founder Luca Bertolani make the case that the €22bn NFT market will grow further. They say that the average investor is under age 40, and they hope to build a transparent and safe marketplace for young art collectors — although digital assets as a whole are still grappling with their use for illicit purposes. If the image of crypto-art was once just a powerful narrative tool, with NFTs it has become a reality. One issue from 2018 remains salient, though — the divide between creating art for the sake of art and producing it to make more money. Given the prices at which some of the most popular NFTs are sold, that tension has only gotten worse. (Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli) Every week we ask the founders of fast-growing fintechs to introduce themselves and explain what makes them stand out in a crowded industry. Our conversation, lightly edited, appears below. Last week, I spoke to Asher Ismail, co-founder of Uncapped. Founded in 2019, the company provides revenue-based financing to other start-ups as an alternative to banks or venture capital firms. This allows the nascent businesses to acquire cash to cover expenses such as marketing without needing to give personal guarantees or surrender equity. To date, it has made over 500 investments and raised $120mn; its last round in May 2021 raised $80mn, and was led by Lakestar. Previous investors include White Star Capital, Global Founders Capital and Mouro Capital. What was the inspiration for Uncapped? We’ve been looking at reinventing fundraising for founders. Many of them face challenges around affording inventory and hiring without having to give personal guarantees [to banks]. Every founder is thinking about ‘how can we get capital?’, but many don’t even have a chief financial officer in the business and face a lot of money challenges. What have been some of the shifts for fundraising as a result of Covid? We launched just before the pandemic started, and many of the investors we spoke to were completely freaked out. One of the powerful things we had was that we could connect the live data that companies use to run a check, compared to a traditional bank where you come in with a business plan and a profit and loss statement that you don’t necessarily believe in. What we saw across the sector was 10 years of ecommerce growth in the first three months of the pandemic, and we believe that one day ecommerce will just be commerce. I think one big shift from pre-pandemic has been a democratisation of capital. Previously, it was a lot easier if you were in a major hub. What Uncapped found was that 70 per cent of businesses would be outside the major metropolitan areas. How do you see the London fintech ecosystem shaping up? We see the trends in London following similar patterns to corporate funding globally. Capital is at its peak — we’ve never had this dynamic level of venture capitalists reaching out or sending gifts, trying to get in and have a conversation. You can feel this rush, and it’s part of something more global. American VCs are much more interested in the market too and it’s a long time coming, which is only beneficial for the London fintech scene. For us, it’s also great to be able to get backing to build a fintech and reinvest into the [London] community. What are the trends around diversity when it comes to start-ups and fundraising? Obviously this topic became of great interest following the Black Lives Matter protests. What I find a little frustrating is that a lot of people made promises about what they’re going to do and little action has come of that. Our solution: we try to remove the bias from fundraising, we aren’t looking at your CV, we’re fundamentally working with the data you’ve created in the business to make a decision. That’s the foundation of how Uncapped works. The broader ecosystem, I think, has a long way to go with that. The taxman’s taken all my NFTs Emma Agyemang reports on the first case of HM Revenue \u0026 Customs seizing three non-fungible tokens as part of a wider seizure of crypto assets worth about £5,000. The UK tax authority has released details on how individuals should record, report and pay tax on crypto transactions. The true size of the NFT world is tiny The hype of NFTs usually centres on the endorsements from the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Justin Bieber and the $24bn-worth traded to date. But as Tim Bradshaw writes, even optimistic estimates put the total audience size in the low single-digit millions, and that’s without accounting for wash trading to inflate figures.

Deregulation and early internet euphoria combined to produce a massive over-building of new networks. An estimated $2tn of telecoms stock market value went up in smoke when the mania passed. But the new fibre optic cables that had been laid lived on, meaning that the infrastructure was already in place when companies such as Google and Facebook emerged to drive a much bigger wave of digital activity. In the world of cryptocurrencies, could something similar be taking shape with a different kind of infrastructure? When the crypto craze passes, many of the currencies that have sprung up in the shadow of bitcoin will be worthless. But their soaring transaction volumes have created demand for real infrastructure and big investments are being made. If blockchains represent a new architecture that will shape the future of online activity beyond crypto speculation, then the need for infrastructure will remain. Picking the ultimate winners in this game requires making assumptions about how this world will evolve. Will it lead to complementary, but linked, blockchains, with room for many players? Or will this be a winner-takes-all industry where a handful of networks each becomes dominant in a particular type of transaction? And will the software and services needed to make the technology usable by non-experts give rise to dominant companies in different parts of a new technology “stack”? Big investments made in two companies this week highlight where some of the most prominent venture investors are placing their bets. They also show how one of the ideals behind the cryptocurrency movement — that it will lead to decentralised networks beyond the control of narrow government or corporate interests — may not survive the twin realities of technology and capitalism. Alchemy, which has raised $200mn, supplies tools that make it easier for businesses to interact with the blockchain. When they want to post to a network or call information from it, it is often through Alchemy’s technical links, removing the need to interact directly. That puts Alchemy in a strong position to mediate the data flows to blockchains, supplying the analytics and other tools users will need to operate. The emergence of companies like this shows that new bottlenecks may already be forming in the supposedly decentralised blockchain world. The second investment — a $450mn token sale by Polygon — represents a bet on the Ethereum network. Ethereum, which was the first to offer the “smart contracts” that are at the heart of decentralised applications being built on blockchains, is severely constrained. It handles a maximum of only 13 transactions per second, and is years behind in its efforts to upgrade its network. That has driven up transaction costs, as users bid for a scarce resource. To relieve the pressure, Polygon, and companies like it, are building on top of Ethereum which could make the blockchain the central hub of a much bigger tech ecosystem. This highlights what has become known as the “blockchain trilemma”. Ideally, the networks would combine security, decentralisation and low cost. But in practice, only two of these three conditions may be possible at the same time. Ethereum has achieved security and decentralisation. Companies like Polygon, for their part, focus on security and low costs, while sacrificing a degree of decentralisation. Inevitably, this opens the door to the risk that new tech suppliers could end up controlling important parts of the value chain. Ethereum’s slow network, meanwhile, has also created an opportunity for newer networks designed to handle much higher transaction volumes. They include Solana, whose tokens are now worth a total of $34bn, and Avalanche, the latest to shoot to prominence, with a token “market cap” of $21bn. With more developers being drawn to these networks and with bridges being built between them, the odds are rising that multiple chains will coexist, with Ethereum exerting the biggest gravitational pull. Ultimately, the high valuations already being put on this new infrastructure will only be justified if the applications they support become central to the online life of many millions of people. There’s a high chance that boom will turn to bust before the ultimate answer to that question becomes clear. richard.waters@ft.com For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click ","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Richard Waters","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-02-10","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/37b8c103-b044-435e-98cd-58a87d37041e","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F285da0a0-c65d-491e-b67d-92baf1d0021b.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"What’s the story, blockchain Tory?","INTRO":"Matt Hancock has a new passion, and it’s not one of his aides this time.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Long-time Alphaville readers will remember that back in 2018, after a certain cabinet minister — then a mere disgraced Tory MP — resigned from two appointments related to blockchain technology when we discovered a secret crypto pay deal, we saw it fit to initiate a series called “What’s the Tory crypto story?” (This title will resonate if you happen to be over the age of about 30 and British.) After that slight embarrassment for now Transport Secretary Michael Green Grant Shapps, the Tory crypto train has kept on chugging merrily along. There was the spectacular flop of Tory Baroness Mone’s crypto project, EQUI; there was then-chancellor Philip “Spreadsheet” Hammond promoting blockchain as an easy solution for the Irish Border problem; more recently there was chair of the UK foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat preaching the virtues of crypto by deploying unforgettable syntax such as “when the queen’s head leaves the coin and goes on to the blockchain”. And before any of them, of course, there was David Cameron — a man known for his impeccable taste in all things financial. It’s not just crypto; it’s blockchain too. In a November report entitled “Blockchain Industry in the UK Landscape Overview 2021” by “Innovation Eye” and the “Big Innovation Centre”, the ruling party’s love affair with all things related to the distributed dream ledger over the past five years is charted. It’s a nice and politically informative chart: Just look at that sea of blue! If you’re wondering about the block of red in the second line, well that’s Chi Onwurah, Labour MP for Newcastle Upon Tyne Central, who has a background in technology. But when she mentions blockchain, it’s to say things like: “For some, blockchain is a way of avoiding government”, and that the “libertarian idea that technology is the answer to everything has driven our regulatory approach for too long”. Music to our luddite lugholes, tbh. Over on the other side of the chamber, though, there’s a new crypto playa in town. And the new pusher of virtual currencies is none other than king of virtual tears himself, Mr Matthew Hancock, a former cabinet minster and now mere disgraced Tory MP (you might notice a theme). Having resigned from his job as health secretary following an affair with an aide, it seems our Matt has turned his sights towards loftier things. So lofty in fact, one might say he is heading to da moon — the MP for West Suffolk’s current pinned tweet is the following: It is vital the UK becomes home to new innovations, like fintech and crypto currencies. My piece in @CityAM on making Great Britain the international centre for financial innovation post-Brexit ⬇️https://t.co/gcpuiGBU1Z That’s right. According to Hancock, Britain should not just embrace the famously above-board and stable world of cryptocurrencies but actually become “home” to them, whatever that might mean. From his piece: Every second advert on the tube seems to be for cryptocurrency. Britain should be the natural place to develop new markets like this – with a liberal, progressive regulatory regime that allows this radical new innovation to flourish, and allows people to take their own risks . . .  We need a commitment to a progressive, liberal environment for fintech, including cryptocurrencies, which allows people to invest their own money as they choose, to make – or lose – as much as they want. We must embrace modern technology to make life easier for people – for example making payments, especially international payments, easier and cheaper. Yeah come on regulators! Why would you try to protect people from losing all their money? There are adverts on the tube, OK? This stuff must be legit! He continues: Britain should be welcoming, embracing, and leading these changes. But over the last few years our lead in fintech has run into a reactionary risk aversion among regulators. Instead we need to embrace change, not fear it. This means putting in place a regulatory regime that protects people, especially from any systemic risks. Um, is it just us or does the final sentence there rather contradict the previous paragraph? How can Hancock be pressing for a regulatory regime that protects people and guards against systemic risk while simultaneously be pressing for a less risk-averse regulatory framework for fintech? In his comments on crypto and fintech in parliament a few days earlier, Hancock had gone even further, declaring: Post Brexit, the UK has the chance to be the home of fintech, which not only can be an economic driver, but can help to cut fraud and financial crime because of the transparency it brings. Now, we have to be honest: cutting fraud and financial crime are not *quite* the first things that come to mind when we think about crypto and fintech, but we guess we should give this man the benefit of the doubt. But all this crypto and fintech and blockchain shilling — he told the Express last week that blockchain had “a wide range of uses, in terms of secure contracts and greater transparency” — did get us wondering what was going on. Was Hancock just proving his techy credentials before gearing up for a run at the leadership in a post-Boris future? Was he eyeing up one of those cushy crypto jobs that Hammond recently landed? Or was there something else to it? In our quest for an answer, we stumbled across the Linkedin profile of Matt’s brother, Chris. It turns out that he’s the founder and CEO of a fintech firm called Crowd2Fund, a peer-to-peer lending company that claims to offer “a new generation of investments to pioneer a cultural shift away from the traditional banking systems”. The Guardian has written about this company before, back in 2019, reporting that: As minister of state for skills and enterprise in 2013, Matt Hancock worked in the government department responsible for setting up the regulatory framework for crowdfunding. In 2013, Matt Hancock told the House of Commons: “We are supporting crowdfunding on financial terms, not least through the new business bank, but we are also making sure that it can operate in a high-quality framework . . .  On a different occasion, Matt Hancock urged a fellow MP “to look also at peer-to-peer finance, whether equity or loan, because that is a small but growing part of the market that companies can look to when trying to access finance”. Hancock’s urging, according to Hansard, was in October 2013. According to Chris Hancock’s LinkedIn and Companies House records, Crowd2Fund was founded just a few months later. And Crowd2Fund isn’t Chris Hancock’s only venture into the world of fintech — he has his finger in the blockchain pie too. He has a company called Finblocks, a “global, security, compliance, deposit and payments system” that “allows clients to leverage the benefits of blockchain simply, easily and in a compliant way”. Last April, Matt Hancock was accused of “cronyism” by Labour, after he declared that he owned a 15 per cent stake in Topwood Limited, an approved supplier to NHS England. Hancock’s sister, Emily Gilruth, is named as a director of the company on Companies House. We asked Matt Hancock whether he thought there was any conflict of interest in his advocating for barriers to be removed for the fintech industry and for crypto and blockchain projects, given his brother’s work. We also asked if he had any comment on the timing of Crowd2Fund’s founding. A spokesman for the MP told us: As explained to the FT, this factless insinuation of wrong doing is not only false and baseless but embarrassing. Matt has a long-standing expertise in digital matters and the idea he shouldn’t talk about something he has detailed knowledge of because his brother is an entrepreneur is clearly absurd. This is unfounded speculation not journalism We were then sent two updated versions of the comment that took out the “embarrassing” bit and the “unfounded speculation bit”, and added that Hancock is a “champion of fintech”, but we preferred the original. We understand that Matt Hancock has no investment in crypto nor any financial interest in his brother’s fintech companies.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-02-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/2d50d5ed-b652-4667-833d-9e2533a61555","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fc256a0ca-8c74-47e2-9b7d-fac04e381eea.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"US arrests two and seizes $3.6bn in cryptocurrency from Bitfinex hack","INTRO":"Prosecutors charge New York-based couple with conspiring to launder billions stolen in 2016 breach","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The US Department of Justice has arrested two people and confiscated more than $3.6bn worth of cryptocurrency that it said was stolen during the high-profile 2016 hack of the Bitfinex exchange, executing the government agency’s largest financial seizure. New York-based Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 31, were arrested on Tuesday and accused of conspiring to launder proceeds of 119,754 bitcoin valued at $4.5bn, prosecutors said in a statement. The cryptocurrency was allegedly taken when Hong Kong-based Bitfinex was breached. The justice department’s operation came as authorities have poured resources into cryptocurrency enforcement after vowing to crack down on the criminal use of digital tokens. “Today’s arrests, and the department’s largest financial seizure ever, show that cryptocurrency is not a safe haven for criminals,” said Lisa Monaco, deputy attorney-general. US prosecutors alleged that the Bitfinex hacker launched more than 2,000 unauthorised transactions that sent stolen bitcoin from the exchange to a digital wallet controlled by Lichtenstein. The assets’ value shot from approximately $71mn at the time of the breach to more than $4.5bn due to the rise in bitcoin’s value, authorities said. Some of the stolen tokens were transferred to accounts controlled by the couple via a “complicated money laundering process” that included “chain-hopping” — jumping between different cryptocurrencies, often in rapid succession — and using tokens that have extra anonymity built into them. More than 94,000 bitcoin allegedly remained in the wallet. Representatives for Lichtenstein and Morgan could not immediately be reached for comment. They were scheduled to make initial court appearances in Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon. Morgan is also known as Razzlekhan, according to court documents. The website razzlekhan.com describes Razzlekhan as a “rapper [who is] also a software CEO, a writer, an economist, and a few contradictory other things”. Responding to questions about her own digital assets, Morgan told a virtual currency exchange: “My boyfriend (now husband) gifted me cryptocurrency over several years (2014, 2015,), [sic] which have appreciated. I have been keeping them in cold storage,” according to court documents. Bitfinex said it was “pleased” the justice department had recovered a “significant portion” of the bitcoin stolen during the hack and that it would continue to co-operate “extensively” with the agency. Cryptocurrencies have become a payment method of choice for cyber criminals including thieves as well as ransomware attacks that encrypt victims’ data until a ransom is paid, typically in bitcoin. Recommended However, every transaction is recorded on an immutable blockchain, giving investigators opportunities to monitor and trace payments, a burgeoning field known as blockchain analytics or forensics. “Today, federal law enforcement demonstrates once again that we can follow money through the blockchain, and that we will not allow cryptocurrency to be a safe haven for money laundering or a zone of lawlessness within our financial system,” said Kenneth Polite, assistant attorney-general at the DoJ’s criminal division. Lichtenstein and Morgan have been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum punishment of 20 years in prison, and conspiracy to defraud the US, which has a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

The move will allow investors to track a basket of projects betting on decentralised finance, trading and lending networks whose standards are automated and often decided by consensus. The fund, called the Hashdex DeFi Index ETF, marks a departure for an industry that hitherto has encompassed funds investing in listed crypto businesses, or popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether — where permitted by regulators. It will list on the Brazilian stock exchange on February 17. “By offering the first DeFi ETF in the world, we are providing our global investors with the ability to play a part in the next evolution of the crypto ecosystem,” said Marcelo Sampaio, chief executive of Hashdex, a Brazilian crypto asset manager. Decentralised finance aims to do away with a centralised intermediary — like a bank or an exchange — to provide financial services such as lending and trading through an algorithm. Supporters say it offers greater transparency, resistance to censorship and faster settlement times than traditional finance. It was one of the fastest-growing areas of the crypto asset industry although interest has cooled in the past two months as crypto prices have fallen. Decentralised applications (Dapps) hold about $107bn of customers’ funds, down from a November peak of $180bn, according to data from DappRadar. The Hashdex DeFi Index ETF will invest in the tokens developed by Dapps, networks built on blockchain technology and use preprogrammed algorithms to execute cryptocurrency trades. Dapp tokens can be traded on other crypto markets but also allow owners to vote on governance proposals and developments for the network. The ETF will invest in eight Dapps, as well as related service providers such as oracles, which gather data on asset prices from the outside world and send it to a blockchain or distributed ledger. The Dapps it has targeted include Uniswap, used to exchange cryptocurrencies and tokens; lender Aave; Polygon, a service designed to speed up transactions on blockchains; and Chainlink, an oracle. The ETF will track the CF DeFi Composite Index-Brazil. The launch highlights a divide between global financial centres that have thus far permitted little innovation in the growing field of digital assets, and relatively laissez-faire secondary financial hubs. While Canada, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Jersey and Liechtenstein all boast spot cryptocurrency ETPs, and Australia and India are poised to join them, US regulators have only approved futures-based versions, while those in the UK, Hong Kong and Singapore have not even permitted these vehicles. Not everyone is convinced by the more liberal approach, however. “This strikes me as an artefact of a race to the bottom with respect to crypto asset regulation in general and the regulation of registered funds that invest in such assets more generally,” Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, said of the Hashdex fund. A rival issuer described the ETF as “cool”, but said it was “more iterative, rather than highly innovative”, building on the network of crypto basket exchange traded products already available. Bruno Sousa, head of global operations at Hashdex, said Dapp tokens are “structurally very different” from cryptocurrencies. Many use the ethereum blockchain, which can hold financial assets and allows programmers to code functions for buying and selling into smart contracts. That allows them to be used for lending, insurance, trading and staking assets. “These are similar to start-ups. They have solutions for given sections of the market. If they do well they will grow, if they don’t they will diminish and the token will dwindle in value,” Sousa said. Formed in 2018, Hashdex at present has one ETF in Brazil, the $350m Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF (HASH11), which it claims is the largest crypto basket ETF in the world, attracting investors ranging from retail to macro hedge funds. It also runs a similar US-based private fund in conjunction with Victory Capital. Recommended Hashdex hopes to launch similar products elsewhere but is reliant on the speed of regulatory change. “Other places are moving with different rhythms. Given the current regulatory landscape in the US, there is no clear pathway for a spot ETF,” said Sousa. “Our expectation, in general, is that the regulators will become ever more comfortable with structures like this and acknowledge that this is a way to buy into the market that the regulator can see and touch, and can engage with the issuers,” he said. In the meantime, launching in Brazil gives Hashdex “the ability to test new products and see how the public react”. DEFI11 will charge an annual fee of 1.3 per cent, high for an ETF but competitive for digital asset funds, particularly multi-asset baskets. With smaller market capitalisations than cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, the underlying tokens may be even more volatile. Amid a global market sell-off, the CF DeFi Composite Index-Brazil has fallen 44 per cent since its launch on December 1 last year. “That is a consequence of assets that are seen as risk assets in general, from stocks to crypto,” Sousa said. “Crypto does respond to the regular market. Over longer periods there is less correlation but in times of high stress, that does affect investors [as] they will have hands in different pots. “This is normal. A 40 per cent dip is something that happens with some frequency in crypto, but what happens is that it continues to grow,” Sousa argued. “Look at this with intellectual humility. This is a phenomenon that is based on a technological advance that is massive. This is a major advance like the internet in the 1990s.” Additional reporting by Philip Stafford For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click Click here to visit the ETF Hub","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Steve Johnson","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-01-31","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f4531e92-0842-4bcc-9879-04c71d44d83c","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F2f82f975-e40a-4a9c-8dfc-ab55e0dd1e8d.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"All digital creations are NFTs. We just don’t know it yet.","INTRO":"Why NFTs may soon have to compete with cash flow-generating content hosted on more conventional platforms.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"If you follow non-fungible token (NFT) news, you may have noticed that the market has recently been coming to terms with the harsh reality that NFTs are possibly not as good for artists as the creative community first thought. As NBC News’ Kevin Collier noted only a couple of weeks ago, creators are discovering rapid growth in the NFT space has opened the door to rampant piracy and fraud in the creative sector. On most NFT platforms including OpenSea, by far the largest NFT marketplace, people can create an account and start selling whatever digital images they want to upload. Not only does that mean there’s no guarantee you’re buying a copyright claim with an NFT purchase, it follows that there’s no guarantee you’re even buying an authentic creator-approved NFT. A good example of this is that even Melania Trump’s collection, the crème de la crème of NFT issues which launched at the end of December on the Solana platform, is already being duplicated unofficially on OpenSea, a competing platform. Unless you are a discerning digital collector who understands digital signatures, chances are you won’t be able to tell the difference between an authentic Melania and a fake. All the more so if Solana, the Trumps’ preferred NFT blockchain platform, goes down, as it did at the weekend when it suffered an instability setback, becoming inaccessible for large periods of time due to transaction congestion. The relationship between NFTs and copyright has always been a murky and unclear one. Nonetheless, there was at the peak of the mania an assumption that some sort of value was being assigned to someone in the process of an NFT transaction. This, however, has started to unravel as it’s become increasingly obvious blockchains do not solve the Garbage In Garbage Out (GIGO) problem. The GIGO vulnerability means that while it’s still incredibly difficult to counterfeit or hack a token once it’s been created, there’s no guarantee the token itself was created legitimately. (A bit like self-reporting a QR code associated with a self-administered lateral flow test. You still need to trust that the originator, or test-taker, truly reports the correct result.) The irony, for a supposedly highly innovative market like the NFT one, is that centralised platforms like YouTube solved this GIGO problem long ago by actively policing content for copyright abuse at the origination point. According to Collier, while NFT platforms (especially those with identifiable management structures) are becoming increasingly responsive to takedown requests from artists who flag copyright breaches, the burden of policing fakes still falls on creators not the platforms. This reveals two important issues about the market. Firstly, that it is incredibly sensitive to becoming embroiled in any high profile copyright dispute and, secondly, the benefits of its decentralised state in giving creators more power have been massively exaggerated. Awareness of these two points is giving way to another important realisation: that the presence of a blockchain makes very little material difference to anything. When the Solana blockchain network became inaccessible during the peak of the weekend’s crypto rout, we wondered out loud what might happen to NFTs if the value of the blockchain they reside on goes to zero. Or if the miners who usually support the network head for the exit? Do such NFTs become internet ghosts? Are they resigned for all perpetuity to the Wayback Machine? Who continues to fund their verification and hosting? According to the Twitter feedback (somewhat skewed towards crypto interests) the answer is no, none of this would necessarily be problematic. The chain would likely still continue to be validated by the originating entity, meaning the only negative consequence would be more centralised control of the system. In the worst-case scenario, NFTs could be transferred to more functional blockchains. What it also means, however, is that NFT platforms, like banks, are highly vulnerable to runs. To use banking parlance (JARGON ALERT), NFT platforms are mostly capital-light facilitators of open-source origination of zero-coupon perpetual assets that draw funding exclusively from capital markets, and whose performance depends on continuing positive mark-to-market valuations in highly illiquid markets. If and when their mark-to-market valuation falls to zero, and the market for new origination closes, they too will have no incentive to keep the assets verified at their own costs. A withdrawal of market funding coupled with a buyers’ strike, where customers boycott sites with the aim of securing lower prices in the longer term, would leave a platform struggling to survive. Indeed, the only way for a platform to withstand the run risk is to promise to throw their own capital at supporting the blockchain and the assets if all else fails. Yet that begs another question. Why would investors in an NFT platform on a dying blockchain be any more inclined to burn capital supporting underperforming non-cash generating assets than they would a distressed bank? So where does this leave us in terms of understanding the longer term potential and value of NFTs? We think it fits our wider thesis that NFTs are better thought of as a type of advertising market, wherein valuations reflect a sunk cost rather than any sustainable long-term value. So, while a traditional advertising market turns creative content into a cash flow-positive asset, NFTs use outrageous upfront cash flows to direct eyeballs to images or messages spenders want to promote. The art is the advertising. And over time, as with art philanthropy more generally, only those images or assets that satisfy the cultural agendas of the hyper-moneyed classes are likely to continue to do well. But that’s far from a cultural revolution in the making. If anything it gears artists towards making content that panders to the existing tastes and agendas of multi-billionaires like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos. At times like this, what a truly distributed and diverse creator market needs — and what platforms like YouTube have and NFT platforms don’t — are cash flows. With cash flows, properly investable assets and associated markets for such assets can be created and a much broader pool of innovative art can come to the table. Which begs the question, given both systems are likely to end up just as centralised as each other, why wouldn’t YouTube seize on the NFT craze to create a secondary marketplace for the cash-flow generating content that already resides on its system? It’s probably something to do with scaling and liquidity. Nonetheless, platforms whose reputations are already aligned with not just hosting content, but monetising it by verifying its authenticity and copyright conditionality, are far more likely to succeed at turning the non-fungible tokens they issue into assets than ones that are not. Unless the true point of NFTs, of course, was never really to create a market for legitimate artistic content, but rather to help propagate or push images and messages that would never stand out (or even be accepted as advertising) on more conventional content platforms.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Izabella Kaminska","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-01-25","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/60c4868b-0122-4101-ba80-7185eba9d95c","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F9fbd48e3-ad86-4356-943f-3f93437cda75.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Singapore clamps down on ads for ‘highly risky’ crypto trading","INTRO":"Move signals further caution despite platforms’ eagerness to tap financial hub","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Singapore’s financial regulator is clamping down on the marketing of cryptocurrency services in the city-state in a further setback for digital asset service providers looking to establish themselves in the Asian financial hub. The Monetary Authority of Singapore on Monday published a set of guidelines instructing crypto businesses to stop marketing or advertising their offerings to retail investors in public spaces, both physical and virtual, calling the trading of such assets “highly risky and not suitable for the general public”. The guidelines are not legally binding, but the announcement comes as authorities have already disappointed several businesses with the slow pace of approvals for platforms looking to set up operations in Singapore. Effective immediately, cryptocurrency players should not solicit customers through ads on social media platforms or other public websites, on public transport such as buses and trains or the venues where they stop, or through broadcast and print media. They are also discouraged from providing physical ATMs for dispensing crypto tokens. This article is from Nikkei Asia, a global publication with a uniquely Asian perspective on politics, the economy, business and international affairs. Our own correspondents and outside commentators from around the world share their views on Asia, while our Asia300 section provides in-depth coverage of 300 of the biggest and fastest-growing listed companies from 11 economies outside Japan. Subscribe | Group subscriptions These digital asset service providers should also not engage external parties, such as social media influencers, to promote their crypto-based offerings to people in Singapore. They can, however, continue to market or advertise on their own corporate websites, mobile applications or official social media accounts. “The trading of cryptocurrencies is highly risky and not suitable for the general public,” Loo Siew Yee, MAS assistant managing director for policy, payments and financial crime, said in a press statement on Monday. “DPT service providers should therefore not portray the trading of DPTs in a manner that trivialises the high risks of trading in DPTs, nor engage in marketing activities that target the general public,” she added, referring to digital payment tokens, which Singapore’s central bank uses as a broad classification to cover cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ethereum and similar assets underpinned by blockchain technology. Singapore-based Foris DAX Asia, which operates the crypto.com trading platform, has been promoting its portal in movie theatres in the city-state. The company even splashed out to hire American actor Matt Damon to front its ads. Across multiplex screens in Singapore, the Hollywood star has appeared in a promotional video uttering the tagline “fortune favours the brave” for crypto.com before movies start. According to MAS guidelines, such advertisements should no longer be used in public venues to market the wares of DPT players. “The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) requires us to provide this risk warning to you as a customer of a digital payment token (DPT) service provider,” a disclaimer on crypto.com reads. “Please note that you may not be able to recover all the money or DPTs you paid to Foris DAX Asia Pte Ltd if Foris DAX Asia Pte Ltd business fails.” While there is no specified penalty should crypto service providers fail to follow the guidelines, the financial regulator is likely to take note of digital asset companies that ignore the public safeguards, which may in turn affect whether they are allowed to continue operating legally in Singapore. While the marketing framework came into effect on January 17, DPT players are being given some leeway to wind down any advertising efforts that run contrary to the guidelines, for instance if certain contractual obligations need to be fulfilled. Singapore’s central bank is taking a similar stance on the matter to the UK, where the advertising watchdog has moved to clamp down on “misleading” marketing carried out by crypto players. The city-state’s guidelines also come as regulators across jurisdictions tighten scrutiny of the emerging crypto sector, which is known for operating across borders and away from regulatory oversight. But for crypto players, the move by the MAS to curtail their ability to target Singaporean customers adds to the difficulty many of them already face operating in the city-state. These businesses have raced to set up in Singapore in the past few years to leverage its status as a prominent hub for the growth of financial technology services. They run the spectrum from exchange platforms for trading crypto, to investment managers and financial advisers looking after digital asset portfolios for the wealthy. Authorities, however, have set a high benchmark for granting licences, with only a handful awarded so far. Under Singapore’s Payment Services Act, businesses that provide offerings relating to DPTs are regulated primarily for money laundering and terrorism financing risks, as well as technology risks. To operate legally, they need to apply for licences in the area of “digital payment token services”. Since the Act took effect in January 2020, there have been about 180 applications for permits for such services. But only five of these have been awarded in-principle approvals, the MAS said. Sixty DPT applications were withdrawn, while three have been rejected. This failure rate comes in stark contrast to the image cast of Singapore as a crypto-friendly location relative to other jurisdictions such as China, which has banned the digital asset. In view of the rapidly changing landscape for the industry, the MAS said it would continue to review the provision of DPT services to the public by providers and may update these guidelines as necessary. The regulator had asked crypto stakeholders and the Singapore FinTech Association, a lobby group for tech-based financial businesses in the city-state, for feedback on the guidelines before they were published. The SFA said in a statement that the new framework demonstrates that Singapore continues to see blockchain and cryptocurrencies as innovations that have the potential to gain mass adoption in the community, acknowledging that such adoption should be “balanced with pragmatic guardrails”. “The technology behind blockchain has the potential to open many exciting opportunities for the industry and bring benefits to consumers,” said Shadab Taiyabi, president of the SFA. “Opening the doors to innovation also requires a system of checks and balances to be put in place before consumers gain full awareness and understanding of the new tools.” A version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on January 17 2022. ©2022 Nikkei Inc.

Upbit launched its crypto art marketplace in November and plans to release a range of NFTs featuring members of BTS in a joint venture with the boy band’s management company, Hybe. But members of the band’s powerful young fan base have criticised NFTs and the crypto industry in general over the energy consumption involved in mining and tracking ownership of the tokens. Sirgoo Lee, chief executive of Upbit’s operator Dunamu, told the Financial Times in an interview that the joint venture with Hybe would use “low carbon, eco-friendly” technology to mint the NFTs. Lee said that Upbit’s NFT marketplace used blockchain technology developed by another Dunamu subsidiary, Lambda256, that claims to use 99.99 per cent less energy on its Luniverse platform than leading blockchain-based platforms such as ethereum. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click “We will try to explain to the fans that this is not environmentally harmful,” said Lee. The first token purchased on the platform, an image of a painting of a girl holding a cat by artist Jang Koal called “Mirage Cat 3”, was sold in November for about $173,000 of bitcoin. Luniverse claimed that the energy consumed for its entire blockchain network including NFTs was estimated to be “around 842.53kWh a year”, an amount roughly equivalent to the monthly electricity consumption of a US residential utility consumer. South Korea has one of the world’s biggest digital currency markets. The Korean won is the third most widely used currency for bitcoin trading, after the dollar and yen, accounting for 3.4 per cent of global trading, according to data from Coinhills, an industry tracker. Lee also said that there was a need for global action to address issues such as money laundering and cyber theft. In 2019, cyber criminals hacked the Upbit exchange, stealing about $49m of ether, the ethereum cryptocurrency. “One of my nightmares is being hacked and losing all [the investors’] money. It’s a huge responsibility and it keeps you up at night,” said Lee. Recommended “I’m not worried about going to jail, I’m more worried about being stabbed to death by our investors.” Many young South Koreans are enthusiastic buyers of digital assets, motivated in part by high youth unemployment and surging housing prices, according to experts. The crypto frenzy has driven a surge in bitcoin prices in South Korea, where it is trading at a 2-3 per cent premium compared with the US, narrowing a gap that reached 20 per cent last year. Lee deflected criticism that indebted young Koreans attracted to NFTs and large gains from crypto trading were being exposed to excessive financial risk, arguing that their understanding of the asset class was underestimated. “In the west, young people grew up playing consoles after school, whereas in Korea these young folks go online to play games, they are used to collecting and buying digital items,” said Lee. “These young guys understand that there’s this value in digital assets.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Christian Davies Song Jung-a","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-01-26","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/1bc90b32-dc76-439b-82aa-6e49a06af79b","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F992c4aa9-c338-48ac-8bbf-fd7908a36c71.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Could blockchain speed up home buying?","INTRO":"Fintech Coadjute is the latest attempt to streamline UK property transactions","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Buying or selling a house is said to be one of the most stressful life events — but a blockchain-enabled fintech aims to make the process easier and quicker for consumers. Demand for property soared during the pandemic, but an analysis of Land Registry data found the full sale process took an average 295 days from start to finish, as estate agents, solicitors, mortgage brokers, lenders, buyers and sellers grapple with the paperwork. Coadjute is the latest attempt to digitise the UK’s convoluted conveyancing process. It has now begun a national roll out, enabling all parties involved in a property transaction to securely share data and track live progress of the deal from start to finish. Backed by Swiss venture capitalist firm Blockchain Valley Ventures, Coadjute comes after two previous attempts to modernise the conveyancing process by the Land Registry and the Law Society ended in failure. Dan Salmons, chief executive, said that because Coadjute is a digital network that uses private blockchain — a record of asset ownership — to connect to existing systems that different groups of professionals already use, it can enable data, documentation and live updates to be shared in real time without having to use a standalone piece of software. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click It is already integrated within the most popular case management systems that are used by property professionals, such as Redbrick, and he said consumers would also be able to see live updates on their housing transactions in real time later this year. Salmons, a former NatWest director who spearheaded the introduction of contactless cards, said the ability for different professionals to use blockchain securely to share centralised documents, such as identity checks, title deeds and local searches would “synchronise what is a highly fragmented process” and speed up transaction times. He added the technology would make it easier for professionals to spot omissions and other factors holding up deals, making the homebuying process less stressful for consumers and more efficient for professionals, who will pay to use the service. One of Salmons’ team is currently moving house. “Since his offer was accepted nine months ago, he’s made 323 phone calls chasing up where the deal has got to,” he said. “The problem is, the people you’re calling don’t know the answer. They have to make another phone call to find out, and the consumer has no visibility over where they are in the process.” Coadjute is one of several fintech innovations attempting to crack this problem, others include View My Chain, a data-driven chain management tool for agents, buyers and sellers. Industry professionals believe Coadjute’s chances of success will depend on how widely its data-sharing model is adopted. “The time is absolutely ripe for technology to resolve these issues, but everyone needs to be on board for this to succeed,” said Andrew Montlake, managing director of mortgage broker Coreco. “I was sceptical at first, but when you look at the number of case management systems, estate agents and search companies Coadjute’s got involved, it stands a good chance,” said Beth Rudolf, director of delivery at the Conveyancing Association, a trade body for the industry. Recommended “For consumers, the difficulty is this process only starts when their offer is accepted. There are so many problems with leaseholds, title and restrictive covenants, it would be better if this data were collected up front and made available at the point of sale.” She added that, currently, 34 per cent of property transactions fall through. “It can be easy to fix these problems if you have time to do it, but not if you have a buyer desperate to proceed.” The ability to collect and share data up front could also help to minimise disputes and delays caused by rows over what fixtures and fittings are included with the property. Coadjute is taking part in a pilot scheme to improve this process with the Home Buying and Selling Group, a government initiative to bring the industry together to improve the consumer experience. “A lot of these industry problems are fundamentally issues of not having secure access to data,” Salmons said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Claer Barrett","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-01-21","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f5d5bed3-8cf2-40c6-8f85-6b824a223ffe","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F3ffd1f8f-c5b1-4bb9-97b2-56cafdbb9281.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Would you buy a home in the metaverse?","INTRO":"Millions are being invested in virtual property — but what do you get for your money in reality?","DETAILED_CONTENT":"For many homeowners, the Covid-19 pandemic forced a change in perspective on where they wanted to live. Why stay in a cramped apartment in the smoggy city when you can Zoom into your meetings from a country farmhouse or Edwardian manor or Martello tower? Or why not buy your own island, complete with villa? Part of an exclusive 100 person community called Fantasy Islands, far away from the hustle and bustle of crowded city streets, its website lists it as the creation of “lady pirate poet” Agadora Humphries. And with prices starting as low as $104,000, it’s a steal —less than half the average cost of a first-time buyer’s house in the UK. There is one slight catch, though — you can’t actually live in it because it only exists online. It exists in The Sandbox, a metaverse: one of many virtual worlds filled with digital assets ranging from dresses and sneakers to art and cars. Users buy a digital receipt of the property, a non-fungible token (NFT) that is recorded on a shared digital ledger known as a blockchain, similar to how cryptocurrency transactions are logged. Welcome to the future of real estate — at least according to enthusiasts, who point at the millions of dollars already being thrown into the space. For its detractors, it looks like a rehash of earlier virtual worlds, with blockchain hype stuck on the end. Prices start at $104,000 — less than half the average cost of a first-time buyer’s house in the UK In 1992, long before the blockchain went viral, Neal Stephenson’s cyberpunk novel Snow Crash touched on the idea of virtual real estate. Jordan Fragen, senior market analyst at gaming data company Newzoo, says that would-be digital tycoons first got the chance to buy online virtual property in the mid-2000s. Platforms such as Second Life and science-fiction game Entropia Universe, which both predate Facebook, were the lab. In 2012, part of a “planet” in Entropia Universe sold for $2.5m; landowners receive a cut of the planet’s gross revenue generated via its internal economy, and can rent out land for virtual events, such as hunting trips. But even that sum has been dwarfed by a $4.3m purchase in The Sandbox, one of the better-known metaverses. Metaverse company Republic Realm bought the land as part of a venture it intends to develop with games company Atari, says chief executive Janine Yorio, adding that the business began as an experiment during the pandemic. “We launched the first project in March and it very quickly became clear it wasn’t nuts and that there were other people trying to figure it out,” she says. Facebook’s choice during its annus horribilis last year to rebrand itself as Meta has also helped drive interest in the metaverse phenomenon, she adds. Recommended Republic Realm launched Fantasy Islands last August, a development of 100 islands with villas that buyers can “visit”, remodel, use to show off their NFT artworks and host friends in. Ownership also grants access to a members-only channel on chat app Discord. Yorio says 90 sold within the first 24 hours after their listing, with no plans to list the last 10 for sale any time soon. Resale listings for Fantasy Islands on NFT marketplace Rarible range from 40 ether-1,000 ether, a cryptocurrency value equivalent to, at the time of writing, $104,000 to over $2.6m (although the highest bid on Rarible is just under $1,700 at the moment). Last year, Republic Realm sold “The Metaflower”, a superyacht the company describes as “fit for after-parties and beach retreats alike”, for $650,000 in The Sandbox. The unknown buyer’s only other NFT on OpenSea — an online marketplace for NFTs — is a list of fantasy loot, including a wand and dragon’s crown which could be used in role-playing games such as Dungeons \u0026 Dragons. Republic Realm is also looking at products such as “a customised metaverse real estate” with a diverse portfolio of property across different metaverses, custom-builds and property management. Prices start at 350 ether, more than $900,000 . A more modest upcoming option is a customisable storefront, with rents starting at 20 ether a year (over $50,000). Proximity to points of interest, such as the virtual mansion the rapper Snoop Dogg is building, will probably command higher value. The company has also bought into rival metaverse Decentraland, building a digital shopping space called Metajuku— digitally measuring 16,000 sq ft— inspired by the Tokyo district Harajuku, known for its distinctive fashion. Decentraland is divided into exactly 90,000 parcels of land, prices for which start at $10,000. As in The Sandbox, location is everything. Land close to public plazas such as Dragon City, Vegas City and Decentraland’s own red light district are more expensive, regardless of the fact “you can teleport wherever you want” at the click of a button, says Adam de Cata, Decentraland’s head of partnerships. Yorio sees an opportunity for early investors to buy up prime real estate that will play host to interactive experiences. “Shopping is a really exciting proposition,” says Yorio. “We could be both at Nike.com, and we can do it together without being in the same place. I could pick up a pair of sneakers and show them to you and you could say, ‘It’s just not you.’” The German sports company Adidas bought land in The Sandbox last year, describing its “acquisition of a plot of land on the platform [as] a way of expressing our excitement around the possibilities it holds”. Yorio says that real-world property developers are mistaken if they believe they can simply transition into the metaverse. “We’ve confused an existing industry, whose skills in bricks and mortar are inappropriate for a virtual world. Every day I wake up to a barrage of emails from real-estate developers . . . but nobody needs serviced apartments in the metaverse,” she says. “The metaverse is better than reality, it’s different than reality — that’s what’s going to make it part of our lives.” De Cata echoes that sentiment. “There’s a level of absurdity to the metaverse, there aren’t the limits you need to deal with in a physical space,” he says. Last year, the socialite Paris Hilton DJ-ed at a Decentraland festival hosted in outer space. While those looking to buy ready-built developments can turn to companies like Republic Realm, would-be land buyers can go direct to metaverse owners or through marketplaces such as Parcel, the self-described “Zillow for the metaverse”. Parcel is currently mainly selling undeveloped virtual land, says Noah Gaynor, chief executive and co-founder, reflecting the early state of the metaverse. But he sees a bright future in more complex transactions. “We also want to facilitate rentals, like you want to Airbnb out your virtual condo, and financial services like mortgages, and then also bring together service providers and landowners,” he adds. Gaynor says there has been interest from family offices, hedge funds and wealthy individuals looking to buy up land in metaverses alongside institutional investors. But the space is more complex for investors than buying land offline, says Lorne Sugarman, chief executive of Metaverse Group, which invested $2.5m in Decentraland space to host virtual fashion shows. Sugarman and Yorio both say that family offices buying undeveloped virtual land are unlikely to get the most out of their investment without teams of experienced 3D games designers. We’ve confused an industry whose skills in bricks and mortar are inappropriate for a virtual world Despite all the excitement over virtual land, it is not hard to find scepticism from those who have watched previous efforts with virtual worlds. “MMOs [massively multiplayer online games] have certainly sold virtual property before and from that perspective they have been successful,” says Fragen. “What is less clear is if these MMOs have successfully turned these properties into profitable investments for their owners on a consistent basis.” Edward Castronova, professor of media at Indiana University and an authority on virtual economies, is equally critical. “I’ve been saying the same thing about virtual real estate for 20 years or so: I never thought it was a good model and I still think it’s not.” For Castronova, the techno-utopian excitement of metaverse acolytes belies the core question — is the content good enough to compete with distractions including Netflix, YouTube, TikTok and other games, and to encourage players to return in ever-growing numbers? Those who have made money through virtual land have been the beneficiaries of hype cycles, he says, not investors in products that offer solid value in the attention economy. Dominant market leaders are also yet to emerge. Virtual events can draw in viewers for one-off occasions, but they do not offer a barrier against new entrants. “There’s nothing stopping anybody else from building this,” says angel investor Paul Griffiths, who likens owning metaverse land to “star registries”, the unofficial lists of naming rights for stellar bodies with no real provenance. Recommended “It’s kind of the same problem you see with NFTs,” says software developer and crypto-sceptic Stephen Diehl. “Who’s to say what’s the ‘real marketplace’ when there’s 40 different chains and 30 different markets, and each one is claiming to be the source of truth?” Diehl is also critical of the artificial scarcity of metaverse projects. Griffiths says the main utility is in creating the virtual simulacra of real buildings, which offers bragging rights. “Selling something that’s a big physical 3D asset [like a virtual version of a physical house] is where I see virtual transactions being helpful,” he says. “I don’t think people will go to a virtual world to order food.” Gaynor acknowledges that the next generation of metaverses will have a “second mover advantage” and are likely to move away from the generalist approach taken by current competitors. With a few exceptions, such as blockchain game Axie Infinity — which allows players to earn cryptocurrencies that they can cash out into the physical economy— there are no “killer applications”. There are also questions about what happens to the long-term future of metaverse purchases. Game servers have been shut down once companies deem the cost of running them too high — The Matrix Online, based on the film franchise, was shut down following a notably grisly body horror sequence. “Let’s imagine you’re playing a blockchain game, and you have an NFT of 62 houses and the game goes offline — it’s true that you own the NFT, but it has no value,” says Castronova. “No court has established an obligation of a company to continue to provide electricity to servers so you can access it.” Gaynor, who says that Parcel is not tied to a single metaverse, believes the future is not necessarily “winner takes all”. “I think there’ll be a few very dominant worlds, and maybe some niche worlds, but I do see a future of interoperability where we’ll be able to go from one world to another and trade between them.” At the start of Snow Crash, protagonist Hiro Protagonist looks back a decade to the unfinished nature of The Street — “the Broadway, the Champs-Elysées of the Metaverse”, remembering that “at the time, it was just a little patchwork of light amid a vast blackness”. The current state of metaverse projects feels similar. The Australian Open is currently hosting an event in Decentraland that features a digital Melbourne park stadium with NFTs, tennis-themed mini games, but no live television streams at launch due to technical problems. (Novak Djokovic is yet to make an appearance, despite the lack of vaccine passports in the metaverse.) Recommended External criticism of metaverse projects has also been scathing. A tweet of a rave in Decentraland has drawn unfavourable comparisons to Club Penguin , an online multiplayer game that ran from 2005 to 2017. Advocates argue that this is simply the start of a transformation. “The metaverse will probably see a meaningful transition to a business phase in 2022, with a wide range of services appearing on the scene,” says Yosuke Matsuda, president of vaunted game developer Square Enix, in a letter released on New Year’s Day. But Griffiths outlines the stark bet for potential metaverse investors. A project that does well and continues to build user growth could offer considerable returns. If the project fails, the land that you’ve bought is basically worthless. “There is a tonne of weird stuff that’s going to happen and it’s not clear who’s going to win.” Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan is the FT’s banking and fintech correspondent; George Steer is an FT markets reporter Follow @FTProperty on Twitter or @ft_houseandhome on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first Letters in response to this article: While you’re at it, why not invest in my boutique? / From David Sharp, London SW15, UK Virtual real estate carries climate change price tag / From Barbara Mullarney, London W36, UK","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan George Steer","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-01-28","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/e83fe16f-fb28-4795-919e-4f1d314e6794","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fc8ea1af1-92f1-45b5-beb9-ffc4b30cd6e3.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"SpiceDAO paid $3m for a copy of Jodorowsky’s Dune","INTRO":"And, by the looks of it, little else.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"By 1974, Mexican film-maker Alejandro Jodorowsky had become a cult figure among film aficionados. His first two pictures, El Topo and The Holy Mountain, had blended surrealist, psychedelic imagery with madcap plots and arcane religious symbolism, establishing him as one of the most prominent names in underground cinema. His next job was to be his biggest yet. A French consortium had purchased the rights to Dune, Frank Herbert’s much loved science fiction novel (and recently brought to the big screen), and asked Jodorowsky to direct it. He went to town on the project. Salvador Dalí, Mick Jagger and Orson Welles were mooted as cast members, Pink Floyd were to do the soundtrack, and the final script came in at 14 hours. Unsurprisingly, no studio would stump up the cash to finance it. The project collapsed. Yet a fascination with the project’s mind-bendingly ambitious vision remained, so much so that a documentary was made about it in 2014, and a rare book on the unmade film — containing the script, concept art and other pre-production materials — has become a collector’s items among Dune-heads. So in-demand in fact, that every now and then one of the estimated 20 surfaces for sale gets purchased for big bucks. And so it was in late November, when Christies sold one of the copies for €2.66m — almost 100 times its estimate. Which brings us neatly to this announcement from Spice DAO on Sunday: https://twitter.com/TheSpiceDAO/status/1482404318347153413?s\u003d20 If you don’t know what a DAO, or decentralised anonymous organisation, is, let us explain. In effect, it’s a governance structure where each member of the organisation — a membership often granted by simply buying a cryptocurrency tied to it (in this case, named SPICE) — becomes a decision maker in the organisation’s governance. The governance rules are set in smart contracts drafted beforehand by the original organisers, but after that, every decision of the entity is decided by the tokenholders. Presented as an antidote to the centralised governance of modern tech companies, it’s like being a shareholder in a crowd-funded project, but without being able to defer any decision-making to a chief executive or management team. (And that, arguably, is the least of the model’s problems. Do read Izzy or Stephen Diehl for more.) Yet the problem with Spice DAO isn’t so much a philosophical one but a legal one. We don’t know why we have to state this, but by buying a copy of something doesn’t give you exclusive rights to monetise its content. It’s literally the bedrock of intellectual property law and therefore, large swaths of capitalism. So, have SpiceDAO resolved this? The copyrights of the book’s script and illustrations, according to BuzzFeed, are owned by Jodorowsky himself, and artists Jean Giraud and HR Giger. Both of whom died over the past decade. So without their estate’s sign-off, SpiceDAO is Spice dead in the water. Even then, Spice DAO’s first stated action — to “make the book public” — has already been rendered pointless as Jodorowsky’s Dune was made available to browse on Google Photos before the auction closed. Oops. So, in effect, the buyers of the SPICE token are, at the moment, bagholding a $3m book that last sold for $42,500 in March 2019. It’s perhaps not the maddest thing we’ve heard of in the deep, murky annals of kingdom crypto.

In October, the first US exchange traded bitcoin fund was launched. Bitcoin’s price jumped above $67,500 in November before falling back below $50,000 this month. Uneven price progression will continue. Company interest in alternative currencies is not yet consistent. Tesla declared that holding bitcoin as an alternative to cash proved its liquidity. It then sold down its holding and decided bitcoin could no longer be used to buy its electric vehicles. The future of all digital tokens still rests with regulators. The US Securities and Exchange Commission permitted a bitcoin ETF to proceed because it holds futures contracts traded on a regulated exchange rather than bitcoins directly. The world’s biggest crypto exchange, Binance, remains unregulated and unlisted. It has clashed with regulators in Singapore. China announced in September that crypto transactions were illegal. The head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, has warned that investors could get hurt without more oversight. Yet while watchdogs prevaricate, the institutions that fret that blockchain and cryptocurrencies could eliminate their expensive third-party services will continue to stake a claim in the sector. Governments will continue to promote their own, central bank-run digital currencies.

Ether is used to purchase non-fungible tokens — now a $15bn market — and is at the heart of decentralised finance. The latter’s technology does not rely on typical financial intermediaries such as banks. In 2022, the ethereum network on which ether is used will be upgraded and is expected to convert to proof of stake verification. This change requires far less energy than bitcoin’s proof of work verification. The shift should appeal to eco-conscious crypto fans, encouraging them to switch.

It’s a small company, only elevated to the Nasdaq last year. You could look at the bividend as a stunt, a canny bit of investor relations with a Twitter-friendly brand name. It’s a possibility that BTCS’s chief executive, Charles Allen, cheerfully acknowledges. He wanted people to see the value in the company and read its filings. Success! Behind the bividend is a bet that, if correct, could have much larger consequences. Allen is offering to pay investors in bitcoin in part because BTCS has 90 bitcoins sitting on its balance sheet that have value, but no productive purpose. Bitcoin, according to Allen, is a unproductive asset, “just literally sitting there”. It might appreciate. But it doesn’t generate revenue, which has historically been the purpose of a publicly listed company. BTCS was founded as a pure cryptocurrency company in what now seems like the Precambrian era in 2013. It started in ecommerce, selling products for bitcoin. It moved on to bitcoin mining, suffered through what Allen calls a “crypto winter”, then spent some time buying bitcoin and ethereum, thinking about what to do next. According to its last quarterly filing, the company now holds two kinds of cryptocurrencies, which sit on different parts of its balance sheet. Along with dollar cash and prepaid expenses, the company holds $3.2m in “digital assets/currencies”. These are the 90 bitcoins, sitting in treasury, doing . . . nothing. The company also has $8.8m in “staked digital assets/currencies”, the core of its new strategy. The staked currencies are mostly ethereum. They have a job, and generated $1.2m in revenue last year (the number is unaudited, but is consistent with the company’s audited quarterly reports). Again, these are small numbers. What matters is the distinction. The ethereum has a job. The bitcoin does not. BTCS has begun staking — placing ethereum and some other cryptocurrencies in a kind of digital escrow, vying for a chance to verify a ledger of transactions. The more coins you have staked, the higher the likelihood you’ll get to verify the ledger. The reward is a fee of more coins. The company is also running so-called validator nodes — staking pools that will bring in others’ coins from outside its balance sheet. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click The bitcoin protocol is not designed for staking. Bitcoin, by design, supposed to just sit there, hopefully becoming more valuable, transferable if necessary. This is good if you hold bitcoin and are optimistic about its future. It is bad, however, if you’re a publicly listed company, trying to figure out how to produce revenue. The bet on bitcoin in particular has always been that the more people hold it, the more useful it will become. There’s a difference, however, between “holding” and “useful”. The bividend is not, strictly speaking, a dividend — profit, paid out to shareholders. Rather, it’s a return of capital. Conveniently for shareholders, this makes the bividend tax free. It also makes it a bit like a share repurchase, a tacit confession that says here, you take this, because we don’t have any plans for it. If BTCS is right, bitcoin is headed for a strange twilight. It is not quite ready cash. Nor it is a productive asset. After BTCS made its announcement Hanno Lustig, an economist at Stanford Graduate School of Business, pointed out that the company was part of a long tradition of paying out dividends in kind. In the 17th century, he wrote, the Dutch West India Company paid out dividends in cloves. Other early modern joint stock companies used the same model. England’s Royal African Company paid out its dividend in gold coins that only over time came to be known as guineas, named for the African coast the gold came from. Guineas were a dividend first, and only became a unit of account over time. The joachimsthaler, the big silver coin that served as a model for taler and daler coins around the Baltic — and eventually what came to be known in the US as the Spanish dollar — was originally a dividend, too, paid out to Saxon joint-stock investors in a Bohemian silver mine. But this isn’t quite what BTCS is doing. All these early-modern joint stock companies paid their in-kind dividends out of revenues. The Royal African Company exported gold from Africa — the gold itself was a revenue. The West India Company exported cloves. The Saxon joint stock companies mined silver. BTCS’s revenues, however, come in the form of ethereum, or the other coins on its balance sheet that it can stake. In its actual business, it does not earn bitcoin. According to Allen, the company may in the future pay out actual dividends in ethereum. But for the time being, it is merely paying a bividend — a return of capital in the form of bitcoin, an asset that has value, but no purpose.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brendan Greeley","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-01-08","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/c4b6d38d-e6c8-491f-b70c-7b5cf8f0cea6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F76b79ca6-95da-4c91-b979-844ae042425f.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Crypto assets inspire new brand of collectivism beyond finance","INTRO":"Decentralised autonomous organisations, or DAOs, are being created for various purposes including city planning","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Near the edge of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, a group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts have launched a new experiment in city building — just don’t ask who is going to be mayor. The collective, CityDAO, has no official leader. Its members organise themselves using the chat app Discord. Every major decision must go up for a vote. Nonetheless, the group of 5,000 successfully mobilised in under four months to purchase a 40-acre plot of land in Park County, Wyoming, near the Montana state border. Members are still debating what comes next, but the DAO’s lofty goals include widening access and lowering the costs of property ownership and developing new systems for public finance. And they want to do it all using cryptocurrency software. “It’s a community experiment,” said Scott Fitsimones, the unofficial founder of the project. CityDAO is one of the most visible examples of the hundreds of so-called decentralised autonomous organisations, loose groups of cryptocurrency users who band together for a central purpose, whether it be governing an open-source software program or buying real-world assets. The groups have recently soared in popularity among cryptocurrency die-hards, who envision a future where software code plays a larger role in governing large organisations. DAOs can have more “accessibility and transparency” than corporations, said Linda Xie, co-founder of the cryptocurrency investment group Scalar Capital. “No one is controlling it,” Xie said. “It’s like a collective decision making.” But even some of cryptocurrency’s most ardent supporters have struggled to define DAOs, and the projects face many legal hurdles in the US, where companies and other organisations must adhere to strictly defined regulations. “It’s not a binary thing, like you’re a DAO or you’re not,” Xie said. “People use the term very freely.” Advocates for DAOs said they are more democratic than corporations, allowing practically anybody in the world to participate in decision making. They also argue that blockchains make it easier to create permanent, unalterable records and govern the large, loosely arranged groups. DAOs take on many forms, but they usually organise on digital ledgers such as the ethereum blockchain that allow developers to write software programs, or “smart contracts”, that automatically execute transactions when the right conditions are met. Many issue cryptocurrency tokens that give owners the ability to participate in governance. “Web3 is starting to turn users and contributors into investors, and vice versa,” said Ian Lee, co-founder of the DAO software company Syndicate, referring to a term for token-based cryptocurrency apps that aim to create a new version of the internet. In practical terms, most DAOs look like chat rooms with a shared bank account. Most importantly, according to members, DAOs should not be controlled by any single person, though in practice some look more like centralised corporations with venture capital backers and other insiders owning significant chunks of tokens. DAOs are tiny compared with the rest of the corporate world, with a total of $12.1bn in cryptocurrency assets in reserves and about 1.6m members in groups tracked by the data service DeepDAO. However, they have already captured the attention of Wall Street. Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager, has invested in Syndicate, which wants to make it easier for people to create investment DAOs. In November, a group known as ConstitutionDAO raised $47m to buy an original copy of the US Constitution, only to be outbid at auction by Ken Griffin, founder of the hedge fund Citadel. Some DAO members have complained that they can be unwieldy to manage compared with centralised organisations. Like other new cryptocurrency experiments, they face legal jeopardy. The first attempt at a DAO, called “The DAO”, raised more than $150m in 2016 as an experiment in community-directed investing before an attacker exploited holes in the code to steal one-third of the funds. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click In response, members of the ethereum community voted to effectively alter code backing the hacker’s funds, creating a new version of the blockchain and returning the funds back to the DAO. Critics said the decision undermined the supposed permanence of the software network. The state of Wyoming, which first developed the limited liability company structure, passed legislation this year that allowed the formation of “DAO LLCs” managed by smart contracts. More than 110 entities have registered as DAO LLCs in Wyoming since the state passed legislation, including four that switched from normal LLCs, a representative for the state treasury said in an email. Critics of the legislation have argued its language does not clearly define how DAO LLCs should be managed. Legislators are considering amendments to the original law. Cryptocurrency lawyers said for-profit DAOs had largely registered as Delaware LLCs, one of the most popular corporate structures in the US. “A lot of the things that people are doing are probably legal,” said Chris Rothfuss, a Democrat who co-chairs a Wyoming state Senate committee on blockchain technology. “Probably legal is not a comfortable phrase.” Rothfuss said he hoped the law would bring more financial technology entrepreneurs to Wyoming, helping diversify the state’s economy away from mineral extraction. Fitsimones said he had become inspired to start CityDAO because of Wyoming’s legislation and that he hoped it would make it easier for larger groups to collectively own and manage land using the blockchain. “There’s something really cool about land because land feels like such a primitive piece of the puzzle,” Fitsimones said. “If you can put land on-chain, what is the next step?” Members of CityDAO must purchase one of 10,000 non-fungible tokens to take part in discussions. They can sell their NFT at any time if they want to quit. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the ethereum blockchain, and Brian Armstrong, chief executive of the cryptocurrency company Coinbase, have both purchased the “citizen NFTs”, which do not give the holders a stake in the physical land or the rights to any income. Fitsimones acknowledged the project still faced hurdles, and its core team members have said most of their time is spent on legal issues. “The worst-case scenario for this law is in a court some judge is like, ‘I’m not reading the smart contract code. This is a bunch of baloney’,’’ Fitsimones said. “And the best-case scenario is this law becomes this fundamental link between digital assets, crypto and the physical world.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Miles Kruppa Hannah Murphy","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-12-27","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/b8d78b6b-a7fa-4525-8c68-99c468aac241","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F142cd836-19b2-4104-b890-466311cda425.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bankers quietly mould crypto innovations for their own use","INTRO":"Conservative corporate treasurers are being offered blockchain solutions to legacy problems","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When Elon Musk revealed this year that he had invested $1.5bn of Tesla’s corporate cash in bitcoin, many grown-up financiers winced. No wonder. The world of corporate treasury management is supposed to be a deadly dull place, where safety rules. No one expects treasurers to dance with the crypto kids. But these days something striking is quietly happening on Wall Street: some grown-up bankers are starting to offer those conservative treasurers some crypto-focused solutions too. Take JPMorgan. This year, Umar Farooq, head of the bank’s Onyx project (which has created a JPMorgan crypto coin and ethereum-style blockchain platform), revealed that it is developing so-called “programmable money” for corporate clients. This aims to enable treasurers to cut deals with partners via a shared computing ledger, on autopilot, with an innovation known as “smart contracts”. It sounds futuristic. But the bank is poised to announce that one of the world’s biggest industrial groups is embracing this crypto innovation. No, this is not the same as Musk’s adventures with bitcoin: instead of using crypto as a store of value (ie investment), the JPMorgan initiative uses it as a payment method to transfer values linked to other assets — including fuddy-duddy fiat currency. However, this second usage of crypto will almost certainly end up being far more important than bitcoin for the business world, not least because it comes as other banks are racing to develop crypto-innovations, too. To cite another example: this week HSBC and Wells Fargo revealed plans to use blockchain to settle foreign exchange transactions between financial institutions. The impetus behind these experiments is a recognition among financiers that treasurers face at least three big headaches. The first is that companies need armies of staff to execute (and check) treasury transactions, which is costly and carries the risk of human error as transactions rise. The second is that settling treasury transactions typically takes a few hours (if not days), particularly across borders. That creates a third headache: to offset these execution lags, companies and banks need large buffers of cash to cover delays and risks. In theory, these three issues could be resolved (or reduced) if legacy financial systems became better automated, offering faster execution and settlement. This is now happening to some degree, as the competitive threat of crypto (belatedly) forces traditional systems to become more cutting-edge. The saga around the Swift messaging system is a case in point. However, in practice it is often very difficult to upgrade legacy systems and a wider business dash into digital is leaving companies drowning in cross-border micropayments. So the “programmable money” project tries to offer a workaround, by, say, enabling a micropayment to be instantly made and settled at moment of “sale” and netted against other transactions in a corporate account, or so JPMorgan hopes. Will it work? It remains to be seen. JPMorgan has already had some success in using blockchain and its own crypto coin for bank-to-bank transactions; with over 400 banks using these. Entities such as DBS, Standard Chartered and HSBC have digital initiatives too. But some non-financial corporate experiments have been less successful. Back in 2018, for example, BP and other energy companies unveiled a blockchain-based system to trade oil. Yet earlier this year Karen Scarbrough, a senior technology associate at BP, admitted that the project “really hasn’t panned out like we thought”, and had been rolled back. The reason, it seems, was that it is cumbersome to update a shared computer ledger with current blockchain technology — so “blockchain is not an excellent tool for tracking and tracing”, yet.

But we simply do not know yet whether it can scale. Nor do we know how regulators will respond; the devil will be in the digital detail. Nevertheless, there are already three important lessons that investors should note. First, while enthusiasts used to assume that crypto innovations would disintermediate legacy institutions, the establishment is fighting back. Second, while crypto enthusiasts also used to extol the idea of “public”, permissionless blockchains (ie ones that anyone can join, without asking), the real action for companies is with “private” chains (ie those where access is controlled). This focus on private chains may be temporary. The internet started life in the form of private “intranets”, which were subsequently linked to create the public net. But the increase in private — not public — chains raises a third key point: the reason why big companies and banks might want to use blockchain for payments is not to be anonymous, but for reasons of flexibility, automation and speed. Crypto is no longer (just) a tool to create trust where none exists or subvert authority. This subtle twist might horrify libertarians. But it is also a sign that the crypto world is growing up. All eyes are now on how regulators and corporate treasurers respond to the idea of “programmable money”; even if it is not as readily tweetable as Musk. gillian.tett@ft.com Letter in response to this column: What blockchain owes to Kubrick’s masterpiece/ From Neil McNaughton, Editor, Oil IT Journal, Sèvres, France ","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Gillian Tett","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-12-16","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/9600d12d-f9ae-4021-8dab-8807b4dfe3eb","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7cc58d47-db00-441e-807e-43217acc03d4.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Melania Trump is flogging fungible NFTs","INTRO":"BUY NOW WHILE LIMITLESS SUPPLY LASTS.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"‘Tis truly the season of giving.

From Monday, they will use blockchain technology to reconcile and pay out on deals in dollars, sterling, euro and Canadian dollars between the two banks, using HSBC’s FX Everywhere platform. The agreement means they will bypass CLS, the nearly two-decades-old utility that central banks urge market participants to use to neutralise the risk of certain trade failures. The move is the latest example of blockchain technology seeping into the $6.6tn-a-day foreign currency market, and resetting relationships between the big investment banks and central banks. Earlier this month, the central banks of Switzerland and France successfully tested the first cross-border payment on the blockchain as part of a series of projects around central bank digital currencies. Mark Jones, co-head of macro at Wells Fargo, said it would be the first time blockchain technology had been used to settle live cross-border payments. “We believe this will be the first step of many utilising transformative technology across our industry in the years ahead,” he added. He acknowledged the move would cut out CLS, the US Federal Reserve-regulated entity that settles trillions of dollars worth of global currency deals and ensures both sides of a trade are paid simultaneously. The two banks also said they hoped to expand the system to other banks and emerging market currencies that CLS does not settle. Mark Williamson, global head of FX partnerships at HSBC, said the banks were also talking to financial market infrastructure operators about their potential involvement. He declined to name the parties but said a decision was likely to come next year. The agreement is an extension of HSBC’s plans to use blockchain technology more widely in making sure that currency trades are correctly logged and settled after it launched its FX Everywhere platform in early 2019. By using the technology, both HSBC and Wells will have real-time transparency of the settlement status of foreign exchange trades in the four initial currencies. Recommended Blockchain’s growing role in post-trade processes highlights the various ways in which banks approach cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. Christine Moy, global head of Liink Onyx, the blockchain division at JPMorgan, said on a panel at the FT’s Global Banking Summit that while the bank does not trade bitcoin, it has been active in researching and finding applications for blockchain technology for six years. Moy noted that JPMorgan completed a blockchain-based intraday repo transaction in December and it was the first bank three years ago to provide bank accounts to regulated crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Gemini. “When people think of a bank in crypto the first thing they think is: are you doing custody, are you trading spot? We don’t . . . but we’ve been supporting the crypto ecosystem in [different] ways,” she said. Wells will pay HSBC a small fee for using the platform, but the costs are likely to be lower than using CLS.

There was little they could do. Maduro had tightened his grip on the country’s purse strings; tough US sanctions had exacerbated an already dreadful economic crisis; and neither the government nor the browbeaten opposition could spare any cash for doctors and nurses. But the president’s opponents had one potential weapon: access to Venezuelan state funds frozen in US bank accounts. Ever since Venezuelan congressman Juan Guaidó launched his audacious attempt to unseat Maduro in 2019, the US government has recognised him as the legitimate president of Venezuela. Washington argues, therefore, that Venezuelan state money seized by US authorities belongs to Guaidó’s administration — not Maduro’s de facto government. Recommended Guaidó’s people figured that, if they could persuade the US Treasury to release the money, they could pay health workers a bonus. They asked US law firm Sullivan \u0026 Cromwell to help. Sergio Galvis, head of its Latin America practice, led a 14-strong team including experts in “a huge range of disciplines — banking, cyber security, sanctions, payment systems and foreign exchange controls”, he says. Sullivan \u0026 Cromwell’s first job was to convince the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac) to release the funds. “It was very, very important to Ofac and the US government that the money was really going to the intended recipients,” Galvis says. The next hurdle was to find a way to send the money to Venezuela securely, without it being intercepted by the Maduro regime or the many creditors suing for compensation for broken promises and assets expropriated during the past 22 years of revolutionary socialist rule. Post-Trump Supreme Court faces stern tests of impartiality People-focused leadership Radical change from joint efforts Creative practitioners crack tough legal problems The brainstorm that triggered a blockchain breakthrough The lawyers battling to right historic wrongs That meant sending money through the Venezuelan banking system was not an option. So Sullivan \u0026 Cromwell joined forces with tech businesses, including digital currency company Circle, to funnel the money to Venezuela via other means. “We were able to put in place an aid disbursement pipeline that leveraged the power of USDC — dollar-backed, open, internet-based digital currency payments — to bypass the controls imposed by Maduro over the domestic financial system,” Circle says on its website. The money was deposited in digital wallets created by online payment platform Airtm. Doctors and nurses had to register on the Airtm website to receive payment. This caused some problems. Guaidó’s team says the Maduro regime blocked Airtm, forcing recipients to use VPNs (virtual private networks) to access payments. Canadian VPN company TunnelBear provided free access to its services for a while, arguing that “healthcare workers deserve the benefits of an open and uncensored internet”. Once the recipients had the money in their digital wallets, they could spend it online, transfer it to local bank accounts in the Venezuelan currency, bolívars, or send it to other Airtm users. In all, Guaidó’s team says the scheme channelled $18m to more than 60,000 doctors and nurses. The payments were set up as $300 per person in three monthly instalments of $100. In a country where the official minimum wage is less than $3 a month, it was appreciated at a time when healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, had to survive on little. Did the system work? Generally, yes, says Mauro Zambrano, a union representative for Venezuelan health workers. “There were some problems, and some workers only received two of their three payments, but a lot of people got the money and it made a difference,” he says. There were some problems . . . but a lot of people got the money and it made a difference Guaidó, Ofac and Sullivan \u0026 Cromwell might regard the money transfers as a noble enterprise but, to Maduro, they were theft. From his point of view, the US had stolen Venezuelan state funds and handed them to a puppet administration led by the unelected Guaidó, which in turn disbursed them to selected health workers without proper oversight. For Galvis, though, the legal case is watertight. He says his firm’s client “was a government recognised by the US, operating in compliance with US law, which is pretty clear on this”. Once the US secretary of state “has designated ‘X’ as the recognised government of a country, that is binding on all arms of the US government”, he adds. Galvis explains the essence of what Sullivan \u0026 Cromwell was trying to achieve: “We had to come up with a system that complied with US sanctions rules and could lawfully get money into the electronic wallet of a nurse sitting in Caracas so she could go to the supermarket and buy milk.” Rescue, restructuring and recovery; dispute resolution.

Milbank acted as legal counsel to lead underwriters in these transactions. The airlines used their frequent flyer loyalty programmes as investment assets, turning them into separate subsidiaries. The financings last year — $6.8bn for United, $10bn for American, and $9bn for Delta — were among the largest in the industry’s history. Their structure provides a model for other loyalty programme financings for airlines globally. Akin Gump Strauss Hauer \u0026 Feld In collaboration with the National Independent Venue Association (NIVA), which represents more than 3,000 music clubs and performing arts venues in the US, the firm ran the Save Our Stages campaign, which lobbied the federal government for Covid relief funding for venues. The firm secured bipartisan support by focusing on economic arguments. The Save Our Stages Act was signed into law in December 2020, securing $16bn in emergency funds — equivalent to nearly half of the venues’ revenues in 2019. Bracewell The firm secured an order from the federal energy regulator to secure $800,000 owed by Gulfport Energy Corporation to its client, the Rockies Express Pipeline, before Gulfport filed for bankruptcy. This order stated that Gulfport was not allowed to cancel contracts unless it was in the public interest. The firm had to secure this declaration before the bankruptcy was filed because automatic stay, which halts certain actions against the distressed party in a bankruptcy, would have prevented the regulator from acting. Hogan Lovells The firm advised the republic of Ecuador on the restructuring of $17.4bn of the country’s external debt. The firm used a collective action clause, which is uncommon for a restructuring of this size. To persuade a large and disparate group of international investors to accept the terms, the clause allows a supermajority of bondholders to enforce a legally binding restructuring on all holders, including those that vote against it. The firm has since been approached by the city of Córdoba in Argentina to restructure $150m of debt using the same approach. Kirkland \u0026 Ellis The firm represented US department store chain JCPenney in its bankruptcy proceedings. The company was split into an operating company, which manages the business, and a property company — a holding company that owns the property. Under this arrangement, the operating company leases the real estate from the property company. The firm brought in an external consortium led by real estate investors Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners, which owns malls that house JCPenney stores, to buy the operating company. The restructuring preserved 60,000 jobs at JCPenney, two-thirds of the workforce. Commended: Josh Sussburg Milbank Representing the first lien holders in the JCPenney bankruptcy proceedings, the firm worked with creditors to identify attractive assets for the department store chain’s property company. The retailer had acquired hundreds of properties over many decades, held in different legal entities, which the law firm organised into the property company — a single legal entity leased to Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners, owners of the operating company. The opco-propco structure could be replicated for other distressed retailers. Morrison \u0026 Foerster The firm structured the California Rebuilding Fund to help small businesses in the US state weather the Covid-19 pandemic. The fund acquires capital from private, philanthropic and public sector resources, and provides loans to businesses. It does this through community development financial institutions, such as development banks, which underwrite the loans. The fund has raised more than $100m to date and has received applications from more than 3,000 businesses. Sullivan \u0026 Cromwell The Venezuelan opposition, led by Juan Guaidó, wanted to use assets frozen under international sanctions against the Nicolás Maduro government to provide financial support for the country’s healthcare workers during the Covid-19 crisis. The law firm designed the legal framework and secured licences, allowing frozen assets held by the US to be released. Funds were transferred to healthcare workers’ mobile phones using blockchain platform Circle, to be spent as cash via Airtm, a digital payments platform. Weil, Gotshal \u0026 Manges AMC, one of the world’s largest cinema chains, capitalised on the boom in retail share trading in June by relying on at-the-market equity offerings to avoid an in-court restructuring. At-the-market offerings are a way for companies to raise money by incrementally selling newly issued shares, or shares they already own, on the secondary trading market — normally a risky way for a company facing bankruptcy to raise capital. The firm worked with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to gain regulatory approval for the plan and negotiated significant concessions from the cinema chain’s landlords. White \u0026 Case The firm advised car rental company Hertz on its restructuring of $19bn of debt. Securitisation was the principal source of exit financing from the bankruptcy — a first for a transaction of this size. Securitisation and an exit from bankruptcy are traditionally difficult to execute simultaneously. The structure helped Hertz avoid funding costs, and equity investors and debt holders have both been paid in full. The company has since relisted on Nasdaq. WINNER: Cravath, Swaine \u0026 Moore In 2014, the US Federal Trade Commission brought an antitrust case against technology company Qualcomm for requiring buyers of its chips to pay licensing fees, as well. In August 2020, the law firm secured a final decision by a US appeals court that Qualcomm was not infringing antitrust law — persuading the court that, while customers can license Qualcomm software without buying its chips, it was fair for those that did buy chips to also license the software. This precedent gives clarity on competition law and standard essential patents, showing that cases fall under the jurisdiction of patent or contract law, rather than antitrust regulation. Arnold \u0026 Porter Representing medical technology company Hologic in the US Supreme Court in April, the firm established legal confirmation on the assignor estoppel doctrine, which limits the ability of a company that has sold a patent to make changes to what that patent includes. In another case, the firm secured state and federal court victories for biopharmaceutical companies Sanofi and Regeneron against biotech group Amgen, arguing for a narrow definition of what a therapeutic antibody patent covers. Hausfeld The firm represented the plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS), a federation of some 35 health insurance companies in the US. The companies were alleged to have entered into non-compete agreements with one another. The case spanned eight years and required complex economic modelling to show the impact of BCBS’s business practices. Last year, the court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement agreement of $2.67bn. Significantly, the agreement demands changes to BCBS’s business practices, increasing competition in the US health insurance market. Latham \u0026 Watkins The firm secured victory for medical practice management software company NextGen Healthcare after an eight-year litigation. A former board member and major shareholder had claimed losses of $400m because alleged misrepresentations from the company — which had made positive statements about its financial prospects — led him to retain his shares rather than selling them at a higher price. This is the first claim of its kind tried before a jury in the US in 86 years, and a first in California, creating an important precedent. White \u0026 Case The firm represented health insurance provider Anthem in its litigation with fellow insurer Cigna over an unsuccessful merger. The lawyers filed a temporary restraining order to keep the merger in place within 24 hours of Cigna’s filing for a termination of the deal. This protected Anthem from immediately having to pay a $1.85bn reverse termination fee. It also bought time to find evidence that Cigna had deliberately derailed the deal, meaning Anthem did not have to pay the fee at all.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Gideon Long","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-12-10","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/fd57521c-a2e9-415b-9c4f-4f74b4587f9e","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7703cc66-38c4-466a-a081-8d3767f26352.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain-powered breakthrough on mutual fund","INTRO":"A new, tech-based breed of fund promises potential big savings for clients","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Dechert partner Timothy Spangler well remembers standing next to a whiteboard on Franklin Templeton Investments’ San Mateo campus in California, about three years ago. He was with some of the asset manager’s senior executives. The hype about blockchain technology — which instantly creates secure digital records on a distributed database — was close to fever pitch. Experts across the world were speculating on its potential to disintermediate old financial services systems where simple jobs can take days. Franklin Templeton wanted in, and executives had gathered to brainstorm ways to exploit blockchain. But, unlike many other companies hunting for a blockchain application, Franklin Templeton — which has $1.5tn of assets under management — happened on an idea it would actually execute. It was also one it predicted could generate big savings for clients. “We came up with the idea of a mutual fund whose shares were built on a blockchain,” recalls Spangler. It resulted in Franklin Templeton’s OnChain US Government Money Fund — the first mutual fund to use blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership. We made it very clear that this was not about trying to sneak bitcoin and crypto into a money-market fund Mutual funds, which pool investments across low-risk assets such as government bonds, are owned by almost one in two households in the US. Traditionally, they are administered through brokerages, but redeeming holdings is not instant. Spangler says a mutual fund powered by blockchain can trade 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, so “you don’t have to wait 24 hours to have a human being shuffle the paper around”. It will also result in a more secure system and a “highly significant decrease in fees”, he says, though he admits the level of those savings has “yet to be determined”. The blockchain technology that powers transactions for the OnChain fund is the only feature that makes it different from the many similar funds Franklin Templeton has been creating and selling for decades. Still, securing approval took months of extra negotiating with regulators. “We made it very clear that this was not about trying to sneak [cryptocurrency] bitcoin and crypto into a money-market fund,” explains Spangler. He says the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator that licenses such products, saw “clear blue water between blockchain technology in the abstract and highly volatile cryptocurrency being put into retail [investment]” products. ‘The pay rates for lawyers are unsustainable’ Creative practitioners crack tough legal problems Crypto collaboration brings relief for Venezuelan health workers Smoothing the transition for markets to life after Libor Lawyers focus on ediscovery tech to meet compliance pressures Franklin Templeton stressed that the only thing changing was how records were kept and how transactions were done. The move had already been made from paper ledgers to spreadsheets stored in the cloud. Using blockchain technology was a “minimal change”, it argued. “If you see it as just the next tech upgrade, it’s not nearly as frightening in that sense,” Spangler adds. The SEC was persuaded — after an approvals process that took significantly longer than the four to six months that is typical for new products. The OnChain fund launched in pilot form in April, with $1.4m of seed money and investment from Franklin Templeton’s US employees. Its gross expense ratio is 3.5 per cent, which is far higher than the 0.52 per cent on the manager’s $3.3bn US Government Money Fund, partly reflecting the blockchain fund’s pilot status. The fund is also yet to benefit from the cost savings of blockchain because it is maintaining traditional records in parallel. If you see it as just the next tech upgrade, it’s not nearly as frightening Spangler thinks the market does not realise how disruptive OnChain could be, and sees potential for it to pave the way for other funds, from Franklin Templeton and rival asset managers. “A number of my clients believe that . . . in a small number of years the near entirety of transactions in financial assets will either occur on the blockchain or be blockchain facilitated,” he says. Spangler adds that Franklin Templeton’s work with the SEC means approving new blockchain-based funds will take only about 10 per cent longer than for traditional funds. Recommended Asset managers could also look at putting existing funds — or part of them — on a blockchain infrastructure. In one approach, an asset manager could carve out units of an existing fund, put them in a digital depository and create the digital equivalent of a depository receipt for ownership. Those receipts could then trade on the blockchain. “I don’t think any of this is flying cars,” Spangler says. “Every year from now is going to be marked by a step change in the permeation of blockchain in financial services.” He is not worried that consumers might find the idea of blockchain-based funds too radical. “We buy cars without having any idea how the engine runs,” he says. “No one is being forced to buy blockchain based products. It’s an opt-in process.” Researched, compiled and ranked by RSGI. ‘Winner’ indicates the organisation won an FT Innovative Lawyers 2021 award WINNER: Sullivan \u0026 Cromwell Luxury US retailer Tiffany \u0026 Co hired the firm to advise on its acquisition by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury group. After the deal was initially agreed in 2019, the lawyers perceived that LVMH might be trying to delay closing, to negotiate a better price. The lawyers spent several months preparing for litigation. When LVMH claimed in September 2020 that the French government had instructed that the deal be put off until the new year, the law firm was able to respond by filing a complaint with the court in Delaware. The lawyers’ preparedness helped Tiffany close the deal for $131.50 per share, which was down from the originally agreed price of $135 but substantially higher than LVMH’s proposed $120. Kirkland \u0026 Ellis In June 2020, the firm represented food-delivery service Grubhub in its acquisition by rival Just Eat Takeaway.com. To manage the business uncertainty at the time, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, the deal terms included a tiered approach to risk allocation, in which Grubhub was able to make some business decisions without approval, whereas others required consent from Just Eat. The approach has since been used by the firm as a template for other deals. The $7.3bn transaction closed in June and created one of the largest food-delivery services globally. Morrison \u0026 Foerster The firm advises leading tech companies that are entering uncharted territory in legal risk. Bringing together a multidisciplinary team of experts in intellectual property, corporate law, data privacy, regulatory and competition law, the firm has advised clients on several significant transactions. These include cloud software company Salesforce’s $27bn acquisition of workplace communications app Slack, and SoftBank’s sale of chip-design business Arm to US software company Nvidia. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton \u0026 Garrison The firm represented PRA Health Sciences — a US-based organisation to which life sciences companies outsource research — when it was acquired by Irish competitor ICON. The lawyers secured terms that ensured ICON could not claim “material adverse effects” of the Covid-19 pandemic on PRA’s business as a reason to not complete the deal. This type of company is a relatively new phenomenon and the acquisition presented novel antitrust questions on top of the complexities of a cross-border transaction. Ropes \u0026 Gray Led by partner Hannah England, the firm advises on collaboration deals between leading pharmaceutical companies and smaller biotechnology businesses. Unlike acquisitions, in which a Big Pharma company might bring a biotech business’s research in-house, these joint ventures are designed to facilitate continuing collaborations that enable more innovation. This way, the lawyers can think less adversarially and adopt a longer-term view. The firm worked on seven of the 15 biggest deals of this kind in 2020, including a $3bn agreement between biotech company Shape Therapeutics and pharmaceutical group Roche on a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.

The metaverse might look like a cutting-edge concept, with people creating digital versions of themselves to interact with other avatars in a virtual world, but this is a nearly 20-year-old idea, only slightly updated. The origins of digital assets — such as bitcoin and ether, non-fungible tokens, smart contracts and the thousands of “shitcoins” out there — can be traced back to video games where avatars played and sometimes worked, acting out fantasy lives imagined by their human creators. It may seem unlikely today, when cryptocurrency markets are worth more than $2tn, that their ancestry lies in World of Warcraft and Second Life, the once-popular virtual-reality games. In the early 2000s, former child actor Brock Pierce, a US presidential candidate in 2020, realised that gamers were happy to buy tokens to reach the next level instead of completing tasks to earn them. “Just because something is not tangible, it doesn’t mean it’s worthless,” Pierce says, recounting how he employed hundreds of people in China and South Korea to play video games and earn the in-game tokens, which he then sold to lazier customers in the west. Together with William Quigley, now chief executive of the Worldwide Asset eXchange, the largest non-fungible token (NFT) platform, they created a market place for in-game tokens that is now worth $200bn. In the process, they laid the foundations for the cryptocurrency industry. Recommended “After World of Warcraft gold, the intellectual leap required to recognise the value of bitcoin was very small,” Pierce adds. Pierce was an early adopter of bitcoin, after an unknown author using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper in October 2008 outlining proposals for a new technology called blockchain, which would rely on the agreement of users to operate, rather than work as a centralised entity. It would be the basis for a digital currency called bitcoin, which can be “mined” by deploying computers to solve puzzles. Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21m units. Nakamoto then mined the first bitcoin in January 2009, marking the date the blockchain network and digital coin went live. In May 2010, a man in Florida paid 10,000 bitcoin (the equivalent of more than $600m at today’s prices) for two pizzas, the first purchase with the digital coins. To say this made a splash would be an exaggeration. Interest rates had plummeted in the wake of the global financial crisis and central banks had launched massive bond-buying programmes to shore up their economies. But, against this shaky macroeconomic backdrop, interest in bitcoin was starting to pick up. First came libertarians and computer geeks, followed by currency traders and the wider financial trading community, some of whom were intrigued by the fact that the technology made it impossible to change or erase past transactions. Others, such as billionaire investor Michael Novogratz, were attracted to bitcoin because of its scarcity, with the 21m unit cap. By 2011, bitcoin had become sufficiently popular for trading platforms to gain traction. These early exchanges — for example, Mt.Gox — were based in Asia, catering to retail investors in the region who had developed an appetite for the asset from their gaming background. They allowed early adopters to mine their own coins as well as trade them. The launch of trading platforms triggered the first bubble in bitcoin’s price, when the exchange rate ballooned to $32 before collapsing to around $2 in 2011. The shortlived run in the price put bitcoin on the map, according to Max Boonen, the founder of B2C2, one of the largest trading companies in crypto today. He notes that the coin has been through a series of bubbles, with each top higher than the previous one. Recommended “The big names we know as ‘whales’ [owners of large holdings] today got into bitcoin just before the 2013 bubble,” Boonen says. He notes that, at the time, Greece’s debt crisis and subsequent bailout spurred many wealthy investors to buy digital coins as a hedge of last resort. “It was the first time that bitcoin was influenced by macroeconomic events, so it was quite significant.” But the wider world was still showing little interest, largely ignoring the launch of tether, the first stablecoin, which was created to link together the world of digital currencies and fiat money. It was also the time of the first ever initial coin offering, from Mastercoin. The first filing to launch a bitcoin exchange traded fund — from the Winklevoss brothers — went almost unnoticed in 2013. And the arrival in 2015 of the Ethereum blockchain and ether, its native currency, the second cryptocurrency to be created, also failed to make waves in mainstream finance, despite its key role in crypto markets today. Ethereum’s ability to carry data in its code was an important innovation and forms the basis for decentralised finance markets, where algorithms carry out transactions as well as settlement and other functions. This market is worth $236bn and, to many, it represents the cutting edge of finance. Bitcoin’s profile then soared in 2017, when small-time investors around the world suddenly took an interest as the price moved above $20,000. Initial coin offerings also became popular. The following year marked the biggest crash so far, heralding the so-called crypto winter, in which bitcoin was written off by many as a gimmick with no future. An influx of hedge funds and family offices into bitcoin made it the digital equivalent of gold for some The crypto mood turned more positive in March last year, when the pandemic hit and triggered an influx of hedge funds and family offices into bitcoin, drawn by its limited supply. This shifted the narrative from bitcoin being an unsuccessful currency to it becoming the digital equivalent of gold for some. Billionaire hedge fund managers then added weight to the rally in the bitcoin price, drawing in other institutional investors, as well as banks and Tesla electric-car tycoon Elon Musk. In the past 18 months, cryptocurrency markets have exploded in popularity and new assets such as NFTs are thriving. The hype has given rise to thousands of alternative coins, such as dogecoin, some of which have questionable value propositions. On the other hand, blockchains such as Cardano, Solana and Polkadot have also emerged, with the aim of making the technology more efficient. Bitcoin has had a bumpy ride and remains exceptionally volatile. But the overall direction has been up: from around $0.08 in 2010, bitcoin hit a high of just below $67,000 in October this year. Not bad for a 13-year-old.

Owners of crypto assets must also be as vigilant about scams and hacks that target them personally as they would be with traditional money. Best protection methods depend on how a user stores assets, and with which institutions, as both security and reliability differ widely in this burgeoning field. Over the past 10 years, there have been 126 big breaches, totalling $3.1bn, of crypto “wallets” (see below) and exchanges, according to data compiled by Crypto Head, an industry intelligence site. The average breach has cost about $25m. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, remains the most targeted digital asset. Digital asset holders need their unique “private key”, a long password that serves a similar purpose to a bank-card PIN to unlock access to their crypto. It is vital not to lose or forget this private key. Decentralised digital assets are not guaranteed by banks and will not have a password reset hotline, meaning it is almost impossible to recover digital keys once lost. According to Chainalysis, a blockchain data provider, more than $100bn in bitcoin may have been lost in this way. Recommended The keys — and therefore crypto — can be kept in online or mobile wallets, known as hot wallets. This makes it easier to access funds swiftly — say, for traders who want to connect quickly to exchanges, brokers or other services. Indeed, many cryptocurrency exchanges offer online digital wallet services that link seamlessly to their trading systems. This is, however, the least secure method of holding crypto, leaving digital assets more vulnerable to hackers. In 2014, Mt.Gox, then the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, filed for bankruptcy after losing more than $450m, largely in bitcoin, when hackers allegedly stole its hot wallet private keys. Today, some large exchanges, such as Coinbase, have added protection for investors in the form of crypto insurance. If an individual’s password is compromised, they will lose their funds forever. But if, for example, the company itself is hacked or breached, the insurance will cover the losses for the user. Yes. The most popular alternative is what is known as cold storage — a device that is not connected to the internet. Hackers would typically need access to that device, as well as any associated passwords or codes, to steal crypto assets. More than $100bn in bitcoin may be lost because of users losing or forgetting private keys Cold storage options to control digital assets that do not involve intermediaries include physical USB keys, specific offline computers or sophisticated hardware wallets — small USB-like devices that are designed to be impenetrable by hackers and can cost several hundred dollars. Cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly the largest ones, increasingly offer cold storage custody options. Other specialist third-party services go to even greater lengths to protect customers’ crypto assets by, for example, holding private keys in vaults with human guards. In southern England, Vo1t, which was bought last year by crypto trading company Genesis, has an underground bunker patrolled by ex-military personnel, according to Forbes. The servers are rigged to delete digital assets stored on them if intruders trigger any hidden trip switches (Vo1t has back-up servers in other countries). Other services offering military-grade protection, such as Prosegur Crypto, use biometrics, including facial recognition and thumb prints, for clients to access their digital assets. On top of attacks on digital asset exchanges and custodians, hackers have been able to exploit the nascent code of new crypto initiatives in the growing field of decentralised finance (DeFi). About $1.1bn in attacks have occurred in this area in the past 10 years, according to Crypto Head. Recommended One such digital heist this year targeted Poly Network, a decentralised trading network that developed a computer protocol allowing users to transfer tokens tied to one blockchain to a different network. Hackers stole about $600m worth of cryptocurrencies, one of the largest ever such thefts, through a flaw in the protocol itself. Finally, crypto frauds remain the biggest form of crime by which digital asset holders lose funds. Losses stand at nearly $15bn over the past decade, according to Crypto Head, or $364m on average per fraud. The largest crypto fraud to date was the $4bn OneCoin Ponzi scheme, which had billed itself as a new cryptocurrency. Ruja Ignatova, its Bulgarian founder, has been on the run from law enforcement agencies since 2017, though she was charged in absentia in 2019 for securities fraud. Last year, the PlusToken Ponzi scheme defrauded millions of investors of some $2bn in total, according to Chainalysis. Becoming a victim of a fraudulent project is always possible where scammers are highly convincing and sophisticated. But investors are advised always to carry out due diligence and explore the “white paper” and other documentation about any digital asset initiative.

Many have promoted a strategy of holding on for future profits — “hodling”, in the vocabulary of cryptocurrency advocates. One anonymous bitcoin account that began purchasing the tokens in March 2011 — and has never sold any — sits on a fortune of $4.8bn, according to the cryptocurrency analytics website BitInfoCharts. A recent paper from the US National Bureau of Economic Research estimated that the top 1,000 Bitcoin investors control about 3m bitcoin, or roughly one-seventh of the cryptocurrency’s total potential supply. Only a small handful of those holders have revealed their identities. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twin brothers best known for losing a legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg over the social network idea behind Facebook, purchased a reported 120,000 bitcoin in 2012, a haul that would be worth $7.2bn as of mid-November. Recommended In a 2014 auction, venture capitalist Tim Draper (pictured above, left) beat other bidders to buy 29,655 bitcoin that US Marshals had seized from the dark web emporium Silk Road. Those tokens would be worth $1.8bn at today’s prices. Draper declined to say at the time how much he had paid in the auction, but the Marshals put the lot’s value at about $18m. Michael Saylor, chief executive of MicroStrategy, a software company, said last year he had over time bought 17,732 bitcoin at an average price of less than $10,000; that holding would be worth $1.1bn at current prices. Founders of newer blockchains such as Ethereum have also reaped large fortunes. Vitalik Buterin (pictured above, bottom right), its creator, received a reported 553,000 ether from an initial endowment set up by the co-founders, a holding that would be worth $2.3bn at today’s prices. The teams behind several cryptocurrency projects that aim to rival Ethereum adopted a similar approach, rewarding themselves with substantial chunks of their own token supplies. Binance coin, the token associated with the Binance Smart Chain, has soared to a market capitalisation of nearly $100bn in four years. The founding team, which includes the Binance exchange’s outspoken founder Changpeng Zhao (pictured above, top right), awarded itself 40 per cent of the token’s total supply. Solana, a blockchain that has gained popularity as an alternative to Ethereum for decentralised finance apps, sold just under 13 per cent of the token’s total supply to the founding team for 20 cents per token. At current prices those tokens would be worth $13.5bn. Some analysts have questioned the fairness of these initial token distributions, arguing that they contradict the supposedly decentralised nature of cryptocurrency networks. “Those allocations would be fine if these were companies — it’s not crazy to see that much ownership,” says Ryan Watkins, a senior research analyst at Messari, a cryptocurrency analytics service. “But, when you’re building systems that are supposed to be more democratic, it just isn’t democratic.” Brian Armstrong, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, ranks as the wealthiest founder of a public crypto services company. Recommended Armstrong owns more than 36m shares in the company, worth more than $12bn. He also sold shares worth more than $290m on the day of Coinbase’s direct listing, an alternative to the traditional initial public offering that has no restrictions on stock sales. Armstrong’s co-founder, Fred Ehrsam, owns shares worth $3.8bn. Other cryptocurrency start-up founders hold large stakes in their companies that could be worth billions of dollars on paper. Forbes estimated that Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was worth $22.5bn this year, much of it from his roughly half stake in the $25bn start-up. Barry Silbert, founder and chief executive of Digital Currency Group, a digital assets company, told the Financial Times that he owns just under 40 per cent of the company, which investors recently valued at $10bn during a private secondary share sale. Silbert says he has not sold any shares in the business. Big cryptocurrency holders typically are reluctant to discuss their buying and selling decisions because of fears about hacking, tax authorities and other risks. “I think anybody involved with cryptocurrency is certainly reluctant and, in my case, unwilling to share anything,” Silbert says. “I joke that I lost all my bitcoin in a boating accident,” he adds, referencing a meme among bitcoin investors about a putative excuse given to tax authorities about losing a crypto wallet. While blockchains can make it easier to publicly track the flow of cryptocurrencies, they also mask the identities of their owners. Some applications, such as Nansen, attempt to match blockchain addresses to investment funds and other big holders, but they can be unreliable. The volatile and concentrated nature of cryptocurrencies means large purchases and sales can have a big effect on the market. Some start-ups have attempted to solve the problem by acting as intermediaries that route orders to multiple venues providing the best prices. Large crypto transactions can also draw a backlash from other traders. Earlier this year, cryptocurrency watchers began buzzing about an anonymous investor who had turned early purchases of shiba inu tokens in August last year into a $5.7bn stockpile little more than a year later, following a big rise in the token’s value. However, the trader soon attracted attention after moving $2.3bn of the stake to four different cryptocurrency wallets, sending the price of the token plummeting without even apparently making any sales.

In March 2019, Berlin-based company Brickblock tokenised a real estate vehicle containing a €2m property in Wiesbaden, western Germany. This was believed to be the first such transaction in Europe in which property shares were registered as digital tokens on the blockchain. A joint study by Hamburg Commercial Bank and the Frankfurt School Blockchain Center think-tank, published in September, suggested an estimated 41 companies in 17 countries, including the US, Germany and Switzerland, had been trialling tokenisation of property. The report said that the market was “still in its infancy”. However, the study emphasised this was a rough estimate due to a lack of transparency in the market and suggested that tokenising and fractionalising large buildings into small tradable units can make it more accessible to investors. It has been argued that tokenisation can allow retail investors with as little as €1 or $1 to participate in a rise in house prices without ever being a property owner themselves. Recommended In the US, a company called RealT offers investors the chance to buy into the country’s property market through fractional tokenised ownership using blockchain. Ownership of properties in cities such as Detroit is recorded by digital tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Tokens have also been issued against other real assets, such as high-end whisky collections and limited-edition gins. Gold is another asset that has been tokenised. Paxos, a US-regulated blockchain infrastructure company for digital assets, has issued PAX Gold, a digital asset where one token represents one fine troy ounce of a London Good Delivery gold bar, stored by Paxos in secure vaults in London. Investors in PAX Gold, built as a token on the Ethereum blockchain, own the underlying gold without having to worry about storing the precious metal themselves. Paxos says on its website that holders of PAX Gold can see on its website the serial number and purity of each gold bar to which their tokens are allocated.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jane Croft","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-11-30","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/85c8d520-b2d9-4a35-abdb-2f56cdd48792","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F74255e63-ca33-461d-8993-5423a93642d6.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How do criminals exploit cryptocurrencies?","INTRO":"Crooks are drawn to the anonymity of digital assets and the law struggles to keep up","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Entities involved in illicit activity received some $5bn in digital asset funds in 2020 and sent a similar amount. Those sums, from blockchain data provider Chainalysis, represent less than 1 per cent of overall cryptocurrency flows, however, and are dwarfed by the $1.6tn in cash that is laundered annually, according to UN estimates. Nevertheless, the freewheeling, loosely regulated world of digital assets has earned a reputation for facilitating crime, given the lack of checks and balances on the system in its early years. The net has been tightening as regulators circle and cryptocurrency businesses develop tools to root out questionable activity. But the use of digital assets for crimes such as scams and ransomware demands persists. The attraction of digital assets for criminals is that they afford varying levels of anonymity, depending on the particular asset. This can make them a tool to facilitate money laundering, for example. Recommended Bitcoin, the most popular, offers pseudonymity for its holders. This means holders can choose services to buy and sell the cryptocurrency without being required to disclose information that can identify them personally. However, every transaction is recorded on an immutable blockchain, so those with the technical expertise can see which digital wallets are sending funds to others. By contrast, monero, a smaller cryptocurrency, was designed as an anonymous “privacy coin” to obscure the identities of the sender and receiver, as well as the amount exchanged. It is more illiquid, however, meaning that it can be difficult to buy large amounts and can attract unwanted attention for criminals. Scams make up the majority of criminal transactions using digital assets, according to Chainalysis. Last year, for example, hackers took over the Twitter accounts of hundreds of high-profile users, including then US presidential candidate Joe Biden and electric-car tycoon Elon Musk, to demand more than $100,000 in bitcoin. “Doubling all payments sent to my BTC address. You send $1,000 and I will send $2,000 back!” wrote one scammer from Musk’s account. The second-largest category of crime is illicit transactions on the dark web, Chainalysis data show. The dark web is the name for those parts of the internet, popular among hackers and criminals, that are invisible to search engines and require anonymising software to access. They act as hubs for buying and selling firearms, drugs, stolen data and other illegal products. Recommended Many only accept payments in digital assets. On Hydra, the largest dark web market place by revenues, there are money launderers called “Treasure Men”: a user pays a cryptocurrency amount to an intermediary, who will turn it into cash and leave it at a pick-up point. A smaller but rapidly growing criminal use for digital assets is collecting ransomware payments. Ransomware usually involves hackers seizing an organisation’s data or hijacking computer systems and only unlocking access for a ransom. As the practice has proliferated, hackers have taken to demanding ransom payments in bitcoin or monero, making it harder for law enforcement agencies to trace the funds. In 2020, at least $350m in crypto ransoms was paid to hacker gangs. Other criminal use cases include terrorist financing, evading sanctions or moving stolen funds. “I see the promise of these new technologies,” US Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said in February. “But I also see the reality: cryptocurrencies have been used to launder the profits of online drug traffickers; they’ve been a tool to finance terrorism.” Regulatory pressure has encouraged many cryptocurrency businesses to improve their policing of nefarious activity. When digital assets first began to take off, criminals would use the major cryptocurrency exchanges, many of which had little to no anti-money-laundering (AML) or know-your-customer (KYC) processes. Blockchain analysis company Elliptic estimates that, between 2011 and 2019, large exchanges helped cash out between 60 and 80 per cent of all Bitcoin transactions from known bad actors. That share now stands at 45 per cent, as many crypto exchanges have improved their systems. Recommended In September, the US Treasury imposed sanctions on a cryptocurrency exchange for the first time, for facilitating ransomware payments. More regulation or sanctions may be on the way. Meanwhile, law enforcement agencies and the private sector are developing technology to track criminal groups and their use of digital assets, by analysing flows of cryptocurrencies in the blockchain. For example, US authorities were able to track and recover a large portion of the ransomware payment made to the Russian hackers who effectively shut down the Colonial oil pipeline earlier this year, causing fuel shortages on the US east coast. However, the game of cat and mouse is escalating as criminal groups develop techniques to cover their crypto tracks.

Pricing in options, tools that let investors bet on future movements in financial assets, suggest market participants are wagering that ethereum will more than treble to $15,000 by March next year. The move comes a week after the Securities and Exchange Commission cleared the way for the launch of the first bitcoin-linked ETF. Investors poured more than $1bn in to the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy fund, prompting it to buy up futures contracts that track the price of bitcoin. This, in turn, propelled the price of bitcoin to an all-time high. Traders are now betting on a repeat scenario for ethereum ETFs: “Simply put, the market seems bullish with regards to ethereum’s potential by year-end or the first quarter,” Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, one of the biggest crypto options trading venues, said. Buying interest has “exploded” in derivatives contracts traded that give investors the right but not the obligation to buy ethereum at $15,000 in March next year, according to Adam Farthing, chief risk officer for Japan at crypto specialist trading firm B2C2. Farthing said the timing of these bets suggested that investors were optimistic about a similar decision for the second most-traded digital coin. Ethereum was trading in striking range of record highs at $4,000 on Wednesday.

The launch of the ProShares fund, which was followed by a similar futures backed product by Valkyrie Funds, has fuelled expectations that the SEC will make a positive decision on the more than 20 applications under review. “The SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have shown they are going to be deliberate but open-minded about the crypto-related funds they are willing to allow, and the past week has shown there is demand for these kinds of products,” Steven McClurg, chief investment officer at Valkyrie Funds. Still, ETF sponsors remain sceptical that the SEC is poised to act in the near futures. ProShares and digital asset manager VanEck had filed applications with the SEC to launch ETFs on ethereum earlier this year, but they subsequently pulled their plans. Both ProShares and VanEck declined to comment on their reasoning. Valkyrie’s McClurg said that due to thin trading activity in ethereum futures markets, expecting regulatory approval before the end of next year was a “long shot”. Joshua Lim, head of derivatives at Genesis Trading, said that traders abandoned positive bets on bitcoin and placed them on ethereum instead in the run-up to the approval of the ProShares ETF in a bid to benefit from a positive reaction in ethereum’s price if the SEC gives the nod.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Eva Szalay","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-10-28","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/785652f9-1739-4b5b-af2b-c3af561dfdf5","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F3004c3ba-4959-4959-94b9-fc62bbc4b577.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Web3: the future of the internet will not spell the end of Big Tech","INTRO":"Walls are already being built before the tech utopia becomes a reality","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The next iteration of the internet requires some magical thinking. Web3 is a tech utopia. It envisages a world of decentralised collaboration that would end the supremacy of major companies by wiping out lucrative markets for data collection and digital advertising. Yet building that world would require exactly the sort of investment that only Big Tech can provide. Hitting the refresh button on the internet looks tempting after years of disinformation and data hacks. First came the web — a scattered collection of open-source information. Then came Web 2.0, in which companies such as Google organised information and helped users to interact online while building walls around data. Tech giants amassed trillions of dollars of market value and now dominate the US stock market. Just five companies account for over a fifth of the S\u0026P 500 index by market capitalisation. Web3 provides the backlash to this concentration of power. It is imagined as a decentralised system built on the blockchain in which companies no longer act as gatekeepers. User information will freely move across the internet. Instead of platforms making decisions about content, users will self-moderate. Tokens will be generated as rewards and everything will be on public blockchains, making the web transparent and safe. That is the theory anyway. Most of this does not yet exist. But the idea has gained momentum with the boom in newly fashionable non-fungible tokens (NFTs), digital ownership of online ephemera and decentralised finance projects running on public blockchains. Venture capitalists already use Web3 as a point of focus for investment in cryptocurrency projects. New VC fund Paradigm One raised $2.5bn in November to focus on applications that operate on ethereum. Its token ether now has a market capitalisation of more than $500bn, up from $68bn a year ago. A planned upgrade from energy-intensive proof-of-work — solving a math problem — verification to proof-of-stake will raise ethereum’s profile further. Yet the end of Big Tech’s hegemony seems unlikely. The ethereum blockchain has limits on transactions and much of the public remains wary of digital tokens. Plus, these wealthy companies have no plans to hand over control either. Social media platform Twitter has announced a dedicated crypto team. Facebook’s name change to Meta and plans to become a “metaverse company” are linked to the idea of a future in which digital assets can be moved safely around the internet.

Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang have finished raising $2.5bn this month for Paradigm One, their first venture capital fund. Investors jockeyed to commit money to the fund, allowing them to raise twice the amount they initially targeted. “It is probably small relative to where we’re going in 10 years,” Ehrsam told the Financial Times at Paradigm’s sparse headquarters in downtown San Francisco, where plastic wrap covered new office equipment. Paradigm’s eye-popping fundraise could stoke fears about a bubble in cryptocurrencies, especially in the niche corners of decentralised finance where the firm has made its name. Earlier this year, VC firm Andreessen Horowitz also raised twice as much as it had hoped for a new cryptocurrency fund, bringing in $2.2bn, which at the time it said was the “largest crypto fund ever raised”. More than any other investors, both firms have staked their fortunes on an expanding ecosystem of applications based on ethereum, a digital ledger that allows programmers to write contracts automatically executing functions such as money transfers. The programs run on what are known as tokens, digital assets that are granted to users over time, often giving them a say in governance. Paradigm has accumulated some of the largest token holdings in the sector by placing early bets on development teams, giving it rights to future distributions. Paradigm’s first fund, which raised an initial $400m in 2018, made an annual internal rate of return of more than 200 per cent through the first half of this year, according to figures viewed by the Financial Times. The fund’s assets have reached as high as $10bn, though they can fluctuate sharply with the price of cryptocurrencies, said people familiar with its holdings. Paradigm structured it like a hedge fund, meaning it does not need to return capital to investors by a certain date, a requirement of VC funds. Paradigm declined to comment on performance. Paradigm’s founders said the world of token-based apps, sometimes referred to as web3, still had more room to grow. Several so-called decentralised finance protocols backed by Paradigm, such as the token exchange Uniswap, have soared in value in the past year as more people move money away from the legacy financial system. In areas such as gaming and music, developers are also experimenting with new ways to distribute value to consumers using tokens. “The biggest companies in the world are large internet tech companies powered by network effects,” Ehrsam said. “We think decades into the future it’s very clear the largest entities in the world will be powered by tokens.” Ethereum still faces doubters. The network has struggled with high transaction costs during busy periods, and some cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have challenged its dominant status as the infrastructure for decentralised apps. “History has yet to be decided on it,” Ehrsam said. Paradigm isn’t solely betting on ethereum either, investing in a lending app called Jet Protocol that runs on rival network Solana, which claims faster transaction speeds. Paradigm’s founders said they viewed their token investments as long-term holdings that could take at least 10 years to pay off. Like bitcoin, the assets can be highly volatile depending on the whims of cryptocurrency speculators. “If liquidity were to dry up in the space, they’re going to be left holding a lot of assets,” said Graham Duncan, an early investor in Paradigm. But he’s still confident on their odds. “I think their time horizon will take them through it,” he said. Start-up founders said Paradigm had rapidly grown into a desirable investor, partly by recruiting a five-person research team to work with portfolio companies. Financial services groups and the firm’s investors, which include the Harvard and Yale university endowments, have also turned to Paradigm for advice on the workings of digital assets. At times, Paradigm has negotiated sweetheart deals with cryptocurrency groups seeking its endorsement. During a recent $73m token sale for Lido, an app for earning yield on ethereum and other blockchains, Paradigm led a group of investors that received a discount of about two-thirds compared with the token’s open-market price at the time of the initial proposal. Optimism, a public benefit corporation developing a programme to make ethereum transactions more efficient, contacted Paradigm for investment after the firm brought on programmers it had previously hoped to hire. “If we wanted to access their time, it made sense to go and try to get a check from Paradigm,” said Jinglang Wang, co-founder of Optimism. Opyn, a cryptocurrency options program, chose an investment offer from Paradigm this year that valued the company lower than what Andreessen was willing to pay, said one person briefed on the deal who asked to remain anonymous. Andreessen declined to comment. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click Paradigm purchased approximately 20 per cent of the company at a valuation of $28m, along with the rights to a proportional share of any tokens Opyn eventually creates. After investing, Paradigm worked with Opyn chief executive Zubin Koticha and other employees to design a new kind of cryptocurrency derivative during a week-long retreat in rural North Carolina. Dave White and Dan Robinson, two Paradigm researchers, emerged as the lead authors of a paper introducing the concept. Investors tend to be sceptical of large VC funds, which can be difficult to invest profitably. Huang said he had few doubts about Paradigm’s strategy. “If Fred and I ever found ourselves working in some kind of low growth, low return situation, I think we would prefer death,” Huang said.

Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Monday Hey Fintech Fam! The past five years have seen more innovation in the payments industry than during the previous two decades, the chief executive of Visa, Al Kelly, told me when we chatted for the FT’s Global Banking Summit last week. Regulators also know this to be true and are scrambling to keep up with the pace of change which has led to whiplash-inducing guidelines from financial authorities around the world. In this week’s newsletter, we get an update from Chloe Cornish in India, where regulators have floated an all-out crypto ban. Read on for stories that highlight how the world is trying to adjust to a changing payments landscape. Plus, there’s a Q\u0026A with Socure, the largest start-up in the digital identity space helping finance companies combat fraud as payments move online. Write to the FintechFT team at imani.moise@ft.com and sid.v@ft.com. Venture capital investors unnerved by China’s tech crackdown are chasing opportunities in India and showing an acute interest in the cryptocurrency space. More than half a billion dollars have poured into Indian crypto companies so far this year, according to Venture Intelligence, compared to just $25m the year before. But as Siddharth reported from Chennai in last week’s newsletter, jitters are beginning to develop in India’s growing crypto market. A proposal was introduced in parliament to “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies” in the country, sparking a sell-off. Newcomers to the turbulence of crypto-land may have been, understandably, spooked by the threat of a ban. But old crypto hands will have seen regulatory panics hitting the market before. Crypto start-ups have had a rough ride in India, in contrast to the government’s enthusiastic leadership on the country’s impressive digital payments infrastructure. A 2018 central bank order forbade Indian banks from providing services to crypto businesses, making it painfully difficult for trading platforms to operate in India. But the Reserve Bank of India’s interdiction was overturned by a Supreme Court decision in March. The flood gates opened: crypto exchanges’ aggressive marketing, fuelled by huge venture capital injections, introduced millions of Indians to digital currencies. One new trader told me “FOMO” had caused her to start buying into bitcoin last spring — she’d seen friends buying iPhones with their trading profits, and she didn’t want to lose out on the opportunity. She did not want her name published in case bitcoin and other digital tokens became illegal, but doubted a total ban was imminent. Indian officials in favour of a ban fear that inexperienced traders are especially vulnerable to the sharp swings of digital currencies. This newbie trader however is trying her luck with crypto alongside the stock market investments in her “systematic investment plan” or SIP. For her, bitcoin and ether make up “another SIP, a more fun SIP.” For now, she plans to sit on her modest crypto gains. Considering there are nearly 1.4bn people in India, crypto makes up a small percentage of overall trading. While platforms like CoinSwitch Kuber boast more than 10m registered users, they admit the number of people who have actually bought coins is much lower. Ashish Singhal, CoinSwitch Kuber’s chief executive, told me that only 6m of the platform’s 13m registered users had transacted at least once. That’s coming from India’s most highly valued crypto start-up, at a cool $1.9bn, which snared Andreessen Horowitz’s first-ever Indian investment. Of course, starting small means there is massive space to grow. And in a sign that India’s government is interested in pursuing the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies’ underlying blockchain technology, India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology published a national strategy paper on Friday. A ban on cryptocurrencies would be the worst-case scenario for the burgeoning sector, but lawyers and crypto business leaders said regulation was more likely than prohibition. So far there are few details about what India’s crypto bill will ultimately say, so traders there will have to wait and see how safe it is to HODL. (Chloe Cornish) Every week we ask the founders of fast-growing fintechs to introduce themselves and explain what makes them stand out in a crowded industry. Our conversation, lightly edited, appears below. I caught up with Socure CEO Johnny Ayers shortly after a $450m Series E funding round brought his company’s valuation to $4.5bn. This makes Socure the most highly valued private company in the digital identity verification space. Banks and fintechs alike reported a surge in fraud activity as the pandemic forced more transactions online, and finance firms have flocked to technology providers like Socure to help them verify that customers are who they claim to be. How did you get started? The idea was that the way that identities were verified historically just didn’t work. You had credit data being the foundation of where a lot of identity information was being used, and then you had the kind of rules-based systems not using any graph databases, or machine learning to actually verify [a specific customer]. So we’ve spent the past nine years building out [a database of] every element of identity — email, phone, address, date of birth, social device, IP, and physical documents — to be able to deliver the most accurate comprehensive identity verification service in the US. Who are your investors? Capital One, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Synchrony Financial and Santander You’ve built out a system to manage fraud risk, do you want to do credit risk as well? I am now at this nucleus, where I’m seeing all these identities at scale. Why can’t I then start to go into ‘This is the real consumer, but do I want to do business with this consumer?’ And so if I have all these customers and this huge network reporting back into me I know if this person has bounced checks, does she dispute [charges], or does she have three to five accounts that are all in good standing and have been in good standing for 15 years? That becomes really valuable to the network. We’re developing right now and we’ll move into that type of risk grading. Does your US focus make it hard to win business from international companies? We’re primarily focused on the US today, because we generally find it’s 40 per cent of the global total addressable market in our world. A global issuer generally has country-specific strategies that they’re developing. We generally find those types of global issuers are not building global strategies that flow everywhere. They have regional data sources. That doesn’t scale internationally. There’s also data storage requirements where data can’t move across countries. There’s privacy requirements. So generally, we find folks building strategies with best-in-class providers in that country. ‘Cash is King’ but monarchies fall Global cash payments fell 16 per cent in 2020 and are unlikely to rebound as fintech companies in emerging markets accelerated a shift toward digital payments, according to a new McKinsey study.

Maybe Facebook will build part of it. Maybe it’s already here, in the form of video games such as Fortnite, digital collectibles known as non-fungible tokens and even cryptocurrencies. Maybe there will be more than one metaverse; maybe there won’t ever really be any. It’s all a bit unclear. What is clear, however, is that we are meant to think of this amorphous metaverse as a place of infinite wonder and possibility. It is envisaged by techno-utopians as an interconnected web of virtual worlds in which our “digital twins” can wander about buying virtual art, attending virtual gigs and having virtual relationships. “The metaverse is the new land of opportunities,” crypto investor Vignesh Sundaresan (known by his crypto name MetaKovan and for spending $69m on an NFT by the artist Beeple earlier this year) told a panel last week. “It’s not about the commerce behind it, but having a place where people from different parts of the world can . . . have an opportunity for prosperity.” Apparently MetaKovan has no interest in making a land-grab for this new sphere, never mind that his pseudonym might come from a partial translation from Tamil to mean “king of the metaverse” or that he might run one of the world’s biggest NFT funds. But there is, of course, a financial incentive here: crypto enthusiasts are hoping that NFTs, which are meant to represent the ownership of digital or physical assets stored on a blockchain, will become a key component of this future world, along with the cryptocurrency used to pay for them. NFTs representing plots of virtual “land” in the metaverse have already been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency. One company selling such virtual goodies is Somnium Space, invested in by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s old rivals, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss — these days better known for being bitcoin billionaires. After the twins tweeted about it on Tuesday, Somnium Space’s native token, “Cube”, soared in value by 260 per cent. “The race for the metaverse is on!” one brother tweeted. He gave the game away. As far as I’m concerned, the hypocritical fantasy that underpins crypto also lies at the heart of the metaverse. This isn’t about building a decentralised paradise where everyone can prosper and live in harmony; this is about making a small group of people rich. “The metaverse is a marketing offensive,” says Janet Murray, a professor of digital media at the Georgia Institute of Technology and author of Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace. “There’s a very vague fantasy at the base of this . . . This sense that technology will magically provide this alternate thing, and there will be some way to make a lot of money out of it, because technology has provided things that we didn’t think were possible before, and people made a lot of money out of those.” Even if the metaverse does end up becoming the future of the internet, why would we want to use crypto tokens to pay for stuff there? Surely we would prefer to use money that we can also use in the real world. After all, we might be able to buy virtual clothes in the metaverse, but we still need real ones — and to eat real food and sleep in real beds. We need real money to pay for all that.

It also means having to pay an exchange fee — the standard rate charged for exchanging fiat currency to crypto, or vice versa, is around 2.5 per cent. There is no reason to use crypto in the metaverse — the vast majority of money nowadays only exists digitally anyway. Cryptocurrencies, in other words, will have as much use as money in the metaverse as they do in the real world. I have always suspected that one of the reasons people keep buying into crypto — which I consider akin to a Ponzi scheme — is that they don’t really understand it. In some ways, therefore, the elusive metaverse is a perfect partner. Talking up ideas that people find confusing is a great way of obfuscating things that people find objectionable, as Zuckerberg seems to have discovered. It’s also apparently a great way of making a quick buck — or much more for a privileged few. jemima.kelly@ft.com","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-10-27","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/4210ceff-f782-4f96-8833-86c5c528da45","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F1288ea3f-f6b0-4d08-b8a8-30d6a88de3dc.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Digital assets: the fun of non-fungible tokens","INTRO":"Growth is likely to come from gamers but as the popularity of NFTs rises so does the potential for abuse","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Non-fungible tokens may not sound aesthetically pleasing, but they have transformed the contemporary art market. Prices set records this year as bitcoin reached an all-time high. Yet future growth in the NFT market is likely to come from gamers, not aesthetes. NFTs can range from images to videos to animations to tweets. What is for sale is claim of ownership. A digital identifier is recorded on the blockchain. Physical objects backing the digital counterpart can exist, but they do not have to. What matters is authenticity. Anyone can replicate or view a digital image, but there is only one true owner. The NFT market is already worth about $15bn, according to analytics platform DappRadar, up from a few hundred million dollars last year. Analysts at Jefferies believe it could be worth almost $80bn by 2025. Gaming NFTs are likely to drive this growth. Axie Infinity, an NFT-enabled online video game created in 2018 by Vietnamese studio Sky Mavis, involves players acquiring and doing battle with cute pet characters. It has generated almost $3bn of transactions and now has nearly 1m players. In the art world, NFTs trade on exclusivity. Digital art collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape have just a few thousand owners. Gaming NFT transaction volumes are far higher. The biggest sales may be artworks, but the highest volumes are in gaming. Gamers have been spending large sums on in-game purchases for years. NFT purchases stand out because they require cryptocurrency. Transactions are often made using a game’s own tokens, which can be converted to ethereum and then to the player’s home currency. Axie’s token is called AXS. As NFTs grow more popular, the potential for abuse rises. There are concerns that they might be used for money laundering. Plus, even with blockchain technology, fraud is still possible at the tokenisation stage. NFT investor Pranksy found this out when buying what was thought to be a Banksy NFT for $341,000 that he says turned out to be a scam.

Is this a moment of vindication for the pioneers who promoted digital currencies as an asset class and heralded a technological and financial revolution? Or is it a sign that the hype cycle is reaching its final, frenzied moments before the fever breaks? I wish I knew — because I am one of those sceptics. And now I own a non-fungible token, or NFT. The annual survey of family offices by Citi Private Bank, which landed in September, found 23 per cent now have crypto assets in their portfolio, and another 25 per cent are considering them. Of family office executives who attended a Citi forum connected to the report, half said they expected to increase allocations to crypto in the next year. These are big numbers from often conservative managers of other people’s money. Interest in digital assets, which spread first from the over-thinkers (crypto-utopians thrilled by a complex solution to an unasked question) to the under-thinkers (herd-followers seeing a quick buck in a barely comprehended trade), appears to have finally reached the consensus-thinkers. I have a theory as to why. If there is one thing wealthy individuals and their advisers know about, it is art — and, this year, the worlds of cryptocurrency and art have collided, in the form of NFTs. Recommended These NFTs are pieces of code that represent an artwork — or a clip from a basketball game, or a tweet, or a photo of William Shatner. They can be bought with cryptocurrency or conventional funds converted into crypto. Ownership is recorded on a digital ledger called a blockchain and transferred using that blockchain’s cryptocurrency. It has been easy to dismiss the utility of blockchain technology. We already have ways to record and transfer ownership of digital assets (like money in a bank account) and an established legal infrastructure to ensure trust in that system, which blockchain does not have. I still don’t know that we need a different way. But it is no longer defensible to say that the use cases for blockchain are entirely theoretical. The reason I own an NFT is that an artist/developer friend of mine has been minting them. Not only are they a way for him to make money from his work, they are a unique way. Code embedded in the token guarantees him a royalty when a piece is sold on, something no artist is able to insist upon in the physical world. That is a use case. So now I am the proud owner of a token on the Tezos blockchain that represents a piece of generative art, a gif of a hexagon that dissolves and spins and reforms on an endless loop. You can download the gif if you want. But I am the only one with the token. Recommended I am under no illusions as to what I have here. I want to see what happens. Quite apart from whether an artist’s work is deemed to have merit in the future, what happens to an NFT will depend on whether we agree that owning a unique token is different and superior to copying the gif or watching it on a webpage. The blockchain where the token exists, and the cryptocurrency in which it is valued, are other variables. Blockchains can and do fall into disrepair. Tezos has powerful backers but it ranks in popularity well below ethereum, which is staking a claim to be the blockchain of choice for higher-value NFTs, new financial services, games and many other developer experiments. There may be more value in whatever is created and traded next using blockchain technology. I also have no idea how to value the currencies that allow each blockchain to function. The biggest investment opportunities may not be in crypto assets at all but in the companies operating and exploiting the technology. But I understand more about the possibilities now than I did before I plunged in. The point is, we are in the midst of a great experiment and investors that may have once dismissed it, ought now to consider taking part in it. I’m with the 25 per cent in that Citi family office survey that said they are “still in research mode seeking advice”. Whatever a family office is spending on research and advice, they may glean equally valuable insight by diverting a little into crypto, to see what happens.

One of the latest comes from Switzerland. It is underpinned by unquoted shares in a sports resort business and backed by Credit Suisse, a traditional institution with a taste for bracing new financing techniques. The bank is placing equity security tokens, as they are called, in Alaïa, whose businesses include an Alpine sports centre. Investors will be able to trade these on the Taurus Digital Exchange, a platform operated by a cryptocurrency services company. Promoters of security tokens like to distinguish their issues from the initial coin offerings (ICOs) that flourished a few years ago. These were frequently fraudulent and imploded in 2017. Tokenised securities can represent shares, bonds, real estate and intellectual property rights. Security token offerings (STOs) may have the blessing of local regulators, giving investors a legal claim over the underlying asset. In the case of putative investors in Alaïa that means the group’s ethereum-based shares have a claim on earnings and a traditional — though low — ranking for recompense in the event of a liquidation. The tokens have obvious appeal to start-ups and other small businesses. Issuance costs may be as little as a fifth of those for a traditional public equity offering, says Ulrik K Lykke co-founder of crypto hedge fund ARK36. Issuers have raised some $500m from 55 deals globally in 2019, according to Blockstate, a token specialist. Three-quarters of transactions so far are for equity and almost all are based on the ethereum cryptocurrency. Traded STO market capitalisation almost doubled to $1.1bn in August compared with March this year. Tokenised securities create intriguing jeopardy for banks such as Credit Suisse. Placing big issues of stocks and bonds is an important business for them. So far, technology has assisted traditional bookbuilding rather than replacing it. That may be about to change, pushing down fees and upending old hierarchies. The only thing more dangerous to incumbents than disruption itself may be a failure to participate in it.

New forms of financial intermediation are using blockchain technology to open up access to finance and bypass inefficient and lumbering traditional institutions like commercial banks. DeFi even makes it possible to sidestep government oversight and regulation. In China, for instance, a national ban on investing in cryptocurrency is pushing traders towards DeFi. While there is no doubt that the technology opens up exciting opportunities, this kind of unfettered financial engineering also opens the door to new risks. At face value, DeFi might seem a more secure way to conduct transactions. The system is characterised by transparent digital ledgers maintained on multiple computers, so there is no centralised point of failure. Its governance is also decentralised — control rests with the members of a network rather than a central authority. Trust is achieved through public consensus: community members must themselves agree about the validity of transactions, rather than relying on third parties. In principle, these features make DeFi invulnerable to hacks of particular computer nodes or malfeasance by individuals or institutions. DeFi also enables “permissionless composability”. That means a developer can easily connect together multiple DeFi applications built on open-source technology to create new financial products and services, without having to seek permissions. Several innovative DeFi products are already available. Flash loans, for example, enable borrowing without collateral, using that money for a transaction and then returning the borrowed amount, all for a small fee. A flash loan is initiated, executed, and completed in the blink of an eye, using just computer code. They have many uses, from helping to arbitrage price differences across markets, to increasing market efficiency. Since they are instantaneous, default and liquidity risks are reduced. Then there are smart contracts, which allow financial and other assets to be exchanged using computer code with no attorney or escrow agent involved. Computer tools can perform rigorous economic risk assessments of smart contracts and specific DeFi products. The open source nature of the applications helps uncover and eliminate security and other weaknesses. Still, sophisticated hackers have been able to take advantage of vulnerabilities in DeFi products. Malevolent agents can exploit the larger “attack surface” that is created when combining multiple applications. They are also more vulnerable to software bugs and users who do not fully understand the risks. The absence of a central authority to police bad behaviour also has risks. Researchers at Cornell University found that automated bots could front-run certain trades — for instance, executing open orders at an unfavourable price before they can be cancelled when prices change. With no one to report this flaw to, the researchers published a blog post detailing the risk, assuming the community would protect itself. Instead, a cottage industry of bots emerged to exploit the idea before the loophole could be closed. It is worth remembering that while DeFi may rely on libertarian ideals such as its own rule of law, with the community creating and enforcing rules in the broad interests of stakeholders, in reality nascent blockchain systems are vulnerable to governance capture by small groups of stakeholders, who could twist rules in their favour. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click Moreover, while blockchains are self-contained, they still need information about prices and ownership of assets to execute certain transactions. For instance, on-chain hog futures contracts need access to hog prices from commodity exchanges. Computer programs called oracles obtain such off-chain information and pass on-chain information back to the real world. These oracles are vulnerable to technical risks including hacks and even problems with external data providers. Given all this, regulators are in a quandary — even open-minded ones who see potential in DeFi but worry about financial stability risks. They can now intercede only at the point where these products intersect with institutions they oversee. As decentralised finance grows in size and scope, regulators will have to pay attention to risks building up in these markets and their spillovers into traditional financial markets. Updated regulatory frameworks that encompass DeFi will eventually be needed, although they should strike a reasonable balance in the innovation-risk trade-off. At a minimum, naive retail investors swept up by the technological razzle-dazzle must be protected from taking on outsized risks.

Examples of digital assets include cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, so-called asset-backed stablecoins, such as tether, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) — certificates of ownership of original digital media. Records of ownership of digital assets are held securely on a type of decentralised database, or electronic ledger, called a blockchain, which is distributed among its users. This structure enables the transfer of digital assets without the need to go through a central party, such as a bank, broker or intermediary. This can make transactions quicker and easier. A blockchain is a type of electronic ledger, in which digital asset transactions are recorded in blocks of data that are “chained” together in a specific order and protected using complex computer “hash” codes. Details of every new transaction must be verified by a network of computers, or nodes, before they can be added to the ledger. This verification process involves the details of the transaction being sent to all of the nodes in the network, which attempt to solve complex mathematical problems to prove that the transaction is valid. A majority must conclude that it is valid — it must be a consensus decision by the network. All the nodes in the network can access the information and compete to be the next to validate a new transaction and add it to a block. Unlike traditional ledgers, therefore, a blockchain database is decentralised and there is no master version. Each consensus-verified transaction is added to a block of data, and the blocks are connected to each other in a chain. As each new block is added, the blockchain becomes a growing database of time-stamped transactions that, in practical terms, is impossible to alter. Each new block that is appended to the blockchain contains a complex and unique computer-generated code, called a hash. This is like a digital “fingerprint”. Each block also contains the hash, or fingerprint, of the previous block in the chain, to which it is now attached. These matching hash codes prove that the chain is intact, in the correct order, and unaltered. If any attempt is made to tamper with the contents of a block, this will generate a new hash for that block, which will then differ from the hash of the previous block — breaking the chain. In order to conceal this tampering, a hacker would have to recalculate the hash code held in the next block in the chain, which would have the effect of changing that block’s own hash, requiring the next block’s hash codes to be recalculated, and so on. Every hash in every subsequent block in the chain would therefore have to be recalculated — a process requiring so much computing power that it would be extremely difficult. The database is therefore, in effect, “append-only” — it is not possible for anyone to go back and revise it later. Several technology platform providers facilitate the building of blockchains. According to industry estimates, 60-70 per cent of public blockchains are run on the Ethereum platform. Some believe this could become the preferred provider of technology for a range of decentralised processes. However, newer rival blockchain platforms with greater processing capacity have now sprung up, including Avalanche, Solana and Cardano. Solana has been used as a platform for the sale of new collections of NFTs. Digital assets can be quicker to issue than paper-based or physical assets. Their electronic-only format can also streamline the transaction process, reducing administrative and physical storage costs. These are some of the reasons that central banks and commercial banks are considering the use of digital assets and blockchain technologies. Digital assets held on a blockchain can pose both investment and security risks. The main investment risk is that digital assets that are not backed by physical holdings or fiat currencies issued by governments or central banks can fluctuate widely in value — driven by sentiment and demand. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have been known to double or halve in value against conventional currencies within the space of a few months. In October, Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe warned: “A massive collapse in crypto asset prices, similar to what we have seen in tech stocks [in 2000] and subprime [mortgage-backed securities in 2008], is certainly a plausible scenario.” A similar risk is that the high prices currently being paid for NFTs — such as the $69m paid for a token conferring ownership of a digital collage by the artist Beeple — will not be sustained. The main security risk is that digital asset exchanges, which allow individuals to buy and sell assets such as cryptocurrencies, can be hacked by criminals. A further risk is posed by electronic “wallets” which can be used to store cryptocurrencies and are protected by complex 16-digit “private keys”. Cybercriminals can trick users into giving away their private keys, and then steal their assets. Or users who forget their private keys can permanently lose access to their assets, as there is no central ownership register. Banks and fintechs have been working on ways to use blockchains to improve payment systems. By using distributed ledger technology, payment systems can, in theory, be made faster and more secure. Some banks are experimenting with issuing bonds on blockchains, as well, which could streamline the existing process, cut costs and reduce risk in the settlement process. The World Bank has already sold and managed bonds using blockchain technology, and the European Investment Bank recently raised €100m from a two-year bond registered on the Ethereum blockchain network. A blockchain’s decentralised structure could also remove the need for intermediaries — so bonds would no longer need to be registered with a central securities depository.

But, unlike the money that is widely used today, a pure cryptocurrency is not created by a central issuing authority and its value is transferred and recorded on an open public ledger known as a blockchain. Furthermore, the currency’s provenance, and transfer of ownership, is secured and verified by cryptography. There are dozens of cryptocurrencies, the best known being bitcoin, ether, binance coin and cardano. However, there is an important distinction between a cryptocurrency, also known as a coin, and a token. A cryptocurrency has its own blockchain; it is effectively the native currency of the blockchain on which it is issued and traded. By contrast, a token is a unit of value that represents projects that are built on top of an existing blockchain. For example, ether is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain. But a token such as dai is built using Ethereum. Dai itself is a stablecoin — a bridge between existing financial markets and the crypto world. Increasingly, observers are talking about crypto assets in a more encompassing way to describe all the projects under way in the industry. Other ventures include security tokens, which are a crypto-based version of an existing security and usually a regulated activity. The Bank of England has estimated that crypto assets have grown in value by roughly 200 per cent in 2021, from just under $800bn to $2.3tn. Even so, that remains a fraction of the $250tn global financial system, notes the central bank. The first versions of cryptocurrencies were intended to be a form of electronic cash whose value could not be manipulated by outside actors such as central banks. But their use in everyday life — to buy consumer items such as coffees or sandwiches — has been slow. That is partly because the technology to make payments is far slower than the contactless card or chip-and-pin systems of today. But the main reason is that the value of the asset is highly volatile, making it unsuitable for everyday payments. Instead, cryptocurrencies are being seen as stores of value in their own right. Cryptocurrencies are created in different ways. Some, like bitcoin, are created as a reward to “miners” for using computer power to verify transactions that are made on the bitcoin blockchain. But that makes bitcoin expensive to operate — and the industry has been heavily criticised for its energy consumption. Others are trying to find alternative processes to ensure deals on blockchains can still be verified but do not require the same amounts of computing energy. Newer projects are focused on third parties to take on the legwork of processing some payments, to make the system more efficient and scalable. Prices of coins can be volatile and can move rapidly in the short term. That is why some cryptocurrency owners use the mantra “hodl” (“hold on for dear life”). With bitcoin hitting record prices in 2021, it is easy to see why they feel vindicated. Still, the coins are largely unregulated around the world so, if something goes wrong and investors lose their money, they have little protection from the authorities. Other assets that are based on cryptocurrencies, such as futures, have more investor protections. Some exchanges that offer crypto-related trading, such as derivatives exchange CME Group, also have to meet local laws that ensure the integrity of their market. The value of a coin can also be affected if it is discontinued, delisted or undergoes a significant technology change. Currencies can be discontinued for many reasons, from low volume and liquidity to security breaches. Finally, developers or members of a crypto community may have differing views on the future direction of the network or want to change the rules, or protocol, that governs the blockchain. That can lead to a “hard fork” which, in effect, splits the protocol into two branches and creates a new cryptocurrency. Forks can create volatility in crypto prices and, over the longer term, the two versions of the currency may not produce the same performance. The owners of the assets are as responsible for safeguarding the asset, as much as they would be for protecting their cash. Digital currencies can be kept on a computer and there are several choices available to crypto owners. One option is a virtual wallet that is kept online. It is easier to access and makes it faster for users to trade because they can quickly connect to exchanges or other services. However, being online makes a wallet more susceptible to being hacked, so some people prefer to keep their assets in what is known as “cold storage” — on an electronic device but in a vault not connected to the internet. Cold storage wallets do not accept as many kinds of cryptocurrencies as online wallets, however, and they are more expensive storage options. Another problem is losing or forgetting the private key, which unlocks the digital wallet. Recommended Like other financial institutions, crypto service providers also have to make sure they are not hacked. Compromising the security of a blockchain is widely seen as a remote problem — to succeed, a hacker would need more computing power than all the other independent verifiers on the network. That often means the computer code written for new projects is the most vulnerable point in the system. Sometimes, the code is little tested before it goes live and is open for hackers to exploit and walk off with the assets. But so-called ethical white hat hackers can try to test and improve the service. In August, one hacker removed assets worth $600m from Poly Network, a decentralised trading network, when he found a flaw. He later returned them.

This guide tells you all you need to know","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Alt or alternative coins: Any cryptocurrency other than the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is known as an alt-coin. Alt-coins range from relatively well-established and popular coins like t through to joke currencies like dogecoin. The term is also sometimes applied to stablecoins or to tokens that represent a stake of ownership, such as a security token. Automated Market Maker: An actor that encourages buyers and sellers in a decentralised market. Like market makers on traditional markets, they aim to make money from discrepancies in pricing on different markets, until the asset price falls into line across all markets. An automated market maker deposits their own pair of cryptocurrencies into a smart contract and lets computer code handle buying and selling with interested parties, who are also using their own smart contracts. Owners of assets are incentivised by sharing in the pool of fees that are generated through trading activity. The process has been compared to YouTube because investors can generate and upload their own content. Automatic liquidation: A common feature in leveraged trading on a crypto exchange. A futures trader only pays for a small fraction of the overall value of their position, which is a bet on the direction of the asset. The leverage can magnify potential gains and losses. That payment, margin, is used to back the trade. In a traditional market, when the asset price goes against the direction the trader has bet, the exchange may ask the customer to stump up extra funds within a certain timeframe to keep the trade open. A position on a crypto exchange can work differently. The exchange monitors the market constantly and may automatically begin selling off some of the customer’s bets if the customer’s margin falls below a pre-determined level. Typically a user will receive an alert if their account is in danger — but given the volatility of digital assets, these kinds of forced liquidation events can leave traders wiped out extremely quickly. Bagholder: An investor who refuses to let go of a cryptocurrency despite its poor performance, delaying their exit long enough for the coin to eventually become worthless. Bankman-Fried, Sam: Known widely as SBF, Bankman-Fried is the co-founder and former chief executive of the now bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Once the crypto world’s most high-profile executive, a regular lobbyist in Washington DC and with a then net worth of about $26bn, SBF fell from grace with the collapse of his company. He was then charged by the US with multiple crimes, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities and commodities fraud and conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election Commission. Basel Committee on Banking Supervision: The world’s most powerful standards setter for banks. It determines how banks control risks and how much equity they should hold to protect themselves if markets or customers blow up. It has proposed differing digital asset categories for banks wanting to buy and sell crypto for customers or themselves. Banks can treat stock tokens and stablecoins on their balance sheets like existing assets, with some rule modifications. Bitcoin and others would come under a new “conservative” prudential regime, so banks would need to hold at least enough equity to more than cover all potential losses. Binance: The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao. The exchange says it does not have a headquarters, but semi-autonomous units that allow it to operate around the world. However it has clashed with many regulators and in March 2023 the US Securities and Exchange Commission sued both Binance and Zhao, filing a total of 13 charges. They included Binance operating unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers and clearing agencies as well as misrepresenting trading controls and oversight on Binance’s US platform. Binance has said it will fight the suit. Bitcoin: The biggest and original cryptocurrency that launched an entire industry. It was envisaged by its pseudonymous creator (or creators) Satoshi Nakamoto as a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system”. BNB coin: The cryptocurrency of the exchange Binance. It was launched in 2017 with the promise that only 200mn tokens will ever exist. Every quarter, Binance uses a fifth of its profits to destroy already existing coins, in a bid to make them more scarce and in turn, more valuable. The coins can be used to pay for Binance services, to pay trading fees, or for trading — just like Bitcoin and others. Blockchain: A type of distributed ledger, written on open source software. It is a growing database of time-stamped transactions that cannot be altered. Each new transaction is verified by a network of computers and added as a “block” to the chain. You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser. Burning coins: Inflation is one of the enemies of cryptocurrencies. Thus, there is a counterpart to minting new coins: burning them, thereby removing them from circulation. For stablecoins, burning is particularly important to keep the token supply equal to the asset backing they have. Cardano: A blockchain network that can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its own digital currency, Ada. The name honours English mathematician and writer Ada Lovelace, who is viewed as the world’s first software engineer because she created an algorithm in the 19th century. It promises to use less energy than Bitcoin or ethereum because it uses proof-of-stake protocols to verify transactions. It was developed by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of ethereum, who left after a dispute with other fellow co-founders, including Vitalik Buterin. Cardano’s Ada is one of the fastest growing cryptocurrencies, with more people holding it on trading platform eToro than Bitcoin. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs): Proposed digital currencies run by central banks, rather than created by private companies. They would use the same technology but would be backed by reserves. Central bankers have been spurred on by fears that efforts such as Facebook’s proposed cryptocurrency could impact monetary policy, and destabilise financial markets or cross-border money transfers. Coin: A cryptocurrency that lives on its own independent blockchain. Examples include Bitcoin and ethereum. Distinct from a token. Coinbase: The largest US-listed exchange for buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies and tokens. It also allows customers to deposit their crypto assets and lend them out, earning interest far in excess of prevailing bank rates. In 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission sued the San Francisco-based company, arguing it had been violating US securities law for at least four years, by failing to register as a broker, national securities exchange or clearing agency. Coinbase has said it will fight the suit. Cold storage: Storing crypto assets on a computer in a vault, which is not connected to the internet. Many cold storage wallets do not accept as many kinds of cryptocurrencies and are more expensive storage options. Consequently, many traders prefer to use a hot wallet. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) The main US regulator for derivatives. The agency has determined that, in legal terms, virtual currencies like Bitcoin are commodities. That means it has jurisdiction to oversee derivatives that use a digital currency and potentially hand out penalties if there is fraud or manipulation of those derivatives. Cryptocurrency: A currency created digitally, usually by private companies, and named after the cryptographic maths that make it possible. It was conceived in the depths of the financial crisis by Satoshi Nakamoto as a way for people to make electronic payments without going through any financial institutions. Crypto exchange: A venue for buying and selling cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and ethereum. They often also offer loans and custody of assets, and other services that a traditional exchange cannot. Examples of crypto exchanges include Binance, Coinbase, Huobi, Bybit, Kraken, Gemini, Bitfinex and Bitstamp. Crypto mixing- A type of money transfer designed to obscure the audit trails that would normally be available to the public on the digital ledgers that track cryptocurrency moves. In a mixing service customers can deposit tokens such as bitcoin using one wallet address. The funds are then mixed into a single pool containing all users’ funds. When it is drawn out it has a different address, making the owner untraceable. Unsurprisingly, the US thinks such services are ideal vehicles for illicit activity like sanctions busting, money laundering and supporting North Korea’s nuclear programme. DApp: A computer application that runs on a decentralised finance network, such as a distributed ledger. DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation): An organisation whose rules are automated or developed by consensus among the members. It is designed to work unlike a typical corporate structure, where power lies in the hands of an executive or board. Decentralised finance (DeFi): An umbrella term for a collection of cryptoasset projects that aim to do away with a centralised intermediary — like a bank or an exchange — to provide financial services. They use DApps to execute common services like lending, savings accounts and trading coins. Decentralised trading protocol: Sometimes referred to as a decentralised exchange, or DEX. It is a network that allows users to buy and sell digital assets directly with each other, bypassing intermediaries that might impose fees, such as an exchange or clearing house. Automated market makers use smart contracts which can trade 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Older trading networks, such as Uniswap and SushiSwap, are written on ethereum but newer networks may use alternative protocols like Solana or Polkadot. However, some networks may suffer from low liquidity. There is also little recourse for users who find their security hacked and assets stolen. Diem: The yet-to-be launched digital coin by Facebook and previously known as Libra. It has been credited with jolting central banks and regulators into realising that private cryptocurrency initiatives were becoming too big to ignore, and to start on their own CBDCs. The intense scrutiny led Facebook to change the name from Libra and scale back its ambitions in 2020. Digital Currency Group: Venture capital firm which has funded dozens of coins and companies in the digital assets industry, including exchange Coinbase and broker eToro. It owns investment firm Grayscale, trade news site CoinDesk, and is also parent to the crypto-lending unit Genesis, which filed for US bankruptcy protection in early 2023, and left creditors short on at least $3.4bn, after it was toppled in the industry-wide turmoil following the collapse of the FTX exchange. Distributed ledger: A public register of deals shared and replicated by a network of computers. They work together to verify transactions and create an immutable ledger, and do away with the need for a central authority. It is similar to a blockchain but it does not need to have its data structured in blocks. Nor does it need to use proof of work to mine tokens. dogecoin: An alt-coin that purposely began as a joke, to highlight the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies in 2013. It uses a Japanese Shiba Inu dog as its mascot and has surged in popularity and value despite its beginnings. Ethereum: The world’s second most actively-traded cryptocurrency and the token associated with the ethereum blockchain. Ethereum: A developer-run blockchain technology co-founded by Vitalik Buterin, a Canadian-Russian computer science student. Its aim is to make blockchains more useful and revolutionary than simply to serve as a database for transactions. Its technology can hold assets, enables programmers to code functions for buying and selling into smart contracts, and is typically also the building block for most DApps for finance. Fiat currency: A traditional currency backed and regulated by a central bank — such as the US dollar, euro, sterling and yen. Flippening: A term the moment when ethereum overtakes Bitcoin as the biggest and most valuable cryptocurrency. Fork: Developers sometimes disagree on how a blockchain should be run and, if they cannot settle their differences, the ultimate step is to create a fork in the network. One side will use newer software and the existing network will rely on the older version. It means that two incompatible versions of the blockchain emerge, based on different principles and with different user bases. Forks can take place for a number of reasons including concerns over outdated and insecure software, or a need to reverse the log of transactions following a hack, or a need to return investors’ funds to them. FTX: The now bankrupt company was one of the world’s largest and most high-profile cryptocurrency exchanges in its heyday. Founded in 2019, it rose to prominence by enabling investors to trade various digital coins and exchange them for traditional currencies. But it fell into financial difficulty and collapsed. Once valued at $32bn, FTX filed for bankruptcy in 2022, leaving customers short on as much as $8bn of its liabilities. Weeks later US regulators charged the company and several of its senior management with misusing client funds, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The relationship with its associated trading firm Alameda Research, at the time almost entirely owned by co-FTX founder and then-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, also came under scrutiny. FUD: An acronym for “fear, uncertainty and doubt”, used as a dismissive label for negative information about cryptocurrencies — and normally to imply that criticisms of digital assets are invalid or misleading. The Fud label is often applied to critiques focusing on Bitcoin’s environmental impact or the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering. People who spread Fud are called Fudsters. Funding rate: A measure of the direction of traders’ collective positions in crypto. It works in tandem with a perpetual futures contract. The funding rate is designed to bring the price of the futures contract closer to the index it tracks. The rate is based on the difference between the spot market and the futures price. It is expressed as a percentage. If it is above zero, it is described as positive as it shows there is more demand for long futures contracts. If it is below zero, it is described as negative. To balance the positions, traders betting in one direction pay traders who have taken the opposing position. If the funding rate is positive, traders who are long of a token price have to pay those who are short. If sentiment is negative, traders with a short position pay those who have gone long. The payments in either direction continue during a set window, often every eight hours, until the price of the future converges with that of the index again. The payments are based on the notional size of a trader’s position — meaning they can be substantial for highly leveraged bets. Gas Fees: The fees paid by users to compensate for the amount of computing energy needed to verify a transaction on the ethereum network. They are intended to prevent nefarious actors from spamming the network. Prices can rise and fall depending on demand. Users have complained about ethereum’s fees, which can cost anything from $20 — $100, because ethereum is so heavily used. Gemini: An exchange for buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies and tokens set up in 2014 by the Winklevoss twins. Customers can also deposit assets and earn interest far in excess of prevailing bank rates. Governance tokens: Tokens that give holders voting powers on a blockchain protocol. They are mainly used in DeFi projects so systems can remain decentralised and no one party makes the decisions on the project’s future direction. Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust: A fund that operates the world’s most popular Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Have fun staying poor: The ultimate retort from crypto enthusiasts to sceptics — expressing their pity for non-believers. It is usually used to counter criticism of Bitcoin or other digital assets and it implies that sceptics do not understand the full implications of blockchain technology. Hodl: The battle cry of the long-term cryptocurrency holder. Originally a humorous misspelling of ‘hold’ found on a cryptocurrency forum in 2013 and sometimes thought to be an acronym for “Holding On For Dear Life”, the frantic tone associated with its use has struck a chord with the wider crypto community. Hodling is not simply about keeping crypto-investments no matter how low they fall. It also reflects an almost religious belief in the inevitability of a return to profitability and a rejection of both the fickle, unmanly day trader and the myopic, untrustworthy crypto-sceptic. Hot wallet: A virtual wallet to store crypto assets. It is kept online which means it is easier to access and enables users to trade more quickly. But being online makes it more susceptible to being hacked, so some people prefer to keep their assets in cold storage. ICO: Like an initial public offering, an initial coin offering is a tool for fundraising. But the similarities end there. Investors get some of the new currency, as opposed to stock in the company. And, unlike IPOs, ICOs lack any investor protection: they can be set up with just a website, a utopian mission statement and some ad spend. After a surge in popularity in 2017-18, ICOs came under sustained scrutiny from regulators in the US, UK and Europe over the dangers they posed to consumers. In 2019, messaging apps Kik and Telegram were both sued over their ICOs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Laser eyes: A social media meme in which users change or edit their profile pictures to make their eyes look like they emit red laser beams. It denotes a fan of cryptocurrencies, with the light-emitting powers variously interpreted to mean a user has special powers of sight and an iron will to make Bitcoin an instrument of economic empowerment. Layer 2: A secondary network or technology run by a third party and built on top of an existing blockchain to improve its efficiency. For example, some blockchains like Bitcoin and ethereum cannot handle vast quantities of trades at high speed, affecting the users of some DApps. A layer 2 network can handle the bulk of the transaction processing legwork, so the original blockchain can scale. Liquidity pool: A central feature of decentralised trading. Customers do not trade on an order book but against other participants in the pool, who have also filled up the pool with funds that sit on smart contracts. Maximalist: A crypto-purist who believes with unwavering conviction that their preferred coin, be it Bitcoin or Ethereum, is the only one that has value. Memecoin: A cryptocurrency that is associated with a meme or viral online joke. dogecoin is a popular example of a memecoin. Metaverse: A vision of the future internet. An immersive virtual reality world where people will be able to pursue all aspects of life as if in a parallel digital universe. Mining: The act of employing a large network of computers to work together to solve cryptographic calculations that verify cryptocurrency transactions. Typically, one party will solve the puzzle, known as a hash, that creates the next block in the chain. The others will verify it. In return for maintaining the blockchain, miners are rewarded with new tokens for being the first to solve the cryptographic proof. They also collect transaction fees. Mooning, aka Going to the Moon: When the price and trading volume of a cryptocurrency are both soaring. Musk, Elon: One of the world’s most influential cryptocurrency advocates, with the power to raise or drop prices of coins with a single tweet or Saturday evening TV appearance. Sometimes sells electric cars, too. Nakamoto, Satoshi: The pseudonymous creator — or creators — of Bitcoin. The seminal moment was the publication of a whitepaper in 2008, weeks after Lehman Brothers collapsed amid the global financial crisis. NFT: A non-fungible token. A unit of information stored as a token on a blockchain, usually an ethereum blockchain. However, it is not fungible — meaning it cannot be interchanged with another token. That makes the token unique and turns its blockchain into a digital form of provenance. It can only have one owner. Some artists and sellers of collectible memorabilia have begun experimenting with selling NFTs. But owning the token only proves that someone has ownership of the “original” work, and does not necessarily include its copyright or its intellectual property rights. NGMI: “Not Going To Make It” — slang for missing out on the profits of a trade. Its opposite is “GMI”, or Going to Make It. Nocoiner: A sceptic who doesn’t own any cryptocurrency, believes it has little to no value and suspects it might be a Ponzi scheme that will fail. Node: Its definition varies, but is usually understood to mean a physical point on a computer network where an activity takes place. Sometimes, it can be to collect and distribute information; sometimes, it is where transactions on a blockchain are verified. OpenSea: The world’s largest peer-to-peer marketplace for trading NFTs. Oracle: A third party that acts as a bridge between traditional markets and the crypto world. It gathers data from the outside world, such as asset prices, and sends it to a blockchain or distributed ledger. That data can be used in smart contracts for other crypto trading projects. It can also work in reverse, using information in smart contracts in the outside world. PancakeSwap: A decentralised trading protocol based on the Binance blockchain. Customers can exchange Binance tokens. It uses automated market makers to trade assets. Pig butchering: Drawing an unflattering analogy to fattening farm pigs before slaughter, the term refers to a type of cryptocurrency scam that involves befriending or entering into a romantic relationship with the unwitting victim, to gain trust before convincing them to make a sketchy investment. Perpetual futures: Type of futures contract more commonly used in crypto than in conventional markets. The expiration date on a traditional future that tracks the price of oil, gas or stock indices helps link the future to the price of the underlying asset, since the holder typically takes delivery of the asset on that date. Perpetual futures can be held indefinitely as the funding rate mechanism links the futures price with the spot price. Derivatives markets usually have more volume than spot markets, so often provide signals into sentiment and likely short-term moves in the spot market. Private key: The complex password needed to access a virtual currency wallet. Proof-of-stake: A system for mining cryptocurrencies that requires users to stake their coins as collateral to become a verifier on the network. It is largely associated with the ethereum blockchain. Unlike proof-of-work systems, verifiers are chosen at random to create blocks and validate proposed blocks. If they attest to fraudulent blocks, they will lose their staked coins. As no coins are mined, the process should not require vast amounts of computing energy. However, it has been hard to scale and ethereum’s blockchain has struggled to keep up with demand. Critics have argued the system favours richer participants because the more coins a miner owns, the more mining power it has. Proof-of-work Used in mining, it allows one party to prove it has solved the cryptographic puzzle to validate a transaction, while the others verify the work. Its aim is to prevent the same coins being spent twice with two different parties. Largely associated with the Bitcoin blockchain, it has been criticised for its high energy consumption and slow speed. Developers are looking at proof-of-stake mining as a cheaper, faster and less environmentally-damaging alternative. Pyth: A DeFi project and Oracle, built by some of the world’s largest high-speed traders as a “potential game changer” for trading stocks and other assets on blockchain technology. Rekt In the world of gaming, you might shout rekt when you gun down an opponent in Fortnite, the violent and popular video game. In cryptocurrencies, someone is rekt if they suffer a loss as a result of a bad crypto investment. A cryptocurrency that has gone down significantly in value could also be said to be rekt. Rugpull A common method of defrauding investors in the wild west world of DeFi, where anyone can list a coin and compete for investors’ money. Scammers set-up a new coin that promises to be the next big moneymaking opportunity. After attracting investors, usually via chat rooms or other social media channels, and convincing enough of them to put money into the projects, the developers of the coin then vanish into thin (decentralised) air. Security token: Similar to the securities that are traded on a stock or bond market but ownership is recorded on a blockchain rather than in a central depository. The tokens often promise a share in future profits or repayments. Regulators around the world usually regard them as in their regulatory jurisdiction. Securities and Exchange Commission: The US securities regulator. Its jurisdiction over crypto markets is limited but does regulate digital assets securities. The SEC chair, Gary Gensler, has called on legislators to give it the power to regulate crypto exchanges. Sharding: Splitting a network into separate but linked ledgers, so it can reduce the strain on each node in the network by no longer requiring it to validate every transaction. Saylor, Michael: Chief executive of MicroStrategy, a software company that has taken the unusual step of buying thousands of Bitcoins. In 2020, he tweeted that Bitcoin was “a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom.” Silbert, Barry: Entrepreneur, early investor in the crypto industry, and founder of Digital Currency Group. A Bitcoin whale. Smart contract: A computer program that can contain financial assets and be coded with the ability to execute actions by itself, if certain conditions are met. That could include transferring funds or sending notifications. Smart contracts play a crucial role in decentralised trading protocols. Stablecoins: Cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, usually the world’s biggest and most stable currencies. They act as crypto-native dollars and a bridge between crypto and traditional financial worlds. They also allow traders to more easily convert traditional currencies into cryptocurrencies for trading. The coins can be lent as collateral for trading, or to generate high yields in the form of interest. They are supposed to have a fixed price and be backed by reserves at all times, allowing users to redeem them. However, critics have questioned where some stablecoins keep their reserves and whether the assets can be quickly recovered and redeemed. The two biggest stablecoin operators are Tether and USDC, run by Circle. A few stablecoins are backed by other cryptocurrencies or baskets of other cryptocurrencies. They use algorithms to buy and sell in order to keep themselves fully backed. But these algorithmic stablecoins can collapse if anything happens to the cryptocurrencies to which they are pegged. They remain a small part of the market. Solana: A blockchain protocol that can handle smart contracts and claims faster speeds and lower transaction costs than ethereum. Staking: A protocol that aims to boost asset owners’ earnings. Users lock their crypto in their wallet but give permission for a third party, often an exchange, to stake their crypto on DeFi projects that offer interest or yield farming. The barriers to staking are quite high and users normally need to hold a lot of a particular cryptocurrency first. Binance and Coinbase both offer staking. Tether: The largest and most controversial stablecoin, with over 60bn tokens in circulation. It is nominally pegged to the US dollar and says all its tokens are backed by dollars, one-for-one. It plays an important role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, because its tokens are used by investors who want to leverage their returns on more volatile cryptocurrencies. However, the New York attorney-general ruled it had deceived clients over its reserves after it suffered a serious loss of funds when its payment processors’ accounts were frozen. Tether did not admit to any wrongdoing, but paid a settlement of $18.5mn Its self-declared commercial paper (a form of debt security) holdings would make it one of the world’s largest investors in the market, according to JPMorgan. Token: A unit built on an existing blockchain and intended to be an incentive or reward for developing other projects on that blockchain. The best known example is ERC20, a token on the ethereum blockchain, which has built other digital assets and currencies. Distinct from a coin. Trustless: A central tenet of the crypto industry. Computing systems like blockchain eliminate the need for a trusted third party, like a bank or clearing house, to check or execute transactions. Uniswap: A decentralised trading protocol built on the ethereum blockchain. It is also the name of the company set up by Hayden Adams, the developer behind Uniswap. Whale: Much like their marine counterparts, cryptocurrency whales are reclusive creatures whose activity has an effect on the whole ecosystem. They are individuals or institutions that hold a large proportion of the coins of a particular cryptocurrency. A rule of thumb is that a whale owns more than 5 per cent of a given coin. That makes them key actors in the price of the asset. Holding the asset can keep it out of circulation, boosting its price. Selling can cause the price to dip, especially if the volume floods the market. In an unregulated market, it invites accusations they are manipulating the market. Few whales are known because identities are anonymous, but they can be recognised by the internet addresses controlled by a single network participant. Known bitcoin whales include the Winklevoss twins. Whitepaper: Part marketing tool, part technical documentation and part vision statement, a whitepaper sets out how a cryptocurrency works, what it is trying to do and the creator’s projections for profitability. Whitepapers have often been associated with the ICO craze. However, whitepapers are produced by almost all cryptocurrency companies as standard procedure. The most famous was written by Satoshi Nakamoto. Winklevoss, Cameron and Tyler: Twin brothers who were early and vocal backers of Bitcoin when it was still a hobby for enthusiasts in the early 2010s. Regarded as Bitcoin whales because they bought large holdings when the currency was worth only cents. They rose to pre-crypto fame because of their claims that Mark Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook from them. Wrapped token: A cryptocurrency token pegged to the value of another token. They have identical values but enable one token to lives on a Blockchain that it was not issued on. For example, Bitcoin and ethereum blockchains cannot talk to each other; but a wrapped token acts as a bridge between the two. Yield farming: The practice of looking through the DeFi world for best yields available from more obscure projects and coins. These opportunities can advertise interest rates as high as several thousand per cent to pull in digital cash but can also be short lived.

The recent rise of NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, is helping to verify the provenance and authenticity of digital art, something that was previously difficult because digital works are easily copied. New companies are springing up to build platforms and assure buyers that the pieces they buy are genuine and can be tracked securely. One Piece, a megahit manga series of pirate tales that has appeared in a weekly magazine since 1997, published its 100th volume in September. In all, the series has sold more than 490m copies, which has previously set a record for the most printed comic series by a single author. To mark these achievements, publisher Shueisha has selected 10 classic scenes from the series to turn into luxury prints. They are priced at nearly ¥500,000 ($4,500) each. A lottery was held for the right to purchase one of up to 20 limited-edition prints of each illustration. The lottery, which ran from September 25 to October 3, attracted more than 3,000 entries in the first two days. Not only are the pieces printed by a skilled artisan on 100 per cent cotton paper, their authenticity is also guaranteed with a blockchain transaction history. Each print comes with a paper certificate with an IC tag that allows the owner to see when the artwork has changed hands by reading the tag with a smartphone.

He believes that registering information on the artworks’ owners will “help original manga illustrations raise their artistic reputation, even abroad”, as many entries for the One Piece illustration lottery have come from Asia, Europe and Oceania, Okamoto said. As manga artists often illustrate for weekly publications, little effort has been made to preserve their original drawings. There are artists who decline to take their original illustrations back from publishers; other drawings are gathering dust in storerooms. “Preserving these mangas for the next generation is necessary,” Okamoto said, adding that he started the project as a way to make use of a digital manga archive that he launched in 2007. He estimates the domestic market for digital comics at about ¥350bn, which puts it on par with the broader art market. “Manga can create a new form of art, instead of being categorised under an existing art framework,” Okamoto added. The blockchain technology used for the Shueisha Manga-Art Heritage project is provided by Startbahn, a start-up founded in 2014 by contemporary artist Taihei Shii. Startbahn issues the certificate, which also contains information on when and where the artwork was exhibited, preserved and restored, as well as which auction house it was traded through. Companies, including an auction organiser and an art ecommerce service, use Startbahn’s database, using the blockchain to confirm the authenticity of artworks. Shii, alarmed at seeing young artists being forced to sell their works cheaply and unable to make a living, came up with the idea of creating a platform that would allow artists to recoup some of the value of their artworks after they are resold by collectors who purchase them from galleries. “It is the same logic as registering real estate . . . The property you buy is not fake and belongs to you, but it isn’t quite like that in the art market,” said Shii. “And this uncertainty of authenticity has made the art market unstable.” One critical area of concern for art buyers is whether a piece is genuine. Except in cases where a collector buys a work directly from a gallery, there has been no way, until recently, for a buyer to verify the authenticity of a piece once it is resold. Paper records can easily be altered or forged. Shii believed a reliable mechanism to authenticate pieces was needed to expand the market — and to broaden the definition of art itself. Startbahn, together with Japanese advertising agency Dentsu, in July began offering a consulting service to companies looking to do business in NFTs. NFTs are digital assets used to track data on everything from items in online games to trading cards. The uniqueness of these items is verified using blockchain technology. The tokens, which can be bought, sold and traded in the same way as physical assets, created a buzz in March when digital artist Beeple sold an NFT piece at Christie’s for $69m, making it the third-most valuable artwork sold at auction by a living artist. A new wave has developed around generative NFT art, which randomly creates pieces using an algorithm. Art Blocks, a platform dedicated to generative NFT art, racked up sales of more than $95m over one week in late September, according to nonfungible.com, a website that tracks NFTs. Sales were three times higher last month. “Generative NFTs help to exponentially multiply the amount of art that you can create as an artist,” said Fungi, a New York-based artist, explaining the popularity of a new type of art in which neither the collectors nor even the artists themselves know what works will result. “As an artist today, you have to be prolific to be at the forefront of art because you have to be turning out products all the time” using platforms from TikTok to Instagram, she said. “That can be exhausting for artists . . . But generative art allows you to create [a piece] using just a few traits.” Fungi is also co-founder of Shroom Chan, a generative NFT art project led by women that aims to help anime creators in Japan and elsewhere in Asia. It is setting up a platform in October that will not only allow creators to make anime characters with just a few clicks, but also let them buy and sell images to make money. Japanese-style anime shows are drawing the attention of media giants such as Netflix, which said in March that it planned to launch 40 new anime titles this year. But in Japan and elsewhere, anime creators are struggling to make a living despite long hours of work. “I think it’s just really ridiculous that from this industry, which nowadays is valued at $25bn, people are making a lot of money. But is the money going to the actual creators? I’d say it’s not really happening,” said Kinoko, another co-founder of Shroom Chan. “We want to flip that equation and help these underpaid Asian creatives.” A version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on October 02. ©2021 Nikkei Inc.

Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec (CDPQ), the US$300bn Canadian pension fund manager, on Tuesday joined WestCap, the fund set up by former Airbnb and Blackstone executive Laurence Tosi, in leading a funding round for Celsius Network — a crypto lending platform that has been targeted by US state regulators who say it has breached securities laws. Alexandre Synnett, executive vice-president and chief technology officer at CDPQ, said he expected that taking a stake in Celsius despite the regulatory pressure might appear unusual. “We knew from the beginning of this investment that we would have questions,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times. “The conviction that we have is around the blockchain technology,” he added. “In a positive way, I think it will change the way the financial services are interacting.” The move by the public pension manager to join Celsius’ $400m equity raising, which valued the company at $3bn, represents a fresh signal that money managers are willing to tolerate regulatory clouds hanging over many crypto businesses in order to tap what they see as a crucial investment opportunity in digital assets. But Synnett cautioned that there were limits to CDPQ’s enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies. He said the fund was focused on making “opportunistic” investments in “diamond in the rough” early-stage companies leveraging blockchain technology, as part of its $40bn exposure to financial services worldwide. “This is a small diversification play. We are not going to go all out on digital assets,” he said, adding that CDPQ would not consider allocating funds directly into digital assets. “Bitcoin? No, absolutely not,” he said. The backing from big investors comes a month after Celsius was drawn into a broad US regulatory crackdown on crypto companies that offer customers yields on deposits of digital assets. State authorities in Texas, New Jersey, Alabama and Kentucky said Celsius’ yield-bearing accounts amounted to an unregistered securities offering. Celsius, founded in 2017, offers its customers interest of as much as 17 per cent on deposits of cryptocurrencies. The company pays the interest in crypto, including in its own token.

New York-based ConsenSys develops and invests in projects built on the ethereum distributed ledger, a rival to bitcoin that can be used to create financial services apps and other automated software programmes. ConsenSys announced in April it had raised $65m from JPMorgan, Mastercard, UBS and other investors, in what the company called a “formation round”. It declined to comment on the fundraising. The financing would mark an important milestone for the seven-year-old company led by ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, who has weathered several public missteps in his attempts to capitalise on blockchain technology. Lubin has made staff cuts of more than 10 per cent at least twice, and ConsenSys restructured last year to split off its investment arm into a separate entity. Investors have poured money into digital assets this year as the soaring price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies attract developers and new users to the fast-growing but risky sector. Venture capitalists have invested $20.7bn in cryptocurrency start-ups so far this year, according to PitchBook data, an increase of more than 160 per cent from the previous record in 2018. Recommended Lubin has mostly self-funded ConsenSys with his personal holdings of ether, the digital asset associated with ethereum. MetaMask, an app developed by ConsenSys that is a popular gateway to decentralised finance programs, has grown rapidly as more people experiment with cryptocurrencies. Since October 2020, MetaMask has facilitated more than $8.9bn of trading through a feature that allows users to swap pairs of digital tokens, according to data on the cryptocurrency analysis site Dune Analytics. MetaMask takes a 0.875 per cent fee on each trade, translating to more than $78m in revenues during the same period. ConsenSys has projected that annualised revenues from MetaMask could increase to $1bn within the next year, said one person briefed on the numbers. MetaMask has more than 10m monthly users, the company said last month. Several other start-ups that develop apps on ethereum have recently attracted large valuations from venture capitalists. The development team behind the popular cryptocurrency-based video game Axie Infinity on Tuesday said it had raised $152m of funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, valuing the company at $3bn. Ether has gained more than 920 per cent in the past year, compared with a more than 400 per cent rise in the price of bitcoin.

A glitch in some little-tested software code left the London-based exchange wearing the charge when a user made an unremarkable $100,000 deposit. On the blockchain, transactions are instantaneous, irreversible and anonymous. Market participants have no recourse to a deposit scheme or regulator to try to recoup funds. This incident highlights the vulnerabilities that implies. But within days, the recipient paid it all back. To true believers in the emerging arena of decentralised finance - or DeFi - the return of the fee shows a generous ethos a world away from Wall Street and the City. “In the decentralised finance space there is a real desire across teams and communities to build and co-operate for mutual benefit,” said Will Harborne, chief executive of DeversiFi. “But having survived Monday I wouldn’t personally recommend to anyone else that they rely on the goodwill of strangers on the internet to return their $24m. “If we had not been able to recover the funds [that] would have presented a major challenge for us as a company,” he added. Numerical flubs and human errors -- collectively known as ‘fat fingers’ -- are a fact of life in all areas of old and new finance. In traditional markets, some errors are reversed over a handshake; some are not. Infamous past examples include the transaction that wiped 80 per cent off the value of conglomerate Jardine Matheson in Singapore in 2019. Deutsche Bank once wired $6bn to a hedge fund client by mistake. More recently, Citigroup sent $900m of its own money to creditors of cosmetics group Revlon. DeversiFi’s faulty bill shows crypto, where “code is law”, is equally vulnerable to costly slip-ups that have no formal resolution mechanism. “Right now, most of the users of DeFi are true believers in the technology and its potential, and so confidence may persist regardless of these events,” said Hilary Allen, professor of law at the American University Washington College of Law. “But if DeFi is more broadly adopted by people less committed to the technology, confidence will become more vulnerable - and the potential for panics that can come with damaged confidence should give us pause,” she added. Harborne’s company acts as a network for buyers and sellers to trade digital tokens automatically without going through a centralised exchange. It aims to skip intermediaries like banks and exchanges and also perform checks and reconciliation on transactions. Transferring deposits generates a fee, known in industry jargon as a “gas fee”, because users must compensate miners for the amount of computing energy they need to verify a transaction on blockchain. But this particular transaction, through a wallet controlled by exchange Bitfinex, generated gas fees of $23.7m, six orders of magnitude larger than intended. The only option was to persuade the miner to pay it back. In its analysis of the incident, DeversiFi disclosed that it could see, through the blockchain, that the recipient was one of the top 10 miners of the cryptocurrency ethereum and had periodically deposited Ether tokens at another exchange, Binance. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click “This led us to hope that although they were anonymous they might have significant holdings and not be tempted to keep the funds of someone who had been the victim of extreme misfortune,” said Harborne. DeversiFi said it contacted Binance, which it said passed on the platform’s email addresses to the miner. Within hours the money was on its way back to DeversiFi. Tim Swanson, founder of technology advisory firm Post Oak Labs, said the refund suggests miners are generally inclined to help with rebates. “Miners want to be perceived as good actors so they can earn more on other investments,” he said. That ethos may not endure. Allen pointed out that the consequences for losing money are much greater. “This is why finance is so highly regulated. At a minimum, regulatory structures that require developers to test for bugs in their DeFi applications are needed.” Without a safeguard, a polite request is one of the few options available. Compound, another DeFi project, said on Friday that it had accidentally handed tokens worth $90m to its users. With the assets gone and without the option to track down a single miner, its owner publicly threatened to report the new owners to the US tax authorities, before realising the shortcomings of the plan. “This was a bone-headed approach,” chief executive Robert Leshner tweeted. “That’s on me . . .

From the press release: Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), the No. 1 U.S. retailer and world’s largest grocer, is pleased to announce a major partnership with Litecoin. The eCommerce giant intends to give its millions of shoppers across the world an opportunity to seamlessly make payments with cryptocurrencies. Bullish for Litecoin right? Well, we’re not quite sure. First, because the press release has not appeared on either Walmart’s website, nor in the form of an 8-K on its SEC page. Second, because the email address given to contact Walmart’s chief marketing officer, William White, has a domain of www.walmart-corp.com which, if you visit it, doesn’t seem to belong to the big box retailer. Chuck that URL into registration data site ICANN, and you’ll also see the site was created on August 17. Then, of course, there’s the fact that Mr White’s email address does not appear at the bottom of any of Walmart’s most recent press releases. Still, it could be true. Walmart might have had a communication breakdown with the good folks at Litecoin Foundation, and forgot to co-ordinate on press release timings. So we called Walmart but its automated answering machine only directed us to its journalist contact page. Which, of course, we filled out. We’ll update the story either way if we hear back. FT Alphaville also contacted the Litecoin Foundation. But given Litecoin’s official Twitter account just deleted its tweet about the news — causing the coin to retreat to a small rise of just 7 per cent after being up 22 per cent — we think the answer is pretty obvious.

Interest in the ethereum blockchain has soared over the past year, as developers have turned to it to create a wave of decentralised finance projects, known as DeFi, and unique digital tokens called NFTs. The rise of new applications like these — among the first running on a public blockchain — have already created what supporters claim is a powerful network effect, as increasing activity brings more and more developers to ethereum. That could make it the platform of choice for what has become known as Web 3.0, where a series of decentralised apps could one day challenge Big Tech’s offerings. “Sixty to 70 per cent of the industry runs on ethereum. It’s very sticky,” said Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, one of a growing number of companies that operate on top of ethereum. As a result, the price of ethereum’s currency, known as ether or eth, which is used to pay for the computing power needed to run the blockchain, has jumped ninefold. At around $350bn, the outstanding tokens on ethereum are now worth more than 40 per cent as much as all the bitcoin in issue, more than double the proportion of a year ago. But there remain fundamental questions over whether ethereum, which is heavily behind schedule with a complex set of technical upgrades, will be able to compete with nimbler rivals, and whether any consensus will emerge on its long-term role as the crypto world evolves. “There isn’t a shared narrative in the ethereum ecosystem,” said Avichal Garg at Electric Capital, an investment firm in San Francisco. “Is it a commodity like oil, digital gold, a better bitcoin?” Until the investment world decides on an answer, the price of ethereum’s tokens, is likely to be volatile, he and others warned. The rally in the price of eth has been powered by two hopes. One is that ethereum has entered a new phase in which the number of tokens in circulation will grow far more slowly than it has in the past, or even shrink. For financial speculators, that has raised the possibility that its tokens will become more like bitcoin. The supply of tokens has already been reduced following a change last month to the way transactions are validated on the network. Some of the eth tokens that were previously paid in fees to miners who validate transactions are now destroyed, or “burnt”. Another big step could come late this year or early next, when the blockchain is due to move away from its current “proof of work” system, which relies on miners committing their computing power to the network in exchange for rewards. Instead, it will be based on “proof of stake”, in which validators participate by lodging some of their eth holdings. Along with the environmental benefits that come from cutting processing demands, the move has big monetary implications. A proof of stake chain was launched to run in parallel late last year. Some 6 per cent of the supply of eth has already been lodged there by holders to back transactions, earning holders an annual return of up to 5 per cent — an early sign, according to the bulls, of how much eth will be taken out of circulation once the full transition is completed. Until now, eth has been viewed as the crypto equivalent of oil, said Ninos Mansor at Arrington XRP Capital, a crypto investment firm — a commodity that is consumed to fuel the digital economy but where there is no cap on supply. But a big reduction in supply of the tokens could change that, making it more attractive to investors interested in a deflationary asset, he added. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click Unlike bitcoin, however, ethereum was not founded on a clear monetary vision or with an upper ceiling to the number of tokens that can be created. Vitalik Buterin, ethereum’s founder and lead evangelist, has said only that it will adapt to whatever needs its users have for it. That has left open the possibility of further changes in how tokens are created, and hence the long-term supply of eth, said Mansor. The second hope behind this year’s price spike is that ethereum will be a core part of the infrastructure because of its “smart contracts” function, software code that automatically executes when certain conditions are met and which enables peer-to-peer decentralised finance projects, for example. Yet the network’s capacity is severely limited, and a series of proposals to relieve the pressure is years behind schedule. The network’s maximum capacity of only around 15 transactions per second has meant that, at busy times, the so-called “gas” fees to use it have been bid up to high levels, squeezing out all but the most high-value transactions. That is one reason that financial applications have come to play a much bigger role on the network this year, according to Buterin. Meanwhile, newer blockchains with greater processing capacity, including Avalanche, Solana and Cardano, have sprung up. “What you’re seeing globally is a rush to scale — and there aren’t that many that are scalable,” said Emin Gün Sirer, founder of Avalanche, which last week disclosed that it had raised $230m through a recent sale of tokens. The new blockchains have been heavily backed but are yet to prove themselves. The price of tokens on the Solana blockchain has more than quadrupled since the start of August as it has become the platform for the sale of new collections of NFTs such as the Degenerate Ape Academy. But a technical failure earlier this month meant the network suffered a 17-hour outage. While ethereum’s limitations have provided an opening for newer blockchains, the network’s supporters claim its early lead in smart contracts will be unassailable. Recommended The hopes rest heavily on the large number of developers who are already creating applications using its technology. Solidity, the blockchain’s programming language, has become as much a part of life for crypto developers as javascript is among web developers, said Nailwal, the co-founder of Polygon. To attract more developers, most of the new blockchains let them run their applications in “ethereum virtual machines”, creating bridges back to the ethereum blockchain and maintaining the demand for eth to secure transactions in their applications. Other mechanisms that are starting to bring relief from the transaction processing bottleneck include so-called “layer two” networks like Polygon. These run on top of ethereum and take some of the strain, for instance acting as aggregators that process transactions on their own networks before batching them up and lodging them on the ethereum blockchain in a single transaction. According to supporters, today’s layer two networks contain the seeds of a wider technology industry that is starting to take shape, with ethereum at its heart. “We believe it will be a multi-chain world — but on ethereum,” said Nailwal. “There should eventually be space for all applications,” said Dan Finlay at Metamask, which offers wallets on ethereum and claims more than 10m users. But he added: “We’re still at a stage where a lot of scaling strategies are being tried at once. I don’t think any of them has been validated yet.” Ethereum itself, meanwhile, has embarked on a series of changes to its own network.

Another involves “sharding” the network — splintering it into 64 separate but linked ledgers, reducing the strain on each node in the network by no longer requiring it to validate every transaction. Buterin says he is also working on other changes to the underlying protocol to reduce the load on nodes, and says he is optimistic that within two years some of these initiatives will have greatly increased capacity. “The success of the currency will rely on ethereum opening up more,” said Jack O’Holleran, CEO of Skale, a network that operates on top of ethereum. “It will become the global settlement layer” for decentralised applications of all kinds, he and others predict. But with ethereum’s long-term role still a matter of debate, investors like Garg warn, the cryptocurrency markets could be overdue for a reversal that will see bitcoin vault back to unquestioned dominance.

The deal will allow Mastercard to “differentiate its card and real-time payments infrastructure” by helping its customers to comply with regulations as they increasingly “build their own virtual asset offerings”, the company said on Thursday. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. The ability to hold most cryptocurrencies anonymously has made them attractive to criminals that are looking to launder dirty funds. However, every transaction is typically recorded on an immutable blockchain, leaving a visible trail for researchers. CipherTrace is one of an increasing number of crypto forensics start-ups that use sophisticated technology coupled with human intelligence to analyse blockchain transactions, helping companies and law enforcement monitor suspicious activity and map out the crypto-criminal ecosystem. The deal comes after Mastercard announced in February that it would start supporting selected cryptocurrencies directly on its network this year, following in the footsteps of fintech rivals PayPal and Square. Meanwhile, US regulators are increasingly circling the growing but loosely regulated industry. “Digital assets have the potential to reimagine commerce, from everyday acts like paying and getting paid to transforming economies, making them more inclusive and efficient,” said Ajay Bhalla, president of cyber and intelligence at Mastercard.

Our aim is to build upon the complementary capabilities of Mastercard and CipherTrace to do just this.” Founded in 2015, CipherTrace was initially funded by the US government’s Department of Homeland Security and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and is backed by Silicon Valley investors, including WestWave Capital and Third Point Ventures. According to its website, it has 150 customers, including banks, cryptocurrency exchanges, agencies and regulators. Rivals include New York’s Chainalysis, which raised $100m at a more than $4bn valuation earlier this year, and London-based Elliptic, whose investors include Wells Fargo. “This is a real coup for the legitimisation of the industry in financial services,” Dave Jevans, CipherTrace’s chief executive, told the Financial Times.

As a masters student at London’s Imperial College, the American orchestrated a field study of office workers and energy consumption. He found that automating light switches was more effective and cheaper than relying on the last person leaving a room to turn off the lights. In his current role at global non-profit organisation Energy Web, he has gone even more high-tech: engineering a certification system for digital assets that rely on clean energy. “I come at this purely from an environmental point of view,” he says. “Blockchain forms a key part of the clean energy transition.” But asset managers with an environmental, social and governance brief may think differently. Blockchain is best known as the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin — assets whose carbon footprint and utility in illicit transactions put them beyond the ESG pale. That may change, however, as — thanks to the efforts of Miller and others — blockchain percolates into more areas of the economy. Recommended Cryptocurrencies owe their dubious environmental reputation to the huge amounts of electricity, often coal-generated, that computers need to create them. And because they are not subject to government regulation, they are a favoured medium of exchange for criminals and terrorists: the hackers who closed down Colonial Pipeline in the US in May, for example, received their ransom in bitcoin. European asset manager Candriam said earlier this year that “cryptocurrencies have a long way to go to satisfy ESG criteria”, citing money laundering and the environmental impact of “mining” coins (performing the complex calculations that generate them). Yet Miller is at pains to emphasise the difference between speculative currencies and the technology that supports not only them but other, more innocuous digital assets — such as the supposedly tout-proof tickets sold for the 2018 football World Cup. Central banks are also using the technology. Recommended “There is a risk of conflating blockchain technology and crypto,” he says. “Helping energy companies manage their grid better is very different from [cryptocurrency] Dogecoin.” Energy Web runs just such a grid project with an Australian electricity group. Last month, UBS Wealth Management said that, as well as healthcare and sustainability, “the digital transformation of sectors ranging from transport to manufacturing and financial services creates opportunities”. In a paper evaluating cryptocurrency investments, the wealth manager’s analysts recommended that “investors focus on companies exposed to the evolution of distributed ledger technology, rather than engaging directly in cryptos”. Distributed ledgers — of which blockchain is one type — are systems that rely on the collective agreement of users to verify transactions. Investor scepticism on ESG points to a maturing market Boards face growing pressure from ESG petitions Regulators put ESG fund names under the microscope Climate change drives push for greener pensions Bond funds wrestle with human rights dilemma Sustainable investors ponder Chinese opportunities Does it pay to steer clear of sin stocks? More recently, the technology has evolved in a way that cuts down on the number of users needed to approve transactions, making these systems more energy efficient. A recent study by University College London found that some new distributed ledger technologies — using the so-called “proof-of-stake” protocol rather than the older “proof-of-work” method — were up to three times more efficient than earlier systems. “Our work shows that [newer blockchains] . . . could even undercut the energy needs of traditional central payment systems, raising hopes that distributed ledger technologies can contribute positively to combating climate change,” the paper concluded. Further impetus may come from the Crypto Climate Accord, which aims to decarbonise the crypto industry by 2030 (and which Miller played a key part in founding). Crypto diehards also point to the fact that the carbon footprint of bitcoin mining is falling, especially since China this year banned private cryptocurrencies and shut down huge mining operations. Distributed ledger technologies can help combat climate change The impact is already showing up in data. In May, the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index estimated that bitcoin’s global electricity consumption was about the same as Sweden’s. This month, it is on a par with Kyrgyzstan’s — a significantly lower level. And conventional assets have issues of their own. “It could be argued that there is a much bigger but more subtle problem with fiat money as it pertains to the environment,” say analysts at Deutsche Bank in a recent report. Central bank-backed currencies, they argue, are “the ultimate tool in bringing forward consumption from tomorrow to today”, referring to national policymakers’ ability to print money through quantitative easing. Still, there are significant risks around cryptocurrencies, especially for responsible investors. The use of digital coins in illicit activities remains rife. Chainalysis, a crypto monitoring company, says bitcoin remains attractive for criminals “due to its pseudonymous nature and the ease with which it allows users to instantly send funds anywhere in the world, despite its transparent and traceable design”. Recommended Nevertheless, there are some hopeful signs for crypto fans. Chainalysis found that, in 2019, around $21.4bn worth of transfers were due to illicit activity, representing 2.1 per cent of all cryptocurrency transactions. Last year, such activities had fallen to about $10bn worth of transactions, or 0.34 per cent of the total. Many continue to believe that, ultimately, cryptocurrencies will fade out after crashing and burning, due to their speculative nature and lack of inherent value. Regulation and central bank digital currencies are also threats. “Bitcoin is a video game,” Jan Kregel, an economist and director of research at the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College in New York tells the FT. “There is potential for the crypto world to blow up and cause a bigger crisis than subprime.” The technology behind it, however, is probably here to stay.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Eva Szalay","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-10-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/9c5a831f-4c3a-457f-b36e-950ba3a23b80","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fb721a98c-2eea-446b-9052-b4fadea36377.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How London became a crypto-art capital","INTRO":"Its money, talent and tech have enabled blockchain think-tanks and galleries selling NFTs to flourish","DETAILED_CONTENT":"One of the more creative disruptions accelerated by the pandemic has been the explosion of interest in crypto art, or art turned into tokens on the blockchain, both as an asset class and as a global cultural trend. The former can be put down to the boom in cryptocurrencies, the latter to a year’s worth of solitary confinement making the digital frame almost our default experience of images. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are the digital collectibles which have resulted from this shift; they can be linked to art, tickets and other real-world assets. Even though this world is digital, geography does still matter — and London has been at the forefront. Its role is less as a site of exchange — the majority of NFT marketplaces are hosted from New York or Silicon Valley — than as an engine of cultural creation, validation and innovation, alongside cities such as Berlin. Despite the recent exodus of labour across the wider economy, London still benefits from the wealth, global connections and absence of oppressive institutions that have fuelled its contemporary art, tech and media scenes since the 1990s. Robert Alice, an artist and curator based in London, collaborated with Sotheby’s last June on “Natively Digital”, an auction of NFTs that combined “old masters” of the scene such as Simon Denny and Anna Ridler with emerging crypto artists such as Fvckrender and Mad Dog Jones. For Alice, “London has long had support and curatorial interest in institutional and grassroots digital arts programmes such as Arebyte, the Barbican and 180 The Strand. These spaces, plus the increasing presence of mainstream crypto companies in London, have led to a diverse presence of artists, collectors and technologists that places London at the forefront of crypto art.” Invention is thriving in the shadow of necessity, says Rebecca Edwards, curator at Arebyte, a gallery which works with immersive or multimedia installations in physical and digital spaces. It is growing, she says, “in part because of recent cuts to art and culture in general. Artists are turning to alternative ways to fund, sell and make art and this undoubtedly includes cryptocurrency, NFTs and the blockchain.” For Arebyte’s founder, Nimrod Vardi, it is precisely London’s inchoate tech-art landscape “that gives space for smaller organisations that are more fluid and quick to respond”. The city has so far relied on an eclectic mix of early adopters from all across town: from Annka Kultys Gallery in east London to Gazelli Art House in Mayfair to Furtherfield in the north of the city. The Decentralised Arts Lab (Decal), run by Furtherfield, epitomises the success of leaner, community-facing organisations in championing the blockchain as a more progressive ecosystem. Its director, Ruth Catlow, thinks Furtherfield has paved the way for critical and creative experimentation with network technologies through its 2017 publication, Artists Re:Thinking the Blockchain, and its DAOWO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation with Others) initiative, which “seeks to produce a commons for arts in the network age”. Catlow says: “This is then turbocharged by London’s status as a financial centre and its rich connections with the artistic, technical and activist communities of the Berlin scene.” For Bernadine Bröcker Wieder, whose company Vastari co-organised inaugural Christie’s Art+Tech Summit in 2018, developments are still largely limited to the private sector. “While the Serpentine’s R\u0026D Platform has been doing very important thought leadership,” she says, “traditional museum institutions have not been particularly active in the crypto art conversation.” That has, however, started to change, with the British Museum now selling NFTs of more than 200 works by Japanese artist Hokusai to coincide with its new exhibition Hokusai: The Great Picture Book of Everything. London’s galleries and auction houses have also been quick off the mark. Christie’s is currently offering five works by Nigerian artist Osinachi as part of a collaboration with the 1-54 contemporary African art fair, and gallery Unit London has just launched Institut as “the first art-world-led NFT . . . platform”, aiming to bridge the divide between crypto art and the “legacy” market. Its inaugural exhibition, NFTism: No Fear in Trying, curated by Kenny Schachter, was hosted across Unit’s Covent Garden space and in the virtual world of the “metaverse”, featuring works by Seth Armstrong, Yuma Yanagisawa and IX Shells, the highest-selling female NFT artist. For Unit’s co-founder Joe Kennedy, “bringing works into the physical space of the gallery is key to demystifying NFTs and moving the conversation from sales and commerce to the art form itself.” Sales of NFTs assuage the art world’s traditional problems of provenance, ownership and record-keeping. Verisart is the first company to certify art and collectibles on the blockchain, recognising the importance of reliable provenance and a transparent record of ownership to the NFT as a tradeable commodity. Its co-founder and chief executive, Robert Norton, formerly of Saatchi Art, sees London thriving as a cultural capital: “London is well positioned to capitalise on the NFT zeitgeist, both through venture capital and the kinds of cross-collaboration between art and tech, fashion and music that are so central to driving interest in NFTs.” Whether Institut, Verisart and others can bring down the firewall preserving the old art-world order is unclear. What is not in doubt is the growing drive towards digital collectibles in an age of dwindling physical resources.

His name is Kouros, but he could be a waiter in a West End café or a gym-obsessed banker over in the City of London, because large parts of his shoulders and back are obscured by an enormous, psychedelic tattoo. “Kouros” is the work of Fabio Viale, an Italian sculptor who takes fine stone, chisels it into replicas of classical statues, then inks tattoos on their marble flesh. He has adorned the neck of Michelangelo’s “David” with wings, and the shoulders of the “Venus de Milo” with flowers. Viale’s work may not be to older collectors’ taste, but it has been exhibited at galleries and art fairs all over the world. “Viale really resonates with the millennial generation,” says Elio D’Anna, co-founder of Artcels, the online art investment platform behind the exhibition at Hofa Gallery. (After exhibiting in London in the spring “Kouros” travelled to the Greek island of Mykonos for another show.) Also at Hofa were a glossed-porcelain Jeff Koons “Balloon Rabbit”, a Yoshitomo Nara woodcut and relief prints by the cult African-American artist Nina Chanel Abney, along with a couple of works by Banksy — signed screen prints of “Girl with Balloon” and “Grin Reaper”. But this is not a conventional exhibition. On offer are not the works themselves but a chance to make money from art in a new way. It works like a traditional art fund, the difference being that proof of ownership is recorded on the blockchain. Artcels even launched its own Swiss-based cryptocurrency, Artem, last year to facilitate trades on its platform. An initial 320 shares in the fund — called Millennials — were released in April at a price of £1,000 each in the form of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. These are lines of code locked into the blockchain, an encrypted record of ownership; each token is unique to the share it represents. The fund gives wealthy young investors a way to buy and own shares in instantly recognisable works by bankable, international artists of their own generation — but using currencies and forms that older generations are unlikely to, and possibly do not trust or even understand. Critics of NFTs may distrust the novelty of the form and its intangible nature, but fans see NFTs as secure — in that they cannot be copied — and more easily tradeable than units in traditional art funds. Many young investors are using the fund to add art to their portfolios for the first time. “The gain is the diversification, buying into 12 artists with a strong following. And very high-value auction results,” says D’Anna. (According to Artnet, an art price database, the market for Banksy’s works have tripled in value since 2019.) “That’s the criteria. And it resonates strongly with a millennial culture, especially in Japan, China, America and London.” Investors stand to make money when the works are sold. London-based Artcels launched its first fund, XXI, in February 2020, selling all the shares immediately. More than 90 per cent of the artworks have since been sold, it says, with “a double-digit net return” paid to investors last February — net profits accrued are paid as dividends annually. The company has not yet published data on Millennials but says it has accepted offers in principle for more than half the 12 works. The value of the portfolio at Millennials’ first release was just over $1m, which the company describes as an “internal valuation” (an external valuation by Doerr Dallas was 23 per cent higher, the company says). A selling point of NFT funds is the reassurance they give to those investors who are prepared to trust blockchain in principle. Encrypted, and thus essentially indelible, they cannot themselves be lost, destroyed by fire or faked. It is still possible, of course, that the underlying artwork turns out to be fake — here the buyers must trust the gallery and its authenticators, as they must with conventional art funds. But if they are sure of the authentication, investors who trust bitcoin will have faith in the value of the NFT. In the wider art market, some NFTs are works of art that exist only in virtual form as digital files, with no underlying physical piece — for example, “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” by Beeple, aka digital artist Mike Winkelmann, which sold at Christie’s in March for nearly $70m. But Millennials is a hybrid: a physical collection backed by crypto security. Investors receive a certificate of ownership — a share certificate — in the form of an NFT, along with a paper copy and a printed catalogue. Millennials may be a modest fund in a global art market worth $50bn this year, according to Art Basel and UBS estimates, but it is playing a long game. It is targeting the next generation of rich collectors, many of whom will grow wealthier, collect more and become increasingly sophisticated in their artistic taste and knowledge. The value of the global art market shrank 22 per cent last year as fairs, live auctions and exhibitions were cancelled. But online sales reached a record high of more than $12bn, double the previous year’s total. Dealers of works worth $10m-plus more than tripled their proportion of online sales to 47 per cent. The explosion of interest in and value of cryptocurrencies during the pandemic, and the rise of NFT artworks in the past year, are set to change the market further. “That’s the whole concept of NFTs . . . seamlessly acquirable through technology, tapping into a broader audience, giving the young an opportunity to collect. It will sustain the art market for years to come,” says D’Anna. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click The art world will learn a lot from the rise of NFTs, with the power shifting to younger people and the blockchain improving transparency on ownership and boosting royalties for artists, says Sibylle Rochat, founder of Rochat Art Consultancy, who advises private and corporate clients on building and managing their collections. She says the art world’s gatekeepers — galleries, auction houses, advisers and dealers — are aware of the potential for NFTs to upend the art market and how wealthy young collectors will adapt to it. Only three of the 33 bidders for Beeple’s work, for example, were previously known to Christie’s, and 64 per cent were millennials or from Generation Z. In March, Justin Sun, a 31-year-old Chinese technology entrepreneur and founder of social media app Peiwo and cryptocurrency platform Tron, launched the Just NFT Fund, which is in the same mould as Millennials, though more valuable. Sun’s fund holds about $30m worth of works, including a 1932 painting by Picasso called “Femme nue couchée au collier (Marie-Thérèse)”, for which Sun paid $20m. Sun said on Twitter that he submitted a losing bid for the Beeple work. In a blog post, he said he estimated that half the world’s “top-notch artists and artworks” would be recorded as NFTs in the next decade. Jos van Basten, a 35-year-old Netherlands-based investor, says he bought into Millennials, not because of the blockchain features but because it offers a way into art collecting that bypasses an intimidating world. “I always thought I should diversify my portfolio and invest in art, but I never got to it,” says van Basten, an actuary. “Then last year, when Covid hit and markets dropped, I thought, OK, maybe now is the time. But I know nothing about art. A picture is either pretty or not, to me.” Van Basten paid for his shares in conventional currency. “I’m kind of an old millennial,” he says. “I’ve dipped my toe into the wider [cryptocurrency] market, but it’s quite volatile. Art seems to be a more stable investment.” Davide Uglietti, an Italian in his thirties living in Switzerland, is another “curious” investor. He has invested 5-10 per cent of his portfolio in art funds, including Millennials and the more traditional Masterworks, a US platform for buying and selling shares in a portfolio with more than $150m worth of paintings, including works by Mark Rothko and Keith Haring. Uglietti, a physicist, says he was initially cautious about investing in living artists — “you need 50 years, maybe more, to figure out who is outstanding” — but he decided to try. “Some I really didn’t like. But you do it because you like it or because you want the profit.” Crypto features, he says, do not interest him. Do purely digital artworks have a future? Rochat has seen a rise in interest in original memes and videos, the digitalised memories from key moments in popular culture, sold as NFTs among young art investors. “My clients want their collection to reflect the time they’ve been living in,” she says. “They ask me to buy one or two for their collection, not to speculate or be part of any bubble but just to reflect this time. They want to participate in a new language. What the art world has lacked for a long time is a new way of consuming collectibles.” Can wealthy investors of the millennial generation be persuaded to buy intangibles? Van Basten says he would not hesitate to buy digital artworks in the form of NFTs. “You can’t hang it on your wall, but it definitely has value. It’s not physical, but it’s still something someone made, a digital asset, which is definitely appealing.” When they are not on display in a gallery, Viale’s “Kouros” and the other works are stored in a vault deep beneath London. If investors want to admire a piece, they can make an appointment. Gazing at a physical portfolio may be reassuring, but the fact that the technology that backs that portfolio’s provenance is invisible does not make it meaningless. For wealthy young collectors new to the art world — and its rarefied institutions and opaque codes of taste and refinement — the intangible may represent the future.

For billionaire financier Mike Novogratz, it was the chance to give a speech about digital art at a prestigious auction house — and settle an old score. “I was thinking: if only my third-grade art teacher could see me now,” says the 56-year-old former money market trader. “She didn’t think I was very good and here I am, on stage at Christie’s giving a talk.” It may not be his biggest achievement, but it adds to the pleasure he says he is finding in his current venture, Galaxy Digital, a specialist cryptocurrency financial services and investment management company. For him, the excitement of the crypto boom stands comparison even with his greatest professional triumph: the 2007 flotation of Fortress, the first hedge fund to go public. “That was a heady time but, of course, we ran right into the [2008] financial crisis and learnt our lessons,” says Novogratz, referring to the losses that then hit hedge funds. “[Crypto] has been even more fun in a way . . . it’s a young people’s business and it’s almost impossible to keep up with the innovation right now.” Novogratz is one of scores of wealthy individuals who are investing not just in cryptocurrencies, but in the industry that underpins it — exchanges, asset management companies and technology providers. Mostly Americans, they often bring money to crypto that they have made in earlier ventures, along with experience that could help turn a chaotic explosion of activity into a sustainable financial sector. But while there are plenty of fans of the blockchain technology underpinning cryptocurrency issuance and trading, there are also many critics who question how such an unruly mass of new businesses can win over mainstream investors or regulators. Investors such as Novogratz could make the difference. Unlike many crypto investors, he has a solid financial background, having worked for a decade at Goldman Sachs before the swaggering years of Fortress. He first invested in bitcoin in 2012, ploughing in $7m when it was trading at $95. With global financial markets then in turmoil, especially in Europe, he saw bitcoin as an alternative currency and “a really interesting speculative bet”, he says. Three years later, he bought 500,000 ethereum for $0.99 each from the coin’s co-creator, Vitalik Buterin. Recommended The punt yielded big profits, spurring Novogratz to announce he would build what he called a Goldman Sachs for crypto markets. He launched Galaxy Digital in 2018, taking his inspiration for the name from the Star Wars films and putting his entire crypto portfolio, worth $302m, behind the company. The business now has more than $9bn of assets. Novogratz thinks the arguments for crypto now are even more compelling, with cheap money threatening the credibility of traditional finance. “What’s happening today in markets makes the quantitative easing of 2012 look like a drop in the bucket,” says Novo, as he is known in the markets. “The blockchain revolution has a purpose: we are going to rebuild the financial infrastructure and we are going after the rent-takers.” This is not a new idea. Fans have long claimed the technology could make payments free, provide solutions for the unbanked, make it easier for individuals to own their own data and end counterfeiting. Critics say blockchain, or distributed ledger, technology destroys the environment (because of the vast amount of electricity it consumes), is clunky and is a solution desperately looking for a problem. A decade ago, blockchain was synonymous with bitcoin. Today, new ledgers such as ethereum power new markets, including decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Meanwhile, Ouroboro units, a new type of blockchain technology, are faster, more efficient and more environmentally friendly than the original ledger behind blockchain. Like Novogratz, Wyoming-based Charles Hoskinson believes in blockchain’s transformative potential. A key individual in crypto, he is the joint inventor of the ethereum blockchain and of the Cardano blockchain platform, and chief executive of blockchain research organisation IOHK. “I don’t really get weekends — I’m always on a project,” says Hoskinson, 33, who studied analytic number theory at university. When he does have some free time, he hunts with eagles in Mongolia, goes on week-long fasts and says he is “a keen user of cryogenic chambers”. And he has played football with an elephant. Hoskinson, who last year spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos about blockchain’s potential to power social change, likens bitcoin to an early steam engine: something that proved hugely valuable but only as a starting point. “There are about half a dozen third-generation cryptocurrencies that do what bitcoin does and much more, but don’t consume [the same amount of] power,” he says. “This progress will allow blockchain to spread beyond finance and create real social change.” Blockchain technology is seeping into areas beyond finance, including new applications in art, property and collectibles in the form of NFTs. Stablecoins — special digital assets that link cryptocurrencies with central bank-backed money — have a market capitalisation of nearly $115bn, according to cryptocurrency data website CoinMarketCap. Even football fans buying tickets to the recent Euro 2020 tournament were using a system that relies on distributed ledger technology. But hurdles remain. Crypto’s rapid growth has caught the eyes of regulators, including those in China and the US, who are concerned about the amount of money that has flown into the volatile market. This has cooled the crypto trading frenzy that gripped investors in the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. The industry is at a crossroads, heading either for a bust or the emergence of clear proof that the technology is here to stay. “Right now, I can attract the best and brightest from all universities but, if something happens and it all goes quiet for four years, they won’t come to crypto,” Novogratz says. “The regulatory overhang is real, the pushback from China is real, and [these] will be a real test.” We need to be more grown-up about how we approach regulation because blockchain really is a better system Risks abound. Regulators, fearful of losing control, dislike private cryptocurrencies and efforts to turn traditional assets into blockchain-based tokens. Cryptocurrencies draw hordes of fraudsters: in 2020 alone, scams cost crypto investors $1.9bn, according to crypto analytics company CipherTrace. Gary B Gorton, a professor of finance at Yale School of Management, wrote in a research paper: “Based on lessons learned from history, we argue that privately produced monies are not an effective medium of exchange because they are not always accepted at par and are subject to runs.” But that does not deter committed investors such as William Quigley. Back in the 1990s, the 56-year-old billionaire helped create the marketplace for virtual assets in video games, where players buy extra game items. Today, the sector is worth $200bn annually. He co-founded IdeaLab Capital Partners, the first venture capital firm focused on internet start-ups, which backed payments group PayPal. In crypto, he is a co-founder of Tether, the world’s first stablecoin, and half of the duo that developed the first crypto derivatives. He is also chief executive of the Worldwide Asset eXchange, the largest NFT platform. These pieces of computer code can store video or other multimedia content and cannot be counterfeited. They allow artworks to be “tokenised”, or sliced into pieces, with the rights sold to hundreds of customers and traded in secondary markets. Quigley’s affinity to digital art started with a fortuitous link to an artist with the same name, William Quigley, who exhibited his work alongside that of Andy Warhol. The entrepreneur contacted the artist, they stayed in touch and recently collaborated on a pack of baseball-themed NFTs that sold out in minutes. However, many blockchain early adopters were not sold on NFTs. Quigley recalls giving a talk in 2017. “I remember presenting a slide and saying these pieces could go for $50,000 and someone in the audience said: who would pay $50,000 for something that is backed by nothing? So I had to remind them that’s true of the whole crypto world,” he says. I had a playbook for how the space was likely to evolve whereas others didn’t Today, NFTs are all the rage. In the first six months of the year, NFT sales amounted to $2.5bn, compared with less than $14m in the same period last year. In March, a crypto investor known as MetaKovan paid a record $69m for an NFT by digital artist Beeple. Quigley’s web investment background made him an ideal candidate for crypto, though initially a reluctant one because of losses suffered in the dotcom boom. “I had scar tissue as a venture capitalist when my friend told me about bitcoin [in 2010],” he says. But, a year later, despite his caution, Quigley felt there was a marketplace for virtual items. “I decided to focus fully on blockchain because it reminded me of 1994 when the first commercial web browser [Netscape Navigator] launched,” he says. “I had a playbook for how the space [was] likely to evolve whereas others didn’t.” Recommended Quigley says NFTs could wipe out counterfeiting — whether of banknotes, art or Disney teddy bears. “Consumer products with a token that acts as a digital twin will allow buyers to check whether it is original, how many were made and where it comes from instantaneously, which is difficult to do with a dollar note or an ounce of gold,” he says. Meanwhile, investors have been flocking this year to bet on transaction systems (financial, but in future for any sale process) where blockchain tech cuts out intermediaries and replaces them with preprogrammed algorithms. Interest in this kind of decentralised finance has exploded since January, with the overall market now worth $53bn, up from $15bn at the start of the year, according to specialist data and analytics company DeFi Pulse. Novogratz is among the backers of DeFi. Through Galaxy Digital, he is helping to finance Bullish Global, a trading platform for DeFi recently valued at $9bn in a finance deal. “The global financial crisis wouldn’t have happened if we had DeFi then, because it’s a completely transparent system,” says Novogratz. “It’s scaring regulators right now because it’s growing so fast, but I think that will get resolved in the next six to eight months.” Novogratz supports regulation. “I keep telling the DeFi guys: dudes, if you keep flicking the bird to the US government you’ll find out that the long arm of the US law is very scary,” he says. “We need to be more grown-up about how we approach regulation because blockchain really is a better system.” We term this the ‘great reset’, but what the heck does that mean? What are we actually going to do? But blockchain retains a strong anti-establishment flavour. “Ultimately, we believe [blockchain] technology is a government replacement system,” says Hoskinson, who argues that disillusionment with authority is widespread, as evidenced by Donald Trump’s success in becoming US president, the Black Lives Matter movement, Brexit and environmental protests. “We term this the ‘great reset’ and there is a global conversation right now, but what the heck does that mean? What are we actually going to do? It’s not good enough to be angry . . . you have to take a step back and say, what do we do? What’s the solution?” But before it can change the world, however, blockchain technology has a monumental challenge: to show it can secure acceptance and trust from a much wider range of people. And turn a profit for the investors ploughing their money into it.

The Pyth Network has persuaded companies such as Jump Trading, Virtu Financial, GTS, Hudson River Trading and DRW Cumberland to put aside their traditional rivalry and join forces to explore the potential of decentralised finance, or DeFi. The project, which only began in April, has also drawn in US stock exchanges IEX and MIAX Pearl, currency venue LMAX and crypto derivatives exchange FTX as its momentum grows. Pyth (rhymes with myth) seeks to change how market data is distributed. Banks and traders have long complained about the data fees charged by exchanges and the legal restrictions they face to redistribute or own data they helped create. David Mercer, chief executive of LMAX said Pyth could “revolutionise and democratise market data provision”. DeFi offers a chance to build an alternative system, its backers say, because a blockchain guarantees the provenance of an asset and its owner. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click The traders and exchanges’ developers have built Pyth to be a bridge between traditional markets and the crypto world, known in industry jargon as an “oracle”. Pyth collects and distributes data on stock, conventional currency, crypto and commodity deals supplied by the high-frequency traders and exchanges and puts it on a blockchain, or distributed ledger. That data can be used in other crypto trading projects. Pyth anonymises the data and publishes the symbol of the asset, such as Apple or Bitcoin, an aggregate value and a confidence level, which reflects how far Pyth believes the broader market price is from its own prices. David Olsen, president of Jump Trading, an early supporter of the project, described Pyth as “hugely exciting”. “It remains to be seen how it develops. The wide range of outcomes remains one of the most intriguing developments of Pyth,” he said. Pyth is built on the Solana blockchain because it can handle 50,000 trades per second, a scale that puts it on a par with Visa, the payments company, and exchanges such as Nasdaq. Most blockchains can only handle a handful of deals per second. “[Current blockchains] aren’t for trading on but they’re very valuable for valuation purposes. Pyth has the best chance of becoming the capital markets oracle,” Mercer told the Financial Times. “Still, we have to be prepared for it to fail.” Solana has been backed by venture capitalists Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital, and Alameda Research, the cryptocurrency market maker co-founded by FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried. At present there is no digital token connected with Pyth, and the developers are finalising the governance structure that will mean users decide how it will develop in the future.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-08-25","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/7eb3f5e1-821a-4707-b720-cfa58c1aa5d8","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fb0e8c54b-ca72-4a30-94f4-ae5f0a2305b6.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Crypto Cummings is back","INTRO":"More blockchain bunkum from the bloke who brought us Brexit, BarnardCastleGate and (arguably) Boris.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When Dominic Cummings said back in May that he had the “only copy of a crucial historical document” and that he was going to auction it off as an NFT, we hoped that this was just going to be a fleeting flirtation with the world of blockchain. A way of showing off his tech bro credentials, perhaps, or even an attempt to push Brexit and Barnard Castle further down the suggestions list when you type “Dominic Cummings b” into Google. But alas, it appears our Dom is still riding that crypto wagon. Here’s his latest “very very unappreciated” (by us anyway) tweet: Think this is very very unappreciated in policy circles \u0026 there will be many startups solving government problems based on this https://t.co/hai7i7aQbD “This” doing a lot of work there isn’t it. What is “this” in fact? Blockchain? The enabling of automated accounting by something crypto-flavoured? And what specific “government problems” is he referring to? As you can see, Cummings was in fact quote-tweeting a quote-tweet by Balaji Srinivasan, a bitcoin-broish VC whose Twitter bio is: “Immutable money, infinite frontier, eternal life. #Bitcoin”. Balaji was quoting the following response to his tweet (yes it’s all a bit convoluted sorry): Ironically, the majority of the world (or at least US) is paid by the hour, a wildly inefficient system for rewarding output/impact. (The “Carry” there is a VC term that refers to “carried interest”, ie their compensation, not to anyone who has ever been cruelly called Princess Nut Nut.) We are not sure what crypto-enabled accounting has to do with people being paid by the hour, or how “more complex models for economic alignment” can help solve government problems. Does our Dom think complexity should be an end in itself? We guess policy circles just very very don’t appreciate cool techy complex stuff (and perhaps neither do we). Luckily, some sensible person on Twitter (yes they do exist) quickly pointed out to Dom that a lot of accounting is already automated and that crypto isn’t very helpful in this area, but Dom used real mathematical probability to win the argument: Chance you know more about crypto than Balaji is ~0% We asked our pal Martin Walker —director of banking at finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management, who has been advising banks on blockchain for about six years — for his thoughts on the matter, and he told us: People, generally who know nothing about accounting, have been coming out with this c**p for years. He then thought he’d better give us a slightly politer version, and said: There is a great deal more to accounting than keeping a ledger of transactions . . . Using some form of blockchain does not in any way make it easier to model financial transactions. Arguably, depending on what form of blockchain is used, it can make it considerably more complicated. In the process of writing this post, Dom has also retweeted the following, on the ability of “a coin’s community” to basically solve the problem of the lack of free speech: Prediction: a coin’s community will build the frontend, backend, and payments for a sufficiently decentralized version over the next 12 months. The tech stack is ready, the market is proven, exchanges exist, and decentralized social media already works. Just need the teams. https://t.co/Dd7VxTUJOW We give up.

After all, “fiat is dirty”: @thebearablebull it’s time to switch to a digital currency. Fiat is dirty and is cause for the spread of the corona virus. Could this be the catalyst that advances utility of XRP??? Now, to be fair to the bitcoin bros (not great) and XRP army (worse), even the World Health Organisation had around that time started pushing the idea that Covid could be being spread by banknotes (while simultaneously recommending that people should not wear masks), now thought to be “very unlikely”. Even if banknotes were a key transmission vector, however, we are not sure that “dirty fiat” itself could be held responsible, given that the vast majority of it only exists in digital form. Why would you use bitcoin, or XRP, or any other crypto token when you can transact digitally using fiat currencies? Yet in some ways, the crypto crowd were not wrong. In the almost 18 months since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic, the price of bitcoin has risen by about 525 per cent, from just under $8,000 to a three-month high just above $50,000 on Monday. XRP has climbed by a similar amount to trade around the $1.25 mark. And that, we regret to inform you, has led to some rather silly thinking (highly unusual in the crypto community, we know), specifically of the chart-crime variety: Want to see an interesting relation? Check the relation between COVID case numbers and $ETH, #BTC. Numbers go up? (Credit to @JohnWRichKid\u0027s for first noticing). pic.twitter.com/7IBTyhZ9Xb Yes, a most “interesting relation” indeed. When Ethereum (or “ether” as the token that powers the network is called) hit its record high of just under $4,200 in early May (not of course higher than the bitcoin price at the time though you wouldn’t know that from the above), the chart shows Covid cases falling towards their lowest levels since April 2020. When bitcoin hit its record high of around $63,000 just a few weeks earlier, Covid cases had already fallen very steeply, according to the chart. And when Covid cases hit their highest levels in early January, bitcoin suffered its worst crash in eight months. It’s almost as if there is no correlation between crypto prices and Covid cases whatsoever, isn’t it? (Both crypto coins have risen in recent days, while cases have also risen; there’s not an inverse relationship either.) It should be noted that crypto prices also started rising more quickly when Donald Trump lost the presidential election, so we should probably have a think about the notion that Trump might actually be Satoshi, and that now with more free time on his hands he is focusing on pumping the market. After all it is highly likely that he is a Japanese-trained quantum physicist (do make sure you get to 2:09 in this for proof of his knowledge of thermodynamics, and to 2:45 for evidence of his reading Japanese): OK perhaps that’s a little far-fetched. But what is behind crypto’s crazy climb over the past 18 months, we hear you ask? We don’t mean to suggest that the pandemic hasn’t been involved, because we think it has, but not in the way that this chart criminal implies — not, in other words, because it’s some kind of safe haven that traders flock to when they are worried about Covid cases rising; the data don’t bear that idea out. It’s always hard to know exactly what is driving crypto prices given the opacity of the market and a certain rather large player whose name rhymes with weather, but we think it’s probably partly related to the same market madness that drove GameStop to da moon, as well as to a desire for an alternative to central bank-issued money due to worries about the government overreach (by means of Covid restrictions), and also endorsements from chief executives at the likes of PayPal, Tesla and Twitter/Square. We should also point out that if we had been given labels on the Y-axis (which obviously we are not), it might become clear that these “daily Covid cases” refer to US Covid cases. Because while a US chart looks exactly like the one above, a chart showing worldwide Covid cases doesn’t; instead it looks like this (according to Google): Perhaps a bit odd, then, to decide to chart crypto prices against US Covid cases rather than global cases, given crypto is traded globally. Very generously our tweeter credits another crypto fanatic for the remarkable analysis, who had drawn up his own chart just days earlier: When Covid numbers goes up, Bitcoin goes up. Based on this analysis I am issuing a BUY order on Bitcoin with a price target of $1 million by September. Attached is my analysis with the Bitcoin chart just above the Covid chart. All thoughts welcome. pic.twitter.com/AeMAEAixn9 Now one can ever be sure in this “space” but we *think* given that the blue line is so vertical that it literally bends backwards, and that the guy seems to have a sense of humour in his other tweets, this is a joke.

Instead, they should be more open to embracing the innovations of crypto and channelling them in a better direction for finance, the economy and society at large. At the same time, crypto supporters need to recognise the growing systemic consequences of the continuing and future disruptions, deepening their engagement on regulatory and energy issues. They need to shift away from a “zero-sum” mindset where their gains can only come from the losses of the established financial system. Overall, the policy debate in western economies over crypto remains too narrow relative to the importance of the issues in play and excessively polarised, with participants speaking different languages. This has intensified the underlying tug of war between accelerating private sector adoption and government/central bank discomfort. As the former steadily increases, we have started to see divergence in the western world on the cost-benefit of trying to channel the crypto revolution towards improving financial services, making things even more complicated. In contrast, China is pressing ahead with a more forceful, unified top-down vision, setting the stage for transformational dynamics that have the potential to extend well beyond the country itself. What happens next will have profound implications for financial services, monetary policy, investment outcomes, payment platforms and the configuration of global reserve currencies. It will also influence the control and use of big data, as well as China-US technological and economic competition. Three on-the-ground developments show how things are shaping up. First, the technologies driving the crypto revolution, including digitally-distributed ledgers of transactions known as blockchains, are becoming more disruptive to a financial industry that has remained for too long relatively inefficient and a source of excessive profits. The combination of regulatory moats that deterred industry entrants and traditional customer inertia are no longer strong enough to discourage a tech-driven wave of competition. Second, despite their instability, cryptocurrencies are gradually becoming a larger part of investor portfolios via allocations to two buckets — risk-mitigating assets that are an alternative at the margin to gold and some government bonds; and opportunistic bets on non-correlated assets. Third, cryptocurrencies are also somewhat more prevalent in the payments ecosystem. It’s worrisome for illicit payments (think of the growing number of ransomware attacks) but more positive for remittance transfers, where too many traditional channels remain slow and expensive. But the broader evolution into global currencies continues to be undermined by price volatility, lack of broad trust and regulatory concerns. The big question now in whether crypto disrupters and regulators in the West will succeed in converging on a more unified approach. The onus here falls primarily on the crypto world, which risks repeating the mistake that Big Tech has made — pursuing narrow business objectives without realising that their desired success will make them systemically important.

They also have to respond to concern about a potential erosion of monetary policy tools. The need for governments and central banks to be open-minded is made more urgent by what China is doing. Officials in Beijing have understood the transformational power of the crypto revolution and wish to co-opt it in a holistic and highly directed manner. By doing so, it confronts the west with a challenge that goes beyond China being quicker to develop better payments systems and a central bank digital currency — all of which are likely to jump borders. It could also pose a new problem for the dollar’s reserve currency status, as well as providing China with more control over sensitive big data and closing what remains of the technological gap. Absent a more co-operative approach, both sides of the crypto world in the west may find their future being determined by what a faster-moving China is doing and intends to do.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Mohamed El-Erian","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-07-29","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/ee970452-02de-4d66-84a1-f2b1345f57d1","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Ff7edf1e9-697b-467c-8bb8-29147a157c2c.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"‘Mr White Hat:’ The story behind a $600m crypto caper","INTRO":"How an alleged thief morphed into a self-styled vigilante who captivated the digital asset world","DETAILED_CONTENT":"An hour after the world discovered an alleged hacker had made off with $600m in one of the largest-ever cryptocurrency heists, the thief tipped a bystander $42,000 for warning that some of the assets were being frozen. The apparent act of generosity was only the first unexpected twist in a virtual robbery that has gripped the crypto industry and left many observers scratching their heads. The mystery hacker’s target was an obscure group called Poly Network, a project in the world of decentralised finance, known as DeFi, which links together some of the most widely-used digital ledgers. DeFi is the cutting edge of the digital asset world. Developers are building automated networks to allow individuals and companies to skip fee-charging intermediaries like banks and exchanges. In the crypto market, all transactions can be seen on digital ledgers. Poly took advantage of this feature in the same way a bank can alert authorities to the serial numbers on stolen cash. It called on other industry participants to “blacklist” the stolen loot, making it much more difficult for the hacker to move it without getting caught. With escape routes rapidly closing down to move such a large sum, the hacker began making the case that they were an altruistic thief, out for a good time and to showcase Poly’s vulnerabilities for the greater good. “I hope my life can be composed of unique adventures, so I like to learn and hack everything in order to fight against the fate,” the hacker wrote in messages that can be viewed on a blockchain. Working out the blind spot of Poly Network “would be one of the best moments in my life,” said the hacker, who has yet to be identified. As the incident unfolded this week, the hacker dubbed ‘Mr White Hat’ sent communiqués via the Ethereum blockchain, which can be viewed publicly. The blockchain conversation reveals part of the hacker’s negotiations with Poly Network and gives some clues to the motivation behind the theft. Here are some extracts from those messages: “Not so interested in money, now considering returning some tokens or just leaving them here.” — Mr White Hat “We can offer you a security bounty when you return all the remaining assets. We will provide a secure address through email.” — Poly Network “I have been exploring the meaning of life for a while.” — Mr White Hat “I know it hurts when people are attacked, but shouldn’t they learn something from those hacks?” — Mr White Hat “Q: Why hacking? A. For fun :) ” — Mr White Hat After quoting German philosopher Martin Heidegger, the hacker then took on a Batman-style vigilante attitude. “I prefer to work in the dark and save the world,” they wrote. To some, a homespun philosophy that mixed high and pop culture to justify taking $600m may seem a stretch. The DeFi market already had a reputation for being the wildest of the “Wild West” in the largely unregulated crypto world. Last year, DeFi represented only 6 per cent of all cryptocurrency activity but accounted for a third of all digital asset thefts, according to Chainalysis, a crypto data company. But as the dust began to settle, many crypto enthusiasts, a community that has long championed libertarian ideals, were already beginning to give him a sympathetic hearing. It had even given the hacker a nickname — “Mr White Hat” — in reference to supposed “ethical” hacking. “The world has up to now been too forgiving of people deploying insecure systems which companies manage rather than fix. The wonderful thing about DeFi is that it is not forgiving in that way,” said Mark Miller, chief technology officer at Agoric, which provides software for DeFi transactions. “We have an ecosystem here in which insecure participants get killed quickly so it gets to be populated by the survivors of the process.” The anonymous hacker’s sudden rise to fame began on Tuesday, after he identified a weak spot in Poly’s systems. Poly had developed a computer protocol, or set of rules, that allows users to transfer tokens tied to one blockchain to a different network. Many of the world’s most widely used blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum, operate independently. Their coins, offered as an incentive to users, run on separate technologies. That means investors cannot easily move tokens to a different blockchain to trade them elsewhere. Poly acted as a bridge but Mr White Hat found a bug that gave him direct access the ledgers. Shortly after 1.30pm London time, Poly alerted the world on Twitter that thousands of tokens had been removed from its network. Its response was to publish the unique alphanumeric addresses of the wallets to which the tokens had been sent, so other crypto players could identify and potentially block further transactions. Exchanges such as Binance and OKEx said they were monitoring the situation. Tether, the stablecoin operator, said it froze about $33m worth of its tokens. As the exchanges at the heart of the crypto system began to block the hacker’s path, the adventure took yet another turn. Users of the Ethereum blockchain can create crypto trades and attach comments for the world to see. The hacker’s helpful informant used this feature to warn Mr White Hat the assets were being locked off. Others began tipping Mr White Hat with tokens, accompanied by messages asking for funds to be returned. While most tips were worth less than $1, a handful of the more than 1,300 transactions involved tokens worth hundreds of dollars in the hope of receiving a more substantial payout. Poly left a message on Ethereum asking the hacker to contact them. Less than an hour later, Mr White Hat responded on the same channel. Attacker and target were communicating in public. In more conciliatory language, Poly then offered a bounty worth $500,000 as a reward for finding the bug and returning the assets. “We hope it will be remembered as the biggest white hat hack in history,” the organisation said. The appeal to the hacker’s vanity worked. He gave no indication he would take the money but, the next day, began transferring small amounts to a joint account. Like a police negotiator in a movie, Poly encouraged the hacker to continue: “You are moving things [in] the right direction.” By Friday, Poly said almost all of the funds had been returned and it was preparing to take full control of the assets to hand back to their owners. As the hacker surrendered, the thief remained defiant; “Hacking for good, I did save the project”, he wrote via Ethereum. For some the episode had represented an important lesson about the fallibilities of the system, especially protocols that look to connect blockchains like Poly. “A blockchain can be extremely secure but only in its own world. The moment it needs to talk to something else outside the blockchain that potentially opens up problems,” said Kevin Werbach, an academic at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton business school. Lawyers said it was unclear whether users whose funds were caught up in the caper would or even could launch a legal challenge. Poly’s website offers no terms governing its use, nor does it reference a legal entity. DeFi systems use software programs called smart contracts to transfer cryptocurrencies, removing any human intermediary and complicating the task of assigning liability to any one party. Some developers have argued that the rules created by software programs constitute the “law” — a notion that many lawyers contest. But it may be the hacker who has the biggest impact on how aggressively regulators look to supervise DeFi activity, said Charlie Steele, a former US government lawyer and now partner at Forensic Risk Alliance, a regulation consultancy. “I don’t think regulators would be too comfortable relying on Robin Hoods out there to police the system.” For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click ","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan Miles Kruppa","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-08-13","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/91342189-978f-4d44-9dcf-b993983f08f9","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fa3846e14-a9a3-498e-9935-5dc8d7eb2082.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How blockchain is shaking Swift and the global payments system","INTRO":"A crucial linchpin of the world’s financial plumbing is ripe for disruption","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Last month, the Brussels-based utility called the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) announced that six global banks had embraced its plan to upgrade cross-border payment systems. So far, so boring, many might think. Payment processes rarely grab public or political attention, unless they go wrong. In that sense they are like household plumbing. But investors should wake up. For this joint initiative (together with the Bank of China, Citi, Bank of New York Mellon, Deutsche, Standard Chartered and BNP Paribas) is one sign of a potentially vicious battle now erupting due to the rise of cryptocurrencies and the technology behind them. The wider public tends to view digital tokens, such as bitcoin, primarily in terms of whether they can act as a store of value and medium of exchange. Many politicians are simultaneously caught up in the emerging debate around the potential of central bank digital currencies. But what is equally important — and often overlooked — in all of these conversations is what blockchain and the cryptocurrencies it supports could do to financial plumbing, not just inside countries but between them. This could reshape not just finance, but US geopolitical leverage as well. Swift is currently both a crucial linchpin of global finance and a peculiarity which seems ripe for disruption. It first sprang to life back in 1977, when American and European banks created a jointly-owned utility to perform correspondent banking services. (As an admirably lucid new book, The Pay Off, explains, this occurred because Citi was developing a proprietary payments network, and its rivals hated the idea of a monopoly sitting in private hands.) Today Swift remains a non-profit co-operative, with 11,000 members and facilitating payments worth an eye-popping $1.5tn a day. It does this not by actually moving money, but by enabling banks to dispatch messages that credit or debit their accounts as payments occur. This makes it akin to an electronic post system. Swift officials, however, prefer to dub it the world’s large “fintech”. Maybe so. But its Achilles heel is that it is anything but “swift”. On the contrary, as the Pay Off notes, critics have sometimes complained about slow and costly payments in the correspondent banking network around Swift. Some financiers also say that the utility itself has been slow to embrace innovation, because it had a bureaucratic culture and weak governance structure. Unsurprisingly, this has prompted fintech upstarts, such as Ripple and Facebook’s Diem project, to create plans to challenge Swift with innovations such as distributed ledger technology (“blockchain”). Some of Swift’s own members are also challenging it. JPMorgan, for example, is developing a particularly bold blockchain initiative system called Onyx with a messaging system called Liink. This is already moving “billions each day’, according to officials. Meanwhile, the Russian and Chinese governments are reportedly creating rival platforms, since countries subject to US sanctions, such as Iran, have occasionally been excluded from the network. (Gottfried Leibbrandt, the former Swift head and co-author of The Pay Off, recently explained to an FT forum that while the utility is technically independent, Washington has sanction power because half of Swift’s payment flows are in dollars.) Will these challenges topple Swift? Definitely not in the short term. Even if Russia and China build rival systems, it is unlikely others would choose to rely on these in a world where the overwhelming majority of global trade is currently invoiced in dollars. And while fintech start-ups are performing small-value, cross-border retail payments — and aim to dominate specific niches — none have any scale, yet. Moreover, the key thing to understand about platforms such as the ambitious JPMorgan Onyx/Liink system is that they are “closed loop”, as opposed to Swift’s open system. Rivals thus have an incentive to collaborate with Swift to promote interoperability. Fintech is a world of frenemies. But even if short-term challenges can be fended off, the long term is uncertain. It is very unlikely that the US Treasury would choose to let Swift be disintermediated, given its geopolitical significance. Washington and Wall Street thus have a joint incentive to help the utility fend off competition, by following others’ innovations. And Swift is trying to do precisely that. Four years ago it introduced one big upgrade: a new “global payments innovation” to improve processes. The recent announcement in partnership with the banks is supposed to deliver more digital capabilities in November 2022. A 15-month plan, however, looks achingly slow to anyone in Silicon Valley — or in Beijing, which is racing ahead with its digital currency. Swift’s ambitions also seem modest compared to the promise of blockchain. So the issue being fought over in Brussels is not just one of technical and geopolitical importance — must cross-border payments occur via messages? Should America weaponise dollar flows? — but also commercially critical. Can an incumbent monopoly ever effectively steal from disrupters? The fact that the answers are uncertain is unnerving. And more important than the hype around cryptocurrencies. gillian.tett@ft.com This article has been amended to clarify that the book The pay-off did not accuse SWIFT of having a bureaucratic culture and excessively high costs, as it originally stated. The book’s criticisms were directed against the correspondent banking network centred around SWIFT.

But some question if the threat to crypto assets is really as existential as feared.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"There’s a paradox at the heart of cyber security. It relates to the trade-off between keeping our secrets safe and protecting the communications of bad actors. Most people are blissfully unaware of it, but an uneasy balance was struck in the early 2000s following the conclusion of the Crypto Wars. After many years of fighting the ability to export secure encryption, US officials finally capitulated on restrictions in 2000, opening the door to a much larger share of the world being able to benefit from secure encryption protocols. While many saw this as too much of a concession to terrorists and criminal organisations, privacy advocates argued the benefits of secure communications for all outweighed the risks. With quantum computing around the corner, however, some believe the power balance struck in the 2000s could be on the verge of breakdown due to the technology’s potential to break current encryption standards. This time, they say, the consequences could be far graver than anything in the past because of the scale of economic value and infrastructure that has been linked in the interim to secure encryption. But others think the threat may be being overhyped by those who wish to profit from selling quantum security or by those who have an interest in getting institutions to migrate to platforms they control and can exploit. In the latest issue of the European Cybersecurity Journal, Jaya Baloo, the vice chair of the Quantum Flagship initiative, an EU-funded research initiative, argued that the impact of quantum computing has the potential to be bigger than the computing revolution. This is why, she says, quantum secure encryption must be rolled out well in advance to fend off any adverse effects. But rather than focus on building more secure systems, Baloo also noted there are still many officials lobbying to weaken existing encryption regimes via backdoors and system overrides in the name of national security and fighting crime. Baloo compared this to the arguments made during the Vietnam war that the best way to save a village was to burn it down: We’re looking at the same absurd situation when it comes to encryption. People with noble ends — stopping crime, terrorism, child pornography, and human trafficking — are proposing means to those ends — weakening encryption with backdoors — that would in fact destroy the very end goal of security and privacy for everyone. As it stands, banks are probably the most ahead when it comes to fending off quantum decryption risk. Many have discreetly begun assembling teams to think hard about moving — if not already moving — their systems to quantum secure levels. Much of this activity is being done in the shadows because of the downside of accidentally signalling to would-be attackers (especially state-level ones) how insecure one’s system currently is. Nobody wants to let the proverbial quantum security cat out of the bag since doing so would invite a perpetual arms-race between attackers and defenders, with encryption having to be continuously adapted to new threats. Even so, this scenario may eventually become unavoidable. Amit Katwala, the author of Quantum Computing, how it works and why it could change the world, told FT Alphaville that while quantum is likely to break certain types of encryption eventually, there’s a good chance it will be contained in counter-encryption upgrades. “By the time these devices are ready to break those types of encryption, there will be new types of encryption in place that will be harder for them to break.” Not all in the crypto security world are convinced by the urgency of the matter. In some quarters, an active debate is being had about whether quantum computing will ever be strong enough to break standard encryption protocols. The question is of particularly relevance to those active in the cryptocurrency sphere, since so much of the sector depends on secure cryptography to retain its value. Opinions, however, remain hugely divided. Among those who see it as a big problem are the founders of Arqit, a British network security company that claims to have solved some key problems in the quantum security field. Stephen Homes, Arqit’s chief product officer, argues in a new paper co-authored with Liqun Chen from the University of Surrey that quantum computers could in theory use Shor’s algorithm, a number crunching technique, to break Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures, which many cryptocurrencies depend on. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click To fend off quantum attacks, the paper outlines, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin will have to adapt in ways that would make usability increasingly cumbersome for users. Keeping on top of the threat, they say, “requires a significant change in user behaviour and a cryptocurrency becomes increasingly less usable as each additional protection is added.” To achieve user-friendly security, the authors add, cryptocurrencies would have to migrate to quantum safe digital signature schemes. But doing so would require a hard fork, which is a notoriously complex process that involves high levels of community consensus to ensure successful implementation. One other option, Holmes and Chen note, is migrating one cryptocurrency to a new cryptocurrency platform designed specifically to be quantum resistant. “This could be achieved relatively easily through an exchange process as a cryptocurrency is becoming more at risk to the ever increasing performance of quantum computers,” they say. But many top-level bitcoin developers and experts remain sceptical. Some argue there’s no clear indication that quantum computing will ever be strong enough to break either ECDSA or the Sha-256 secure hashing algorithm that underpins bitcoin. Stepan Snigirev, a former quantum physicist now involved in the crypto space, told FT Alphaville that it is unlikely that quantum computers will become a threat to bitcoin in the next 20 years. As he noted: In order to break elliptic curve cryptography, one needs ~10 thousand physical qubits and their quantum state should survive several million operations. The current state of the art Quantum Computers are tiny and very noisy - 20 qubits with ~100 operations is what you can expect today. Optimistically one can expect ~10x improvement in both parameters every 5 years. Or maybe in 3 years if you have unlimited funding. So these simple estimates give us about 15-20 years to develop and deploy quantum-safe cryptography. Others in the community go further than that. They claim the true agenda of those circulating fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) about bitcoin’s resilience to quantum is to sabotage trust in the novel financial system, since it poses such a threat to incumbent powers. A counter-narrative that might best be described as “quantum denial” has thus appeared in some quarters too. The views of those developing quantum computers sit somewhere in the middle. “Certainly quantum computing is not a hoax,” Dr Kuan Yen Tan, chief technology officer of IQM Quantum Computers, told FT Alphaville. “There is of course lots of hype around, but some of that is very good because quantum has great potential. We think it is going to eventually change everything because it is like a new force of nature that we are taking into use.” His colleague Prof. Mikko Möttönen of Aalto University and chief scientist at IQM however caveated that “for quantum computers to become a security threat, in the sense that you define, you would need something called quantum error correction. So you would need a machine that makes almost no errors at all . . . and that kind of machine is beyond 10 years from now.” Irrespective of how great the quantum threat really is, efforts to provide the market with pre-emptive solutions are coming. Holmes’ company, Arqit, is among those looking to cash in. In recent months Arqit has come to market claiming it has figured out how to commercialise symmetric key encryption, a much stronger method of encryption that has until now been viewed as impossible to scale. It works on the basis that if two counterparts can access the same genuinely random number that only they share, they can encrypt their communications in a way that is most likely to be quantum secure. The method is most famous for protecting high security assets like the US nuclear codes, using the nuclear football. But it also comes with a big disadvantage: in most circumstances it calls for the physical exchange of passwords between two parties, meaning it is no good for encryption between distant parties that never have the chance to meet in person. But Arqit’s CEO David Williams says the company — which consists of a plethora of former GCHQ code crackers and former British and US military types — has solved the trickiest part of the problem by using another quantum process known as quantum key distribution (QKD). At the heart of the solution is a mechanism that draws on the spooky properties of quantum states to help distribute the keys securely over distance. The quantum properties ensure that if a message is intercepted it disappears before it can be read. “If you try and read quantum information, you break it, and it doesn’t get used,” says Williams, while pointing out that the downside of quantum key distribution is that its resistance to hacking is also what makes it highly sensitive to more benign forms of interference it the real world. “It unfortunately only lasts a few dozens of kilometres because the quantum information bumps into glass molecules and dies,” says Williams. Arqit solves this problem by using satellites to distribute the keys to terrestrial receivers, a process which extends the transmissibility of the codes by many hundreds of kilometres. It also claims to have found a way to branch off that security and offer it as a service to mass-market telecoms providers, ensuring everyone’s personal computers and mobiles can benefit from QKD. Arqit, however, is not the only venture to claim to have solved QKD using satellites. In 2016, China launched a quantum communications satellite known as Micius, that was also set to transmit encrypted keys from space. Xinhua reported at the time that the satellite was “designed to distribute keys between relay stations on two different continents using high-speed coherent lasers” and that “as a quantum photon cannot be separated or duplicated, it becomes ‘impossible to wiretap, intercept or crack the information transmitted through it.”” But Williams claims Arqit, which fetched a $1.4bn valuation on Nasdaq in early May via a merger with Spac, is far ahead of the Chinese effort. He says Micius unlike Arqit has not yet solved the “global versus trustless” conundrum, which allows for the quantum encryption to be distributed beyond its end point on the ground. Solving this means the technology can be applied not just to direct communications but much more broadly, including to protect new blockchain-based financial systems from quantum attack. “Our customer announcement will be about a central bank digital currency, which we think is the best legitimate regulated use of blockchain technology, but only works if it is quantum safe,” he told FT Alphaville. The idea central banks may be inclined to draw on quantum properties to secure their currencies is certainly intriguing. One of the big challenges facing CBDC issuance, after all, is how they will be able to maintain users’ privacy while simultaneously complying with their own Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money-Laundering rules, which require active supervision and monitoring of all transactions. As it stands the two requirements are paradoxical. From a users’ perspective, siding more firmly with one or the other requirement also risks alienating users either way, whether that’s on privacy grounds or on stability and risk grounds. In that context, being able to say “we’ve solved this impossible problem with quantum” seems an awfully convenient thing to be able to promote. Such assurances, however, are unlikely to satisfy the eternally distrustful crypto community. One high-level cryptographer source told FT Alphaville that even if QKD has been achieved at scale, it doesn’t mean the wider system is necessarily unhackable. If the attacker controls the endpoint in a QKD pair, they said, it is possible they could see the key being generated and that would then give them access. “That’s how governments will backdoor it,” they noted. “They will be using a keyed random number generator, so the question is: how do you audit the independence of the random number generator? And the answer is you can’t.” For now at least we guess that means the paranoia in the sector is unlikely to be abated.

In a Twitter thread, Dorsey said that Square planned to create a “new business” with the “goal of making it easy to create non-custodial, permissionless, and decentralised financial services”, in what would mark one of the first big projects of its kind in the nascent market. Decentralised finance, or DeFi, is the name given to the growing number of cryptocurrency projects that are trying to build an interlocking financial system denominated in cryptocurrencies that cuts out traditional middlemen. Proponents say it will provide a new way to access financial services ranging from lending and trading to insurance and savings products. Dorsey, who is chief executive of Square and Twitter, said that Square had “some ideas around the initial platform primitives we want to build”. However, it is unclear what exactly the business would offer to prospective developers or how it might be monetised. It is to be called TBD, until a name is chosen. “We’re going to do this completely in the open. Open road map, open development, and open source,” Dorsey said, adding that Mike Brock, an executive who has worked on Square’s push into cryptocurrency, would head up the platform. Recommended Private investors have backed more than 70 DeFi companies this year and although the area remains small, its value has ballooned in tandem with the cryptocurrency bull market. The assets in DeFi products have grown from about $2bn a year ago to more than $55bn today, according to data from DeFi Pulse. The freewheeling space has also captured the attention of regulators, who have raised concerns about the security and accountability of projects, as well as the potential for fraud. Dan Berkovitz, commissioner at the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has asserted that many DeFi apps could be illegal. Many DeFi projects are built on the ethereum blockchain because it can be used to easily create smart contracts — essentially computer code that is automatically triggered when certain conditions are met.

However, in November it will receive its first big upgrade in several years, known as Taproot, which will make it easier for smart contracts to be created on the protocol. Founded in 2009, Square started life as a digital payments company but Dorsey has signalled wide-ranging ambitions for the group. Earlier this year, it acquired a majority stake in Tidal, the struggling streaming platform owned by Jay-Z, for $297m, making an unexpected entrance into the music industry and putting the rapper on the Square board. TBD would be the latest in a number of bets on cryptocurrencies made by Dorsey, a fierce bitcoin advocate. Revenues at Square more than doubled in 2020 in part due to a rise in bitcoin-related transactions made on its Cash App, its peer-to-peer mobile payment facility.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hannah Murphy","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-07-15","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/00ee2bf6-3c19-4e81-ad0c-dd5b66606b3f","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F24057e9a-6af3-48cb-9983-db08e525e083.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"DeFi paradoxes","INTRO":"Why using crypto smart-contracts to remove financial intermediaries comes with its own trade-offs.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"You might have heard the term “DeFi” making the rounds in the cryptosphere. Like us, you may even have tried to understand what it was all about but given up due to the complexity, opacity and jargon surrounding its key aspects. Others have tried to shed light on its mysterious operations. The FT’s Miles Kruppa and Hannah Murphy, for example, noted as far back as the heady pre-pandemic days of December 2019 that DeFi operates as a broad umbrella term for blockchain projects that aim to eject human involvement in financial services by using smart contracts. To accomplish this, DeFi depends on the creation of “liquidity pools” and overcollateralised repo-style arrangements. Even so, DeFi, which stands for “decentralised finance”, remains a murky if increasingly hyped up corner of the crypto world. To be blunt, FT Alphaville’s initial knee-jerk reaction — based on what we should confess was not that much research at all — was that the very idea of decentralised finance being something new or exciting was hugely naive. The story of financial markets, after all, is one of continuous decentralisation, innovation and engineering to synthesise seemingly risk-reduced returns and free lunches, which usually turn out to be anything but. Crypto is just another part of that story. From repo markets to eurodollars and commodities, the story always starts with decentralised frameworks arising quite organically, being heralded as amazing wealth generators, then turning risky, then blowing up, then having regulatory forces battle to contain them — usually by centralising their processes and slowing down their growth by forcing expensive checks and balances on the systems. Were the alchemic solutions being offered by DeFi really immune to that age-old pattern? We somehow doubted it. It’s for this reason a new paper DeFi Protocol Risks: the Paradox of DeFi, by Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures and Linda Jeng, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University Law Center piqued our curiosity when it crossed our radar. Neither Carter or Jeng are openly hostile to crypto, in fact quite the opposite — Carter is a well known advocate of bitcoin and crypto. That their incredibly well researched work should arrive at conclusions that fitted with our base assumptions seemed noteworthy, therefore. To be clear, Carter and Jeng do see potential in DeFi bringing down the cost of financial services and broadening access. But they are also incredibly realistic about the challenges and risks. Notably, they are also wise to many of the inherent paradoxes of financial systems that we at FT Alphaville are so fond of flagging. The paper is a dense read, but of course it would be: it’s DeFi. Nonetheless the authors do a good job of explaining the background of the movement, laying out the current landscape and then setting the scene for the risks. But it’s their concluding points that really should not be missed, since they speak not just to the heart of the issue that faces of crypto but also to fintech and financial innovation more broadly. Basically, that there really is no free lunch. And, as Grossman-Stiglitz highlighted as far back as 1980, there is also “a fundamental conflict between the efficiency with which markets spread information and the incentives to acquire information”. This means prices will never reflect the information which is available “since if it did, those who spent resources to obtain it would receive no compensation”. Which de facto means if you remove the incentive (a.k.a. cost) to hunt for information, you will get bad prices and thus incur risk. Here in any case is a similar concluding point from Carter and Jeng (with our emphasis): Many of the risks described above stem from the decentralized nature of blockchains. The goal of automating the delivery of financial services and reducing human dependencies also has the congruent effect of reducing oversight and control. Disintermediating traditional intermediaries reduces high fees and entry friction, but also creates new opportunities for new types of intermediaries. These new types of intermediaries require the sufficient economic incentives and, thus, could be potentially more costly and risky than the monopoly rents extracted by today’s centralized intermediaries. Ultimately, this new host of intermediaries in a decentralized financial ecosystems could stymie the drive toward the twin goals of democratizing financial services: lowering cost and improving access. They also observe just how difficult it really is to disintermediate a system from its base source of value, which stems from the core system. (This of course is something the eurodollar and MMF markets also found out in 2008): External dependencies on traditional finance, namely banks, is another important source of risk as well as a transmission channel for risk. Although one of the goals of DeFi is to create a new kind of financial system without traditional intermediaries, the irony is that as DeFi struggles to make itself more useful in the real world, its dependency on the established financial system grows. Its reliance on traditional finance is not only a source of risk but can potentially serve as a transmission channel for risk between traditional financial and DeFi systems. DeFi leveraging stablecoins’ backing by fiat or other financial liabilities is an excellent example of this type of risk. Another dependency is that the crypto industry still needs to bank with commercial banks in order to conduct the cash legs of their transactions. Last, here are some insightful observations about why it is so much harder to remove back-office personnel than many appreciate: Wholly new risks are introduced by DeFi stemming from the reliance on open protocols and the fact that the underlying infrastructure is un-owned. Removing the back office and human oversight results in many efficiencies, but they also introduce risks. Thus, it is up to the end user or contract administrator to monitor the risk of the protocols themselves, and many would not want the burden. These risks are amplified when financial primitives collide with automated, hard-to-intervene contracts. Here is where all the chaos in DeFi is really from - systems that are built to be scalable and automated but that are underspecified or not understood by their creators. In sum, blockchain technologies bring many benefits. But the tools or processes used to disintermediate or gain efficiency also have costs in recourse, reversibility, risk management, etc. – the ‘paradox’ of DeFi. In short, where there is a burden associated with processing information or familiarising yourself with an opaque, jargon-heavy new system that promises to be safe as houses and efficient but demands you to just trust it on that, there is and always will be a market for a trusted third party to do the due diligence for you.

Blockchain — the digital ledger that records and verifies transactions and underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin — has the potential to streamline the process of selling new debt, leading to substantial cost savings, bankers say. “I think blockchain has a real future in debt capital markets,” said Sean Taor, head of European debt capital markets at RBC. “If you can use blockchain from start to finish, you take out a lot of the costs, a lot of the risks in terms of counterparty and settlement risks.” In April the European Investment Bank raised €100m from a two-year bond registered on the ethereum blockchain network, in the first such deal involving a syndicate of banks. The deal came three years after the World Bank sold the first bond to be created and managed using blockchain. Singaporean food producer Olam International last year sold a bond using HSBC’s blockchain-based settlement platform, while JPMorgan has also tested the use of blockchain technology for issuing financial instruments. For the issuers the motivation is obvious. Over the life cycle of a bond, using blockchain technology could save at least 35 per cent of the costs associated with issuance, according to a study last year by German fintech firm Cashlink, by automating processes such as the emailing back and forth and manual updating of bond documentation. Use of blockchain could also cut down the number of intermediaries involved in the process — for example the bonds would no longer need to be registered with a central securities depository. A similar 2019 study by HSBC looking at the green bond market — where a public ledger would help streamline the process of tracking the use of the bond’s proceeds — identified much larger savings of up to 90 per cent. Blockchain issued bonds are not denominated in cryptocurrencies, but they use the same underlying technology to reconcile orders from different systems, record and update ownership of the asset, and allow the transaction to be settled without the need for extensive manual cross-checking. Rather than settlement taking three days, as is typical, money can flow to the issuer seamlessly once the bond is priced. “It’s essentially a glorified database,” said Matthew McDermott, head of digital assets at Goldman Sachs, one of the banks which handled the EIB deal along with Santander and Société Générale. “This technology reduces the number of intermediaries involved in any given transaction.” The bank has had more than 100 one-to-one meetings with investors and would-be issuers about the potential use of blockchain as a result of the interest generated by that transaction, McDermott said. Some of this is just hype around a new technology. I’m not sure it’s quite as revolutionary as it’s sometimes made out to be Blockchain also offers a way to easily locate current holders of bonds — often a tricky task in the relatively fragmented world of fixed income where bonds are often traded directly “over the counter” rather than on centralised exchanges. Billions of dollars have been poured into analytics to help traders locate debt securities to buy or sell, according to Kevin McPartland, head of market structure at Coalition Greenwich. “A universal database of who owns what, at least in theory, avoids the need for that,” he said. Issuers would also find it much easier to communicate with investors — some bonds, for example, contain clauses which allow bondholders to sell back to the company if it changes hands. Moreover, banks could also save money on fees charged by trading venues and allow deals to be negotiated without giving away data to the rest of the market.

The HSBC report, which was co-authored by the Sustainable Digital Finance Alliance, recommended the setting up of “DIY” bond platforms on blockchain, which would enable smaller companies to tap debt markets with a minimum of fixed costs. Some of the claims made about its potential may be overblown, McPartland said. The massive investment necessary to change the systems that underpin debt markets will probably happen slowly, and regulators won’t necessarily approve, he argued. “Distributed ledgers will have a role to play in helping markets become more liquid and transparent,” he added. “But some of this is just hype around a new technology. I’m not sure it’s quite as revolutionary as it’s sometimes made out to be.” ","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Tommy Stubbington","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-06-30","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/e6e7d9d6-7778-4286-ba6f-e5831fcbc538","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fc5f426a8-e368-4e94-a187-22ae11cb47cd.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Regulators begin to grapple with DeFi","INTRO":"Blockchain projects that aim to cut out the middleman are growing so fast that regulators risk being overwhelmed","DETAILED_CONTENT":"On private video calls last week, some of the world’s fastest-growing cryptocurrency start-ups educated global financial regulators on a corner of the market that has largely evaded oversight: the booming world of decentralised finance. The event featured presentations by the decentralised exchange Uniswap and derivatives trading venue dYdX, among other popular so-called DeFi programs, according to people familiar with the conference. Representatives from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission also attended the event, which was hosted by the International Organization of Securities Commissions, the people said. The gathering, which has not been previously reported, shows how financial regulators have begun paying greater attention to DeFi, a collection of cryptocurrency projects that aims to cut out the middleman and provide financial services such as lending and trading using automated software programs. Lawyers and cryptocurrency advocates said the rapid growth of DeFi in the past year had caught authorities off guard, while also raising unprecedented questions about the nature of financial regulation. Bitcoin is the most high-profile effort to bypass traditional financial systems but the so-called DeFi sector extends far beyond cryptocurrencies into insurance, derivatives trading and even savings accounts. In the US, CFTC commissioner Dan Berkovitz has suggested that many DeFi apps could be illegal, and SEC chair Gary Gensler has singled out the programs as raising “a number of challenges” for investors and regulators. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click “There’s so much happening so quickly that regulators just cannot respond, as a practical matter,” said Lewis Cohen, a partner at DLx Law, a cryptocurrency law firm. Cohen compared the boom in DeFi to a “giant DDoS attack on global financial regulation”, referring to a kind of cyber security assault where hackers overwhelm their targets with huge volumes of activity. A representative for Iosco declined to comment on the event, saying that it had been organised to “support internal work”. The CFTC confirmed the agency’s attendance but declined to comment on the discussions. Uniswap, dYdX and the SEC declined to comment. While employees at DeFi projects said they would welcome clearer guidance from regulators, increased oversight could pose an existential threat to the growing sector, which has ambitions to create an entirely new financial system. Regulators have traditionally monitored the activity flowing through intermediaries such as banks, and may decide that the decentralised nature of DeFi apps makes the sector unaccountable. Founders of some of the largest projects, such as Uniswap, have begun introducing governance systems that aim to spread responsibility for the apps among their users, rather than with a central authority. Several projects have also distributed tokens that have surged in value in the past year, raising concerns that regulators might classify them as securities and introduce greater oversight. The total assets pledged as collateral in DeFi applications has soared in the past year, growing from less than $2bn to more than $50bn, according to data collected by DeFi Pulse. Cryptocurrency advocates have resisted early attempts to regulate the underlying software programs, arguing that the open-source projects are protected speech. “If you try to put prior restraint and permission-based regulations on these activities, what you’re basically doing is creating a ban on certain types of speech,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, an advocacy group. An early flash point emerged around new guidelines developed by the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental organisation that develops standards to prevent global money laundering. A draft version of the group’s newest guidance appeared to widely expand the group’s definition of “virtual asset service providers” to include decentralised software programs. Cryptocurrency groups have protested against the measures, which could force DeFi apps to begin implementing know-your-customer rules similar to those required of banks, and FATF said on Friday that it would delay the final guidance until October. US regulators have also taken notice. Berkovitz, the CFTC commissioner, said in a recent speech that automated software programs for derivatives trading appeared to violate the Commodities Exchange Act, which requires futures contracts to trade through regulated bodies and bars individuals with less than $10m of invested assets from entering swap contracts. “I’m totally open to having certain applications that can be done more efficiently without intermediaries,” Berkovitz said in an interview. “But the intermediaries in many respects do serve an important function, and we can hold them accountable.” Berkovitz’s comments suggested that the CFTC could begin regulating DeFi apps if they begin replicating traditional derivatives markets. So far, though, the CFTC and SEC have not taken any concrete action against DeFi. Recommended “If it were to be an unregulated direct competitor in the futures market, that would be problematic,” Berkovitz said. DeFi project founders argued that users of their open-source software programs benefited from transparent, rules-based systems for executing transactions. For the SEC to take action against DeFi, it would need to assert “securities jurisdiction” over the programs and their related digital assets, said Michelle Bond, chief executive of the Association for Digital Asset Markets, a cryptocurrency industry body. “Just as a doctor shouldn’t recommend heart surgery for a knee scrape, regulations from one asset class or platform shouldn’t be broadly applied to non-similar asset classes or technologies,” Bond said. Antonio Juliano, founder of dYdX, said the project had held multiple discussions with the CFTC, and its so-called perpetual contracts were not yet available for trading in the US largely for regulatory reasons. “A lot of things that had to be done manually before, no longer have to,” Juliano said. “That’s great for investors.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Miles Kruppa Gary Silverman","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-06-26","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/b06e84a6-2a8e-4816-a62c-c30b2b922811","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F9951b652-9ba3-4262-8278-50a7d0a45fd2.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin and the wealthy","INTRO":"The very rich are adding fuel to the bitcoin boom but many are wary of a bubble","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ten years ago, Sandra Ro was working in finance in London when some currency-trading friends told her about bitcoin. The cryptocurrency had been released only a couple of years previously and was still far from a global phenomenon. “Bitcoin was only really known in geeky tech circles and eventually currency traders in London found out about it around 2010,” says Ro. She invested in the cryptocurrency, made a substantial fortune and is now chief executive of the Global Blockchain Business Council, a Swiss non-profit organisation that promotes the technology behind cryptocurrencies. With a background in markets at global banks such as Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley, Ro was quick to grasp blockchain’s revolutionary potential. “What really piqued my interest was whether the tech could disintermediate financial markets. I thought, what the heck?” she recalls. “Bitcoin was trading at a couple of hundred bucks at the time and I bought a bunch thinking, what if it works? And guess what? It did!” Today, bitcoin and its digital peers are becoming mainstream. The hype reached new heights this year after the cryptocurrency gained 600 per cent in value in 12 months. The mania has swept up not only retail investors but also very wealthy people. Ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWs — people with assets of $30m or more) such as Paul Tudor or Stanley Druckenmiller were among the earliest backers of bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, and are prominent in the market today. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are also gaining traction as a store of value for financial institutions. Banks are queueing up to compete — Goldman Sachs is trading cryptocurrencies while Citigroup is considering providing trading, custody and financing services. Billionaire investors openly discuss their cryptocurrency-related investments, while some large publicly listed companies, such as software company MicroStrategy, hold billions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin on their balance sheets. Neither the sharp sell-off that hit cryptocurrencies last month nor the surrounding turmoil should obscure the fact that these are now huge markets, with a combined value of $1.6tn. That is big enough as an investment pool for even the richest private investors and largest family offices. But bitcoin still divides opinion. For some it is an obsession, for others a speculative bubble. Yet financial industry analysts say that few people really understand how it works. To make life more complicated, it has spawned scores of other cryptocurrencies, all based on complex computer-driven calculations but with different levels of liquidity and transparency. “We have seen UHNW individuals and family offices looking into cryptocurrencies and becoming interested in allocating some portion of their investments into crypto,” says Calvin Koo, a Hong Kong-based lawyer at Kobre \u0026 Kim. “But it’s important to make sure investors don’t inadvertently step into a minefield.” Recommended Clearly, what makes the crypto field tempting are the stories of those who have struck gold. Ro is reluctant to say how much she is worth as a result of her bitcoin punt, as she has been targeted by scammers and has received death threats after talking about the subject. But she was able to leave full-time banking in 2017 — the year of bitcoin’s first significant rally, when prices rose from just above $800 to almost $20,000. Bitcoin’s surge to $63,000 earlier this year increased Ro’s fortune. “Let’s just say, I have done very well. I have gone from being a banker to working at a non-profit,” says Ro, who studied at Yale and Columbia universities. “Getting in early because the tech seemed really cool also worked out as an investment, so that’s also pretty cool.” Being an early investor meant she has had to try a dozen exchanges, suffered hacks and been locked out of investments. Her friends have also done well from her foray, as she recalls giving them bitcoin “just to test out how it works”. “I wasn’t surprised by bitcoin doing well, but there were always a lot of risks. There were hacks, regulatory risks and exchanges going bust,” she says. “Crypto used to be messy. Now there are multimillion-dollar companies being built.” Another early believer is Olivier Janssens, a Belgian-born entrepreneur who states his profession on LinkedIn as an investor in bitcoin since 2010. He is also proudly “self-educated” with an attraction to “libertarian and voluntarist” ideas and forged a career as a software entrepreneur. In 2014, when bitcoin was trading at around €600, he became the first person to pay for a flight by private jet with the cryptocurrency. He settled the bill for the trip from Brussels to Nice with, he estimates, 15 bitcoin — in hindsight, a pretty costly trip. “[That] would be worth about €400,000 today,” he says. Crypto used to be messy. Now there are multimillion-dollar companies being built Janssens has also realised actual losses in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, notably in the saga of the collapsed exchange Mt. Gox, one of the largest crypto-linked financial failures. More recently, the huge gain in the price has left early investors like Janssens dealing with the problem of having too much bitcoin as a proportion of their overall portfolio. Some bitcoin investors who vow never to sell their cryptocurrencies are known as “hodlers” (holding on for dear life). “I sometimes rebalance my portfolio when it becomes 50 per cent of my assets. I’m smart enough to sell sometimes — I’m not a hardcore hodler,” says Janssens. Seven years after the Belgian’s historic trip, paying for private charters by bitcoin is not quite mainstream but no longer newsworthy. More than one in 10 flights were settled with bitcoin in January at jet-hire company PrivateFly, where the share of cryptocurrency revenues grew to a fifth of the total. Denison, a US luxury yacht charter company, published a list of its 372-strong fleet in February with prices in bitcoin. Recommended However, Janssens is slightly disappointed in bitcoin’s evolution from a peer-to-peer means of payment to a perceived store of value, which he says is “completely against the original aim” of the cryptocurrency. “It’s interesting to see big companies buy bitcoin as a digital gold, but I have personally shifted my focus to currencies like ethereum,” he says. There are hundreds if not thousands of alternative coins with varying characteristics. Like bitcoin, all are created by computers solving complex mathematical equations, churning out digital code. Some, known as “shitcoins”, are created purely as get-rich-quick schemes. Janssens is among wealthy investors who think ethereum, launched in 2015 and now the second-most traded cryptocurrency, could be bigger than its erstwhile peer. Supporters say it could rewire the financial infrastructure. Billionaire financiers Mike Novogratz, Peter Thiel and Alan Howard are among investors who recently announced their backing of a venture that relies on ethereum. Bitcoin might drop 20% in a day but it’s still up 85% this year; it’s about how far out you see the big picture While bitcoin is just a piece of digital code, ethereum acts as a store of data and a marketplace for assets as well. It can perform the tasks of brokers, exchanges and other intermediaries, with the help of so-called embedded smart contracts. These ensure transaction details are correct, funds are paid and assets change hands as set out in a preprogrammed piece of code. Ethereum is also behind most non-fungible tokens, which are digital representations of things, people or concepts that investors can buy in the form of units of data stored on a secure computer ledger — artworks, for example. Christie’s, the UK auction house, is preparing for the sale of digital tokens created around the works of American artist Andy Warhol. “Digital art is gaining momentum,” says Emma Cunningham, a Christie’s spokesperson. But not everyone is convinced the future is bitcoin-shaped. The cryptocurrency’s volatility might be attractive to investors seeking fortunes. Those who are already wealthy, though, often avoid the rough and tumble. “Our clients have already created substantial wealth, so they’re in preservation mode and only a very small proportion of clients have the high risk tolerance required for crypto,” says Mohammed Kamal Syed, head of asset management at Coutts, the UK bank. That does not mean UHNW individuals will ignore the siren call of extreme profits, says Syed. “All clients have Fomo [fear of missing out], all the time. But with crypto, if anything, they’re bewildered; they don’t understand why it’s gone up or down — because no one knows,” he says. Sky-high valuations this year have raised fears of a bubble — an outcome some hedge funds backed by wealthy investors are betting on. “I believe we have passed the point of peak speculation — crypto and bitcoin have this glamorous image, but that will get questioned ultimately,” says Barry Norris, chief executive and fund manager at Argonaut Capital, a London-based equity specialist. He has started shorting crypto exchange Coinbase and software company MicroStrategy, a corporate holder of bitcoin. Recommended Cryptocurrencies also face broader challenges. A growing concern is their environmental impact — a Cambridge university study suggests the computers used to generate bitcoin consume more electricity than Sweden. Meanwhile, governments in the US, China and the EU are raising questions about the sector’s potential instability and lack of transparency. Criminal investigators say cryptocurrencies can be used for financing terrorism or other illegal activities, while tax inspectors are focusing on investors’ huge capital gains. Koo at Kobre \u0026 Kim says that despite a reputation for anonymity, cryptocurrency transactions are a lot more traceable than most investors think. “Many UHNW individuals value privacy for different reasons, so they often have to make a choice between privacy and security,” he says. But despite these concerns, the potential returns keep the investors coming, including family offices. “You can’t find alpha like this in any other asset class,” says Kevin Kang, founding principal of New York-based cryptocurrency hedge fund BKCoin, whose clients include rich individuals. Kang and his co-founder, Carlos Betancourt, manage $50m of assets in the fund they established in 2018. Among the better-known individual cryptocurrency enthusiasts is Derrick Brown, a former NBA basketball player. Now chief executive of US venture company Free Fenix, he says he is “an investor first and foremost, who also happened to play sports in the past”. He adds that were he starting his sporting career now, he would ask for part of his pay to be in crypto. Brown first invested in cryptocurrencies partly through an allocation in specialist hedge fund BlockTower. “I look at everything from a diversification standpoint,” he says, noting that less than 5 per cent of his portfolio is allocated to cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin might drop 20 per cent in a day, but year to date it’s still up 85 per cent; it’s about how far out you see the big picture,” he adds. Ro agrees. “This is a market at an experimental stage and this is what happens,” she says. “I’m a typical hodler. I believe in crypto in the long run, but I’m not going to put all my life savings in it. I have stocks, real estate, jewellery, art . . . it’s about diversification.” This article is part of FT Wealth, a section providing in-depth coverage of philanthropy, entrepreneurs, family offices, as well as alternative and impact investment For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Eva Szalay","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-06-14","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/949ee788-6630-4aac-9c4d-b6b0a45f4e25","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F82cd41ad-c419-4cb2-8970-ce4f1c3651cf.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How Joseph Lubin became Wall Street’s crypto whisperer","INTRO":"Gillian Tett meets ethereum’s co-founder, an increasingly powerful influence over the future of digital money","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In the summer of 2016, a group of central bankers from the American Federal Reserve left their Wall Street branch office, crossed the East River and headed to Bushwick. Their destination was a graffiti-covered warehouse on Bogart Street, home to a small company called ConsenSys. Joseph “Joe” Lubin, a Canadian programmer in his mid-fifties and founder of the financial software-maker, waited as they walked down the street to a scrappy front door festooned in stickers. The besuited bankers looked out of place in Brooklyn. Lubin wondered if ConsenSys should be worried about them. The Fed officials were there to fact-find. ConsenSys was quickly becoming influential in the world of cryptocurrency, and Lubin was turning his company into the world’s first crypto conglomerate, a network of for-profit projects tied into bitcoin’s biggest rival, ethereum. As such, Lubin was not only an expert in blockchain technology — the databases underlying nearly all cryptocurrencies — but also an ardent proponent of decentralised finance. David Mills, an economist in the Fed group, had plenty of questions for the ConsenSys team. Who could access these new financial platforms? How susceptible were they to hacking? What, if any, was the role of central banks in a financial world like the one crypto’s boosters imagined? “It was a very warm, thoughtful conversation,” Lubin recalls, even though he tried to explain that “the reality you all know and operate in is going to be totally turned on its head in a few years”. The real topic of discussion was trust. The Fed and all central banks are the avatars of trust the world has been accustomed to for the past few centuries: people have faith in the financial system because these large, seemingly competent institutions appear to be in charge. Cryptocurrency proponents such as Lubin offer a different avatar: they want people to have faith in a financial system essentially guaranteed by computer code that normal people can inspect. “It’s a whole new foundation of trust for the world,” says Lubin. “And a new way to organise ourselves.” In the five years since the Bogart Street meeting, financial elites who once sneered at the idea of crypto have come around. The New York Fed, for example, is about to unveil a new cryptocurrency research hub, bringing some of the ideas being championed by ConsenSys into its orbit. The Boston Fed has been studying the viability of building a digital version of the US dollar, the world’s most important reserve currency. A host of central banks, particularly in Asia, are investigating similar ideas. And financial titans such as JPMorgan have created digital money of their own. Wall Street is starting to dance with Brooklyn. If you met him casually, you might not guess that Lubin has been pivotal in this change. For one, he prefers to listen, not talk. And when he does speak, his intonation rises at the end of each sentence, making him sound oddly self-deprecating. (The exception is when he starts to discuss ethereum, which analysts estimate will host some $8tn worth of transactions this year.) Until he hit his early fifties, there was little in his career to suggest he was about to play a crucial role in answering the most important economic question of this century: does crypto represent a revolution for global finance or merely a natural evolution? Somewhere along the way, Lubin became a go-to guy for crypto-curious central bankers, not to mention a putative billionaire on paper. (In 2018, Forbes named him the second-richest person in crypto, worth an estimated $1bn-$5bn.) All of which means this mild-mannered Canadian with the no-flash profile increasingly holds sway over the staging area for the future of money. Lubin was born in 1964 in Toronto to a dentist father and property agent mother. As a teenager, his main passions were squash and maths, a combination that helped him get into Princeton, where he studied engineering and computer science. He forged a tight-knit group of friends, including Michael Novogratz, now a billionaire hedge-funder. “Joe was one of the brightest among us, a forward thinker, but by 45 hadn’t done anything to stand out,” recalls Novogratz. “I don’t think any of our gang would have guessed how things would turn out.” After graduating, Lubin got a job managing the Princeton robotics lab, where he became fascinated by artificial intelligence. As a software and AI consultant, he worked for two computer companies in New York, before landing a job at Goldman Sachs, where he stayed for almost two years. “I was never really a Wall Street person. I was a software person,” he says. His growing disillusionment was catalysed during the 2008 financial crisis when, as he once told a ConsenSys summit, he realised “it was folly to trust all those structures that we implicitly felt had our best interests at heart. I felt we were living in a global society and economy that was figuratively, literally and morally bankrupt.” He was convinced “a slow, cascading collapse” was taking place. Lubin briefly toyed with the idea of moving to Latin America to build a survivalist bolt hole. Instead in 2012, he moved to Jamaica with a girlfriend who was trying to forge a career in dancehall music. For a couple of years he dabbled in music production, while also investing in bitcoin as a hedge against the collapse in traditional currencies he expected to see. In late 2013, Lubin travelled to Toronto to visit his parents over the holidays. On New Year’s Day he headed to a meet-up for bitcoin devotees at a downtown warehouse and met a teenager named Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, now 27, is a legendary figure among crypto enthusiasts; his persona is the basis for the creation myth that binds the ethereum tribe. A Russian-born wunderkind who emigrated to Canada as a child, Buterin grew up in Toronto and became so obsessed with bitcoin as a teenager that he dropped out of college and lived in anarchic computer coding communities in Spain and Israel. Then, in late 2013, aged 19, he wrote a white paper proposing ethereum and subsequently rallied eight software enthusiasts from around the world to build it. (For the differences between ethereum and bitcoin, see the panel below.) Lubin and Buterin only talked for a few minutes the day they met. “But he told me about his paper, and I read it that night and was blown away,” Lubin says. So much so, he joined the band of geeks Buterin recently compared to Tolkien’s “fellowship of the ring” who were working to turn his vision into reality. Over the next few months, they slummed together, student-style, in a series of shared houses in Miami, Toronto and Zug, Switzerland, creating the computer code that would underpin ethereum. Lubin always seemed an odd addition to the group. He was old; many of the others were in their twenties. Then there was his background at Goldman Sachs, as if Gandalf had shown up on the road to Mordor wearing a three-piece suit. “The people who are attracted to, and influential in, paradigm shifts tend to be out-of-the-box thinkers and on the fringes of society,” Lubin says, recalling the free-wheeling mood in the hackers’ houses. “I am an out-of-the-box thinker too, but I can speak different languages” — including that of Wall Street. Many in the group had a strongly anti-establishment bent. There was endless tension between a camp that wanted to run ethereum as a commercial, for-profit venture and those who wanted to make it a mission-driven non-profit instead. Buterin was among the latter, but Lubin wanted to build a business. So did Charles Hoskinson, the first CEO, who was eventually expelled from the group. Gavin Wood, the chief technologist, also left after repeated disputes. (Both Hoskinson and Wood now run ethereum rivals.) Lubin’s interests are not exactly aligned with Vitalik because he is more of a financial type pursuing commercial gains,” observes Alexander Lipton, a finance and maths professor, who recently published a book on blockchain. “Vitalik is a visionary and is pursuing the common good.” Lubin survived the feuds and forged a close bond with Buterin. The middle-aged man respected the “genius” of the teenager’s vision. He “really doesn’t care about material things at all”, says Lubin. “It’s about wanting to change the world.” Buterin, in turn, seems to have valued getting some seasoned counsel on politics and high finance. Presciently, Lubin insisted the ethereum team consult with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at an early stage, and that it hire high-priced lawyers from the Manhattan firm Pryor Cashman to minimise legal risks. “Joe is in the background,” says Novogratz, “but he is as important as Vitalik.” That was Lubin’s other advantage in the run-up to ethereum’s launch: his ability to slide into the background and remain level-headed when personal vendettas exploded. “With Joe, you never actually know more than 5 per cent of what he is thinking,” says Hoskinson. Or, as Lubin observes, “I am not reactive in the way that most humans are. It’s just how I am wired.” He also describes himself as “meta”, referring to an idea promoted by lifestyle guru Deepak Chopra. (In Greek, meta means “beyond”.) “You can take yourself out of the drama of reference and not react instantly and emotionally to things,” Lubin says. “So when other people are reactively bouncing off each other, I have a different perspective.” Meta-ness seems to shape not just Lubin’s dealings with colleagues, but his vision of how cryptocurrency could eventually remake finance and business. In the summer of 2015, Buterin finally launched ethereum via a non-profit foundation. Lubin was at his side, but he had worked out a way to pursue his commercial dream too. His company ConsenSys was a for-profit venture offering the infrastructure to make the products and services around ethereum work. These days, he describes ConsenSys as “just a software company”. Mere “software” is not something the SEC normally regulates. That modest label conceals a bigger ambition. As the concept of crypto has gone from marginal to mainstream, the money-making proposition has shifted. To make an imperfect analogy, once it became clear in the 1990s that the internet was a useful way of storing information, the business contest quickly became a fight between companies trying to help people easily find stuff online. In some sense, ethereum is trying to be to blockchain what Google has been to the internet: a service provider that creates order in a digital mess. But the early years of both ethereum and ConsenSys were rocky. Shortly after the platform launched, a hacker tried to steal about $60m worth of ethereum’s digital currency, ether. “The attacks were perpetuated with someone with a deep understanding and were designed to catch us off guard,” says Lubin. The hack failed. But the saga, coupled with fundraising controversies in 2017 and 2018 at ventures launched using ethereum, caused ether’s value to wobble. Lubin had to let go of about a tenth of the people he had hired to work at ConsenSys when the price was soaring. By late 2018, a Forbes article declared that “Lubin’s ethereum experiment is a mess” with “cryptopia in crisis” and asked how long the venture, largely funded by Lubin’s vast stock of ether, could survive. Lubin insists that ConsenSys was “almost intentionally decentralised”. It aims to seed and launch numerous ethereum projects, not control them all itself. This approach also created a sandbox in which mainstream companies could dabble in the hot new technology without much risk. Santander, the Spanish bank, started testing ethereum for payments. BHP Billiton experimented with it as a means of tracking mineral supply chains. John Hancock, the US investment company, explored creating a vaccine register. Then there was JPMorgan. Since 2016, it had been running two rival experiments, building a proprietary version of a blockchain system, while working with ConsenSys to import ethereum technology into its operations. “We wanted to test all the different scenarios, to see which would work,” says Umar Farooq, head of the so-called Onyx project at JPMorgan. The bank eventually settled on the ethereum system, and went on to work with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Temasek and the Singaporean bank DBS to create digital money. “We decided that the easiest way for us, as a central bank, to understand this new technology is to get involved in building a system ourselves,” says Sopnendu Mohanty, a senior MAS official. Lubin says Beijing’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, has also been in contact with ConsenSys. This behind-the-scenes activity was a striking twist, especially for long-time crypto boosters. When the mysterious person or group of people calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto first described their vision for bitcoin in a 2008 white paper, the rallying cry was that it should remove all the middlemen and gatekeepers who control global business and finance, allowing everyone to participate in the financial system on an equal footing. That, incidentally, was also the young Buterin’s mantra for ethereum. The idea of an open-to-all system is referred to as “permissionless” — a computing term meaning roughly that anyone can inspect or add code without permission from an authority figure. As institutions such as JPMorgan started to dive in, permissionless systems proved to have a few big problems. For one, the larger they are, the slower they tend to operate, since each new transaction recorded on the network requires computers to synchronise their records with each other. The more people involved in a platform, the greater the risk of hacks and leaks. And while such systems are supposed to build trust through transparency, since anyone can check everyone else’s records, this flies in the face of how banks have historically operated: their clients usually want to keep their finances secret. Last year, JPMorgan sold off its first, relatively open version of blockchain, called Quorum, to ConsenSys for an undisclosed amount and set about building a private system that would only be open to select clients, a quasi-crypto club. On paper, that seems like a betrayal of the whole blockchain ideal. But Lubin and Buterin admit that until a technological breakthrough occurs that can make permissionless systems run faster, private chains are a more practical solution for companies. Indeed, these days many blockchains are so-called private chains or permissioned chains. Users’ trust in the system tends to derive as much from the organiser behind that chain — a brand name such as JPMorgan, say — as the computing code itself or the theory of decentralised finance. So, too, with the central bank experiments. “Distributed finance is not really DeFi [decentralised finance] today,” says Hoskinson. “It’s actually quite centralised.” Another way to put that is that the old avatars of trust, namely large central institutions, remain important. Lubin argues that, in history, “We see these moments of revelation, when someone brings the tablets down the mountain and there is something profound and beautiful there. Then everyone starts to bicker about what the correct interpretation is, and we are in that moment now.” Rhetoric has collided with reality. “We were always really interested in this convergence strategy where revolutionaries build out this infrastructure and then meet the evolutionaries in their comfort zone,” he says. He thinks these private blockchains will eventually be interlinked. “We have always been pragmatic,” Lubin notes. Not to mention commercial. In the late summer, I found myself staying a few miles away from Lubin out on Long Island. So on a glorious sunny day, as we paced down a vast sandy beach, I quizzed him about where crypto is headed next. In many ways, the future seemed almost as bright as the summer skies: activity in ethereum is exploding. Last year ConsenSys restructured itself with $65m investment from JPMorgan, UBS and Mastercard, and is now engaged in a proliferating set of projects with financial institutions and central banks. It is developing new tests with non-financial companies too. Artists such as Damien Hirst are starting to use the platform to sell unique, time-stamped digital creations. Hollywood is looking into doing the same. “We are making a lot of money,” says Lubin, which is impossible to verify in detail, since ConsenSys is private. Nor would you know it from his scruffy jeans and T-shirts. Lubin shuns the glitzy toys of most Wall Street financiers and says that, on the rare occasions when he is not working, he hangs out with his fashion-designer girlfriend, cooking and engaging in simple pleasures such as caring for their pet tortoises. He doesn’t even own a car. “People like me have lots of houses,” says Novogratz. “Joe doesn’t do any of that.” Lubin says, by way of explanation, that he “never did ethereum or anything in my life for money” but because “I had an opportunity to build something profound that I think will transform life on the planet for a pretty long time”. Maybe. He also knows that the vision that drives him and Buterin is still in its infancy, and the sands could shift again. For one thing, regulators are increasing their scrutiny. For another, ethereum still faces unresolved technical challenges limiting how many transactions it can process at speed. Proponents argue this will be resolved when an important technological upgrade takes place early next year (the move from a “proof of work” system to “proof of stake”, which is far less energy-intensive). But the maths professor Lipton retorts that it will be hard to “fix” ethereum. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click “Ethereum [introduced] this brilliant idea of smart contracts. But I don’t think that ethereum is the last word in this,” Lipton says. “Other [blockchain] systems, like Cardano and Polkadot, use more advanced payment systems, are cheaper and they are going to win.” Cardano and Polkadot are rival platforms launched by Hoskinson and Wood, former members of Buterin’s “fellowship”. Lubin insists he is unruffled by his colleagues-turned-rivals or the doubts about ethereum’s long-term viability. “When people say ethereum won’t scale, that is pretty naive. You should never say that about technologies,” he says, arguing that history shows that people always overestimate how quickly new innovations will catch on and underestimate the scale and speed of disruption that can occur when those ideas are finally embraced. “Just look at the internet,” Lubin continues. “A few decades ago, nobody could imagine that. But it scaled to support all the economically viable use cases. Blockchain will do the same thing.” As I listen to him speak, part of me remains sceptical. No matter how much I read about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, something always remains opaque. Possibly sensing my doubt, Lubin asks, “Why am I doing this, rather than just hanging out in nightclubs? We are building a new organising principle for the planet and a new foundation of trust. Don’t you think it would be a good thing for humanity?” I wonder. Then I remember how many central bankers seem to think Lubin is on to something. Launched in 2009, bitcoin promised a form of online currency secured without a central authority, as opposed to government-issued currencies. Over time, one of the innovations underlying bitcoin — the blockchain — appeared to be useful for other purposes. The blockchain is a database that stores information in a way that decentralises control. Ethereum uses blockchain technology not just for maintaining a payment network, but also for storing computer code that can be employed for financial applications such as contracts. Ether is the currency used by applications and contracts on the ethereum network. Although it was supposed to complement bitcoin, ethereum has become a competitor on cryptocurrency exchanges.

Why? Well, a number of Tory parliamentarians — Grant “Michael Green” Shapps, Baroness “cryptocurrency expert” Mone, and Eddie “a blockchain for Bloxwich” Hughes, to name but a few — had got decidedly excited about the potential of the distributed technicolour dream-ledger and the wondrous strings of 1s and 0s that run on it (which some call “cryptocurrencies”). With Mone’s “EQUI” project having flopped pretty spectacularly, Shapps deciding to quit the ICO he was “advising” as soon as we found out about it because he “just want(ed his) time back”, and with the market town of Bloxwich still apparently not actually running on a blockchain, it has been a bit quiet on that front lately. Yes, Cummings recently came out as a blockchain bro but these days he’s largely just a blogger, and it’s not like he was ever running the country or anything like that (don’t be so cynical). Fear not though, all ye coiners, as there is a new kid on the Tory crypto block and he is here to help. Introducing Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Conservative MP for Tonbridge and Malling, a former Territorial Army officer and co-founder of the China Research Group: As Tugendhat told crypto podcast Bankless, this was — believe it or not — the first mention of “the flippening” in our great parliament (“the flippening” is crypto parlance for the hypothetical moment that the “market cap” of ether, the crypto token underpinning ethereum, overtakes that of bitcoin). A proud moment for Britain. The video embedded in the tweet is just a partial clip of Tugendhat’s comments during the May 18 Queen’s Speech debate (which wasn’t actually about crypto or fintech or anything of the sort; this was shoehorned into a debate on housing). Tugendhat posted the full thing on Facebook, which you can watch here. If you’d rather not, here’s an excerpt (emphasis here, and elsewhere, ours): This bill - this speech - does not cover the changing nature of currency, the changing nature of the economy, and the innovations that we’re seeing online through various forms of cryptocurrencies. I’m not going to go in, in the few moments left to me, of (sic) the flippening and why I’m going to be bullish on ether and not bitcoin, or the nature of the change in the Treasury that is needed to enable innovation that sees the sharing of prosperity on a global basis rather than a local one . . .  This Treasury needs to create a safe space for cryptocurrency development. Because setting the standard for this new economy will shape a new electronic age; a new digital world. Just as our laws - the laws passed in this place and in that old parliament - created the trading economy that enabled so many to prosper under concepts of individual ownership, of corporate responsibility, and indeed private power - we now need to see those values injected into a new change. If we do not get this right, those standards will be set by authoritarian governments with no interest in innovation, or in wild places where there is no regulation and no accountability. As we come to the end of this Queen’s Speech tomorrow I hope the government - and the Treasury in particular - will reflect very hard on the nature of crypto exchanges because they fundamentally will be underpinning, the understanding, of a new trading world. Tugendhat also recently posted a monologue on SoundCloud following his speech in parliament, in which he goes into a bit more detail, concluding with this: When the queen’s head leaves the coin and goes on to the blockchain it will be because that constancy that she has enabled through her reign has enabled innovation, entrepreneurialism - adventures, if you like, off it - and given people the confidence and stability to know that whatever change comes, it won’t disorientate and it won’t leave them lost. That’s the speech I wanted to give. I hope it makes sense. Thank you for listening. Now when we heard this we felt a little bad about dashing his hopes, but we had to be honest: it made absolutely no sense to us at all. So we thought we’d better get Tugendhat on the blower and ask him to clarify. Our first question for Tugendhat was a fairly obvious one: in his entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests, there was no mention of any crypto HODLings. Yet in parliament he said he’s “bullish” on ether. So we asked, does he hold any of the thinking man’s crypto? Oh, pennies. I don’t have any money, I’m an MP. Right. So how many pennies? Oh about £500? Something like that - not more. Peanuts. We put it to him that given he had bought some crypto, it struck as a little bit unethical that he seemed to be shilling it in parliament, particularly given that he hadn’t disclosed his holdings. For £500? It’s peanuts. When we put it to him that £500 is not actually “peanuts” for many people and that, furthermore, in the Wild West of crypto, things can increase in value by several-thousand per cent at the drop of an Elon Musk tweet, he said: It’s not like I put thousands of per cent in there. I put pennies in there and they bounce around. All I’m doing at the moment is using it to see how the thing works. I’m not investing in it. I don’t have a serious investment in it and I’m not going to have a serious investment in it, because I don’t — it’s not something I have. We guess because he didn’t put “thousands of per cent in there”, it’s fair enough that he didn’t disclose it. Ahem. At this point, we began to feel that Tugendhat didn’t have the firmest grip on what he was talking about. And this feeling intensified when he started talking about “predict(ing) the future”: People look at it like it’s currency - it’s not currency, it’s nothing to do with currency. It’s to do with the ability to understand and predict the future - effectively to write algorithms that answer future questions on the basis of considerations agreed today. That’s what Ethereum’s decentralised contracts are - effectively they’re ways of doing legal cases without courts . . .  That’s what it’s all about, it’s not about whether bitcoin gets to $50,000. That’s why I’m bullish on ethereum not bitcoin. Bitcoin might well get to $100m, I haven’t got a clue - there you’re just speculating on gold, that’s all you’re doing. Whereas with ethereum you’re speculating on future contracts, based on a different kind of ledger - one that doesn’t require a complete redrawing of the ledger every time you draw on it. Look, Tugendhat seemed to us like a decent enough guy. He was a good sport on the phone and admitted that some of what he had said was “because I’m a politician and I’m trying to get heard”. But Ethereum’s “algorithms” cannot predict the future and talking about the “flippening” — which is not about whether the ethereum blockchain is going to enable some kind of new trading environment, but about people selling their bitcoin and buying ether — in parliament, particularly when you are a holder of ether and other cryptos yourself, seems . . . a bit off. And no, the Treasury certainly does not need to create a “safe space” (read: loosely regulated environment) for cryptocurrency development — it’s rather too “safe” already, if you ask us. FT Alphaville feels quite strongly that if you are going to choose to talk about something like this in parliament, your understanding of the subject matter should be . . . better than Tugendhat’s words suggest his is.

Since their creation, they have boomed into a highly volatile and divisive asset class. Bitcoin, the most traded cryptocurrency by volume, has a market value of around $700bn alone, according to CoinMarketCap, but can suffer huge losses from a single tweet. Policymakers have grown increasingly concerned about potential fallout from cryptocurrency markets, launching crackdowns and regulatory consultations. Proponents argue cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to centralised financial systems, a way to wrest control from central banks and stimulate innovation; but the market has also been exploited by fraudsters, while their creation has raised environmental concerns and the spectre of wider financial implications. Here is a guide to the key concepts: Cryptocurrencies are pieces of digital code that are traded as an asset. These digital coins are built on blockchain, a decentralised ledger technology that offers a permanent, immutable record of transactions divided among different nodes. Proponents claim that this offers greater autonomy and privacy. New units are created by computers solving complex equations, a process known as mining. The oldest and best-known cryptocurrency is bitcoin, which launched in 2009. Today there are thousands of digital coins available to buy and sell, but only a handful — such as bitcoin and ethereum — are traded on key exchanges. Cryptocurrencies have steadily crept into the mainstream over the past year as bitcoin gained popularity, and its price has soared, despite its high volatility. In the first few months of 2021, bitcoin rose 116 per cent to a high of over $60,000 per coin, before crashing over 40 per cent since mid April. Crypto exchange Coinbase became the first main company in the space to go public, listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange in March. There are also growing concerns about the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies as the process of “mining” some popular coins is highly energy intensive. This process not only creates new coins, but is crucial to the functioning of the overall network because this is how transactions are logged and verified. Recommended Fears about possible market manipulation, scams and the use of digital assets to finance nefarious activities, such as ransom payments demanded by the hackers who shut down the Colonial fuel pipeline in the US this month, have also caught the attention of global regulators, including the US, China and South Korea. In the broadest sense, cryptocurrencies can be divided into two camps: bitcoin and the thousands of “alt-coins” created after it. While bitcoin remains the top cryptocurrency by market cap, several other coins have gained traction among investors. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has emerged as a contender for bitcoin’s crown owing to its use in the rapidly growing world of decentralised finance, or “DeFi”. Aimed at eliminating intermediaries, DeFi uses computer codes known as smart contracts to conduct and settle transactions in real time. While many alt-coins are designed for serious use cases, there is a large class that are designed as jokes, and some have been involved in “pump and dump” schemes that have caused investors to endure losses. Among the alt-coin universe, dogecoin has achieved huge popularity in recent months. Launched as a joke in 2013 and named after a popular meme of a Shiba Inu dog, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has plugged the coin, causing its value to rise nearly 7,000 per cent since the start of the year despite suffering losses during a cryptocurrency rout last week. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, stablecoins claim to be pegged to other assets, including traditional “fiat” currencies such as the US dollar or other digital assets. They promise lower volatility, which makes them useful for converting between fiat and other cryptocurrencies. Stable coins have seen a huge surge in popularity mainly because they are used in DeFi transactions. Central banks are also exploring them as part of projects around digital currencies. However, many stablecoins lack consumer protections and provide patchy, frequently unaudited accounts of the reserves meant to back their coins. Tether, the $60bn stablecoin, was fined $18.5m by the New York attorney-general over allegations it lied about its reserves. It did not admit or deny wrongdoing in the matter. Central bank digital currencies are official efforts to create a digital version of money using distributed ledger technology. CBDCs are central banks’ attempts to keep control of the monetary and payments system. They would be reserve-backed currencies and could use some of the blockchain technology originally proposed as a way to decentralise markets. These efforts have accelerated as policymakers have grown concerned that private initiatives such as Facebook’s proposed cryptocurrency could have effects on cross-border money transfers and the effectiveness of monetary policy. In most countries, CBDC plans are at an early stage. Officials are considering key questions such as whether the digital coins would be usable for international transactions or just domestically, as well as assessing the impact of these decisions on the broader financial system. The most advanced projects are in China, Sweden and the Bahamas. However, a survey from the Bank for International Settlements showed that central banks representing a fifth of the world’s population have said they would likely issue a digital representation of their domestic currencies. Emerging markets showed interest in these projects, but in recent months discussions have picked up in the US, Europe and the UK.

Over the past 24 hours it has fallen by about a third 40 per cent to just above $36,000, $34,000, $30,000 (although at this point we not only can’t keep up but also can’t even be sure because a number of price sources seem to be having issues pulling data — go figure). In fact, the whole of the crypto space is a bit of a bloodbath, to put it frankly. That darned technoking eh. Oh and China too — they banned financial and payment institutions from providing cryptocurrency services overnight. China is NGMI. So what you really want at at a time like this — short of another tweet from Elon which, let’s be honest, would be by far and away the best thing for creepto right now — is a compelling reason to buy it. All the better if it comes from one of the big names in the crypto world. Enter Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano — a man who objects to being called a bitcoin bro but continues to channel the vibe of a bitcoin bro regardless: As can be seen from the tweet, the Pomp is launching his own pizza company, Bitcoin Pizza. And to mark the 11-year anniversary of the first time someone paid for something — pizza — in bitcoin, Bitcoin Pizza will only be accepting er *checks notes* dollars. The video doesn’t seem to be on YouTube but you can watch it on Twitter by clicking here. In case you CBA, here is a partial transcript: What’s up guys? Bang, bang. [?!] Everybody knows there’s two things I love more than anything else in the world: bitcoin and pizza. That’s why today, we’re announcing Bitcoin Pizza. That’s right. What is Bitcoin Pizza? Bitcoin Pizza is a new national pizza chain that allows you to eat tasty pizza while also supporting bitcoin developers. Here’s how it works: you head to eatbitcoinpizza.com, you order the pizza that you want, you select the day and time that you want it delivered straight to your door, and a local pizzeria in your town will go ahead, they’ll make the pizza, they’ll put it in one of these awesome boxes that we’ve created, and they’ll have it delivered! Right to you, on the specified day and time. Hold on, hold on. You can order pizza straight to your door?! In a box? This is sounding pretty disruptive. Pomp continues: We’ll take 100% of the profits from this pilot and we’re donating it to the Human Rights Foundation Bitcoin Developers’ Fund. That’s right when you buy bitcoin pizza what happens is you’re actually funding bitcoin development. Well honestly thank God someone is looking after the human rights of the bitcoin developers. But what about the local pizzerias? As it turns out: When you order pizza at eatbitcoinpizza.com not only are you getting tasty food but you’re also supporting a small business and bitcoin developers around the world. Got it. So rather than supporting your local business by, say, ordering directly from them, this way you can actually make sure you can redirect some of their potential income into the pockets of bitcoin developers instead. One has to wonder: why didn’t anyone think of this before? But as Pomp points out it’s all in the name of decentralisation: Now we have to be honest, not everyone was as thrilled as us about this new non-bitcoin-accepting venture: But whatever. Haters gon hate. Have Fun Staying Poor bro. Honestly, if news of upcoming bitcoin-themed pizza disruption isn’t enough to shore up the prices, what will? Surely, exchanges won’t have to resort to mysteriously synchronised unplanned maintenance episodes to guard against too much capital flight? Oh but what’s this? By the power of digital transmutation of the Northern Rock queue, at pixel time, Coinbase was down. Down as in actually not functioning we mean, though the recently-listed stock was also down about 10 per cent in pre-market trading. Keep calm and HODL on everyone. Nothing to see here.

And when we say a bit of a moment, we mean that it is on a lunar trajectory (in crypto talk: it is going to da moon). At the time of writing this, it is up over 200 per cent in the past 24 hours — more than tripling in value (for those of you who need help on percentages, it is Friday afternoon after all). Over the past week it’s up more than 550 per cent (almost seven times higher!). Here’s a chart to show you what that looks like (thanks to Jamie “Spreadsheet”/”Loves A Good Pun” Powell for drawing it up): So what’s going on? Well we did a quick inbox search — when bitcoin is mooning we are always inundated with “expert analysis” from shills. But it seems the usual suspects aren’t quite sure what to say — maybe they feel the big serious talk they usually do about crypto would look a bit silly given that this was designed solely for the LOLs? So there was literally nothing to be heard from the usually loud voices of bro-dom. And we know what they think of Doge already: Why do people have to be so cynical?? Instead we got this from David Kimberley, at Freetrade, who is very much on the money (we started bolding bits of this but there was too much to bold so just read all of it!): Dogecoin’s rise is a classic example of greater fool theory at play, Dogecoin investors are basically betting they’ll be able to cash out by selling to the next person wanting to invest. People are buying the cryptocurrency, not because they think it has any meaningful value, but because they hope others will pile in, push the price up and then they can sell off and make a quick buck. But when everyone is doing this, the bubble eventually has to burst and you’re going to be left short-changed if you don’t get out in time. And it’s almost impossible to say when that’s going to happen. This is doubly the case in the crypto markets where a small group of players often hold a huge chunk of the total number of ‘coins’ in circulation. That means it only takes one person to dump all their holdings for the entire market to tank. The latest uptick in Dogecoin’s price isn’t indicative of any meaningful value the cryptocurrency offers, it’s just a surge in interest from people looking to get rich quick. That can make for a fun bet, but it’s not good investing. And if you’re the one left holding on to the coins when the market tanks, you may regret taking a punt in the first place. The good thing about that commentary is that you can replace Dogecoin with bitcoin, or basically any other crypto token under the, er, moon. (And there are many of them — Coinmarketcap currently lists 9,262 individual coins.) There are just two other things that Kimberley misses really. One is the LOL factor. The entertainment element in all of this should not be dismissed, as the great former Alphavillain Kadhim Shubber wrote back in 2018. The second, very much related to the first, is the Musk factor. On Thursday the electric car king jester tweeted this: So there you have it. The explanation for these crazy price moves you’ve been looking for: greater fool theory + I’m gonna buy some Doge for the LOLs + OMG Elon tweeted about it again, wen lambo \u003d number go up. If you’ve ever wondered how to say Dogecoin but were too afraid to ask — especially if you wondered how you might do that with a light French accent — well here you go: Our Dear Leader Kaminska called it “Doggycoin” on Clubhouse yesterday so we thought we’d better clear that up once and for all, particularly if you fancied bringing it up when you’re shivering outside the pub on a Hinge date tonight. But if you do bring it up, why not make the argument that LOL should be just as sound an investment strategy as, say, ESG? It’s certainly a lot more fun, and probably more consistent. After all, in the era of kayfabe, it makes perfect sense.

First there was the 1,500 per cent rally in flailing video game retailer GameStop, then there was the $100m valuation of a New Jersey deli, and then there was a 15,000 per cent surge in dogecoin, a cryptocurrency designed as a joke. “Do you want Tesla to accept Doge?” the electric car company’s chief executive and self-styled “technoking” Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers on Tuesday. The tweet was just the latest of several Musk shout-outs to the digital coin, which is based on a meme showing the face of a Shiba Inu dog overlaid with an imaginary inner monologue: “Wow”; “so scare”; “keep ur hands away from me”. Dogecoin functions the same way as bitcoin — it’s a digital token underpinned by a decentralised network of computers that process and keep track of transactions via a digital ledger called a blockchain. But unlike the original cryptocurrency, whose backers use highbrow arguments to justify and shore up its value, dogecoin has been a joke from the outset. Yet while few people are claiming that dogecoin will “democratise finance”, or become “the global reserve currency”, or fundamentally change the world, since its creation in December 2013 it has hugely outperformed bitcoin. While the latter has climbed a remarkable 7,700 per cent during that period, dogecoin has rocketed by an almost unfathomable 200,000 per cent. In other words, if you wanted to make some money on crypto over the past seven-and-a-half years and chose to buy bitcoin rather than dogecoin, the joke’s sort of on you. Dogecoin gives the lie to the idea that we should take bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies terribly seriously. While crypto evangelists might want everyone to buy into the notion that bitcoin is going to take over from the dollar one day, and that we all need to hold some of it in order to protect ourselves from the evil central bankers who want to inflate away the value of our money, the reality is that their arguments are largely just a self-interested attempt to boost the price of cryptocurrencies. Much like a pyramid scheme, those who got in early on bitcoin have a huge financial incentive to draw in others by any means necessary. But while getting rich is clearly the main motivating factor — and some people have indeed managed to become incredibly rich from crypto — it is not the only one. Buying into crypto should be considered akin to gambling and, like gambling, people get into it not just because they might make money, but also because it’s entertaining. It’s no coincidence that cryptocurrencies and “meme-stocks” have surged in a year in which much of the world has been locked up indoors. It is the result of what Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine has called the “boredom markets hypothesis”. Crypto trading is often more accessible than gambling, particularly in places where betting is heavily regulated, such as in the US. It allows buyers to feel like they’re in some kind of tribe. And while the “LOL” factor might not be considered a traditional metric for working out the value of an asset, that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be: clearly, the extent to which it is fun to buy into something has an impact on how much it is bought, and nowhere can that be seen more clearly than in dogecoin. The joke-coin makes a mockery of the idea that crypto investing should be considered a serious pursuit. Its very existence undermines the notion that bitcoin derives value from its scarcity. While bitcoin’s total supply will eventually be capped at 21m, as written into its original source code, there is no limit to the number of copycat cryptocurrencies that compete with it — there are now almost 10,000, and dogecoin itself has no hard supply cap. Dogecoin’s success makes just as much sense as the rest of the crypto market — people buy into these coins because doing so is exciting, it gives them something to do and discuss with their friends, and of course because it can allow them to make a quick buck. But perhaps it can also allow us to stop taking the crypto project quite so seriously. While we’re at it, we might do the same with the stock market. jemima.kelly@ft.com","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-05-11","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/529eb4e6-796a-4e81-8064-5967bbe3b4d9","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F601c4260-04ce-4902-880b-dd0630fb6221.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Tether says its reserves are  backed by cash to the tune of . . .  2.9%","INTRO":"Rather far off from the 100% it used to claim isn’t it?! But still, we now have “unrivaled transparency” AKA pie charts!","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Sooooo remember Tether? The last time we wrote about the “dollar-backed” stablecoin around these parts was back in February, after the New York District Attorney’s office decided to suspend the company — and sister crypto exchange Bitfinex — and fined them $18.5m in a settlement because of their “illegal activities” in the state. That was, you might recall, on the basis that the companies had deceived the market by overstating their reserves, and by covering up approximately $850m in losses. You might have thought all this would have some kind of negative impact on Tether — which is pegged to the dollar — or even the wider crypto market, given how much crypto trading is done via Tether. But no, don’t be silly this is CREEPTO!! Since the settlement in February, when Tether was worth a piddling $35bn, it’s actually increased its circulation by more than $20bn to about $58bn. But what does this number actually mean? Yes, it represents the total value of these tokens that are washing about the cryptosphere, but what stands behind them? Tether used to claim all its tokens were backed one to-one by US dollars held in cash reserves, but in an April 2019 affadavit, its general counsel Stuart Hoegner revealed that in fact only 74 per cent of Tethers were backed by “cash and cash equivalents”, with the rest in a “less liquid form”. Under the terms of its February settlement with the NYAG, Tether agreed that it would provide quarterly breakdowns of the assets backing its tokens. So, on Thursday it appeared to say it had done that, as proudly announced by Chief Technical Officer Paolo Ardoino on Twitter (though rather than referring to the NYAG he says it is the “#crypto community” that asked for it 🤔): That link in the tweet takes you here, to a PDF demonstrating its unrivalled transparency, which is a whole . . . one page long. It doesn’t appear to have been audited but who cares, it’s not like trusting intermediaries is a problem for this community is it? Here is the breakdown, as of March 31 2021 — it should be noted that this is the first time since launching in 2014 that Tether has actually released any kind of breakdown of its reserves, so to that extent yes, unrivalled indeed: As you can see, the blue pie chart shows that 75.85 per cent of Tether’s reserves are, according to the company, backed by “Cash \u0026 Cash Equivalents \u0026 Other Short-Term Deposits \u0026 Commercial Paper”. The smaller, orangier pie chart breaks down that 75.85 per cent, and it turns out that the stablecoin that used to say it was 100 per cent backed by cash reserves is in fact . . . 2.9 per cent backed by cash reserves (3.87 per cent of the 75.85 per cent). Fancy that! We asked the NYAG’s office whether this would satisfy their reporting requirements and they told us: We cannot confirm if this will suffice at this time. An interesting response. At this time. Before we move on to the rest of the breakdown, we asked some of our friends — well-known FUDsters, as our beloved crypto-enthusiast commenters will no doubt point out — what they made of the fact that only 2.9 per cent of Tether’s reserves were in cash? Frances Coppola, financial commentator and operatic wonder, told us (emphasis ours here and throughout): Tether’s reserves analysis published today confirms what many people have said for a long time, namely that Tether has almost no cash dollars on its balance sheet. Actual “cash” is 3.87% of what Tether describes as “cash and cash equivalents, which in turn make up only 75% of its total assets. We know from the March attestation that nearly all of Tether’s liabilities consist of tokens it has issued. And we now know there are hardly any real dollars backing these tokens. We have come a long way since Tether claimed on its website that all USDT in existence were 100% backed by real US dollars. Yup. Indeed. It’s almost like Tether thinks it is some kind of bank, isn’t it? Well, kind of. In the 2019 affadavit, Hoegner pointed out that commercial banks operate under a similar “fractional reserve” system, and that this was “hardly a novel concept”. But 2.9 per cent is really quite the fraction isn’t it? And the difference here, of course, is that commercial banks are subject to stringent regulations and thorough independent audits, neither of which apply to Tether. When we asked Tether about this a couple of months ago, Hoegner told us that “Tether does not purport to be a bank, call itself a bank, or carry on a banking business”, and that “Tether Limited is registered as a money services business” and was regulated as such. So it doesn’t purport to be a bank, but it points out that it operates a fractional reserve system like banks. Doesn’t that crypto-cake taste so damn good when you can have it and eat it all at the same time? Martin Walker, director of banking and finance at the Centre For Evidence-Based Management, told us: It is pretty clear looking at the makeup of the reserves — a tiny proportion of the reserves are cash on account at banks — that Tether is operating like a bank but with none of the normal disclosure. They are creating a dollar substitute and basically running a banking and payments business but without the oversight that anyone else doing a similar kind of business would have. How the peg in value between Tether and the USD at exchanges is preserved is beyond any reasonable economic explanation. The resilience of the Tether dollar peg shows there is something rotten in the state of the whole crypto market. And Nicholas Weaver, a lecturer in computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, said: It’s clearly a wildcat bank. The cryptocurrency community seems intent on speed-running half a millennia of economic failure, and this is just simply one of the cases. So what about the rest of the reserves? As you can see in the pie charts, the rest of the “cash and cash equivalents” are broken down as follows: commercial paper (65.39 per cent); fiduciary deposits (24.20 per cent); reverse repo notes (3.60 per cent); and Treasury bills (2.94 per cent). Commercial paper, therefore, represents about half of Tether’s collateral. So which companies’ debt is it that Tether holds via this commercial paper, we hear you ask (we presume it is of the highest quality)? Well they don’t tell us! On this Coppola said: The reserve analysis also shows that Tether’s assets are made up mainly of various forms of long and short-term corporate debt. We do not know if this debt is secured or unsecured, nor what the assets backing it are (if there are any). And we have no idea who the borrowers are, except that long-term loans are not made to Tether’s “affiliates”. The reserves are thus exposed to unknown levels of credit and liquidity risk. I would have expected to see far higher levels of genuine cash equivalents such as T-bills and insured deposit accounts in a reserve report for a financial institution that claims to guarantee redemption at par. There is a very real possibility that in the event of a run on USDT, Tether would be unable to realise sufficient real USD to meet redemption requests. The 1:1 peg to the USD is therefore not remotely credible. If the numbers that Tether reports are accurate — which because they are unaudited we cannot be sure of — then it looks like just over 20 per cent of its reserves are made up of liquid, quality assets. That’s the 2.9 per cent of cash plus the fiduciary deposits, which make up about 18 per cent of the total reserves. And the rest? Well as Walker says: It’s extremely difficult to make judgments about the liquidity or credit worthiness of the other assets making up the reserves because they simply haven’t disclosed sufficient information. We would be somewhat surprised if the NYAG is satisfied by this level of disclosure. Tether have given us some numbers, yes, but they are not audited, and they do not give us nearly enough information to be able to judge what would happen if a large number of people tried to redeem their Tethers for dollars at the same time. Over the coming months, Tether might find itself facing tougher scrutiny. In December, members of the US Congress presented a legislative proposal for the so-called “STABLE Act”, which would require stablecoins like Tether to obtain full banking licenses. “The idea here is to build on the lessons that came out of the 2008 financial crisis, about how to regulate shadow banking and shadow finance,” Rohan Grey, assistant law professor at the Willamette University College of Law, who has been working on the new legislation with Congress, told us. Grey continued: The idea that (stablecoins are) part of the business of banking, and should be regulated as such, is something that is increasingly being acknowledged across the spectrum The growing world of stablecoins arguably underpins the entire crypto community right now. If that collapses, the whole space could collapse. Additional reporting by Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan.

Dfinity is set to release what it calls “the internet computer”, a group of technologies intended to support a new generation of decentralised applications and services that are being developed in the blockchain world. Even before its launch this week, futures trading in the digital tokens that will be used to grease the wheels of its internal digital economy suggested it could claim a place among the handful of most highly valued cryptocurrencies. The highly volatile and thin trading at one point put the aggregate value of its tokens at more than $100bn. “A lot of people are looking for the next, best thing — what is the newest, shiniest token on the market,” said Wilson Withiam, an analyst at Messari, a crypto research firm. “It seems absurd for a network that’s just launched. But on the other hand, it’s a high-profile project.” However, despite the frothy advanced trading, he and other crypto experts warned that Dfinity could struggle to differentiate itself in an increasingly crowded market of “smart contract” operators and distributed computing networks that have emerged in the blockchain world. Work on Dfinity began in 2017, just as the first cryptocurrency boom was taking off. It raised more than $120m from a wide group of venture capital firms and hedge funds, led by Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital. Since then, the project’s core software code has been completely rewritten once as its engineering complexity multiplied and its goals shifted. Dfinity set out to build a faster, cheaper alternative to ethereum, the blockchain that introduced “smart contracts”, or software code that automatically executes when certain conditions are met — considered a key building block for the next generation of apps. In the years since, it has also evolved into an alternative to Amazon Web Services and other cloud computing companies, devising software that could replace their centralised networks with a set of distributed data centres run by independent operators. “It does not seem they are doing anything new,” said David Nage, a principal at Arca Funds, which invests in digital assets. “The market has already matured and produced real applications that have uses today.” Recommended These include other ethereum rivals such as Polkadot, Solana and Flow, which have carved out positions in distinct markets such as gaming and a class of digital assets known as NFTs, Nage said. There has also been a wave of new ventures designed to promote distributed computing resources, such as storage services Filecoin and Storj. Dfinity’s “internet computer” amounts to a full set of technologies that replicate what these and other crypto projects are doing. Dominic Williams, the project’s founder, cast it as the single platform for what has come to be known as Web 3.0 — a decentralised set of services that could challenge the power of companies such as Facebook and Google. But he also tried to depict it as a complement to other blockchain projects, for instance allowing other crypto participants to move their computing out of Amazon’s data centres and move it into the Dfinity network. Williams compared the craze in cryptocurrencies to the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s, when the vast majority of speculative ventures imploded, but a handful of survivors went on to become internet giants. “It’s very speculative, it’s very crazy,” he said. “We think in terms of five, ten, twenty-year milestones.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Richard Waters","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-05-09","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/c9f5a75a-3e67-4a06-bc4c-182698c8a5df","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F9f45f1b5-0906-4803-a8db-f8e267254fbf.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Law firms chase a piece of the crypto action","INTRO":"The legal grey areas in this field have opened up opportunities for lawyers to become trusted advisers","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When Scott Thiel first tried to talk to colleagues and contacts about digital tokenisation almost three years ago, he says it was like “shouting into a hurricane”. The DLA Piper lawyer had spent days holed up in a Hong Kong attic writing a paper on the implications of digital proofs of ownership for virtual or physical assets. But many potential clients were still wary after the so-called crypto winter of 2018, when cryptocurrencies fell in value dramatically. Now, that audience has suddenly started listening. Cryptocurrencies have taken off — bitcoin’s value has jumped 400 per cent in the past year. And interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) — a digital token or digital collectible — exploded this year after an NFT representing a digital work by artist Beeple sold for $69.3m in an online auction at Christie’s in March. Lawyers are trialling new approaches and technology to make business faster and more transparent. Scroll down to read case studies in best practice It later emerged that the buyer owns an NFT fund and already owns Beeple’s work, so the figure may not ultimately represent the true value of NFTs. However, an NFT for the first ever tweet was sold for $2.9m by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, while an NFT for a gif of a flying cat sold for more than $500,000. Recommended In essence, non-fungible tokens are lines of code, letters and numbers saved on the blockchain: an immutable register on a network of computers and also the digital ledger underpinning cryptocurrencies. When artists sell an NFT, they do not sell the underlying artwork and they retain intellectual property rights to their work. NFTs are similar to certificates of ownership but, importantly, are not actually attached to an underlying physical asset, or legally binding. Still, the scope for digital tokenisation, more generally, is wide. Thiel — who studied law and computer science at the University of Melbourne and has spent most of his career as a technology lawyer — says it is also possible to issue a token that is backed by a physical asset, such as a painting, property or wine collection. This conveys ownership of the asset and turns that asset into something that can be digitised, traded and put on the blockchain. DLA Piper and its Aldersgate subsidiary, which sets up and runs new businesses outside traditional legal services, has built a blockchain-based tokenisation engine. Called Toko, it allows companies to create fractions of any asset and issue security tokens that can be traded. This type of token could help asset owners tap into new sources of funding and reach a wider group of potential investors, argues Thiel. It could also improve the liquidity of certain assets — such as a wine collection — that cannot easily be traded on an electronic exchange. Last November, Toko’s first project was tokenising a piece of fine art commissioned and purchased by a group of Thiel’s Hong Kong partners at DLA Piper, as an unregulated security offering. Recommended The painting by Chinese artist Wang Xiaobo, depicts a white horse grazing in a meadow with vivid orange flowers. The painting was divided into 16 squares, with one digital token created for each square. Each tokenholder has a one-sixteenth image of the painting on the token and also has paid for and owns the same fraction of the painting. “There was a bit of a market, with some partners wanting the sky and others wanting the flowers,” Thiel says. Toko can handle NFTs (backed by virtual assets such as a video clip) as well as digital tokens that represent fractions of a physical asset, such as a building or painting or intellectual property rights. “This is where it becomes exciting — we say to clients, what do you want to do?” Thiel says. It was easier for us to build a tokenisation engine than it is for technology firms to build a law firm In theory, investors will gain access to assets previously unavailable to them, and asset owners will be able to create unique product structures. A real estate owner, for example, could fractionalise an iconic building — usually an illiquid asset — into 100,000 digital tokens representing parts of the building, and the tokens could be sold and traded by investors. However, potential users, including clients, have to be aware of the many compliance risks around digital token issuance. Anyone dealing with digital tokens must understand their status under US securities law, for instance. The crypto world is so new that it is unclear whether an individual token or NFT would have the characteristics of an investment contract, meaning it would be regulated under US law. Recommended With so much hype surrounding NFTs and digital tokenisation, investors may be wary of a bubble and a clampdown by global regulators. Allen Huang, associate professor of accounting at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, warns that NFTs and digital tokens give rise to legal ambiguities. One question is which country taxes are payable in when an asset is held virtually on the internet. “There are also regulatory issues about how to stop people using NFTs for money laundering,” Huang says. “And there are issues around blockchain, especially some of the newer ones: what happens if you have an NFT held on one particular blockchain and that blockchain becomes defunct after a few years?” This is where law firms could have an advantage over tech company rivals, because they can ensure the tokens are legally compliant and give investors confidence. Indeed, Thiel says clients are reassured that a law firm is involved. “It’s a complex legal environment, but tech companies want to build something as quickly as they can,” he says. “It was easier for us to build a tokenisation engine than it is for technology firms to build a law firm,” he notes. “Technology firms don’t understand the complexities of securities law in 50-plus markets around the world.” Recommended Huang agrees that it gives investors a degree of reassurance when professional advisers move into this market: “Investors are definitely more comfortable with traditional players stepping in and with law firms or big accountants playing a clarifying role.” He notes that law firms have become more innovative in recent years in areas such as smart contracts and are hiring people with legal and programming knowledge. “[Law firms] also realise that these companies are now becoming big businesses — as well as potential clients — and they cannot simply ignore them and stay stuck in the 20th century.” That “trusted adviser” role may come under increasing scrutiny, as the rush for NFTs and digital tokens shows little sign of slowing. High valuations of tokens lead some to believe the market has become a bubble. In March, a work by UK street artist Banksy was burnt and destroyed in a video streamed on social media. An NFT representing the video was then sold for $380,000. The original work — titled, ironically, “Morons” — depicted an auction at Christie’s. “Does it mean NFTs are a bubble? I think it does, but it does not mean NFTs have no value,” Huang says. “In the future, I see artists or musicians using NFTs to . . . allow people who buy NFTs to attend special talks or get exclusive access to a music gig or videos. “Before this type of technology, it was difficult [for artists] to know who held their artwork or who were their biggest supporters.” Researched and compiled by RSG Consulting. “Winner” indicates the organisation won an FT Innovative Lawyers 2021 award; other organisations are listed alphabetically.

Blockchain increases efficiency by automating processes so they can run outside trading hours and also require lower transaction fees. The automated nature of the platform limits ways in which the tokens can be misused. The firm has demonstrated proof of concept by tokenising a piece of fine art. Commended: Scott Thiel. Atsumi \u0026 Sakai The firm worked with Japan Post — the logistics, insurance and banking company — to centralise its whistleblowing procedures after the Japanese stalwart mis-sold insurance, causing a scandal in the country. Complaints, which used to be handled by 49 departments, can now be logged through a single platform. The firm’s approach is notable in Japan for prioritising the whistleblower. Hogan Lovells Partner Mark Parsons worked with the Hong Kong Association of Banks to create a new regulatory framework for the use of application programming interfaces (APIs) in the financial services sector in Hong Kong. The framework is designed to create a collaborative and flexible contract-based open banking regulatory system, allowing banks and API users to compete to introduce more services and products. Commended: Mark Parsons. King \u0026 Wood Mallesons The firm advised a consortium of three leading Australian banks alongside IBM, the US tech group, and Scentre Group, a Sydney-based shopping centre company, on the launch of Lygon, a platform that enables banks to issue guarantees digitally using blockchain technology. The law firm designed the legal framework, which allows for the guarantees to be issued digitally, and convinced the banks — Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and ANZ Bank — to agree to a standardised wording for the document. This is the first project globally to use live financial instruments on a blockchain, cutting the time taken to issue a guarantee from one month to one day. Kirkland \u0026 Ellis The firm has built a special purpose acquisition company (Spac) team for Asia-Pacific, drawing on its private equity, mergers and acquisitions and capital markets practices, which have experience in Wall Street’s fast-growing Spac market. The firm concluded seven deals in the first quarter of 2021. Nishimura \u0026 Asahi Using legal expertise, communications, diplomacy and corporate strategy, the firm successfully defended Japanese manufacturing company Toshiba Machine and amusement park operator Tokyo Dome from hostile takeovers in 2020. The rarity of corporate raiders and activist investors in Japan meant that the law firm had to call on suitably adapted defence strategies from other jurisdictions. Commended: Yo Ota. Singularity Legal The firm has helped expand India’s nascent litigation finance market over the past year. It has assisted businesses in funding cases that are collectively worth more than $1.4bn, and is advising funders and financial institutions on structuring transactions in India. Singularity Legal is a founder member of the Indian Association for Litigation Finance, launched in 2017, which brings together funders, lawyers, service providers and arbitral institutions to develop self-regulation for litigation finance.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jane Croft","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-05-13","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/9e38bee8-d70a-4f28-a771-c3d77068e9ba","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F504d2855-e7f2-48ab-bdef-f2810c747b45.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain may change equities trading for good","INTRO":"It allows for faster and safer settlement than the current monopolistic clearing houses","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Credit Suisse and Nomura have lately grabbed headlines for all the wrong reasons. But amid their multibillion-dollar losses in the Archegos debacle, nestled a snippet of very different news that may hold more profound implications for the future of finance. This week Credit Suisse cut some US equities trades with the Nomura-owned broker Instinet, using blockchain. This technology has been used before to verify other kinds of transactions. But these trades were a “first” because settlement occurred in hours and not the two days needed with America’s Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, the industry-owned utility that normally settles stock trades. Think of it, if you will, as a financial version of moving from the snail mail of post to zippy emails. Wall Street currently uses a third party, the DTCC, to transfer assets, net off balances and collect margin to protect against losses. But now Credit Suisse and Instinet have dealt directly with each other by recording the trades on a shared digital ledger, and much faster, too. Is this revolutionary? Not yet. The transactions were a small pilot and only took place because the Securities and Exchange Commission granted to blockchain specialist Paxos a temporary “no action” letter, meaning the innovation was tolerated but not formally approved. Paxos is now applying for a permanent SEC licence to compete with the DTCC. It is unclear whether the SEC will agree, or if Paxos could even scale up to snip at the heels of the DTCC behemoth, which handled $2,150tn worth of trades last year. As Emmanuel Aidoo, digital markets head at Credit Suisse, observes tactfully: “Innovation in blockchain technology is [still] incremental.” Even so, investors should take note. For one, the deal is a reminder that there is more to blockchain than the cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin that also use the technology. While obvious to crypto insiders, this point needs to be proclaimed loudly given how bitcoin grabs so much public and political attention. I’d bet hefty sums, in any currency, that non-bitcoin innovations will eventually matter far more. In fact, Piper Sandler, an investment bank, guesstimates there are already around 4,000 financial assets and processes operating on blockchain technology. Second, if the settlement process does embrace blockchain, it may have wide implications. Regulators have granted the DTCC an effective monopoly for four decades. A main reason for this is safety: to ensure trades do not fall apart and undermine confidence in markets. That is fair enough. But the status quo looks increasingly anachronistic. Settlement takes days instead of hours. It also requires large back-offices to process deals, and enables financial groups to skim off fees. It injects other risks: while settlement is under way, precise ownership of the collateral is in limbo. The two-day delay can also leave financial players subject to shifting margin calls, as happened during the meme stock trading dramas this year. In fact, Vlad Tenev, head of Robinhood trading platform, and Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel Securities, were so outraged that they are pushing to break the DTCC’s monopoly. “This is an incredibly inefficient way to operate,” Charles Cascarilla, Paxos’s chief executive tells me, pointing out that $15bn to $30bn of industry capital and twice as much liquidity are tied up in DTCC systems. Using blockchain, by contrast, may reduce the need to post the collateral required to protect against risks while the trades settle. Fees should fall, too. A third point is that if this experiment takes off, it may result in co-operation rather than confrontation. Paxos likes to present itself as a plucky financial David challenging Goliath. But Cascarilla tells me that Paxos has a depository account at the DTCC for regulatory reasons, and that the DTCC is now conducting internal experiments with blockchain itself. Moreover, the DTCC has recently issued a thoughtful white paper that proposes to use existing technology to cut settlement times to one day by 2023, if all its members approve. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs may scoff that this is still too timid — especially as the DTCC now admits it can shrink settlement times if it wants. Crypto-enthusiasts also carp that incumbents have little incentive to innovate rapidly, given they can reap fat fees. As Dan Schulman, PayPal’s chief executive, told me: “Across the world, the financials’ take rate [on payments] has been 2.8 per cent for 10 years in a row, which is ridiculous.” So the Credit Suisse-Instinet deal is notable. It does not mean finance will move to any speedy blockchain nirvana soon, as libertarians hope. There are still huge regulatory and technology challenges to overcome. Nor would everyone even want an accelerated world: if instant settlement occurred, financial players could no longer net off trades, forcing them to fund deals in advance. Even so, the deal is another example of how societal ideas about what looks “normal” in a digitised world have been questioned during the pandemic, and so can change. The two-day settlement system is one such shibboleth. The prospect of that process changing is something we can all applaud. It shows how competition, or just the threat of it, can introduce greater efficiency and hopefully less risk too. gillian.tett@ft.com Letter in response to this column: Folk tale sheds light on equities settlement times / From Neil McNaughton, Editor, Oil IT Journal, Sevres, France","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Gillian Tett","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-04-08","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/fce3785d-ad70-436f-b42e-c478f98941eb","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F0fd99fd3-fa5b-45a8-a8f7-0dc00e217ae6.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin is making all Revolut’s dreams come true","INTRO":"The company is about to allow bitcoin withdrawals to anywhere in the world for UK Metal account users.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"As we all know, Revolut has set out to become one of the Big Boys of Banking. Earlier this year the London-based fintech, which is gearing up for a fundraising that will reportedly value it at between $10bn and $15bn, applied for a full UK banking licence. It has also hired grandees from the world of banking and traditional finance such as the founder of the firm now known as Abrdn, Martin Gilbert, and former Goldman Sachs vice-chair Michael Sherwood. But somewhat paradoxically, Revolut is also setting out to become one of the Big Boys of Bitcoin. It is not hard to see why — the company has never been profitable on an annual basis, even if it has occasionally on a month-to-month basis. And the only months that this has ever been the case have tended to be moments of crypto mania. It was briefly profitable during the bitcoin boom of late-2017, and Revolut said recently that it had been profitable every month since November, during which time bitcoin increased in value by more than 300 per cent. With the company charging 1.5 per cent per transaction and opening 300,000 new crypto wallets per month in December and January — well, you do the math, as they say. But Revolut is planning to change up its bitcoin strategy. Until now there has been what the fintech called a “walled garden” system, whereby you didn’t actually have control of your own bitcoin; rather you had a claim on a certain amount of it and could only withdraw it by switching it back into fiat currency. As of next Thursday, however, customers using their “Revolut Metal” premium account will be allowed to withdraw bitcoin to another bitcoin wallet. This means it will be a real bitcoin transaction, recorded on the real bitcoin blockchain, which has not been the case until now. It will start small-scale, in “beta mode”, with withdrawals restricted to £500 a day or £1,000 a month. Revolut wasn’t actually meant to announce this till next Thursday, but it accidentally did so via a now-deleted blog post on Thursday morning, reported on by AltFi, which the company told us was “due to a scheduling error”. But Revolut did announce it to employees on Wednesday evening, in a company-wide communication. And we get the impression Revolut is quite excited about it all. Employees were told (emojis Revolut’s but emphasis ours): Huge Revolut milestone to announce. Our public beta for crypto withdrawals has now soft launched for all eligible users (UK metal customers). 🚀 And . . . our first user who is not a Rev employee has now successfully withdrawn Bitcoin to their own wallet and this transaction is recorded on the blockchain (wen NFT? 💰) There’s a fun bit at the end after various teams have been thanked: Exciting times 🚀🚀🚀 And also . . . thank to you Bitcoin, for making all our dreams come true — only up 📈 *not investment advice — Bitcoin is a high risk asset not covered by FCSC protection and extremely volatile. Investments may go down as well as up. Thank goodness they added that disclaimer at the end, eh? We were beginning to think they might be some kind of irresponsible crypto bro types, who only seemed interested in making a load of easy money from the huge fees they charge retail investors, and didn’t really seem like the type of people who you’d want to look after your actual hard-earned cash. A shame, though, that they got the name of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) wrong. But it’s an interesting development. Revolut is regulated by the FCA as an e-money institution, but does not have any kind of crypto licence because . . . no such thing exists in this country. The walled garden system meant that, in theory, Revolut wouldn’t lose track of where the money was going — you couldn’t just send your money to a bitcoin wallet in Iran or North Korea, for instance. We asked Revolut how they would prevent crypto withdrawals becoming an avenue for money launderers and they said that “all external crypto addresses that a user adds to their account and all user withdrawals will be screened by Revolut’s blockchain analytics partner”, and that “Revolut’s blockchain analytics tool analyses each address and provides a risk score based on the address’s connection with illicit activity (previous hacks, dark market activity, etc) as well as connections to sanctions list and terrorist financing sources.” All very well, but what about if this is a new address that hasn’t been connected with such activity? They added: In addition to blockchain analytics, Revolut has adapted its own anti-money laundering rules to apply to its cryptocurrency product, which are triggered when a users’ behaviour on the Revolut App suggests an increased risk of money laundering. If these addresses or withdrawals breach any of Revolut’s anti-money laundering rules Revolut will follow its financial crime procedures, depending on the severity of the breach. (As in other fincrime cases we don’t disclose the nature of the procedures for obvious reasons.) Unlike many other crypto companies, Revolut has the advantage of applying financial crime controls to a regulated business and has leveraged this experience in designing the systems and controls surrounding the cryptocurrency withdrawals product. All we’d say is thankfully Revolut hasn’t had too many issues with its anti-money laundering procedures in the world of real money. Revolut is going hard on crypto more generally it seems — it sent out an email to customers earlier this month in which it announced 11 new crypto tokens were now tradable: Unlock hot coins like Uniswap, Cardano and more We’ve levelled up from 10 to 21 tokens with this new drop. In addition familiar [sic] tokens like Bitcoin, you’ll now be able to trade Cardano, Uniswap, Synthetix, Yearn Finance, Uma, Bancor, Filecoin, Numeraire, Loopring, Orchid, and The Graph (We keep telling you, the thing that gives value to all these crypto coins — last count 9,486 of them — is scarcity.) The company also told customers: 2021 is the year of crypto at Revolut! A whole year to bring you new features, new tokens, and more surprises along the way. If you haven’t explored crypto in the app yet, this is a great opportunity to discover something new. With “hot coins” like “The Graph” now available, the opportunity really is all ours. Thank *you*, Revolut, for making all our dreams come true. We know you’re not a bank in the UK yet, but we feel like maybe our money is actually protected by your FCSC (For Crypto Spawns Crypto!) scheme after all. We trust that with you, our money really is only going up 📈 .

The venture, run by blockchain software company Block.one, will be called Bullish Global and has been capitalised with more than $10bn in cash and digital assets ahead of its launch later this year. Hong Kong businessman Richard Li, German financier Christian Angermayer, Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital and Nomura, the Japanese investment bank, have also backed the group. The decentralised finance, or DeFi, market has grown from about $15bn to $65bn since the start of the year, according to analysts at JPMorgan. Supporters say DeFi has the potential to disrupt traditional markets by building a system that bypasses the custodian, record keeping and trading roles that are typically reserved for banks, brokers or exchanges. Block.one has said it will offer automated market making on a decentralised exchange, a development that could potentially offer a radically different way for investors to trade on markets. Instead of using a traditional market maker to persuade buyers and sellers to trade on exchanges, investors will be able to deposit their own assets into a smart contract and let automated computer code handle buying and selling with interested parties. The smart contract will hold funds and take in data, as well as performing settlement and clearing. Owners of assets are incentivised by sharing in the pool of fees that are generated by trading activity. This would replace the so-called “spread” that market makers earn on the difference between the price they pay to purchase assets and the level they are sold at. The process has been compared to YouTube because investors can generate and upload their own content, bypassing established intermediaries. Because all information, including market data and transaction history, is publicly available but anonymous, some experts describe cryptocurrency as the world’s most difficult market to trade in. Trading volumes on decentralised exchanges such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap, which uses the cryptocurrency exchange Binance’s blockchain, have surged in recent months as traders experimented with the technology and leveraged their gains in other speculative cryptocurrencies. Monthly trading activity on Uniswap has repeatedly surpassed that of Coinbase, a listed cryptocurrency exchange. Dave Olsen, president of electronic market maker Jump Trading, said on his corporate webcast last month that DeFi was a potential “game changer” for markets over the next 10 years. Recommended “The intermediaries, the rent-seekers, in financial markets that exist today could very well be disrupted by parties being able to interact directly on [block]chain,” he said. “Bullish’s sheer size and scale combined with Block.one’s experience in high-performance blockchain engineering will make Bullish a formidable player from day one,” said Novogratz, a longtime investor in cryptocurrency technologies. Bullish will use $100m, 164,000 bitcoins, 20m of its own crypto token EOS and an additional $300m strategic investment round for the $10bn capitalisation. Block.one will use its own blockchain, EOS.IO, to handle the business.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford Eva Szalay","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-05-11","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/be796d33-a5e7-4753-98a8-b586f1680d58","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fd76ce582-e610-40a4-99f0-d500dd8c7f8f.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin: too good to miss or a bubble ready to burst?","INTRO":"If retail investors buy, they need to accept that cryptocurrencies come with big risks","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The problem with investing in bitcoin is that it instinctively feels too good to be true. The largest cryptocurrency by volume is worth 600 per cent more today than a year ago, soaring from about $7,000 per bitcoin to $54,000 this week, along the way becoming one of the best performing financial assets of 2020. Despite including some extreme price swings, the year-long rally has so far defied fears of a repeat of bitcoin’s spectacular price crash of 2018. Eye-popping returns are making it difficult for even hardened cryptocurrency sceptics not to consider putting money into bitcoin and many long-term doubters are crumbling. Jamie Dimon, chief of US banking giant JPMorgan, is just one prominent crypto bear who turned bullish in recent years. Recently emerged cheerleaders include Tesla chief Elon Musk and a number of billionaire hedge fund managers who are convinced that as the digital equivalent of gold, bitcoin’s exchange rate against conventional currencies has even further to soar. So is bitcoin just a big Ponzi scheme or a genuine investment opportunity? Should retail investors give in to the temptation to pile in? FT Money has spoken to finance professionals inside and outside the cryptomarket and found that opinion remains sharply divided. The recent stellar performance has turned some bears into bulls. But hardcore naysayers warn that a bubble that has grown bigger is still a bubble. Even ardent crypto fans are reluctant to wager their life savings on an asset associated with hair-raising levels of volatility. Even among these enthusiasts, many limit their investments to 1-2 per cent of their portfolio. Regardless of whether cryptocurrencies turn out to be the digital equivalent of gold in the long run, today they are providing fraudsters with a rich hunting ground. Since the start of January, bitcoin’s value has risen by 85 per cent and in mid-April it hit the latest in a series of record highs at $65,000. Companies that operate in the digital currency sector are attracting a flood of money. In a recent (conventional) stock market flotation, investors valued Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange launched less than 10 years ago, at $72bn, putting it equal with BNP Paribas, a French bank with roots stretching back to 1848. Young people are in the vanguard of investing. In the UK, millennial and Gen Z investors are more likely to buy cryptocurrencies than equities and more than half (51 per cent) of those surveyed had traded digital currencies, research from broker Charles Schwab shows. After a year of spiralling prices, bears warn of the growing risk of a 2018-style collapse. Bitcoin bulls argue that the current rally is different from the 2018 bubble burst, when the price collapsed from above $16,000 to just $3,000. Today, they say, it is driven by demand from professional trading firms and institutional investors whose presence brings stability. Not everyone agrees. “It’s not different this time. There are no new eras, despite what the promoters tell you,” says David Rosenberg, a Canadian economist and president of Rosenberg Research. “Asset price bubbles come, bubbles go, but none of them correct by going sideways.” In contrast with younger investors, those aged 55 or over remain resolutely on the margins with just 8 per cent of survey respondents in this age group trading digital currencies, the Charles Schwab study found. They may be right to do so. Investors globally have lost more than $16bn since 2012 in cryptocurrency-related scams and fraud, according to disclosure platform Xangle. The Financial Conduct Authority, the UK’s financial watchdog, warned this year that investors can lose 100 per cent of their money when punting on cryptocurrencies. It has not sought to block cryptocurrency dealings but has forbidden the sale of derivatives on crypto assets to UK retail customers. As crypto markets are unregulated, investors have no one to turn to for help if they fall victim to fraud. Exchanges can turn out to be bogus and their founders disappear. A new coin might turn out to be a tissue of lies. “There are a lot of scams and criminal operations that target individuals and it’s very important to recognise that in an unregulated market there is no recourse,” says Ian Taylor, the chief executive of lobby group CryptoUK. Another concern for investors is the environmental footprint of cryptocurrencies. The carbon emissions associated with bitcoin equal that of Greece, according to research by Bank of America, because the coins are created or “mined”, in vast computing centres, which burn electricity and generate heat. Crypto specialists say the most important rule for investors is to be prepared to lose all their money. On April 13, bitcoin began a sharp decline, its exchange rate shedding 23 per cent in less than two weeks. Marcus Swanepoel, chief executive of Luno, a retail-focused cryptocurrency exchange with 5m-plus customers, says that in some cases they were overstretching themselves. Luno surveyed its clients last year and found that 55 per cent had no other investments. “Never spend more money than you can afford to lose,” he says. “It’s very risky, there is no doubt about it.” Extreme swings in the exchange rate mean cryptocurrency exposure should be kept at a low proportion of a portfolio, say most mainstream investment analysts. “I understand if you want to buy it because you believe the price will go up but make sure it’s a very small portion of your portfolio, maybe 1 or 2 per cent,” says Thanos Papasavvas, founder of research group ABP Invest, who has a 20-year background in asset management. Borrowing money to pump up trades with leverage amplifies gains but inflates losses. As there are no official rules, trading platforms allow investors to wager multiples of the money they deposit, inflating the amount at stake by as much as a 100 times. “Leverage on a crazy asset class is a recipe for disaster,” says Abhishek Sachdev, a derivatives expert and head of Vedanta Hedging. Choosing the right coin is also important. There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies; most are worthless and some are plain scams. Bitcoin is the oldest, most liquid, coin and it is the one that enjoys support due to institutions investing due to its limited supply. According to its original computer-based design, only 21m bitcoins will ever exist and 99 per cent of these coins will be mined by 2030. Other cryptocurrencies are not limited in this way and the hundreds of available digital coins all have different characteristics. It is also the most expensive per unit but since it can be bought in small increments, there is no requirement to splash out $50,000 or so for a full coin. Ethereum is the second most traded cryptocurrency and has benefited from the tailwind of bitcoin’s rally. The technology behind ethereum is also used in a nascent market dubbed decentralised finance, making the coin a relatively safe choice. dogecoin and the likes occupy the riskiest and most illiquid end of the spectrum. In the UK the easiest way to access cryptocurrencies is to buy a portion of bitcoin on an established exchange such as Coinbase. Given that exchanges have suffered outages, been hacked or collapsed, this is the safest approach, though it is more expensive than other exchanges. Coinbase typically charges a spread of about 0.50 per cent plus a fee depending on the size of purchase and payment method. Fintech companies such as Revolut also offer a way in for bitcoin buyers, but there is no way to transfer bitcoins from the app elsewhere or into other types of coin. Since they may only sell it back within Revolut, investors only nominally own bitcoin via the app. In the US, investors are able to buy shares in diversified cryptocurrency funds such as Grayscale, which can then be bought and sold like other mutual holdings. Institutional investors can also buy into exchange traded products but these are inaccessible for retail investors in the UK. It is possible to buy into products that offer exposure to companies active around blockchain — the public, digital ledger than underlies bitcoin — such as Invesco Elwood Global Blockchain UCITS ETF. These are a bet on technology, however, rather than the cryptocurrency. Recommended Selling cryptocurrencies also has tax implications. Digital assets count as property for accounting purposes and profits may be subject to capital gains tax. Scammers are a growing problem. Some ask investors to send their private keys to their crypto holdings, promising to return with a profit. But once done, there is no way to undo a transfer. Lihan Lee, co-founder of Xangle, advises potential investors to check the past records of any crypto investment schemes, while CryptoUK’s Taylor warns of posting about cryptocurrency investment on social media or cold callers promising guaranteed returns. “If a stranger walks up to you on the street and says they’ll give you £150 if they can borrow £100, you probably wouldn’t give them the money,” he says. “It’s the same with crypto.” “If it’s on the side of a bus it’s time to buy,” screams an advertisement from Luno in London. Many seasoned investors say the ad should say the opposite. If everyone is talking about the same thing, it’s a sure-fire sign that prices have reached unsustainable heights and are about to collapse — as they did in 2018. But in the past 12 months companies and institutional investors have cautiously dipped their toes into digital assets. Since central banks around the world responded to the coronavirus pandemic with easy money policies, large asset managers and hedge funds have been looking for ways to protect themselves from a return of inflation and the erosion in value of of some currencies, including the dollar. “We’ve seen a step change in institutional interest last year,” says James Butterfill, an investment analyst at digital asset specialist Coinshares. He notes that around $54bn of money is invested across 120 cryptocurrency funds. A year ago, the total figure was $3.5bn across 89 funds. “Cryptocurrencies are here to stay,” wrote Christian Nolting, global chief investment officer at Deutsche Bank’s international private bank, in a report. Central banks are even exploring the idea of issuing digital alternatives for domestic currencies. To some analysts, central bank digital currencies lend legitimacy to the crypto space, while others believe it is an attempt by central banks to wrest back control of the market. “Central banks have always thought that they were key for payments,” says Randy Kroszner, professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. “And now they’ve realised they’re not.” But that does not mean that the risks of cryptocurrencies are likely to dissipate any time soon. As the unregulated market bounces through its latest price gyrations, it is a long way off from either stability or security. “Money and IT are my core things,” says Adrian, a financial services professional in his late 40s, who asked the FT not to use his full name to avoid “tax complications”. In many ways, he is the archetypal cryptocurrency investor in the current bitcoin rally. Following his divorce, a pub conversation in 2017 led him to look into cryptocurrencies. Since then, Adrian has gone deep. “I have property, wine, lots of different investments but crypto is by far the most profitable. I look at what I put in and there is no better return anywhere else,” he says. He says he owns about 50 different types of cryptocurrency but has kept as much as 70 per cent of his investment in bitcoin, which he regards as the safest and most liquid option. He is also actively trading — hence his concerns about HM Revenue \u0026 Customs — on various exchanges and in the fledgling derivatives market, using leverage to amplify the outcome of his bets. Venturing beyond buying and holding coins, Adrian has entered the rapidly growing area of decentralised finance, which uses the “digital ledger” technology of blockchain to replace intermediaries in trading, lending and borrowing. One crypto insider describes decentralised finance — also known as “DeFi trading” — as the world’s most adversarial market. “You can make anything between 100 and 1,000 per cent, but it’s probably not for beginner investors,” he says, adding that trading in this area requires a heavy commitment in time and research. Adrian says he will “never” sell his bitcoins but aspires to borrow against his holdings in DeFi markets to buy a home in a couple of years. Having gone from bitcoin novice to evangelist in three years, he believes blockchain has the potential to replace insurance companies, retail banks and central banks. “If you’re selling bitcoin you’re going long fiat. Why would you ever want to do that?” Sachdev has taken a much more moderate approach. The derivatives expert runs financial advisory firm Vedanta Hedging and takes a dim view of overly complex products. He nonetheless started “dabbling” in bitcoin in January this year. “I can give you 20 reasons why investing in bitcoin is a good idea and 20 reasons why it’s a crap idea,” he says, noting that he took the plunge after two people whose views he respects encouraged him to do so. “I did some research and downloaded CoinbasePro.” His initial investment of about £20,000 has so far yielded a profit of roughly 35 per cent. Still, given bitcoin’s volatility he is taking a cautious approach and says he would never use leverage. Sachdev still owns more gold than bitcoin but says this could soon change. “I don’t want to invest any more into crypto than 5 per cent of my equity investments,” he says. “Returns are bigger and quicker than in other alternative markets like art or wine, but it’s a lot more frothy and prone to bubbles because it’s very new.” He would “ride out” any collapse in price, he says, and has had no issues when converting some of his bitcoin into fiat currency. But he also believes bitcoin’s success might be too big for central banks to ignore. Bitcoin’s failure thus far to fulfil its promise of becoming a mundane, ubiquitous means of payment does not worry him, however. “I’m not too bothered about not being able to use it in Sainsbury’s. I see bitcoin as an uncorrelated asset. Just because it can’t do everything it doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a place.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Eva Szalay","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-04-30","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/7df21f05-1365-4e31-bac5-5987658f9f7e","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fbf9dbebf-bf89-4d8f-8681-02efc8f8cb99.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Now you can offset your NFT footprint too","INTRO":"Interested in owning an NFT art piece but stressed by the insatiable energy consumption of the blockchain? Artist Simon Denny possibly has the answer.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In recent weeks it’s become apparent that the serious end of the international art market has decided to go all in on non-fungible tokens that register digital art on a blockchain forever and ever. They’re going to be a thing. And that’s an end to it, alright? And really, what’s not to like for the pros servicing the market? This isn’t the first time they’ve had to contend with the question “but is it really art?” Or had to tackle “I just don’t get it”-type criticism. Not getting the art is kind of part of art these days. At the very least, it is not a reason to stay away. (Especially if there are countless would-be collectors happy to tell you the opposite.) The market provides what the market demands. And in this case there’s also another obvious draw: a huge pool of freshly enriched crypto fans with money to burn on anything that matches or supports the system that enriched them in the first place. Hell, yes! NFTs were obviously going to be the sort of low-hanging fruit the art market could not ignore. And yet, there is one not insubstantial niggle. The art market is not exactly devoid of hip-and-considerate-vegan types who want to save the planet. For them, crypto’s energy intensity is clearly going to be a problem. The irony hasn’t been lost on artist Simon Denny, who has been chronicling developments in blockchainland from its earliest years. Denny’s 2016 exhibition at the Petzel gallery, “Blockchain Future States”, was one of the first artistic projects to unpack the complex politics of the blockchain, and to critically address the major actors in cryptoland. He also joined FT Alphaville on stage in 2019 at our Vaudeville production, where he gifted self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto, Craig Wright, with a cardboard copy of a CryptoKitty. We can now exclusively reveal that in his latest exhibition, “Mine”, Denny will not just be turning his attention to NFTs, but to a kind of NFT “offset”. Here’s the press release: Denny’s suite of NFTs will spotlight themes central to this new exhibition at Petzel Gallery, namely the energy demands and environmental impacts of running data networks such as Ethereum’s. The project recasts each minted NFT as an automated mining unit – a crypto miner – using five second-hand Ethereum “mining” computers purchased by the artist from the familiar online marketplace Ebay.com, where these machines currently fetch anywhere between $3000 - $20,000. Denny has worked with a gaming illustrator to produce detailed 3d portraits of these miners to create new digital artworks. Following their images’ release as NFTs, Denny will retire the mining computers represented from the Ethereum network altogether. Instead of the hardware using the energy typically required to host the intangible collectibles of the NFT wave, the processing power from these machines’ GPUs (Graphical Processing Units) will be donated to environmental research via climateprediction.net, a not-for-profit climate modelling project overseen by scientists at the University of Oxford, using volunteer computing to study and predict climate change. The artist sees this material and market swap as a kind of offset in the NFT world, mirroring “carbon offsets” that many companies today are leveraging to redress the negative impacts of their business practices. The artwork is a poetic transformation between states – moving energy, matter, likeness, and attention from one network of value to another. Now that’s what we call an NFT that can be banged into a 2021 ESG portfolio. The official release of the work is set for next Thursday, March 18. But the good news for those who aren’t exactly convinced by any of the above is that Simon has agreed to come and talk to Jemima and me just as the whole thing launches next Thursday (Jemima will be in a childcare bubble in deepest Cornwall so her appearance depends on strong connectivity). So prepare your quibbles, your cynicism or your love and come and join us on ClubHouse at 9pm London time (4pm EST). We will be sure to have a great discussion, and an important one at that.

Dangers lurking for the digital generation","INTRO":"£9bn in child trust funds are maturing so let’s make it easier for their newly adult owners to carry on saving","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Remember child trust funds (CTFs), Gordon Brown’s attempt to make sure that all young people had something to their name when they turned 18? Well, their time has come. They started maturing in September. That’s nice for any of the young people who were eligible. Even if their parents did nothing about it, there will still be a useful pile of cash knocking around in a default fund for them to find. It will be very nice indeed for anyone with proactive parents with the spare cash to have turned them into junior Isas (Jisas) and kept them topped up, as has been possible since 2015. There’s a lot of money up for grabs here: £9bn in the CTFs alone. The question is just who gets their hands on it, and how. When the CTF or Jisa holders turn 18, their products mostly roll into being adult Isas. Exciting! Until they actually want access to them, that is. The problem is paperwork. A friend’s son tells me that — for today’s young, at least — this is complicated stuff. It isn’t online with everything verified with codes sent to phones and the like. Instead, it involves actual letters on real bits of paper and the production of bits of ID they mostly can’t lay their hands on. You need to verify your ID and address. Most will have a passport (if they don’t, there is a long search for their birth certificate ahead) so the ID part isn’t too hard but, for the address, the list of things most institutions will accept aren’t easy for the average 18-year-old to find, particularly as mobile phone bills aren’t acceptable. Not so exciting. So what do you do if you are said friend’s son; you are finding the access documentation difficult to deal with; and a kind relative deposits some birthday cash into your bank account to help you top up your new adult Isa? If you are over 40 the answer isn’t obvious: you will already be down a rabbit hole of stress about the low deposit rates on cash. But if you are under 20 the answer will be. With the money burning a hole in your bank account, a pile of admin faff ahead and YouTube offering you New-Age financial advice on a loop, you will start clicking. The next thing you know you won’t have what you should have: some nice sensible stakes in a diversified range of investment trusts biased to long term growth. No, you’ll have a portfolio of non-fungible tokens. NFTs are bits of code that attach to anything digital (sound, videos or art) certifying them as unique and hence collectable. You might go to nbatopshot.com, for example. There you might buy a video of your favourite basketball player doing something brilliant as an NFT. This doesn’t mean no one else can ever see it. It just means, for what it’s worth, that you own the moment. Recommended The top NFTs now for sale on the Top Shot site are $250,000. That is chicken feed compared to the £1m I am hoping to get if the FT allows me to turn this column into an NFT and auction it, the $2.9m Twitter founder Jack Dorsey got for the NFT of his first tweet (“just setting up my twttr”) or the £50m artist Mike Winkelmann, aka Beeple, got for selling a digital collage this month. These numbers make no sense. Think of an NFT, if you will, like a Scottish island (bear with me). There is currently a tiny one for sale in the middle of Loch Moidart on the west coast. It comes, says Future Auctions, with a “beautiful outlook and approach” and a “unique opportunity to purchase a space that can be enjoyed with zero chance of intrusion”. The first part of this is true. The second simply isn’t. Scotland has fabulous right to roam laws. You can go pretty much anywhere and do pretty much anything when you get there. Loch Moidart is “extremely popular”. I should think it will be something of a shock to the buyers when they find that they have bought, not a private haven, but a popular local picnic spot open to anyone with a paddle board. What is ownership without exclusivity? The same is true of NFTs. If everyone can watch your video clip, what is it that you have collected? You might say that owning an NFT video which can be copied is no different from owning a Picasso that everyone else can get prints of. But that’s to miss the point. A print is not the same as a painting. But a digital copy of a video of any one slam dunk is identical to the original. NFTs are lots of fun, partly in a speculative isn’t-the-tech-cool kind of a way and partly in a social-justice way. Note that the code can be written so that a payment is made to the artist every time the NFT is traded. NFTs might also be useful to some people — perhaps money launderers. And there are some interesting aspects to the craze: the thought that the whole thing is just another step towards the full digitalisation of life; and the way which the tokens disintermediate the art industry (we no longer need institutions to authenticate art). But that doesn’t mean their current ubiquity represents the beginning of the emergence of a new asset class, whatever the YouTubers might tell you. I suspect it represents yet another minor speculative mania driven by free money meeting free time, and one that will end along with the pandemic and within which danger lurks. We want to hear from readers aged between 16 and 35 on what life is like, and which problems need fixing most urgently. Housing? Education? Jobs? Pensions? The environment? Tell us about your experiences via a short survey. My young friend’s NFT trading account suggests he has made money buying and selling (hooray!). But he has not yet been able to get the money paid out of the platform and back into his bank account (no hooray). There is an important lesson here. There’s a new generation of investors out there. And they aren’t much good with, you know, like, letters. We have an amazing opportunity, right now, to bring these people, and the £9bn in their CTFs, into the long-term investing fold. If we want to have a chance of doing so, depositing money in your first Isa needs to be as straightforward as signing up for an NBA Top Shot account. Providers, adjust your processes accordingly. In the meantime, some advice for those who are newly 18. Do not put your CTF money or indeed your granny’s money into NFTs. This is not what Gordon Brown had in mind.

Never mind that the price of the digital currency has gyrated dramatically; or that Elon Musk, the flamboyant founder of Tesla, is reported to be on course to make more profits for the company from bitcoin investment than from the manufacture of electric vehicles last year. This week it was equally striking that Citibank told its clients that the digital currency has reached a “tipping point” and could one day “become the currency of choice for international trade”. Cue predictable levels of celebration from bitcoin-enthusiasts — and of bemusement or horror from almost everyone else. Yet detractors and fans of the cryptocurrency both seem to agree on one thing: bitcoin is taking finance into the realm of bold 21st-century tech experiments. Is it though? On a week such as this, it pays to take a wider historical lens — and peek at nuggets from the past, such as some research carried out in Micronesia by Scott Fitzpatrick, an archaeologist at the University of Oregon, and Oregon business school professor Stephen McKeon. The pair have been studying an ancient stone money system that once existed on the Micronesian island of Yap, where local communities would treat large limestone discs as a medium of exchange. Such stone discs, called rai, “were considered extremely valuable”, the pair noted in a 2019 paper in the Journal of Economic Anthropology. But the stones were so huge that “given their size, weight, and relative fragility, they were not typically moved after being placed in a specific location [and] if a rai were gifted or exchanged, the new owner(s) of a disk may not have lived in close proximity to it.” That might make them sound pretty useless as a form of money. But the local community maintained an oral ledger so effective in keeping track of who owned which hunks of immovable limestone that Fitzpatrick and McKeon concluded that rai were, as a record of value, “an exemplary ancient analogue to blockchain” (the technology that powers bitcoin). Recommended Parallels between the two are limited. Limestone hunks cannot be subdivided as easily as bitcoin. And, since blockchain ledgers are based on (seemingly) immutable computer code, they appear more durable than communal memory. The circle of participants in bitcoin and blockchain deals is obviously exponentially larger than it was with rai — and pseudonymous to boot. But there are other thought-provoking similarities between the two. First, rai — like bitcoin — commanded value because of perceived scarcity; just as it now requires vast amounts of effort to “mine” bitcoin (the technical term for the creation of new coins), so procuring rai was hard. The limestone discs were quarried from Palau, 400km away from Yap, then carried across the seas. This was the most impressive piece of maritime transport logistics seen in the region until the European explorers arrived in the 18th century and mind-bogglingly difficult for the time (although significantly less environmentally damaging than the filthy process of bitcoin mining, which requires using huge amounts of electricity). The second point of similarity is that rai only functioned like money because there was communal trust. Unlike in the conventional modern monetary system, the “trust” underpinning rai did not operate in a vertical, hierarchical manner — ie, due to faith in a leader or an institution; instead, it was “distributed” horizontally. Everyone in the crowd needed to trust that everyone else would respect the oral ledger. Recommended Bitcoin also rests on the distributed trust of a crowd. For while computer code might seem impersonal, free from capricious human intervention, the system only works if people trust in the sanctity of that computer code. If that ever breaks down — say because of a cyber hack or a shift in norms — bitcoin would command even less value than rai does today. There is no sign that trust in blockchain is breaking down. Indeed, the recent note from Citi claims the opposite. The key point is this: anyone betting on the currency is not just expressing faith in algorithms, but in a specific pattern of trust too (ie, that computer code means something). That does not render bitcoin invalid or the blockchain useless; after all, the mainstream currencies on which our lives depend rely on sometimes tenuous social norms as well. One way to frame the contest between bitcoin and fiat currency is thus as a battle of norms — and of distributed versus hierarchical trust. As the story of the rai shows, when it comes to human economies, nothing is entirely new. In fact, one rumour periodically buzzing round the crypto-world is that this is where the mysterious progenitors of bitcoin got their inspiration (which is why some bitcoin blogs have titles that include the word “Yap”). Perhaps Musk’s next trip should be to Micronesia, where those now-useless stone circles still litter the landscape as a sign of what happens when norms and patterns of trust change Hear Gillian and Mark Carney, UN special envoy on climate action and finance, former governor of the Bank of England and author, in discussion at the FT Weekend Digital Festival, March 18-20; ftweekendfestival.com; ftweekendfestival.com Follow Gillian on Twitter @gilliantett and email her at gillian.tett@ft.com Follow @FTMag on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

The sale was the first of its kind by Christie’s, underscoring the eye-popping valuations for NFTs, which are unique files encrypted on blockchain to ensure authenticity. The collage by Beeple is titled “Everydays: The First 5000 Days”, a single jpeg file composite of digital sketches taken each day for more than 13 years. Bidding opened on February 25 at just $100. The artist, whose given name is Mike Winkelmann, summarised his reaction to the sale with a tweet: “holy fuck.” NFTs have exploded in popularity among collectors of sports memorabilia and in the cryptocurrency community in recent weeks. An encrypted 12-second clip of the basketball star LeBron James recently sold on a secondary market for $208,000, in a new venture between the National Basketball Association and the consumer blockchain company Dapper Labs. The Christie’s sale illustrates the stratospheric potential for NFTs. Noah Davis, specialist in postwar and contemporary art at Christie’s in New York, said the auction house has “never offered a new media artwork of this scale or importance before”. The price tag on the Beeple sale places him among the top three most valuable living artists, according to Christie’s. It also eclipses prices paid for works by other renowned visual artists, such as the impressionist painter Edvard Munch, whose “Girls on the Bridge” sold for $54m in 2016 by Sotheby’s. The sale also demonstrates efforts by auction houses to expand their offerings beyond Old Masters and pop artists in order to cultivate a new generation of collectors, particularly millennials. Last spring, Sotheby’s set a world record for sneakers at auction when a pair worn by basketball legend Michael Jordan sold for $560,000. In September, the New York-based house also presented its first collection of hip-hop memorabilia, including love letters penned by the late rapper Tupac Shakur. Recommended Christie’s said the emergence of NFTs was a breakthrough in digital artwork, a tradition established in the 1960s but whose ease of duplication “made it near-impossible to assign provenance and value to the medium”. According to a breakdown of the bidders for the Beeple piece provided by Christie’s, 91 per cent were new to the auction house, and 64 per cent were millennials and Gen Z. Within the sporting world, NFTs are considered a new form of digital collectible, similar to physical basketball cards, which can be acquired in packs at retail and then resold based on scarcity or emotional or historical value. NBA Top Shot, the licensed NFT platform for the US professional basketball league, launched in beta in October and has since logged more than $347m in transactions, according to NFT tracker cryptoslam.io. Mik Naayem, co-founder of Dapper Labs which developed the Top Shot and CryptoKitties platforms, told the Financial Times recently that “for a new generation of fans, a digital thing may actually be more ‘real’ to them than a physical object”.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Sara Germano","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-03-11","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/83a59275-9a85-464b-af45-aad0e8bd6311","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F5ddaff64-d238-487b-80c5-fc0c98975ec4.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"You are a valuable asset. Tokenise yourself.","INTRO":"Be you, but make it blockchain.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"You might have noticed that we are living through a time of total tokenisation. Digital art, tweets, music, sports memorabilia and even “crypto-flowers” are being minted into so-called non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are saved on to a blockchain (usually the Ethereum blockchain) and then sold for huge sums of money. Like, yuge. On Thursday, a new record was set for a sale of a digital asset: $69.3m for a digital collage by the contemporary artist Beeple. In case you were wondering but were too afraid to ask, the reason these digital “collectibles” are labelled “non-fungible” is to keep them distinct from the more common form of crypto tokens, like bitcoin or Ether, which were designed to be used as currencies (though they are used far more for speculation). Because these tokens were designed as currencies, they are meant to be fungible, meaning that their individual units are mutually interchangeable: the idea is that one bitcoin is always worth the same as any other bitcoin, in other words. In reality, that is in fact not really the case, because the blockchain allows you to trace the transaction history of any given coin, meaning that coins that have been found to have been involved in illicit transactions are “dirty”, and that any coin that has been spent at all is less desirable than freshly mined “virgin” coins, which are sometimes sold for a premium. But that is the reason for the name; NFTs are designed to be unique digital assets, so one NFT ≠ another NFT. But in a world of infinite possibility like cryptoland, the rise of the non-fungibles doesn’t of course negate the value of the fungibles. You can also tokenise something from the real world (not just the silly ephemeral digital one) and turn it into something fungible that you can also stick on the blockchain, by creating a “coin” from it rather than an NFT. One example of this is the plethora of gold-backed cryptocurrencies that exist; another is stablecoins supposedly backed by real money such as dollars. (Ahem.) So real-world assets can be tokenised too. And what could be real-er than, well, YOU? We hadn’t really considered this idea until we received this via direct message on Twitter: Now, “crypto influencers” we may or may not be, but crypto-writing journalists we certainly are, and so we didn’t take this person up on their offer as we felt like it might be kind of off to try to profit from a “space” that we write about. (Not that this principle is paid attention to by all “journalists”, for instance those covering certain electric car manufacturers, but we digress.) However we did have a look at this platform to see how it would work so we could give you the lowdown . . . It’s called MintMe.com, and it turns out that it’s in fact not just crypto influencers who can make their own coins so as to “fund (themselves) for free”. Anyone in fact, the website says, can turn themselves into a coin: Anyone can mint or create a token (coin) that represents themselves or a project that they have created for their fan base and supporters to support them. It helps content creators to realise their maximum potential through a new innovative way of crowdfunding. It\u0027s also a social platform where traders can interact with token creators and other traders. Tokens are created (minted) on top of our custom decentralised blockchain called MintMe Coin. When you create coin or create token [sic], you become an owner of your own financial future. Create a token, create a coin for your project or yourself or just trade other people coins. Who doesn’t want to become an owner of their own financial future!? Who doesn’t want to be represented in digital form by “people coins”? The site also has a useful FAQs section, featuring questions and answers such as: I\u0027ve created a token. How can I give it a real value? Coins are as valuable as you make them, you give them the value because they are a tokenised representation of yourself or your project. As we said above, you see, cryptoland is a world of infinite possibility. Yes, you already exist in the real world and have a real-world value, but the important thing to remember is that crypto is not a zero-sum game. Your real-world value doesn’t take away from your tokenised value. You are a scarce asset, and yet you are infinite. Simples! Moving on with the FAQs: Why would I accept token instead of USD for my work? To get money when you need it. You might need tools to start earning, but you have no money to buy them, so how to start? By allowing potential customers to judge your offer and decide if you are worth their trust. If your offer will be credible, they could purchase tokens that will be worth your service, this way you first get tools needed for your work and customers get the service they needed. Honestly, we have tried to understand this as an answer to that question, but we really can’t. It is a nonsense. Moving on to our personal favourite: Why would anyone believe in me or my coin? Because you have developed a reputation for yourself that certainly has value. You are a valuable asset that can be tokenised as such on the MintMe platform. Your supporters might also feel more comfortable in being able to benefit later from supporting you now. You are a valuable asset that can be tokenised as such. Don’t you ever let anyone ever tell you otherwise! And when we say you, we mean each and every one of you — all 7.8bn-odd of you out there. You are many but you are scarce! Scarcity is value. Value is harnessed on the blockchain. The blockchain’s possibilities are infinite. Infinite scarcity for the win! Oh and can anyone think of other examples of people being traded as assets? Did it work out OK? Either way, honestly this seems like a truly excellent idea no honestly really truly we mean it.

In the US, the National Basketball Association is taking the industry to a new level: selling game highlights to fans as digital tokens on the blockchain. The enterprise is called NBA Top Shot, a venture between the league, its players’ association and a consumer blockchain company that says it is creating licensed sports memorabilia for the digital age. The popularity of Top Shot has skyrocketed in the past few weeks, to the point that a single, 12 seconds-long highlight of a November 2019 LeBron James dunk resold for more than $200,000. A similar clip can be viewed on YouTube for free. In plain terms, Top Shot takes actual NBA highlights, encrypts them into a digital asset known as a non-fungible token (NFT), and allows consumers to buy and sell them in an online marketplace licensed by the league itself. These transactions are saved on the blockchain, which serves as a record of ownership. Each token, known in Top Shot parlance as a “moment”, is given a serial number and sold in limited-edition “packs”, which range from $9 to $230 depending on the moments they contain — similar to packs of baseball or basketball cards. Collectors can buy and sell moments from each other on the secondary market, which has recorded over $300m in sales since Top Shot’s public launch in October, $250m in the last 30 days, according to NFT tracker cryptoslam.io. Players, team owners, and broadcast presenters have all contributed to the hype for Top Shot in recent weeks. Portland Trailblazers point guard CJ McCollum tweeted about getting in on the trade, inviting fans to direct-message him on social media to discuss. “I want to learn more about these moments,” he wrote. “Especially my moments lol.” The US sports memorabilia market is already worth as much as $5.4bn annually, according to a 2018 estimate by Forbes. Angela Ruggiero, chief executive of the Sports Innovation Lab, a research firm studying technology and fan behaviour in sports, said that digital tokens could expand the market to individuals who are not considered “traditional fans”, generally defined as those who watch games on television or buy tickets and jerseys. Case in point: Robyn Batnick, a high school guidance counsellor from Long Island, New York, said she became immediately enthralled with collecting Top Shot moments after her husband suggested it as an activity they could do together. “He was like, ‘I have a confession to make, I just spent $2,500 on a hologram’,” she said. Initially alarmed at the dollar value, she became intrigued once he demonstrated to her how the process works online. Collectors have to sign up on the Top Shot website at appointed times to await a “drop”, or release, of packs of moments. Demand is so high that more than 200,000 people joined the queue last Friday for a drop of just over 10,000 packs. “I am definitely not a sports fan”, said Batnick, 35. “The players and the moves? They mean nothing to me. I look at it as a game, and I’m like, I want to play!” The blockchain company Dapper Labs partnered with the NBA to develop Top Shot in 2019 after the success of its earlier venture in NFTs, CryptoKitties. Dapper Labs co-founder Mik Naayem said his goal was to develop a product whose popularity could extend beyond the insular cryptocurrency community. “We wondered, if we could create something cute and appropriate on blockchain, could we get regular people to engage?” he said. Revenues from the sale of Top Shot packs are split between Dapper Labs, the NBA and the players’ association. The three groups also split a 5 per cent cut of each sale on the secondary market, according to two people familiar with the arrangement. The league helps determine which highlights are made into moments, according to Adrienne O’Keeffe, associate vice-president of global partnerships at the NBA. Current moments are mostly limited to games from the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons, but the league could release historical highlights — such as those by Michael Jordan — sometime in the future. Meanwhile, Naayem said Dapper Labs plans to eventually enable collectors to use their moments as tokens in a digital game, similar to Pokémon.

The “trading cards” category on eBay grew by 142 per cent last year, with 4m more sales in the US alone compared with 2019. Basketball card sales, eBay’s second most popular card category after Pokémon, grew by 373 per cent. To illustrate Top Shot’s meteoric rise, the Financial Times compared the price trajectories of a LeBron James trading card and a LeBron James Top Shot moment. Both the card, a 2003 Topps Chrome LeBron James #111 in mint condition (PSA 10), and the moment, a 13-second clip of James replicating a Kobe Bryant dunk from 2001 as a tribute to the late Lakers star, recently sold for around $34,000. For the card, that was more than twice the price it fetched in October; the value of the moment, meanwhile, grew by more than 700-fold over the same period, from its October resale price of $46. Robyn Batnick’s husband, Michael, who works as a financial adviser and co-hosts a podcast on finance and culture, said Top Shots are “about as speculative an asset you could possibly own” and hype has driven him to make financial decisions against his rational judgment. “I spent $400 for a Duncan Robinson moment. He isn’t even good. I want to punch myself in the head.” Nonetheless, he has earned returns of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent on resales thus far. Batnick said he became interested in Top Shot in late January as the online collecting community offered an antidote to pandemic boredom. “When the drop happens and you get in the line and you see your spot, there’s something about the community, it just erases the loneliness,” he said. “It’s not about the money, it’s about the chemicals in your brain.” Additional reporting by Eric Platt","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Christine Zhang Sara Germano","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-03-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/c1caca5b-01f7-41be-85a4-3ecb883f2417","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fc531a247-670f-4893-8765-cd3221341a3a.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Get ready for self-driving banks","INTRO":"Lenders run by algorithms and blockchain technology will require 21st century regulation","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The writer is the US acting comptroller of the currency In 1961, Popular Science magazine envisioned self-driving cars. The reality arrived sooner than anyone anticipated, and before safety regulators could adapt. Most automotive laws — on speed limits, giving signals, drink-driving — had been designed to protect against dangerous drivers, not dangerous cars. Autonomous vehicles brought new risks that legacy rules never considered. As one headline on the Wired website put it: “Who’s Regulating Self-Driving Cars? Often, No One”. Banking is headed down the same road. And it’s being driven by the technology behind decentralised finance, or DeFi. But just as the original rules of the road protected us from other drivers, so our current bank regulations exist mainly to prevent human failings. At the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, we require every bank to have officers responsible for its safety — such as a chief risk officer and a chief audit executive. We limit how much banks can lend to their directors. We even make some bank employees take a certain amount of vacation so others can sit at their desks and identify potential fraud. We call it bank regulation, but we’re really regulating bankers. DeFi turns all this on its head. It leverages blockchain technology to deliver services with no human intermediation. One example is creating money markets with algorithmically derived interest rates based on supply and demand — rates that traditional banks set by committee. Other DeFi projects include decentralised exchanges that allow users to trade without brokers, and protocols for lending that do not involve loan officers or credit committees. Although these “self-driving banks” are new, they are not small. They are likely to be mainstream before self-driving cars start to fly. However, self-driving banks present the same challenges and opportunities as autonomous vehicles. On the opportunity side, they can allow savers to stop shopping around for the best interest rates by having algorithms do this for them. They can also end discrimination against certain borrowers by having software make credit decisions. They could even eliminate the risk of fraud or corruption by no longer being run by humans at all. Self-driving banks also present new risks, though. If technology accelerates withdrawal of depositors’ funds, just as high-frequency trading can accelerate equity sell-offs, that could increase liquidity risk compared with traditional banks. Asset volatility could be a concern for similar reasons. And the management of loan collateral could be more difficult if humans are not involved in valuations. There is also a risk that, in the absence of federal regulatory clarity, US states rush to fill the void and create a patchwork of inconsistent rules that impede the orderly development of a national market. This is exactly what happened with self-driving cars. Federal regulators must therefore determine what a regulatory scheme for self-driving banks should look like. Could they ensure fair treatment of customers by such a bank? Sure. Most bias and compliance issues are failures of software. Not the software you code, but the kind hard-wired into human brains. Bias can creep also into the rules of algorithms, but it is easier to root out. Could regulators properly examine a bank that exists only as software? Yes, we can. It may be easier than supervising banks today. Our examiners could be retrained to read the algorithms that make deposit pricing or credit decisions and work out whether they comply with legal requirements. Could regulators ensure self-driving banks properly serve their communities? Absolutely. Their greater efficiency would free significant amounts of capital that is lost to operating costs today or slowed by decisions dependent on human grey matter. Of course, algorithmic banks would change the nature of employment in the financial sector — with far fewer bank tellers and more coders. But creating better compensated and value-added jobs may prove a societal benefit in the long run. Could the OCC even grant a national bank charter to open-source software that manages deposit-taking, lending, or payments, if it doesn’t have officers or directors? Not yet. Under current law, drawn up on the assumptions of the early 20th century, charters can only be issued to human beings. But those antiquated rules should be revisited, just as regulations that still mandate the use of fax machines should be. Could we usher in a future where we eliminate error, stop discrimination, and achieve universal access for all? Optimists like me think so. How different would banking in the US be today if regulators, bankers, and policymakers were as bold as carmakers 10 years ago?","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Brooks","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-01-12","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/7d5eeecd-c0b7-4fc0-9319-581163bf484d","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Ff1a0c561-5f0b-4b4d-8f71-dac7cc4301bf.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"This Valentine’s, consider the crypto-flower","INTRO":"Upside: it’ll never die. Downside? Your love just might.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"All this time, we’ve been saying blockchain is a solution looking for a problem. But now, as it turns out, we might have been wrong . . .  On Tuesday we appeared on one of these trendy Zoom-panels that everyone seems to be doing these days, to take part in a discussion about blockchain and its implications for financial markets. It was hosted by His Excellency Alexander Fasel, the Swiss ambassador to the Court of St James’s (AKA the UK). As you can imagine, we were giving our usual spiel about how blockchain has yet to prove itself as a “solution” for anything outside of the world of cryptocurrencies; how you never seem to hear about how the literally thousands of blockchain projects that have been splashed across newspaper pages over the past six years or so are doing; how blockchain has a garbage-in, garbage-out problem . . . you get the drift. But then, out of nowhere, we were told about a new solution! Flowers! Not real ones, obvs, but you know, pixels! On a blockchain! CRYPTO-FLOWERS! Solving the problem of, erm, what to send someone with pollen allergies and an aversion to chocolate or basically anything tangible on Valentine’s Day! Have a watch here if you’re interested in hearing about it first-hand, from about 45.50: Or if you’re not, here’s what this guy, who is the head of the “world’s first digital assets bank”, Sygnum, told us: What if I told you that there is right now a very strongly growing so-called “NFT market”, where you have girls — 15-year-old girls — today getting a digital flower, of which there is only one? It’s also on the blockchain but it’s one, created for them. And when their boyfriends send them the flower, they have the same emotions as if your partner, your partner gives you roses. (Don’t let anyone ever tell you that tech bros don’t understand the fairer sex.) When we said we weren’t sure the emotions one would feel on receiving a digital flower would be quite as strong as what one might feel on receiving a real one, we were lightly admonished: We have to be careful to not be stuck in mindsets that have been established over many years. Ah yes, that old chestnut. It’s a nice line for anyone pushing basically any technology. It’s almost as good as the “blockchain is the new internet” one (which also came up on the panel, naturally). We then said that, frankly, we found the idea of receiving a digital flower a bit of a depressing thought, to which we were told: Jemima, for you it is an absurd example. But the point I’m making is that it’s clear that it’s absurd to you, but to hundreds of millions of younger generation people it is not. Now we can either accept that or not. So at this stage, you know, we thought we’d better have a look to see what all the fuss was about. After all, being of the millennial generation, it was true that we are a bit out of touch these days. And there was that cryptokitties craze a while back — remember that? (Just don’t mention it to the ‘star’ VCs.) And that is how we found ourselves on the CryptoFlowers website, wondering at beauties like this: We are not virologists so we can’t be sure but those things behind the flower do look remarkably like SARS-COV-2 don’t they? What are they doing there? If you’re wondering how much that one costs, it’s a snip at 0.4 ETH (ETH is short for Ether, the cryptocurrency that runs on Ethereum, the thinking bro’s blockchain). At current exchange rates, that’s just . . . $730. If you really like her though, you could splash out on something like this: You can’t accuse the blockchainers of not appreciating aesthetics can you? That one will only set you back 4 ETH, so about $7,300. And if you really want to impress her, there’s the “first Ethereum flower”, which can be yours/hers for 50 ETH (a snip at $91,000). The thing is they’re not just pixels. Well they are, but they change. In fact they are part of an exciting blockchain-based game. Here is how the CryptoFlowers website describes it: CryptoFlowers is a game about collecting and breeding digital flowers. Using the power of Smart Contracts and Ethereum network, the game allows you to collect, breed and exchange unique digital flowers. While CryptoFlowers are not digital currency, it provides the same level of security. Each Cryptoflower is genetically unique, it cannot be destroyed, taken away or replicated, and it will always bloom! We went back to our Sygnum CEO to check that this is really what he was talking about when he said that this is what “hundreds of millions of younger generation people” were getting into, and he directed us towards all sorts of different sites selling various different crypto flowers. Basically crypto flowers are part of what seems to be the latest craze in blockchainland: NFTs, or “non-fungible tokens”. Crypto site Decrypt (one of the better ones) defines them thus: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are crypto assets that are indivisible and unique, creating digital scarcity. NFTs initially launched on Ethereum, using the ERC-721 token standard, but are now available on a number of other blockchains. -They have many use cases, including digital collectibles, artwork and in-game assets. Pretty radical huh? Kind of like Pokemon Cards, but on the blockchain. Look, it’s true that we cannot speak for 15-year-old girls, but we can speak for grown women. Please, lads, if you’re going to spend $90,000 of your hard-earned money on something that runs on a blockchain this Valentine’s Day, well, we haven’t said this before but: just buy us some bitcoin or something? Doge’ll do too.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-02-12","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/9be5ad05-b17a-4449-807b-5dbcb5ef8170","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F6cd39420-94d9-49ee-8528-9fa808887df3.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Nouriel Roubini: bitcoin is not a hedge against tail risk","INTRO":"Elon Musk may be buying it, but that doesn’t mean everyone else should follow suit","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The writer is a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business, NYU, and host of NourielToday.com Claims that bitcoin is the new “digital gold” are feeding a new bubble in it and other cryptocurrencies. The last one in 2017-18 saw bitcoin go from $1,000 to $20,000 and then fall back to $3,000 by the end of 2018. Since the fundamental value of bitcoin is zero and would be negative if a proper carbon tax was applied to its massive polluting energy-hogging production, I predict that the current bubble will eventually end in another bust. Referring to bitcoin or other crypto as “currencies” is a misnomer. They are not a unit of account: virtually nothing is priced in them. They are not a scalable means of payment: with bitcoin you can do five transactions per second while the Visa network does 24,000. Bitcoins are barely used by legitimate companies as payment for goods and services, although Tesla said it planned to start accepting them. Crypto is not a stable store of value: even some crypto conferences refuse to accept them as payment for attendance fees. The volatile price moves can wipe out any profit margin of a merchant within a matter of hours. They aren’t even denominated in a consistent way that allows users to compare relative prices of goods. This reliance on different tokens is effectively a return to barter. The Flintstones had a more sophisticated monetary system based on a benchmark: the cartoon cavemen used shells. Even referring to crypto as assets is a misnomer. Most assets have a stream of income (stocks, bonds, commercial real estate) or a use (housing) or some other utility (fiat currency provides liquidity and can be used for payments). Gold has no income but it has industrial uses. It also has utility as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, currency debasement and tail risks. Crypto has no income, no utility, no payment or other services. It isn’t even anonymous because the underlying blockchain technology makes it easy to trace payments. It is only a play on a speculative asset bubble, worse than tulip-mania as flowers had and still have utility. Its store of value against tail risks is unproven. And worse: some cryptos, dubbed “shitcoins”, are financial scams in the first place or debased daily by their sponsor. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and claims of misbehaviour, including pump and dump, spoofing, wash trading and front-running by exchanges, are widespread. Stablecoins claim to be superior. But New York authorities are already investigating whether one, tether, is being used to manipulate the price of bitcoin. Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of the cryptocurrency ethereum, argues that no crypto can be at the same time scalable, safe and decentralised. Traditional financial systems are scalable and safe: if your credit card or bank account is hacked or stolen, you are made whole. But they are centralised because participants and assets are verified by trusted institutions. Right now, crypto is neither scalable nor safe. If your private key is stolen or lost, the assets are gone for good. It isn’t even decentralised. Oligopolistic miners control most bitcoin mining. Many are out of reach of western law enforcement in places such as China, Russia and Belarus, creating a national security nightmare. About 99 per cent of bitcoin trading occurs on centralised exchanges, which may be hackable. Furthermore, the original programmers retain outsized control over their creations. In some cases they act as police, prosecutors and judges, and reverse transactions that are supposed to be immutable. Nor is crypto equitable: a small number of “whales” control much of bitcoin’s value. This undermines claims that crypto will decentralise finance, provide banking services to the unbanked, or make the poor rich. Blockchain claims to enable cheap money transfers to refugees, but crypto is much more likely to provide cover for scam artists, conmen, tax evaders, criminals, terrorists and human traffickers. Our world is beset by financial crises, geopolitical risks and very loose monetary policy. There is growing demand for safe haven assets that are a hedge against inflation, currency depreciation and debasement and tail risks. Gold, inflation-indexed bonds, commodities, real estate and even equities are all reasonable candidates. Risky, volatile bitcoin doesn’t belong in the portfolios of serious institutional investors. Many of its retail backers are suckers being manipulated by an army of self-serving insiders and snake oil salesmen. Tesla’s Elon Musk and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor may be betting the house on bitcoin. That doesn’t mean you should.

Blockchain and cryptocurrency-linked stocks are posting record returns around the world. But not in China. Blockchain-related shares — including companies that run digital currency trading platforms and cryptocurrency miners — are regarded as an alternative to straightforward cryptocurrency investments. New York-listed Marathon Patent Group and Riot Blockchain are investor favourites. Both have gained more than 4,000 per cent in the past year. Yet the fortunes of Chinese blockchain-related companies have been mixed. Shenzhen-listed Brilliance Technology recorded gains of more than 44 per cent over a two-week span in early October as the current bitcoin rally kicked off. Shares of local peer Shenzhen Forms Syntron Information climbed in May before losing a third of their value the following month. For the full year, the price is down 35 per cent. About half of the world’s bitcoin miners are Chinese. But investors looking for bitcoin exposure in local markets are constrained. Cryptocurrencies are not considered legal tender in the country. The People’s Bank of China has banned initial coin offerings — cryptocurrency-based fundraising. It shut trading platforms four years ago. Unfavourable local regulations mean local companies closely linked to the mining and trading of cryptocurrencies have looked overseas to list in markets such as Hong Kong and the US. Recommended Locally listed crypto companies are largely focused on the development of blockchain technology for banking and commercial use. Demand for those services should rise as Beijing pushes ahead with its plans to encourage take-up of digital renminbi amid the pandemic. China has long wanted to replace cash. It also seeks to curtail the power of local fintech giants. The PBoC has distributed more than 100m worth of digital renminbi so far. Local blockchain companies should spy opportunities in systems development and support as the digital currency becomes more mainstream. The spur will be nothing like the bitcoin boom during the past few months. But it could be both more sustainable and less volatile.

In her last press conference as chair of the Federal Reserve in 2017, Ms Yellen said bitcoin was a “highly speculative asset” and “not a stable store of value”. These dismissive remarks were echoed by many other public officials at the time. Since then, however, the market value of bitcoin has roughly doubled. Digital currencies are here to stay. In the first crypto frenzy of 2017-18, comedian John Oliver described bitcoin as “everything you don’t understand about money combined with everything you don’t understand about computers”. The technology aspects, particularly the blockchain network of digital ledgers that are used to record transactions, have not really lived up to the initial hype, but they are beginning to make progress. The issuance of $20bn in “initial coin offerings” seemed to contain elements of a speculative bubble, but the funds raised are now being used to launch projects broadly similar to other IT ventures in Silicon Valley. Jay Clayton’s recent departure from the chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission may result in less hostile regulatory scrutiny of these activities, especially if Gary Gensler, who teaches about digital currencies, replaces him. However, resistance to digital currencies as payments and transfer vehicles is likely to remain. Partly because of high transaction costs, bitcoin is not widely used for payments, and its future role seems limited. The outgoing Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has been working on new regulations to increase transparency in bitcoin transfers and reduce the scope for money laundering. Ms Yellen, in conjunction with the Fed, is likely to adopt an even more orthodox approach, treating the payments system as a quintessential public good. The Fed is collaborating with foreign counterparts in investigating the development of central bank digital currencies. It is almost certain that CBDCs will eventually be issued in the major jurisdictions, following China’s lead. However, they will be denominated in national currencies, not crypto. Private competitors denominated in genuinely new currencies, such as bitcoin, will be heavily regulated or actively discouraged. Hybrid stablecoins, such as Facebook’s libra, that are pegged to a single currency or other real assets may be more welcomed by central banks, if they were directly transferable into traditional currencies. Furthermore, they may not be powered by blockchain. Each of the major central banks may develop its own distributed ledger technology. That still leaves a role for crypto as an investment vehicle and store of value. Can bitcoin seriously compete with gold as a safe asset for the largest investors? History, regulation and market volatility make that seem improbable, but it is beginning to develop a more important role. Many big hedge funds and some conventional asset managers have followed Paul Tudor Jones in adopting bitcoin as a core hedge against inflation. While this may have seemed attractive when central banks were in effect creating money by buying up government debt last year, there are few signs of inflation on the imminent horizon. Yet bitcoin prices have continued to rise, apparently driven by a narrative that holds that a privately created asset, which in theory has a finite supply, cannot be “printed” like the “legacy” fiat currencies. According to Gold Hub, gold stocks held above ground amounted to 198,000 tonnes at the end of 2019, with about 57,000 tonnes of proven reserves below ground. This total stock would be valued at about $17tn in today’s prices. The latest market value of bitcoin is about $0.6tn — bitcoin bulls see this as a gauge of how much further its price could rise. There seems little reason on monetary policy or financial stability grounds why regulators should be worried about cryptocurrencies competing with gold as a store of value. The crypto world is currently in a frenzy of short-term speculation. However, if investors continue to buy into the dubious narrative that these private currencies are “safer” than those controlled by the central banks, they could rise much further in market value in coming years. Stranger things have certainly happened in financial markets.

The digital token’s price has fallen to about 20 cents, down from $3 in late 2017. There is no reason to expect a rebound. XRP was created in 2012 by the founders of Ripple, the San Francisco-based payments company. It is described as a currency — crucial to facilitate blockchain payments. But XRP is not necessary for Ripple’s products and its use as a currency is limited. The SEC accuses Ripple, chief executive Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen of selling $1.38bn of XRP to retail investors as an unregistered security. What took the SEC so long? XRP is not the first token it has targeted. In 2017, it declared tokens offered by an organisation called The DAO were securities. But the SEC’s framework for such action comes from a 1946 Supreme Court decision that focuses on whether something is an investment with the expectation of profit through another’s work. Decentralised digital currencies are hard to categorise this way. The SEC’s tardiness in updating its own definition has ensured that the crypto industry remains a sideshow. Even so, the case against XRP is unlikely to weigh on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which are not linked to one company. More than half of all XRP is owned by Ripple. The SEC’s case focuses on the lack of information given to investors compared with that held by the company. For true XRP believers there is always reason to hope. Ripple has vowed to fight. And incoming acting SEC chair Elad Roisman may prove more amenable than Jay Clayton, who once declared “every ICO [initial coin offering] I’ve seen is a security”. Ripple’s own business can survive, given its products do not require XRP. But its reputation has taken a hard hit. Its valuation, last set at $10bn, was tied to a digital token whose price was always hard to justify. Now it is impossible to do so.

The California native has spent much of his career at the intersection of music and technology as a serial entrepreneur. LVMH recruited him in 2015 from Apple where he helped roll out its streaming service, and enlisted him to expand its ecommerce operations and inject brands such as Louis Vuitton and Dior with more digital knowhow. Now Mr Rogers, 48, is trading in LVMH’s glitzy offices on luxury shopping street Avenue Montaigne for Ledger’s more modest digs in a central Paris neighbourhood called Silicon Sentier that is home to many start-ups. His mission as Ledger’s chief experience officer will be to expand its consumer business and help bring cryptocurrency ownership to the masses as opposed to the relatively niche activity it remains today. “When I look at cryptocurrency, privacy and security, I have a similar feeling I did about music in the early 2000s at the beginning of the streaming era,” said Mr Rogers in an interview. “There is an inevitable change coming, but it’s the very beginning, so not everything will be easily predictable . . . but these are very fast-growing markets, so that’s where I like to be.” Mr Roger’s move to Ledger comes amid a rally in bitcoin this year — the price hit an intraday high last week of $19,510 before dropping back. Many new investors have flocked to the asset, helped by improvements to the tools and trading platforms that facilitate bitcoin trading. Some also see bitcoin as a potential inflation hedge. Ledger, which was founded in 2013, sells hardware security products to protect users of cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications to secure their digital assets. It has sold about 2m digital wallets across 165 countries, with its Nano series among the industry’s most popular hardware solutions. Ledger has raised $87m from venture investors including Draper Esprit and Samsung Ventures. The valuation implied in its last funding round in 2018 has not been disclosed. Pascal Gauthier, chief executive, said Ledger planned to hire more than 100 people next year to expand its existing workforce of 250. Most of the start-up’s sales come from consumers, but in 2018 it began marketing a product called Ledger Vault to institutional investors such as hedge funds that needed to secure their crypto assets. “We want to grow by bringing new features to the technology to make it more secure and easier to use,” said Mr Gauthier. “I need help to scale the business and take it to the next level, and Ian has the experience, leadership, vision and management skills to help.” While at LVMH, Mr Rogers helped refine the luxury conglomerate’s approach to how it sells and promotes its brands online, winning over some insiders who feared ecommerce and social media would dilute the exclusivity of the group’s products. Ecommerce has accelerated in luxury this year as the pandemic has forced months of store closures. Some analysts predict ecommerce will account for nearly half of luxury sales by 2025 when the industry is expected to have recovered from the impact of Covid-19. Mr Rogers said he would remain an adviser to LVMH on digital projects, as well as continuing to run its annual innovation awards, a competition for luxury, fashion and ecommerce start-ups.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Leila Abboud","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-11-30","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/ffc5ea03-cdbe-4d20-b61f-3a10f2b6b986","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fe431d06f-30da-455b-82b6-e682c0721c5f.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"On guard for breakdowns and rule breakers","INTRO":"From goats to government, digital tools help businesses keep watch for faulty connections in supply chains","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Mongolian goat herders can go days without seeing a car, a building or even a power line. Yet, despite their remoteness, they are a visible part of a global supply chain. Digital technology enables the cashmere wool they produce to be tracked from Mongolia to the point where it is sold in luxury markets across the world. A mobile phone app, developed by Convergence.tech of Toronto, Canada, uses blockchain to help herders achieve better prices for their cashmere by verifying that it is not sourced from areas that have been overgrazed, which turns grasslands into deserts, contributing to localised climate change and air pollution. The app is an example of how, in a complex, volatile and resource-stressed global economy, digital technology can link up parts of a supply chain and provide increasing detail. The goat herders are not the only beneficiaries. Data and digital technologies are also helping global companies keep their operations running at a time when, according to McKinsey, the consultancy, a supply chain disruption lasting a month or more will happen every 3.7 years when averaged across industries. To cope with such disruptions, Flex, which designs and makes electronics, has established worldwide Flex Pulse centres that use real-time data and visualisations to watch events in its supply chains. As the coronavirus spread from Asia to other continents, Flex created dedicated dashboards to track the effect of the outbreak on its operations. “I can look at a region, at a site, for a specific customer, down to a part number, at the touch of a button,” says Lynn Torrel, chief supply chain and procurement officer at Flex. In helping to manage supply chain disruption, one of technology’s most powerful functions is to collect and combine information from a variety of sources. Boston Scientific, the US medical device company, integrates various supply chain indicators, from sales data to insights gained by commercial teams from customers about medical procedures being scheduled, into what it calls a “control tower”. “We put that all together into algorithms that help drive our forecasting,” says Terrance Brick, vice-president of global supply chain. Buyers want a lot more data than before — and they want it to be verifiable As well as enabling companies to plan during political or economic turbulence, technology underpins transparency. Demand for information on everything from companies’ carbon footprints to their human rights records has increased. Investors seek to create portfolios of businesses that can verify their ESG (environmental, social and governance) credentials, while consumers are keener than ever to know how products are sourced and made. “Buyers, whether industrial or consumer, are asking for a lot more data than before — and they want it to be verifiable,” says Raj Rao, general manager of blockchain platforms at IBM Food Trust. The hunger for data extends to the food industry, where the IBM Food Trust enables foods to be traced for safety and efficiency, to minimise waste and confirm their sustainability. For Convergence.tech, a digital transformation company that works with government bodies, humanitarian agencies and corporations, blockchain allows two functions that are critical to sustainable sourcing: defining where products come from and who has handled them on the way. “We wanted to disrupt and add value to two very broken systems: identity and traceability,” says Chami Akmeemana, the company’s chief executive. Technology can also make it easy to pass information to customers who want to track their own environmental footprint. Ukraine has saved itself billions of dollars with its transparent procurement system Boston Scientific does this by giving customers such as hospitals access to parts of its global data synchronisation network. This uses a cloud database as a “single source of truth” for product information. Customers can find customised data such as the amount of carbon or plastic in the products they are about to buy, says Mr Brick. Work to increase supply chain transparency is also under way in the public sector. The technology is critical, for instance, when governments try to rid their procurement processes of corruption and cronyism. Recommended In Ukraine, a digital procurement system called ProZorro (“transparent”) enables government agencies to manage contracts electronically and transparently. “You can follow all the contracts throughout their lifecycle. They collect information about the planning, bidding and winning of those contracts — and they’ve saved themselves billions of dollars,” says Gavin Hayman, executive director of the Open Contracting Partnership, a not-for-profit organisation whose aim is to improve public-sector contracting. But digitally enabled transparency alone is not the solution, he says. It must be accompanied by changes in policy and practice. “It’s got to be linked to actions, otherwise you just get transparent corruption.” The case studies below are a shortlist of entries to the FT Intelligent Business awards event held online on November 19. All the entries showcase the combined use of data and tech in business operations. Source: RSG Consulting  Winner: DHL, Blue Yonder and Microsoft DHL, the German distributor responsible for logistics for some of the biggest household names globally, worked with software company Blue Yonder to deploy robotics to automate tasks in its warehouses, with Microsoft software providing data analytics and artificial intelligence to optimise resources. One example of how Microsoft and Blue Yonder are helping businesses is with Morrisons, the UK supermarket chain, where it has forecast demand fluctuation during the coronavirus lockdown and automated inventory orders. This has improved the on-shelf availability of products by 30 per cent and reduced the in-store inventory by two to three days. Boston Scientific Thanks to efforts over the past five years to digitise the operations of Boston Scientific, the medical device maker took eight weeks to redeploy its sales reps using predictive data analytics of where and when demand would fluctuate, speeding up a process that would normally take six to eight months. The IT team has developed a data analytics tool that integrates sales data from the enterprise resource planning system with public data on Covid-19 rates and regional responses. Insights are presented via a dashboard that helps the business make decisions about deploying sales reps and managing inventory. Flex The electronics manufacturing company used Flex Pulse, its supply chain visualisation software, to respond quickly as Covid-19 spread. The database was reconfigured during the pandemic to provide more detailed information about supplier locations, allowing Flex to manage up to 8,000 daily shortages across its 16,000 suppliers. The data provided intelligence on how long the shortages were expected to last, enabling the business to look for alternative suppliers where needed. The company estimates that before Covid-19 it would usually manage between 1,600 and 1,800 shortages daily. State of New Hampshire and Dun \u0026 Bradstreet At the start of the pandemic, business intelligence company Dun \u0026 Bradstreet launched its Covid-19 Business Impact Research platform, with free access for government agencies. The platform has been used to verify suppliers and measure economic recovery from the crisis. The US state of New Hampshire used the platform to review suppliers 75 per cent faster than before and exclude 10 per cent of potential suppliers, allowing the state to scale up its personal protective equipment (PPE) supply chain while minimising the risk of scams or fulfilment issues. Currently, 35 of 50 states use the platform. Verizon The introduction of 5G presented the telecommunications company with the opportunity to abandon its legacy systems and move to SAP, a single enterprise resource planning platform. This has given Verizon greater visibility into its equipment stocks, and allowed the company to consolidate its 30 wireless equipment warehouses, which were managed regionally, into three nationally managed centres, reducing working capital on inventory by 20 per cent. Increased access to data has enabled the business to identify problems in the supply chain faster and use algorithms to predict other areas that may be affected.

At the time, investors were pouring an estimated $20bn into so-called Initial Coin Offerings — sales of new digital tokens by projects which, like Filecoin, claimed to be building important new digital infrastructure. Many have since sunk without a trace, and ICOs quickly went out of fashion. But in recent weeks, the Filecoin marketplace has finally seen the light of day. People vying to earn its tokens have already committed a combined 1.3 exabytes of storage capacity, according to Juan Benet, the project’s founder. An exabyte is equivalent to 500 times the data stored in all US research libraries. Demand from customers looking to buy storage is still only a small fraction of this, but Filecoin’s first goal was to attract capacity, and progress has been ten times ahead of expectations, claimed Mr Benet. The activation of Filecoin’s network is part of the belated emergence of a handful of blockchain projects, financed by the ICO bubble, that set out with big ambitions to change online activity. Polkadot, a platform others can use to create their own blockchains, is close to completing the phased launch of its network. Others, like Cosmos, which provides a way to connect different blockchains, and Tezos, a “smart contract” competitor to Ethereum, have also gone live. The founders of some of these projects admit that their ideas benefited from the wave of financial speculation. Gavin Wood, a founder of Polkadot, said that much of the money pouring into ICOs in 2017 represented the recycled profits from investments in Ethereum (which he also co-founded) and Bitcoin. “Ultimately I think a lot of people viewed this as a sort of accumulator bet,” Mr Wood said. “They won a lot of money on Ethereum and they wanted to see if they could carry on rolling.” Yet he and other crypto entrepreneurs claim that the technical innovations from a handful of survivors will prove more lasting than the financial mania surrounding the ICOs. “These projects have built pretty significant things,” said Mr Benet. “I think the total capital organised [by ICOs] in the last three years is not — if you look at the rest of technology — out of the ordinary.” Recommended Though some of the blockchain networks have gone live, the applications they were built to support have yet to be developed, making it hard to judge their ultimate impact. The Tezos blockchain, for instance, was designed for “any place where you\u0027re trying to create a digital economy”, like purchases made inside a video game, said Kathleen Breitman, one of its founders. Other potential uses are in online “creator economies”, said Alison Mangiero, president of TQ Tezos — places where individual artists, entertainers and influences might see a benefit in “cutting out the middleman and working out ways to monetise their fan bases.” They promise applications like this will start to appear in 2021. Meanwhile, a recent surge in interest in DeFi — decentralised finance applications that cut out traditional intermediaries — has also drawn attention to the blockchain platforms that could support it. Polkadot has been one of the main beneficiaries of developer attention: its platform for interlinked blockchains could be well suited to DeFi, supporting a large number of simple applications that could be combined to create new and more complex financial products. Platforms like this are not designed to simply deliver an existing set of services at marginally lower cost, said Mr Wood. Rather, they could support entirely new services, or ones that could only be provided with “orders of magnitude more overhead” using older methods, he said. The same is true of data storage delivered over a blockchain, according to Mr Benet. Though it might sound like the ultimate undifferentiated service, the storage services sold by a handful of giant cloud companies like Amazon Web Services are highly complex and “anything but a commodity”, he added. Opening up Filecoin’s network to smaller players, as well as developers who can build specialist services to make use of the raw capacity, will be as disruptive to the cloud companies as Airbnb has been in the hotel world, he said. If new applications are still largely theoretical, the financial gains are all too real. The price of Filecoin’s tokens have risen 14-fold from the average price paid during its ICO, while Dots — the tokens used on the Polkadot network — are up nearly 20-fold. The promoters of some of these projects also stand to be big winners. Filecoin, for instance, reserved 300m tokens for itself at its inception. That haul is currently worth around $7bn, though Mr Benet said the tokens will not fully vest for six years. The recent Bitcoin boom has also cast some of the less successful veterans of the ICO bubble in a new light. Most accepted payment in Bitcoin and Ether in exchange for their own tokens, leaving them with a potential windfall. The Tezos Foundation took in $232m through its 2017 ICO — an amount that had risen to $652m by July this year. With more than 60 per cent of its reserves held in Bitcoin, it is now likely to be worth well over $1bn. The value of their crypto holdings means that many of the less successful blockchain projects are now sitting on reserves worth more than their “market caps” — or the total value of their outstanding coins. That is likely to bring intervention from activist investors “holding projects’ feet to the fire” and forcing them to pay out some of their surplus cash, said Ryan Zurrer, a crypto investor and entrepreneur. Tech history has seen this before. In the aftermath of the dotcom bubble, cash rich companies without viable business models sometimes lingered for years while investors agitated to get their cash back. The dotcom period also produced a small number of big winners, including Amazon and Yahoo. The survivors from the ICO bubble still have a long way to go to prove they have anything like the staying power.

The deal, which aims to raise up to $3bn in total, will allow investors to buy digital tokens that are backed by deposits at the bank’s branch in Labuan, an island tax haven in Malaysia. The tokens will be available for purchase by ordinary investors on an exchange in the territory that specialises in digital assets and can be traded using either dollars or bitcoin. The move comes amid a wider push towards new technologies in China’s rapidly evolving financial industry, with the central bank working on a digital version of the renminbi after a period in which online payments systems have taken off. “China is big on blockchain and all of the big Chinese banks are majorly engaged in this area,” said Henry Chong, chief executive of Fusang Exchange, where the tokens will be traded and which uses blockchain technology to record ownership. He said the deal would allow global investors to “benefit from access to an investment previously reserved for only the largest institutions, together with low and transparent fees”. The deal works as a securitisation, in which investors purchase notes issued by a vehicle that deposits the proceeds at China Construction Bank Labuan (CCB Labuan). The notes, which are available as digital tokens, can be bought for as little as $100 and are backed by the underlying deposits at the bank. Recommended The investment provides a return of 50 basis points over Libor, an interbank benchmark commonly used to price loans and contracts, or about 0.75 per cent, which CCB Labuan and Fusang said in a joint release was “considerably higher than market interest rates for typical fixed deposits”. They added that the bond was “the first digital security to be listed on a public stock exchange that is directly accessible by retail investors”. Felix Feng Qi, principal officer at CCB Labuan, said the issuance “serves to narrow the divide between fintech and the wider financial markets”. At the end of last year, Fitch Ratings said that the application of blockchain technology in Chinese securitisations “seems to have proceeded at a faster pace than in other parts of the world”. The rating agency added that the technology “has the potential to promote data transparency and transactional efficiency”. China Construction Bank is the sponsor and lead arranger for the deal. The tokens will begin trading on Friday.

First, we published a piece on Her Majesty the Queen apparently expressing an interest in blockchain. She had been sent a copy of a “peer-reviewed blockchain journal” (!) and her private secretary had replied that our Liz “was interested to learn that the publication is the first open access blockchain publication research journal available both in print and online”. We must now inform you that it was meant to be a bit of a joke. We weren’t convinced that our 94-year-old monarch was really that interested in Byzantine Fault Tolerance and proof-of-work mechanisms. But some people got very excited about it nonetheless. The CEO of Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, tweeted our story saying “I wonder how many #Bitcoin she has. The Express declared in a headline: Queen left delighted after learning about Bitcoin after receiving peculiar gift. Business Insider added vital context by noting in its write-up of the story: “It\u0027s unclear whether the monarch had any prior blockchain knowledge before receiving the journal.” (We have got to be honest: we are still not sure that the Queen is now in possession of such “blockchain knowledge”.) And then later on Tuesday Alphaville editor Izabella Kaminska, the Original Bitcoin Cynic, wrote an op-ed for the FT in which she appeared to undergo some kind of a Damascene conversion, arguing that “bitcoin finally finds a rationale in doomsday scenarios”. (She hadn’t really undergone any such conversion; she noted that all her reservations remained, but that in the “far-fetched” scenario of a future dystopian reality in which the world has slid into authoritarianism, bitcoin could act as a kind of hedge.) (There was also former Alphavillain Tracy Alloway’s apparent actual Damascene conversion a few days earlier.) We are afraid that collectively — and in particular, we suspect, HM the Queen — we may have sent bitcoin mooning. Bitcoin jumped by about $1,000 on Tuesday, climbing above $19,000 to its highest since the bitcoin-manic days of December 2017. On Wednesday it inched up a little further to top $19,500, just shy of its all-time-high of about $19,666 (depending on which exchange you go with). And now, number go down! At pixel time, bitcoin had slid about 10 per cent at around $17,200. Here’s a chart showing the past week’s price moves, courtesy of Coindesk: Last time we looked, Ethereum was also down 13 per cent on the day; XRP had lost 21 per cent. We are not going to — and nor will we ever — argue that bitcoin will never again rise to such heights. It might, but then again it might not. Without any fundamentals to judge the price on, it is purely based, as we have said many times before, on speculation. Sometimes it does well when risk appetite is low; sometimes it does badly. That all makes the price pretty much impossible to predict. But we feel that for now at least, we might have triggered The Top. And for all those bitcoin bros* who have been desperately telling their followers stuff like this: We can only apologise. We hope you enjoy your carnivorous Thanksgiving dinners despite today’s plunge. *NB: not all of those we who we deem bitcoin bros self-identify as bitcoin bros.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-11-26","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/6e3df1a6-1eca-47d5-b9cf-1ba821895b1d","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F9dc09ca6-0c0e-4689-919d-87db9be8df33.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The Queen expresses an interest in blockchain","INTRO":"One must say one finds it all a little surprising.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Remember the Centre for Evidence Based Blockchain?

The open-ledger technology launched a million management consultancy reports. It was supposed to authenticate diamonds, underpin a cache of cryptocurrencies, prove the provenance of pork and replace signatures on contracts. Bullish management consultants were chief flag bearers, insisting blockchain would prove as game changing as the internet. Distributed ledger technology was supposed to collapse costs, eliminating duplicative record-keeping along transaction chains, and bolster trust. As early as 2016, Bain \u0026 Co was chiding banks for being slow on the uptake and risking their incumbent position. The ensuing four years have hardly seen a rush: a few piecemeal applications have emerged, such as HSBC in trade finance and Walmart in food provenance. Google searches for the term are running at roughly a tenth of peak popularity levels in late 2017. Bulls, leery of writing off the technology they championed, pin the delay on complexity and “scalability”, reinforcing the sense that the main product of blockchain has been more jargon. Integrating blockchain into the financial industry was never going to be as straightforward as migrating data from in-house servers to the cloud. Intense collaboration is required: between regulators, clients, infrastructure providers and, in many cases, competitors. In the absence of set standards, players have to take a punt and risk ending up with blockchain’s version of Betamax. As apps like WhatsApp or Uber show, broad take-up and a deep ecosystem is needed. Coronavirus and geopolitics have diverted executive attention. Financial services was once viewed as the most fertile ground, inspiring projects at the likes of JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. But the technology has suffered from its associations with bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has made some people very rich, but its reputation was tarnished by its use for illegal transactions. Other digital currencies have floundered: see Facebook’s heavily watered-down Libra plans. All this suggests the lead will not be taken by the private sector, after all. Fittingly, some of the biggest advances have come from China, led by the central bank. Millions of digital yuan transactions took place during a recent pilot programme. More tentatively, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has signalled plans to look into regulation while noting “we should not run before we can walk”. PwC predicts blockchain could add $1.76tn — or 1.4 per cent of global gross domestic product — to economic output over the next decade. More than a decade after its birth, that still looks a stretch.

TRUMP DEFEATS COVID WITH ICONS OF HIS ENTIRE FIRST TERM!” The coins’ artistic merits are described thusly on the gift shop’s website: . . . a new commemorative that vividly shows President Trump\u0027s historic presidential candidacy win, itself, from his descent on the elevator in Trump Tower, against a veritable army of superb Republican presidential candidates confluent with taunts, jeers, sneers by Media naysayers—to present day with design motifs of President Trump\u0027s ascendance over and personal defeat of the deadly COVID pandemic virus. The series creator and designer is one Anthony Gianni, who happens to be both the CEO of the gift shop but also (according to his LinkedIn) someone who “guides a unique team in the research and development of supercomputer systems for neural network mapping, simulation and AI models for use in neuroscience research as well as synergistic intelligence and defence systems modelling.” Intriguing. Yes? We then found the following tweet bearing some gratuitous imagery of Donald J. Trump fighting off coronavirus that began circulating on Nov 2, which may or may not be related: While we cannot confirm that the depiction is definitely related to the giftshop series, we couldn’t help but clock its stylistic similarity to some of the artistic visualisation often found in the cryptocurrency realm, especially the HODL coins. Could there be more to Donald Trump and crypto than first meets the eye? What we do know is that the Donald famously disappointed crypto lovers when he disparaged bitcoin back in July 2019, noting: But thanks to Emily Dreyfuss, a journalist at the Harvard Shorenstein Center’s Technology and Social Change project, who was published in the New York Times on Thursday, we now know that Trump’s iconoclastic tweeting and/or use and abuse of typos may be part of an elaborate strategy to backchannel secret messages to his most loyal fans. Of course, the idea Trump is possibly working in tandem with the mysterious “Q”, who drops esoteric messages on message boards such as 8kun in a bid to reveal the reach and scale of the deep state, has long been at the heart of the Qanon conspiracy theory. That theory states that Trump’s tweets are being used as proofs that the messages being put out by Q are really linked to insiders with special or advanced knowledge of things to come. That the system links to the seediest ends of the “free speech” internet, however, has done little for Qanon’s credibility with the mainstream press. Qanon followers have, instead, been labelled as deluded and potentially dangerous extremists who can’t help seeing connections where there are none, and who may also be preparing for a coup. The retort from the Qanon followers is that the presence of Q on such sites is not an endorsement of the extremist content. Rather, the backchannel system was established there precisely because it was the only way to guarantee resilience in the face of censorship by major platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Either way, there is no escaping the fact that The New York Times, by seeing fit to publish an opinion piece pandering to the delusional idea that DJT is smart enough to use secret codes in his Tweetstorms, has inadvertently also confirmed the worst of the Qanon fears. DoNALd TrUMp really is speaking in Code. So is it conceivable that Donald might secretly be a crypto blockchain bro too? Well, there’s a cute but desperate theory also doing the rounds that the current election capitulation is actually all just Kayfabe -- a sort of Sun-Tzu “art of war” diversion. In “reality” the STOP THE COUNT mess was entirely pre-engineered and Donald outwitted everyone by secretly watermarking ballot papers and tying them to the immutable power of the blockchain. So every illegal ballot is fully traceable and detectable. Yes really. Here’s the vid where Steve Pieczenik, a former state department guy, explains how the elaborate sting operation was set up and how it will prove the true scale of the rigging at hand. What can we say? Clearly the Donald has not been reading Alphaville. Even if the theory wasn’t bunkum, which of course it is, there’s the longstanding problem that blockchain can’t and never has been able to control for the garbage-in and garbage-out problem. Pieczenik also neglects to mention that if blockchain was indeed used to trace every single ballot, it would be a major breach of voter secrecy rules. In the best-case scenario, Trump would just be replacing one illegal act with another illegal one. What’s more, there’s no one in the official coinspace that gives the theory credence. Adding fuel to the conspiracy fire, however, was an interesting side development that got buried as a result of the election debacle. The US attorney’s office in San Francisco has now revealed it was behind the $1bn in bitcoin that was transferred unexpectedly on Nov 4. The sum -- linked to the 2013 Silk Road bust -- had previously sat unmoved in a mysterious wallet since 2015. How and to what degree that will be linked to the debacle is still unknown. What we can be sure of is that until waters settle and power is properly transferred, the consensus-reality of conspiracyland will be ablaze with all sorts of bonkers possibilities.

But it can be hard to visualise potential, can’t it? Because it’s so vague, so amorphous, so indeterminate. That’s why we need numbers. And charts. Because even if those numbers and charts are just potential numbers and charts with absolutely no connection to reality, they give us something that we can actually see with our own eyes. So here is what blockchain’s potential potential looks like, fresh from PwC’s new “Economic impact of Blockchain” report: Isn’t that a beautiful chart? So simple. So exponential. As you can see there, PwC’s economists have decided that blockchain has the potential to boost global gross domestic product by $1.76tn over the next decade! Potentially accounting for 2.3 per cent of GDP in 2030! (The word “potential” is used 15 times in the report.) And if that feels too far away for you then no worries because it’s going to boost GDP by $66bn even in 2021! PwC’s experts also expect “the majority of businesses to be using the technology in some form by 2025”. Which is quite surprising given that the blockchain has been around for more than ten years and it’s very difficult to find a single major company that has gone beyond the experimentation stage with it. But sure, give everyone four years and two-and-a-half months longer and why not! The report was bulked out by some compelling quotes, like this from PwC’s “global Blockchain leader” Steve Davies: Serious activity around blockchain is cutting through every industry across the globe right now. It’s driven by an acute need to win trust in the digital world. We’re not sure about your industry, but we can confirm that serious activity around blockchain is certainly cutting through the media . . . never to be seen again. (Remember Civil? Yeah.) Also we thought blockchain was the new internet but apparently it’s the new barcode! Barcode pioneer Brian Marcel, chairman of IBCS Group is quoted in the report thus: There’s a competitive advantage to be gained in adopting blockchain technology early because it’s going to change the world like barcodes did in the 70s and 80s — creating even greater trust in all of your business transactions. Actually wait — it’s also the new internet!! Guenther Dobrauz, a PwC global leader in financial services, tells us (emphasis ours): Blockchain is going to become an infrastructure technology — like the internet. No one really cares how the internet works, but it has become integral to our daily lives. The same will be true of blockchain. We haven’t reached that tipping point yet because there are no dominant players. At some point soon, this will change. Can’t argue with that. Aside from the hype, there’s quite a lot in PwC’s report that strikes us as not quite correct. Like this: The technology, as we’ll see in this report, creates digital records — such as certificates, public registers or agreements — which are stored, shared and amended online. Blockchain does not create certificates or public registers or agreements. In the bitcoin version of blockchain, it does automatically generate a record of a transaction (literally a transfer of strings of 1s and 0s from one person to another). But it does not create a digital record aside from a string of 1s and 0s. That record has to be put into the blockchain, either manually or by some other means, but the blockchain in and of itself does not create the record. And this one of our major issues with the tech. Because you know, GIGO. It’s no good having an immutable record of the provenance of your venti salted caramel mocha coffee frappuccino with extra cream if you can’t be sure that the supply chain of each of the 923 ingredients has been recorded accurately on the ledger in the first place. PwC concludes: As organisations look to reconfigure and embrace new technology, they should seize the opportunity to explore blockchain solutions. It’s quite comforting really. The world might be turning upside down but at least we can count on blockchain hype to keep on filling up our inboxes unabatedly, unashamedly, uninvitedly. Thank you Satoshi.

And when we say classic, we mean one of the most execrable pieces of propaganda masquerading as “research” that we have ever come across. Not only was this “report” actually just a massive bitcoin-shilling exercise, it also contained some really quite embarrassing errors from what is meant to be one of the top banks in the world (and their “premier thought leadership” division at that). The error that was probably most shocking was the apparent failure of the six Citi analysts who authored the report to grasp the difference between basis points and percentage points. As a refresher, the report said the following about illicit transactions in bitcoin, and then proceeded to compare that with those done on regular credit and debit cards: The extent of such activity can often seem overblown based on news headlines alone. In total, just over 2% of the activity in the cryptocurrency space was linked to illicit activity in 2019 and that total was down to only 0.3% in 2020. To put that figure in context, a payments study commissioned by the Federal Reserve found that fraud represented 13.46% of aggregate credit and debit card network activity in the U.S. As it turned out, the Fed study they refer to actually said that fraud represented 13.46 basis points — just the 100-fold difference, then. So we pointed this out to Citi who told us they would correct the report, and they stayed true to their word. Here’s the new graphic putting things right: Funny, isn’t it? Why didn’t Citi write that “13.46bp” figure as “0.1346%” so as to make the comparison easier to see? It’s almost as if they want their readers to be confused with this crime against charts. Also do note the text at the top of the graphic, in particular this bit: Security issues with cryptocurrency do occur, but when compared to traditional payments, it performs better. Doesn’t quite work now, that, does it? They must have been pressed for time. This, meanwhile, is how that section of the main text now reads: In total, just over 2% of the activity in the cryptocurrency space was linked to illicit activity in 2019 and that total was down to only 0.3% in 2020. To put that figure in context, a payments study commissioned by the Federal Reserve found that fraud represented 13.46 basis points of aggregate credit and debit card network activity in the U.S. So the numerical mistake is fixed but not the implication. Absolute jokers. And now that we’ve got through the wordy stuff, feast your eyes on some of the other charts in the report. We’ll let the charts do the talking: Later we are given another version of that chart: They must have been quite pleased with the “North Star” idea. The term is used 18 times in the report. Then there’s: And: And: Oh and we should just leave you with Citi’s “acknowledgment” — they’re kind enough to not take all the praise for their steaming pile: In preparing to write this report, we completed a series interviews [sic] with CEO\u0027s [sic] and professionals of some of the leading custodians, prime brokers, exchanges, infrastructure, and asset management companies, in addition to select experts within Citi. We thank them for all of their sharing their [sic] knowledge and expertise.

Its cutting-edge technology is supposed to allow financial institutions “to send money across borders, instantly, reliably and for fractions of a penny”, by the power of its immutable digital dream-ledger (aka blockchain, but for banker bros). In all honestly, it isn’t making much progress on that front. Spanish bank Santander, a Ripple investor and what the company calls “one of our largest and most important customers”, recently chose not to use Ripple’s XRP currency for its new international payment network. But you might at least think Ripple’s CEO would know a thing or two about technology. And also immutability. It turns out, though, that blockchain is not the only game in town when it comes to immutable ledgers. On Wikipedia anyone can edit a page, but the site keeps a record of these changes for all to see. It’s a bit like, um, a shared digital ledger. The difference with the Wikipedia ledger is that all these entries and edits are stored on a regular database, rather than a distributed one like a blockchain. As founder Jimmy Wales has pointed out, it turns out that’s perfectly sufficient! What is like the original bitcoin blockchain, however, is that the Wikipedia ledger is pseudonymous, meaning that you can’t see the full details of the person who has made changes to any given entry. If they’re not using a pseudonym, you can see their IP address. With that in mind, it’s come to FT Alphaville’s attention recently that some Wikipedia users — two in particular — have been repeatedly editing Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s Wikipedia page to remove some less positive aspects of the entry. Specifically, these two users have been removing text under the “Controversies” section of the page, and one of them in fact removed the whole section entirely, before it was reinstated by a different Wikipedia editor. The Controversies section includes the fact that Garlinghouse had claimed multiple times that the published error rate for SWIFT messaging was at least six per cent (a claim that has been proven to be false in a great piece by Martin Walker published by the London School of Economics Business Review); the fact that he’d been personally named in a group of class actions against Ripple that claim the company has breached various securities laws; and the fact he’d admitted that, without sales of the XRP cryptocurrency, Ripple would be lossmaking (which was revealed by none other than, um, FT Alphaville.) So there’s been something of an “edit war” on the page, with multiple removals and reinstatements of text since May. And we know this because via the magic of Wikipedia’s non-blockchain-flavoured digital ledger, we can see all the edits that have been made to the page by either a user or an IP address. (You can see the full edit history here if you’re interested, as you can do on any Wikipedia entry by clicking “View history”.) One of the users, who can only be identified by their IP address, appears to have edited another Wikipedia page before editing Garlinghouse’s one. It was the page of a woman named Cheryl Helmer, a Republican politician and a member of the Kansas House of Representatives. Funnily enough, this user actually added a “Controversy” section to Helmer’s entry, under which it was written that she’d “attracted national attention during the COVID-19 pandemic when she requested that Kansas Governor (of the opposing party) produce information on the Governor\u0027s hairstyling”. It turned out that the Democratic senator’s husband had been cutting her hair, hence Helmer’s demands being pretty controversial! We tried to find evidence of the “national attention” this controversy had provoked, but even the citation in the Wikipedia entry itself referenced an article in the Leavenworth Times, a local Kansas paper, and the only other place we found it was in the Kansas City Star. But is there any connection to Garlinghouse? While we don’t want to speculate, we would point out that he’s from Kansas and is a repeat donor to the Democrats. We’d also highlight that the IP address shows the editing user was based in Menlo Park, which is a small city in the Bay Area (where many start-ups, such as Robinhood, are located). Some of Garlinghouse’s political donations are sent from a Menlo Park address. Ahem. What about the other user? They were signed in as “Pizzamyheart” and, before touching up the Garlinghouse page, had edited Wesleyan University’s entry, alongside a few other pages. Ripple’s executive communications manager, it turns out, is a recent graduate of Wesleyan. Crypto journalist Mitchell Moos tweeted the company last week to ask them about this link, but doesn’t seem to have got a response: We haven’t had a response back from Ripple on this either. But since asking the company about the edits on Friday, and then again over the weekend, “Pizzamyheart” disappeared as a user on Wikipedia. Strange. We called up David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain and a Wikipedia editor and administrator, who was one of the people who had been reinstating the removed Garlinghouse text. He told us: It’s not clear precisely who did this but, if it looks like corporate whitewashing and quacks like corporate whitewashing, then we’ll treat it as such.

And who can forget when Neil Woodford invested in a cold fusion business that, quite literally, was making claims that were scientifically impossible.

How wrong we were. INX Trading Solutions is a “fully-regulated digital asset trading ecosystem for listing and trading cryptocurrencies and security tokens for both institutional and retail investors.” In just under a day it’s launching an ICO with the aim of raising $109m, net of commissions, from the sale of 130m tokens. On its website, it claims to have the “world’s first F-1 prospectus for a fully-registered security token IPO aimed at establishing an evolutionary financial trading market and to become a prime trading and listing arena for blockchain digital asset”. That prospectus, which has been filed with the SEC, can be read here. Yet for all INX’s speak of its “strong adherence to laws and regulations from inception”, that doesn’t seem to have extended to its graphic design department which, delightfully, has conjured up this in an attempt to demonstrate just how much of a quantum leap in financial innovation this token offering is (h/t to Joe Weisenthal for flagging on Twitter): There’s almost too much to unpick here. Why are the blue circles sized as such? Where is the advent of insurance and central banking in the 17th century?

But you’ve probably heard less (if anything) about AntChain, formerly Ant Blockchain, “a new technology brand for Ant Group’s blockchain-based solutions that also aggregates other digital technologies including AI, Internet of Things (IoT) and secure computation”. Sounds good though, doesn’t it? In a kind of chucking-random-buzzwords-onto-a-wall-and-seeing-what-sticks kind of way. You probably want a bit more information, though. In this “space”, one tends to find that hype is heavy and detail is light, and “blockchain-based solutions” doesn’t get us that far really. Well, look no further, because we of course have you covered. Or to be more specific, the “Elderly University of Alipay Choir” has you covered. What’s that, we hear you ask? Well, it’s a Chinese university for senior citizens, which is sponsored by Alipay as part of their philanthropic projects. Ant, the parent company of Alipay, says the song was not created by them (Ant is the parent company of Alipay). So this was, apparently, a voluntary thing. Don’t you just love philanthropy? The “seniors” dressed up as ants (geddit?) and created a rather proselytising yet wondrous video to explain all of the things that AntChain will be able to make better in this world (h/t Chris Skinner for drawing our attention to this one via his blog a few days ago; the video was originally posted on Twitter in July). Someone on the internet then translated the video into English, which Ant has confirmed is pretty much a correct translation, apart from some typos. The video doesn’t seem to be on YouTube so we can’t embed it, but you can watch the whole thing here. And yes, that is the melody of The Lonely Goatherd from Sound of Music. Do watch the whole thing — it’s quite magical.

The company has been working on blockchain projects for several years, and boasts that it holds “the greatest number of published blockchain-related patent applications from 2017 to the six months ended June 30, 2020”. Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, from which Ant was spun out, and who owns almost 10 per cent of Ant’s shares and half of the voting power, is very bullish on the technology. Very bullish. According to the South China Morning Post, Ma said back in 2018 that: We have to turn to blockchain, otherwise it would be fatal. Get on blockchain get on blockchain get on Antchain! P.S. Izzy says if there was ever evidence that blockchain is the pathway to a Borg hive existence for all humanity, it’s this.

As in so many other areas, technology is transforming trust-based transactions, but it has also created new problems of its own. When we were all muddy-faced peasants living in villages, we relied on gossip to know whom to trust. When life became more sophisticated, we created expert institutions to build societal trust. Now, thanks to technology, we outsource much of our judgment to total strangers, who rate products, drivers, apps, employers and people’s spare rooms online. This third trust revolution has underpinned the emergence of huge new digital businesses, such as Alibaba, Uber and Airbnb. Connecting everybody online creates a powerful “hive mind” that can capture the wisdom of crowds. But one of the troubles with these models of distributed trust is that they are themselves too trusting — they do not pay enough attention to original sin. They also open up digital platforms to criminals and propagandists. Trust may be the currency of the sharing economy; sadly, it has already been debased. Two Financial Times investigations this month have highlighted how trust can be manipulated on even the best-resourced tech platforms. The first showed how Amazon’s online marketplace in the UK had been infested with fake reviewers giving five-star recommendations to little-known Chinese products. Following the investigation, Amazon deleted 20,000 product reviews. The second revealed how highly organised “ratings farms” have manipulated rankings on Apple’s App Store. Boosting the rating of an app above four stars can have a big impact on usage on a platform that facilitates more than $500bn of commerce. “The problem is that the truth gets rained on,” one industry expert said. Similar trust problems have plagued other platforms. Uber has had rogue drivers, Facebook political propagandists and Airbnb fake customers exploiting loopholes in automated systems. Rachel Botsman, the author and academic who was one of the earliest enthusiasts about the power of distributed trust, acknowledges that the revolution has so far failed to deliver on its potential. “The promise is still there, but the mechanisms are wrong and clunky,” she said. Recommended It is undoubtedly hard to deliver trust on an industrial scale involving many millions of online interactions. But Ms Botsman highlights the positive examples of distributed trust that have emerged among small groups of local users on WhatsApp or Nextdoor helping out neighbours during the coronavirus crisis. “Where distributed trust works best is not in a global marketplace but where it is hyper-localised,” she said. That suggests that our village mentality remains strong. Personal connections, word-of-mouth recommendations and societal sanction for the untrustworthy can all play a vital role in building online trust, too. The answer may be to try to integrate all three of the models, combining individual recommendations with institutional trustworthiness and collective wisdom. This combination can create powerful knots of trust. One business that is attempting to do just that is UrbanSitter, a San Francisco-based start-up focusing on the babysitting market. Sitters register with the service and are checked out by company staff, who scour personal submissions, criminal records and social media posts. In return, families are scrutinised to ensure the safety of sitters. Both parties are subject to two-way appraisals and performance measures. The company, founded in 2011, has facilitated more than 1m bookings across the US, creating a nationwide web of referrals. “All this builds up a much more trusted ecosystem,” says Lynn Perkins, UrbanSitter’s founder and chief executive. “We are trying to give you word-of-mouth trust in an easy-to-use service.” It may be a similar story with blockchain — or distributed ledger technology — perhaps the ultimate distributed trust model. There are perhaps some workable, if limited, examples of trusted institutions creating “permissioned” blockchains between themselves to expedite share transfers, for example. But wholly “permissionless” decentralised blockchains, championed by the technology’s purists, can generate considerable risks. Trust cannot, and should not, be purely automated.

The views expressed herein are those of the authors and should not be attributed to the IMF, its Executive Board, or its management; or of Avanti. Monetary policy in the United States, until the early 1980s, was simple and conducted exclusively within the traditional banking system. Then, slowly, it began to seep into securities markets via rehypothecation and other uses of collateral. These methods gradually surpassed in importance the fractional reserving of dollar deposits in the traditional banking system. Now, as the growing connection between large bank funding desks and digital assets is becoming more notable, that pendulum might be swinging back. This is because high-velocity digital assets, secured via a blockchain, could become more prominently used in collateral markets. This development could be significant for monetary policy, where collateral re-use has declined since the 2008 financial crisis. (Table 1 updates the latest collateral velocity data that were primarily led by prime-brokerage funding and leverage to hedge funds.) How might digital assets function in collateral markets? Title transfer-based collateral agreements could, in theory, utilise these assets as eligible collateral — assuming they are securities — which would settle with finality, just as happens with US. Treasuries under title transfer. Security interest-based collateral agreements take a charge over a digital asset. Such digital assets as securities could be re-used — but, importantly, while the length of collateral chains involving traditional securities cannot be accurately tracked, the length of collateral chains involving digital assets can be measured in near-real-time. Transparency is a key benefit of open blockchain technology because these assets can be tracked in a manner that does not give up privacy or reveal proprietary trading strategies. The ability to monitor collateral-chain leverage should appeal to risk managers and regulators alike. Collateral re-use has been a difficult metric to integrate within a monetary policy framework. Disclosures about pledged collateral are generally made only once a year, in the footnotes of banks’ financial statements. Auditing standards do not reflect whether collateral reported on a bank’s balance sheet is reflected on more than one institution’s balance sheet simultaneously. But what if collateral re-use were no longer so critical to monetary policy because money could naturally start exhibiting higher velocity? A recent Federal Reserve paper by Wong and Maniff contains a discussion of the “programmability” of money — a feature of smart contracts, which are self-executing pieces of code that can automate business processes, and which are associated with a subset of digital assets issued on blockchains. (These are either privately-issued, such as stablecoins designed to track the value of fiat currency, or a central bank digital currency; of critical importance to collateral markets, IOSCO notes that stablecoins can resemble regulated securities.) The digital asset world has been talking about programmability for years, and mainstream financial players are now connecting the dots about its importance. Why? Because programmable digital assets exhibit high velocity (see Table 2), potentially exceeding that of traditional money in some jurisdictions. Amid the collapse in recent years of the velocity of traditional money, as QE and similar programs have expanded reserves on central banks’ balance sheets that remain mostly dormant, the rise of high-velocity, programmable money could pose important implications for monetary policy. Programmable instruments, such as cryptocurrency stablecoins, already exist (see Table 2), and since they are issued by non-banks they are not money and cannot offer settlement finality in money. At more than US$1.1tn of on-chain velocity annually (which is verifiable) and over US$12tn of exchange-reported velocity (off-chain crosses not independently verifiable), the volumes are no longer small. Mainstream institutions are taking notice. Why do these particular digital assets demonstrate significantly higher velocity than traditional bank money? These assets free up capital that would otherwise be trapped in unsettled payments, thereby improving the velocity of users’ capital (and returns on capital) — from traders to investors to corporate treasurers alike. They settle much faster than traditional payment systems — in minutes, not hours or even days — plus they settle on shared infrastructure (a blockchain), thereby eliminating the slow sequential settlement from one institution to the next and reducing counterparty credit risk. They also offer settlement finality, including protections from chargebacks and reversals that traditional payment systems may not provide. Most importantly, they are issued on API-based, smart contract platforms that enable users to build software applications to improve, for example, the payment reconciliation processes. However, digital assets issued by non-banks, including Facebook’s Libra, pose a problem for monetary policy. They squirrel away collateral — siloed and no longer available to be re-used in collateral markets, thereby adversely impacting global liquidity. A macroprudential-bulletin by ECB staff (Adachi et al, May 2020), noted that Libra could become a US$3tn collateral silo. Another alternative exists. If banks were to issue commercial bank money on blockchains in digital asset form, central banks would gain a new policy tool that enables them to deploy existing central bank reserves that are currently dormant. Commercial bank-issued dollar tokens backed by reserves on deposit at central banks would complement, not compete with, existing real-time gross settlement efforts of central banks, such as FedNow. Moreover, the valid concerns voiced by the Fed’s Lael Brainard about the legal, regulatory, financial system stability and private money implications of stablecoins issued by non-banks would not apply to bank-issued versions. Banks are following non-banks into the market. Swiss bank Sygnum, which was granted a bank charter a year ago by FINMA, in March began issuing a Swiss franc stablecoin 100 per cent backed by central bank reserves. Japan’s interbank dealer, Tokyo Tanshi, is a partner in a venture with software companies Digital Garage and Blockstream, which in June graduated from the innovation hub of Japan’s FSA and is issuing a yen stablecoin. The high velocity of digital assets as programmable money, and/ or as a security that can be pledged as collateral, offer a way for central banks to rely less on traditional money metrics as a monetary policy tool; if this holds true when applied to traditional finance, then what’s old in monetary policy may become new again.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-09-04","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/05c17062-b1df-4f7b-bedd-7ca32448f9ed","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F85a13117-65ac-4abd-b637-83acd39f3685.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"There’s very little evidence for blockchain, it turns out","INTRO":"So says the Centre for Evidence Based Blockchain, no less!","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Regular Alphaville readers will know that round these parts, we don’t think much of ye olde distributed technicolour dream-ledger. That’s because outside of cryptoland, where blockchain does actually have a purpose insofar as it allows people to pay each other in strings of 1s and 0s without an intermediary, we have never seen any evidence that it actually does anything, or makes anything better. Often, it seems to make things a whole lot worse. But step forward the Centre for Evidence Based Blockchain, a non-profit set up last year by the British Blockchain Association, whose very purpose is to promote “evidence-based adoption of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) across the public and private sectors”, to give us some sorely needed evidence. Last week, it published a very serious-looking “peer-reviewed” paper in its very own Journal of British Blockchain Association, presenting its findings from a “Global Study of Blockchain Projects and Start-up Companies”. Given that the peers in question are crypto peers, we weren’t sure how much credibility that would add to proceedings. But we were quite pleasantly surprised with the level of honesty that the paper exhibited: Our study concluded that almost half of the blockchain firms show no explicit evidence of the problem to be solved. Approximately one-third fail to cite a comparison and intervention analysis, and less than 2 per cent demonstrate evidence of outcomes backed by filtered (critically appraised, peer reviewed) information. They separate any evidence that does appear to exist into “filtered” (ie, supposedly peer-reviewed) and “unfiltered” (which includes any random blog post or article on a crypto site) and then ask questions like: “Have the results shown an objective improvement in outcomes?”, to which the answer is: No evidence: 304 Unfiltered evidence: 206 Filtered evidence: 7 Or, to put that in visual form: The paper also makes several recommendations. This one is pretty great, we think: For every £100 spent on blockchain and distributed ledgers, we propose that at least £2 should be dedicated to making sure the other £98 actually works. There’s also this one that’s quite good: We make a case for a ‘Chief Evidence Officer’ for all organisations where blockchain is being deployed, to ensure that blockchain products, services and solutions are built on best available scientific evidence; this will ensure efficacy, efficiency, impact and effectiveness. One might have thought that you’d seek evidence something worked before setting up a company. It could save you the £2, or plunging the C-suite into an existential crisis, but that idea doesn’t crop up. We do also wonder whether the Centre for Evidence-Based Blockchain should itself appoint a Chief Evidence Officer to make sure there really is some evidence for blockchain somewhere. FT Alphaville would nominate Martin Walker for the job, who is a director at the actual Centre for Evidence-Based Management, and who grabbed headlines in 2018 when he appeared alongside our very own Izabella Kaminska at a Treasury select committee. He told them blockchain was a “\u0027pixie dust\u0027 fad” and that its benefits in finance were “little to nothing”. As we’ve written before, blockchain is a belief system that requires faith rather than thinking. As Walker put it to us: All that it takes to make a credible idea, sometimes a good idea, into a fad is that people just switch off their brains, stop thinking, stop asking questions and start believing.

The internet, he said, “has been compressed under the powerful weight of a few dominant platforms”. The concern is highly topical now that coronavirus has led to a surge in online traffic. Should companies like Facebook and Google be allowed to profit so significantly by leveraging our private data at a time when humanity is making sacrifices? If there is a time for new “privacy-first” models, it may be now. Many of today’s dominant disrupters, such as Airbnb, Alibaba and Uber, use a platform model, acting as a powerful intermediary between users. So do seven of the 10 most valuable companies in the world, including Amazon and Apple. While these big companies appear invincible, the history of business and technology is replete with evidence that such businesses almost inevitably fall prey to newer, more efficient models, in line with the process of creative destruction described by the economist Joseph Schumpeter. Now a new breed of businesses known as DAOs (decentralised autonomous organisations) is paving the way for an alternative “trust-based” business model that has the potential to disrupt some of today’s dominant disrupters. DAOs are at the heart of the recent movement to create the next-generation internet, the internet of people (IoP), which calls for individuals to be able to control their personal data and for a drastic reduction in the role of intermediaries. The IoP movement argues that cyber space has been colonised by a few platform companies, which have turned the internet into a hostile environment through their exploitation of data and high fees in the range of 20-30 per cent. The DAOs are built on the principles of the IoP movement. First, they are based on the belief that parties directly involved in an exchange can operate without having to rely on third-party networks such as those used by Uber or Facebook. The likes of Swarm City, a ride-sharing app, are able to do this by exploiting technologies such as blockchain. Recommended Imagine a traveller using Swarm City. A DAO can create a hashtag “#needaride from point A to point B”, which serves as a marketplace and a smart contract. Drivers who are interested in providing the ride can send a bid directly to the prospective customer, eliminating the need for intermediaries such as Uber. Second, DAOs are based on the belief that users should control their personal data, and they do not capture user and interaction data centrally. This contrasts with platform businesses such as Uber and Facebook, which maintain centralised data sets and use them for commercial purposes. DAOs use blockchain technology, with advanced cryptography for security, to store relevant trust-forming information like consumer reviews in a distributed ledger. Third, DAOs take ultra-low commissions — typically less than 3 per cent. They pass on the savings to those parties involved in a transaction. As a result, they lay the foundation for new trust-based business models that return data control to users and share profits more equitably. The DAOs enable payments using cryptocurrencies. Arcade City, a ride-sharing service, issues “Arcade Tokens”, which eliminate expensive credit card fees. Users can use a preferred currency for buying and converting the tokens. Many DAOs, such as LockTrip, a blockchain-based travel marketplace, even accept credit cards for a low fee. Platforms such as Uber, Airbnb and Booking.com would be primary targets for disruption Our analysis suggests that all commercial platforms perform three key functions: matching supply and demand (such as rider with driver), verification of supplier reputation through reviews, and payment. DAOs are particularly suited to accomplishing these using technologies like blockchain. Platforms such as Uber, Airbnb and Booking.com perform precisely these three functions, so they would be primary targets for disruption. However, some big platforms are relatively safe for the time being, such as Amazon, which also provides extensive customer support and mediation, and a variety of products from different categories; and Netflix, which creates content. The DAOs will have to build scale to disrupt any of these dominant platforms. It is becoming increasingly clear many large suppliers whose profits have been hit by dominant platforms are partnering with the new arrivals. LockTrip lists more than 500,000 hotels and properties. Winding Tree, a business-to-business travel marketplace, has received an investment from Lufthansa and has partnered with Air Canada, Air France-KLM and Air New Zealand. DAOs will be able to build on large companies’ capital and brand strength to legitimise their business models. Even if the DAOs fail, their fundamental principles give them a good chance of capturing a fair share of the market. They are likely to mirror low-cost airlines and financial services businesses in the way those have wrestled market share from high-margin incumbents. The newcomers may initially appear inferior, but that is how Clayton Christensen, the late management writer and author of The Innovator’s Dilemma, predicted disruption would occur.

Its digital tokens, known as XRP, have a total value of almost $30bn, behind only bitcoin and Ether. But, eight years after launch, Ripple is still trying to find compelling uses for the blockchain technology underpinning its currency that would justify such a high figure. Now, in an effort to draw more users, it has struck out in a new direction: to try to become the Amazon of the cryptocurrency world, using its platform to support activities far beyond the original cross-border payments system it hoped to build. The popularity of XRP has already made Ripple — and its leaders — far richer than most start-up software companies. The company has cashed in more than $1.2bn of its own holdings of the cryptocurrency since early 2017. It is also still sitting on about 55 per cent of the total supply, worth around $16bn at current prices — far overshadowing its underlying technology business. As a result, the value of the company is tied “mainly to the XRP, with an option on a small software business”, said one former executive. Brad Garlinghouse, chief executive, admitted that Ripple is swayed heavily by the value of its crypto hoard. “We are a capitalist, we own a lot of XRP,” he said. “So do I care about the overall XRP market? 100 per cent.” But he added that the company’s aim was to “deliver a lot of utility through XRP”, something that is likely to take “years” as it develops applications that use its blockchain technology — and, by extension, justify the high price of the currency. Ripple’s original aim, to build a more efficient, wholesale cross-border payment system, has made slow headway with the banks that were the original target for the technology. Santander, the Spanish lender that invested in Ripple in 2015, recently chose not to use XRP at the heart of an ambitious new international payment network — a sign that even some of Ripple’s strongest backers do not yet see a use for its core technology. Cedric Menager, the network’s chief executive, suggested that Ripple was not active in enough markets yet to support Santander\u0027s needs.* The bank wanted to “give the best [user experience] as quickly as possible and also operate in as many currencies and corridors as possible from the beginning,” he said. Ripple said that Santander was still using some of its software in the payments service and was “one of our largest and most important customers”. The company also claims a high growth rate for the XRP facility at the heart of its system, though it does not provide absolute figures, and also says many banks are using some elements of its software. Many observers say Ripple was always facing an uphill battle in trying to win over the banks, which have already invested heavily in current technology and benefit from the current system. “It’s like Uber trying to disrupt the taxi industry by working with the taxis,” said Michael Arrington, the founder of the TechCrunch news site and now at a $100m cryptocurrency hedge fund. Mr Garlinghouse blames uncertainty in the US over whether XRP tokens should be regulated as securities for discouraging more companies from using Ripple’s blockchain. He and the company also face a lawsuit over claims they sold unregistered securities. Ripple has subsequently drawn on its main asset — its cryptocurrency reserves — to try to draw more users to its technology as it looks beyond the banks. In cross-border payments, the company’s focus has turned to remittances, where customers face high fees to send relatively small amounts through money transfer companies. Last year, Ripple used some of its cash to buy a stake in MoneyGram, as well as Bitso, a Latin American cryptocurrency exchange. The investments helped to put its technology at the centre of about 7 per cent of all remittances from the US to Mexico in June, the company said. But the success only represents one market, and has come at a cost. Moneygram’s filings show that Ripple handed it $31m in “market development fees” to encourage use of XRP in the first half of this year — payments that accounted for 60 per cent of Moneygram’s operating profit. Mr Garlinghouse defended the subsidies and said it was common practice for payment companies to use financial incentives to generate activity on their networks. He also said the need for payments such as this had fallen as activity had picked up: “If you look at more recent customers, it\u0027s a different dynamic now than when we first got started.” Ripple has also handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to stimulate wider uses of blockchain technology. A year ago, it said it had distributed the equivalent of more than $500m — much of it in the form of XRP — through its Xpring fund, as a way to seed more new applications that use blockchain technology and might, indirectly, benefit Ripple in the long run. That included handing $260m worth of cryptocurrency to Coil, a start-up building a decentralised online media marketplace where creators can sell directly to consumers. Most of the money was earmarked as grants to attract developers and creators to join Coil’s market, said Stefan Thomas, the company’s chief executive and a former Ripple chief technology officer. A year after launching a blogging platform, however, Coil seems to be generating little in return for the handouts. A German blogger identifying himself only as Benny has publicly disclosed his earnings on the service since the start of this year: the micropayments received for attracting readers add up to only about $15. However, over the same period, Coil has given him $2,250 worth of XRP as an incentive to keep writing. Ripple has since cut back on the Xpring handouts and instead is now trying to produce the tools that developers need to create their own applications to run directly on its blockchain. Ethan Beard, who runs Ripple’s developer efforts after once holding the same position at Facebook, said the company had moved from “writing cheques to writing code”. According to Mr Garlinghouse, this latest effort — which he described as an extension of the company’s strategy, rather than a full shift in direction, will turn Ripple into a broader blockchain platform in much the way Amazon has become a platform for a wide range of ecommerce. “Amazon started as a bookseller and just sold books. We happen to have started with payments,” he said. “Two years from now, you’re going to find that Ripple is to payments as Amazon was to books.” The gamble is a reversal from the position Mr Garlinghouse took when he joined Ripple as chief executive five years ago and narrowed its focus to payments. Unlike Amazon, however, Ripple has not yet produced a hit with its first application, leaving it without a big base of active users to sell other services to. Also, it has a controversial reputation in many parts of the cryptocurrency world, where its attempts to build bridges with the existing financial system clash with the radically anti-establishment motivations of many developers. “It gets a lot of hate in the crypto world, because it’s trying to be close to the banks,” said Mr Arrington. In one sign that some of the most potentially disruptive new applications are not being attracted to its platform, a wave of experimentation in decentralised financial applications — known as DeFi — has been drawn instead to the Ethereum blockchain. Despite Ripple’s struggles to find more uses for XPR, meanwhile, the speculators who have made it a fixture of the cryptocurrency markets are not giving up. Prices were subdued for much of this year, missing out on the jump for bitcoin and Ether, but then soared almost 50 per cent in the final week of July, putting them at their highest level since the coronavirus crisis hit. Even the prospect of a long search for a purpose does not shake the confidence of the cryptocurrency’s biggest supporters. “It can take centuries for currencies to catch on,” said Mr Thomas at Coil.

You can construct that ledger and you can do it electronically and use the best of data. Shin first raised the possibility of a mass ledger of our money’s memories back in the summer of 2018. As central banks move closer to making state-backed digital money a reality*, in the form of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), we could be about to see vision become reality. But what are the consequences of money suddenly having a universal memory? And are they necessarily all good? To explain why the dawn of monetary memory matters, we need to understand what happens right now. Most money comes not in the form of publicly issued banknotes, but rather exists as a mix of competing private and public-sector liabilities. Indeed, our current monetary landscape is more akin to a hierarchy of money types, with state-issued money sitting atop of the pyramid, and with various privately issued alternatives falling underneath it based on their trustworthiness. Many of these privately issued monies look and feel like public monies only because of the promises that their units can always be redeemed against public money at par. According to the Bank of England, central bank money, also known as the monetary base – either notes or coins, or reserves held by private lenders at the central bank – is but a fraction (specifically a fifth) of the total monetary liabilities that circulate through the system mimicking the values of public money. The rest is private money created by banks that is only constrained in its potential by regulatory frameworks. The two main constraints right now are the proportion of reserves lenders must have parked at the central bank and the proportion of capital regulators require them to set aside. A far more restrictive constraint on private money creation would be a full-reserve banking system – where all money must be backed by the state. CBDCs are a big step in that direction, potentially forcing all private lenders to pre-fund, and so leaving little scope for private money creation. In that sense a CBDC could operate as the final check on the double-entry accounting system that has persisted for centuries – and stop unchecked shadow money creation destabilising the system. Here’s Shin again: Money has undergone tremendous changes throughout history. And CBDCs could potentially be as far reaching a change as double-entry bookkeeping. Account-based money is still the same as when the Bank of Amsterdam started it in the 17th century – whether you do it with pen and paper or you do it with technology, the underlying architecture has been the same. Will it be as far reaching? I think you can make both cases. It is a step change in the architecture in the sense that central banks are thinking about for the first time having a ledger and assigning ownership based on that ledger. Under double-entry bookkeeping there is no collective memory because there is no universal substance that perfectly synchronises the snapshots of all the various financial balance sheets across the system. So monetary shadows go unseen until distress forces them into the light of the formal system intermittently (and sometimes with great surprise). These shadows are facilitated by the existence of jurisdictions that wilfully obscure, delay or misreport balances. While International Financial Reporting Standards have helped to reduce the scale of those shadows, by helping to synchronise and standardise financial reporting rules, the system is not infallible. The current method of bookkeeping also fails to track private money created for loans once it is repaid, meaning the story behind the money vanishes with it. The creation of a central bank digital currency, on the other hand, would potentially mean a far greater volume of the money supply comes from the same source, is accounted for on one ledger, and would last as long as the currency did, floating around the economy from bearer to bearer. There would no longer be any capacity for lookalike money to fill the gaps, the power of memory driving everything into the light by linking it all together and making escaping into the shadows an impossibility. It’s often said that money is as money does. But the reason we’re talking about this right now is more a case of when money doesn’t. Back in 2018 Benoît Cœuré, then of the European Central Bank and now of the BIS, dubbed bitcoin the “evil spawn” of the financial crisis. Yet bitcoin took off in no small degree because of the lack of trust in global financial officialdom following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. That threat to central banks’ monopoly of the monetary base has forced central bankers to move with the times and embrace innovation. Via Shin: What the Libra announcement and the energising of the debate did was to focus minds. There was a job to do in terms of central banks explaining some of the benefits of the payments system as a public good, it showed the importance of putting information on money out clearly. It also impressed upon central banks how far technology had come. For a sense of the impact that bitcoin and Libra have had on what central banks say, see this chart, taken from a BIS paper out yesterday: (Mostly negative) mentions shoot up first during the bitcoin boom, before rising again (and becoming more positive) after the unveiling of the original Libra white paper in June 2019 (there is now a Libra White Paper v2.0 which is . . . rather different). The upside of an all-encompassing monetary framework that links every transaction, replete with its history, to all others, is undoubtedly that it helps to keep the system stable. The downside is that it comes both with a loss of privacy and the fragility of brittle totalitarian systems. In that context, bitcoin’s brilliance becomes more evident; it was able to have its cake and eat it. Transactions remained fully private, thanks to the use of public key encryption, while its open blockchain ledger allowed for the formation of a collective monetary memory system which could be tracked, traced and monitored from the outside. Within its own ecosystem, there were no shadows – everything squared up. (We should point out here that a CBDC would not require a blockchain – there are ways other than distributed ledger technology (DLT) that are under discussion and are likely to prove more appropriate for a retail CBDC.) Yet users’ privacy came at a price – in the form of higher fees charged by miners, especially during times such as the bitcoin boom: While bitcoin users might view those fees as acceptable, the party line within the central banks would be that currencies and the payments systems that back them work best as public goods that can be accessed universally. That in turn implies a role for the official sector to keep costs at a minimum to make the memory of money as collective as possible. Money developing more of a memory also undermines one of its most important properties: fungibility. In the eyes of the Uniform Commercial Code, the most important act of contract law in the US – and therefore, as far as money is concerned, the world – cash never takes its claim history with it upon transfer. What this means in practice is that – in contrast to other facets of property law – anyone who acquires cash starts off with a clean slate as far as previous claims are concerned. It is assumed, then, that previous claims on cash are untraceable throughout the system. But once money has a provable public memory, history becomes much harder to ignore. Even if contract law demands that all past sins in the money chain must be forgiven, there’s a good chance some chains – especially those involved in disputed transactions – begin to be discriminated against cleaner chains. At this point, a whole new plethora of risks and frictions are likely to be introduced. There is a lot of debate right now about the various forms a public digital money could take (more on which, including a discussion of the pros and cons of DLT and other forms of infrastructure, here). The perfect fix would have bitcoin’s privacy, while also being scalable and less easy to replicate and sub-divide into competing systems, and less costly. Creating a collective memory for a jurisdiction’s money would probably require a retail CBDC, that could be used for payments by normal citizens. The reason being that these retail payments make up the bulk of the volume of transactions. On that front, the People’s Bank of China is well ahead of the curve. It has already forced the country’s main digital payment providers (such as WeChat and Alipay) to hold all deposits as reserves at the central bank on a fully collateralised basis. They are thus already the dispensaries of a CBDC in everything but name. Yet China is a case that highlights the pros and cons of the leap perfectly. On the one hand, there’s a clear benefit in terms of financial inclusion – especially in developing and emerging markets where significant proportions of populations remain unbanked. Via Shin: If the government were to do direct fiscal transfers, then you can guard against duplication and fraud, you can guard against people opening different bank accounts. During the acute phase of Covid we saw governments rolling out very aggressive fiscal packages. It’s those countries that have very fast systems that have done best, to get money in the pockets of people to buy essentials, financial inclusion is really underlined by the recent episode. On the other hand, there are clearly concerns about privacy. Do we really want states to have a ledger that gives them unlimited access to our money’s memories? This chart on privacy fears over digital payments, taken from yesterday’s report, indicates that many people do not: CBDC enthusiasts claim there may be ways in which data can be anonymised and some schemes are being trialled. Yet that jars with wider anti money-laundering and know-your-customer regulations. It appears an unsolvable paradox for now. Via Shin: What we still don’t know is whether it can be rolled out in a robust way into the whole economy and in a way where you can use the architecture as well - if we can keep track of who has spent it, while at the same time as ensuring privacy. It is uppermost in everyone’s mind, anyone who has looked into this matter knows that some sort of ledger has to be there – centralised or decentralised – while at the same time bearing in mind privacy concerns. A possible solution here is that, rather than requiring people to open accounts, central banks could instead use an “I know, therefore I own” system of digital tokens, with transfers taking place through digitally encrypted keys – the trade-off being that central banks would then fall foul of the very AML rules they’ve been pushing upon banks. Fears over privacy, then, are a massive obstacle to switching to CBDCs. The problem is only amplified by suspicions that central banks will, despite claims to the contrary, use the switch to CBDCs to abandon what is by far the most reliable and private form of money available to the public right now – cash. After all, we all have memories we would rather were forgotten. *State-backed digital money, of course, already exists. It comes in the shape of central bank reserves, which can only be exclusively held by commercially licensed banks. When people talk about central banks issuing their own digital money, what they usually mean is central bank money that consumers would hold directly, without the need of an intermediating bank. Thus far, the only state money the public can hold is cash.

Lay-offs everywhere from The Atlantic to Vice have been really sad to see, and also somewhat anxiety-inducing for those of us who have until now been lucky enough to be employed to do this journalism malarkey. But there is finding ways to make money via means other than via dwindling advertising revenues, and then there is taking the biscuit. Axel Springer-owned digital news site Business Insider, which so far has not announced any cuts, has an offshoot called BI Intelligence. It describes itself as a “premium research service specializing in business intelligence and data-driven research”, providing “deep analytical insight into the latest global trends and developments that every business needs to know to be competitive”. That’s all very well. But just how deep is this analytical insight into the latest global trends that every business needs to know? Well we’re not sure, because frankly we don’t really feel like paying for it. But we recently stumbled across an article promoting its “Blockchain in Banking” report (via Mike Dudas, who is founder and CEO of The Block, another online media site that focuses on blockchain and crypto) and, well, it was . . . not good. Above is a screenshot of the report in question, which you can now purchase for a snip at £300 if you use the discount code! (The full price is $495 in the US.) Dudas had come across an article published last week on the main Business Insider site where they were pushing the report, described as “an inside look at four banks’ early blockchain successes and failures”, under the somewhat unrelated-sounding headline “How to Invest in Cryptocurrency \u0026 Blockchain Technology”. Since Dudas’s tweet, the article has been deleted, but it is still available via the Wayback Machine. The article tells us that “the following is a preview of one Banking report, the Blockchain in Banking Report”, before providing a link for where you can purchase said report, and then — kind of bizarrely given that it doesn’t seem to have anything to do with blockchain in banking — a list of the “top cryptocurrencies to invest in” (happily telling us that these “have risen to the top as the most popular options for investment”): The first problem here is that this is utter nonsense. What they have listed there is not the “most popular options for investment”, but instead the five biggest cryptocurrencies by “market cap” (a quite meaningless and misleading metric when used in cryptoland, as we have said many times before). The most traded cryptocurrencies, according to CoinMarketCap, are actually currently (in order) Tether, bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. So four of the ones they list are correct, even if in the wrong order, you might say. Well, no. Because investing is different to trading. Trading volume is about how many times a cryptocurrency is bought or sold in any given time period. It’s not about buying something with an expectation of a future return. Trading is not, in other words, the same as the HODL. Tether might be the most traded cryptocurrency but it is not something that you would “invest” in. It is in fact a “stablecoin” that is meant to be tied to the dollar (and was also meant to be backed one for one by real dollars, lol) so the idea that you would “invest” in it, when you could just buy the dollar, makes no sense. The reason why it is traded so much is that many crypto exchanges only allow for crypto-to-crypto trading. In other words, if you want to buy bitcoin, for example, you first of all have to exchange your real-world money into Tether, and then you can buy the bitcoin. (We would also like to point out here that “investing” in crypto should actually be thought of as more akin to gambling. But we have made this point many times before and we are not ones to harp on about things we have already harped on about here at FT Alphaville. Don’t @ us.) Also, what’s all this about “Investors are paying a 220% premium to buy Ether” (another word for Ethereum, or the technical word for it)? The only reference we could find to such a premium was a Coin Telegraph article from February discussing the premium investors were paying to buy Ether via the Grayscale Trust, so that they didn’t have to have the risk of actually holding any real crypto. (Gotta love crypto!) It’s not just some “premium” that you pay to buy Ether. Did the person just copy and paste this from the Coin Telegraph article? We asked BI Intelligence why the article had been deleted and they told us that “We are making edits to the article which is why it’s down.” When we asked why they were editing it, they said: “We’re just updating it.” They also said they “stand by” their $495 blockchain report. It turns out that this article was not in fact a “preview” of the report, as stated, but just a way of selling it (not particularly well if you ask us). To be fair, telling people to “invest” in Tether is the kind of advice you can’t really put a price on. And we’re sure the actual blockchain report, which “provides actionable recommendations on how banks can successfully pursue a blockchain project”, is worth every cent.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-07-01","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/9acde1ba-184a-4827-880f-a5168275da38","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F3aae08ca-b932-4891-a18a-dc3e38cbd37a.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"ASX users urge Australian exchange to delay blockchain project","INTRO":"Computershare wants 2-year delay in implementation because it says project to overhaul critical systems lacks clarity","DETAILED_CONTENT":"ASX is under pressure to push back an ambitious plan to use blockchain technology to clear and settle trades in Australian equities because customers are worried about the implications of the rollout. Computershare, one of the main share registry companies in Australia, told the Financial Times it was seeking a two-year delay in implementation because the project to overhaul critical systems lacked clarity. The company said it had not been given the necessary technical, operational and regulatory information on how the new system would operate or the fees that would be charged by the ASX for existing and new services. Computershare — which maintains a register of legal ownership of shares and distributes corporate dividends for investors — said a delay until April 2023 was required to address the risks of the project, particularly in light of complications introduced by the Covid-19 pandemic. A delay of this order would be a blow to the ASX, which became the first big stock exchange around the world to commit to using so-called distributed ledger technology — which underpins bitcoin and other digital currencies — for clearing and settlement in 2017. The new system would enable customers “to develop new services and reduce their costs”, and would “put Australia at the forefront of innovation in financial markets”, the ASX said at the time. But users rely on the ASX for clearing and settling up to 2.5bn shares a day, making the replacement of its existing “Chess” system a critical flashpoint. The ASX should focus on its core systems rather than prioritise the development of new commercial services, said Ann Bowering, Computershare’s chief executive of issuer services in Australia and New Zealand. Blockchain technology promises to deliver an instant electronic database of transactions shared among many parties, threatening the revenues of share registrars. “In order to get this project back on track we really need a robust governance framework which isn’t there today and at the end of the day, we need to take a look at the timeline,” she said. Several ASX clients expressed concerns to the FT that the exchange could use the tech overhaul to extend its dominance in clearing and settlement into other markets, including share registry services. Tony Cunningham, founder of CPS Capital, a Perth-based stockbroker, said there was a lack of clarity on how the distributed ledger system would operate and how it would affect broking, share registry and other market activities. “This [new platform] is owned by ASX and the ASX is a monopoly, it’s not ideal. I don’t believe they should own it,” he said. “If ASX have a distributed ledger, then why do you have a share registry?” Australia’s Stockbrokers and Financial Advisers Association told the FT it also wants a six- to 12-month delay to the project. Australia’s competition regulator said it was working with the Council of Financial Regulators, and advising the ASX to consider the implications to market competition when developing the Chess replacement. “In particular, the ACCC advocates for transparent and non-discriminatory pricing and access to clearing and settlement services,” said an ACCC spokeswoman. Recommended ASX said the blockchain initiative would not harm competition, adding that it had kept the market briefed on the project’s objectives from the outset. “The market has been engaged and consulted extensively since the commencement of the project,” the company said. “The solution has been designed with the market’s input to capture the features that the industry wants. The project’s scope was defined through a lengthy and comprehensive market consultation process where the industry prioritised the requirements they wanted to see in the new system. The scope has not been expanded.” ASX had aimed to roll out the blockchain-based system in April 2021 but agreed to a short delay in March. A consultation paper setting out new plans for the project’s scope and timing is due as early as next week. “We know there are stakeholders who want a small change to the go-live date as well as those who are seeking for more time,” the company said. “We will listen carefully to the consultation feedback prior to finalising the revised implementation timeline.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jamie Smyth Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-06-25","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/a76fba24-afbe-4b4d-84b8-629fedd961c1","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fd5e6702c-44ab-43a2-a27d-579498c9de18.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Canaan you believe this crypto stock got listed on the Nasdaq?","INTRO":"Canaan Creative, the Chinese firm with a... creative approach to securities laws.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In November, Chinese bitcoin mining-machine manufacturer Canaan Creative became the first crypto company to be listed on the Nasdaq, at a valuation of $1.35bn. After the IPO-that-never-was of Bitmain, another Chinese bitcoin mining firm that has been trying to go public since 2018, the successful listing of Canaan on a major US stock exchange was heralded by the crypto industry as something of a coup. This despite the fact that the $90m the company raised was a fraction of its original $400m target. See for instance this tweet by Justin Sun (the dude who Warren Buffett was recently made to dine with after he bid just over $4.5m for the privilege): The party appears to have been a little premature, however. In the three months or so since listing, the Cayman Island-registered company -- which is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of the ASIC devices that are used to “mine” cryptocurrency -- has seen its share price collapse by almost half, from $9 to around $4.70 at pixel time (despite a rather unusual 80 per cent one-day surge in the middle of last month). And that’s in a period during which bitcoin has climbed about 15 per cent. But the collapsing share price is just the start of the company’s woes. Bear with us as we tell you a strange tale of how it came to be that this little-known Chinese crypto firm came to be listed on the second-biggest stock exchange in the world, despite three unsuccessful listing attempts in Asia, and is now being sued by unhappy investors. On Wednesday an investor in Canaan named Phillippe Lemieux filed a class-action lawsuit against the company, alleging that it had released false and misleading statements to make its financial health appear better than it was, and had failed to disclose information that might have been pertinent to investors. And a host of law firms have announced investigations into similar claims of securities laws violations by Canaan over the past couple of weeks. This all comes on the back of a February 20 note from short-seller Marcus Aurelius Value (MAV), entitled “Canaan Fodder”, which goes into some rather disturbing details about the company’s antics in the run up to the Nasdaq listing, and also its three previous unsuccessful listing attempts. Canaan told us they were unable to provide any comment for this article as it was too close to their fourth-quarter earnings release. Instead, they directed us to an article on Chinese blockchain-focused site huiyep.com, which constitutes of a series of rebuttals to the MAV short report. It’s in Mandarin, but we’ve used Google to give us a clunky translation, and will include some of this in order to try to put across Canaan’s point of view in this post. From the MAV note (with our emphasis): We view CAN as the latest US-listed Chinese company to have deceived investors about its business. After failing three times to list itself on Asian exchanges since 2016, CAN took advantage of these frothy markets to complete a NASDAQ IPO in November 2019. Shares surged by more than 80% in a single trading day last week, pushing the company’s market cap above $1 Billion, in a move that appears to have enticed thousands of unsuspecting retail investors into the speculative fervour. But our investigation of this bitcoin mining machine maker reveals undisclosed related party transactions, irregularities involving many customers and distributors, as well as a business model that we view as broken. Regardless of your outlook on the future of Bitcoin, we believe that CAN’s business is simply far worse than promoted. We therefore see significant downside potential and believe the stock is uninvestible. So let’s look into some of these allegations. The first concerns alleged undisclosed related party transactions. In late October, around three weeks before the Nasdaq listing, Canaan announced a “strategic partnership” with a small Cayman Island-incorporated, Hong Kong-listed company called Grandshores, with the latter agreeing to spend up to $150m on buying and distributing Canaan equipment on behalf of the company by the end of 2020. That $150m is nearly equal to Canaan’s 12-month trailing revenue of around $177m, as MAV points out, so this would seem like kind of a big deal for the company. But it’s also more than three times greater than Grandshores’ market capitalisation, four times Grandshores’ reported 2019 revenues, and almost ten times the amount of cash the Hong Kong company says it has on hand. So how could Granshores afford to spend this $150m? What was going on? It turns out that Grandshores’ chairman and executive director, Yao Yongjie, is a shareholder in Canaan, owning 9.7 per cent of the company’s outstanding shares, according to an SEC filing. But this transaction isn’t listed in the SEC filings, so the relationship is not acknowledged. MAV says it views the Grandshores announcement as “largely bogus”, and that it “was used by CAN as a device to hype its financial prospects to investors”. We got no reply to our request for comment on this from Grandshores, but the Huiyep article says the relationship did not need to be disclosed as it “did not meet the related party standards required by the US financial accounting standards”. It also says the $150m deal “was only an intent, not an ongoing or completed transaction, and had no impact on the operating results during the reporting period” and there was therefore no need to disclose it. (Grandshores did, however, feel the need to disclose it as a related party dealing, in its filings in Hong Kong.) Similar apparent related party transactions appear to have been used to boost investor interest in the run-up to Canaan’s attempts to list on Chinese exchanges. You also have the fact that some of the companies listed as major customers of Canaan in its Chinese listing documents seem to be operating in industries that are entirely unrelated to crypto mining. According to MAV, one of among the top-five accounts receivable listed by Canaan in 2015 to 2017 was a firm called Tianjin Garments Import \u0026 Export Co. The clue is in the name: the company says on its website that it specialises in “clothing, fabrics, blankets, carpets and stone carvings”. The Huiyep article says on this (excuse the clunky translation) that Canaan “borrowed (Tianjin’s) import and export qualifications to export a mining machine to a Swedish customer. The initial payment was still the advance payment of Tianjin Clothing”. Hmm. Then there are the disappearing distributors. Shortly before its IPO, Canaan deleted 8 of the 11 official distributors it had previously listed on its website (MAV links to the a May 2019 version of the website as archived by the waybackmachine). One of these was a company called Nova Bit Mining Solutions, which at least sounds like it might be into crypto mining. The intriguing thing here, though, is that the CEO of Nova Bit, according to his LinkedIn profile, is Andres Romero, and he is... one of Canaan’s sales reps. He happily lists both companies on his LinkedIn profile: We contacted Romero on this, and he told us that he no longer worked for Nova Bit and that he just hadn’t got round to updating his LinkedIn profile. He also said he had “no idea” who the new Nova Bit CEO was or whether the company was still operational. Like MAV, we made several calls to the number listed on the Nova Bit website and didn’t get through. There appears to have been some further issues regarding the distributors, too. MAV say their review of the other seven deleted distributors reveals that “most appear to be small, defunct, or otherwise incapable of buying material amounts of product from CAN”. The other company you can see Romero currently works for, on his LinkedIn is Northern Data, which last week announced a “close cooperation” with Canaan “in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) development, Blockchain Technology and Datacenter operations”. Canaan’s other listed sales agent, Matthew Carson, works for the same company, according to his LinkedIn profile. Cryptoland: it’s all so cosy. Another slightly odd matter, given the fees associated with such transactions, is that shortly before Canaan’s November 20 listing on the Nasdaq, its lead underwriters Credit Suisse pulled out of the IPO. We asked Credit Suisse to tell us the reason for the sudden change of heart but the bank declined to comment. There’s much more to dig into here, and the full short report -- which has not provoked any direct response from the company -- is worth a read. We will certainly continue to keep a close eye on this firm. With this much smoke, there has to be some Canaan fire.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-03-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/8a94be58-5c32-4ec4-9e9b-b6cf1d60ccfe","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fcb9b1b15-7c93-4624-9c7f-a7638fcbed62.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Mr Blockhead wants to school us all on blockchain","INTRO":"Keep your kids away from their screens, folks; it’s dangerously disruptive out there.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"It’s always difficult finding pictures for stories about blockchain and crypto. Does one use one of those quite frankly terrible stock images that show crypto tokens as actual coins and thereby feed the fallacy that these are in fact currencies? Does one use a picture of a crypto mine, which essentially just looks like any other data centre — ie, a room full of computers — and can therefore be a little dull? Or does one try to somehow illustrate the magic of blockchain with some kind of graphic, and if so, how does one come up with a graphic of something that is used in such an inconsistent way to mean so many things? Luckily for us, our perpetual quandary appears to have been answered. Because we now have a personification of the marvel that is the distributed dream-ledger. And what’s especially lucky is that personification of the blockchain has given unto us a literal blockhead. (In case you don’t know, a blockhead is a word that dates back to the 1540s and means “a very stupid person”. Look, they did this, not us.) Enter Figure, a Silicon Valley-based start-up headed up by Mike Cagney, former CEO of Social Finance Inc (SoFi) that says it provides lending on the blockchain. On Tuesday it launched a video ad campaign that hopes to “educate consumers” on the technology (h/t to Reuters’ Anna Irrera for drawing our attention to this one). Here’s the main ad, in which we get introduced to this fun and disruptive dude. As you will see, Figure’s cartoon character is imaginatively just called “Blockchain”, but we’re sure you’ll agree that he suits Mr Blockhead much better. Mr Blockhead tells us: I’m not bitcoin, cryptocurrency, or anything scary. In fact I make things less scary. I improve financial transactions like loans, behind the scenes, to make them more efficient, secure, and less costly. Which, if I work my magic right, can save you money. Before me, this was all done manually — aka by people. And people can make mistakes. And then other people have to find those mistakes and correct them, which all takes time and money. Ah yes. Because as we all know by now, blockchains can’t make mistakes. Why not? Well to be honest, it’s not because it’s impossible for there to be a mistake on a blockchain. It’s because they’re immutable. So the idea of finding those mistakes and correcting them? Not possible. So you see you really can’t make a mistake. Can’t meaning shouldn’t, of course. Don’t you just love this technology? The best bit is probably when Mr Blockhead starts explaining the trustless nature of the blockchain (emphasis ours): Whenever you use Figure to get a loan, I make a block. That block is a super-secure digital record of the transaction. In fact it’s so secure that in order for me to create or append a block, I have to share my block with a network of unbiased computers, called nodes . . . from trusted financial institutions all over the country. And they all have to sign off on it to give me the go-ahead to make it. Which means I can always maintain the security and legitimacy, OR TRUTH STAAAATE. You know, those unbiased computers at all those unbiased banks! What’s that you say — you don’t trust those banks? That’s OK! Um hello, we have a blockchain! Distributed across a whole load of computers at . . . oh yeah. No that doesn’t quite work does it.

Do you see caution, restraint and austerity? Or is it more excess, profligacy, and greed? For the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Hester Peirce, a commissioner at the US financial regulator with libertarian leanings, it appears to be the former. Ms. Peirce — whom blockchainers have nicknamed “CryptoMom” because of her ongoing support for cryptocurrencies — gave a speech to the International Blockchain Congress in Chicago on Thursday, where she announced that she was proposing a new rule. Crypto start-ups, she said, should get a “safe harbour period” for three years after they issue their tokens, during which time they shouldn’t be subject to the normal regulations. In a speech entitled “A Proposal to Fill the Gap Between Regulation and Decentralization”, Peirce told revellers: When we see people struggling to find a way both to comply with the law and accomplish their laudable objectives, we need to ask ourselves whether the law should change to enable them to pursue their efforts in confidence that they are doing so legally. Entrepreneurs across the crypto landscape are facing just such a scenario in their attempts to develop worthwhile and beneficial products. Whether it is issuing tokens to be used in a network, launching an exchange-traded product based on bitcoin, providing custody for crypto assets, operating a broker-dealer that handles crypto transactions, or setting up an alternative trading system where people can trade crypto assets, our securities laws stand in the way of innovation. Yeah, because after all, why can’t setting up a trading system for crypto assets (essentially, in our view, facilitating gambling) be laudable and beneficial and worthwhile? And why shouldn’t i n n o v a t i o n come first for once? What’s that you say? Innovation has come first in the past and things haven’t necessarily turned out that well? Oh well things are different now so let’s not look back at previous mistakes. All eyes on the decentralised future! One of the main regulatory hurdles getting in the way of crypto-innovation in the US concerns the Howey test, which determines whether or not a transaction should be considered an investment contract, and therefore whether it should be subject to securities laws. This has been used to determine that several initial coin offerings (ICOs) were in fact unregistered securities offerings, with significant fines for the targeted token issuers. But Ms. Peirce thinks that this test is often used unfairly. You see she really, really sees the best in the cryptofolk (emphasis ours): There are circumstances in which the security label fits, but, in other cases, promises made about tokens increasing in value are nothing more than expressions of the hope that a network will succeed and be used by lots of people. Absolutely. Because when you’re trying to shift a few million strings of 1s and 0s to retail investors for a couple of hundred million quid, sharpish, what you’re really focusing on is your hope that your network will succeed and be used by lots of people. Yes, you might be telling potential buyers that your token is going “to the moon”, but again it’s just an innocent expression of hope. Ms Peirce does think there should be some conditions for token issuers under her proposed “safe harbour” rule: First, the team must intend for the network on which the token functions to reach network maturity—defined as either decentralization or token functionality —within three years of the date of the first sale of tokens and undertake good faith and reasonable efforts to achieve that goal. Second, the team would have to disclose key information on a freely accessible public website. Third, the token must be offered and sold for the purpose of facilitating access to, participation on, or the development of the network. Fourth, the team would have to undertake good faith and reasonable efforts to create liquidity for users. Finally, the team would have to file a notice of reliance. But overall, it seems like CryptoMom just wants to give the cryptokids a break. Enthusiastic commentary on the development has of course been spewing into our already sagging inbox. Like this from Catherine Coley, CEO of the US division of Binance, a crypto exchange that is estimated to have made over $1bn in cumulative profit: If adopted, the proposed safe harbor could be the most groundbreaking development for the U.S. cryptocurrency market to date.... By putting development first and giving projects runway to build robust networks, the proposed safe harbor puts an important stake in the ground towards supporting American access and acceptance of digital asset markets. In the long run, it will help bring more Americans into digital asset trading and foster greater network participation. (Bringing more Americans into digital asset trading; what more could you ask of a regulator?) And this from Andy Bromberg, co-founder and president of CoinList, a crypto token sales management platform: This is a great day for the blockchain industry and the United States. Today we both congratulate and thank SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce. In her announcement of proposed Rule 195, she set a course for compliant blockchain projects to innovate and grow here in the United States, resolving more than two years of ongoing discussions about the applicability of securities laws to crypto. A great day for the United States indeed! What could possibly go wrong? For an idea, we recommend that Ms Peirce (and any readers who aren’t familiar with ICOs) have a look here.

Frankly, there are more important and concerning things to write about at the moment. But sometimes, when a spot of writer’s block just happens to coincide with the delivery of the most perfect exemplar of a techno-solutionist press release, well one’s appetite for blockchain-bashing is re-whetted. Shimmying on into our inbox on Wednesday came the news that “Tech rivals collaborate on blockchain to combat COVID-19”! This of course wasn’t the first release we’d been sent on how the distributed technicolour dream-ledger could help combat this deadly pandemic. And nor, we concede with some regret, will it be the last. But what it was, by a country mile, was the best (emphasis ours): In response to COVID-19, technology companies have ramped up collaborations on innovative technologies such as blockchain, says GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company. Charlotte Dunlap, Principal Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The industry can no longer afford to wait several years for new market segments such as blockchain to take off.” Why is that, we hear you ask? Well it’s simple. And reader, please do take your time to really savour this paragraph, because honestly even if we were trying to write parody we couldn’t have come up with this: The dire nature of COVID-19 demands the ability to fast-track solutions at a Netflix-like pace. With the forthcoming enabling technologies, reducing complexity and the need for technical expertise in order to usher in a broader set of stakeholders, ‘citizen solver’ could become the newest catchphrase. There’s then some fluff about a “potentially mega-blockchain initiative” to “integrate COVID-19 data” from relentless blockchain-pushers IBM and Oracle (who were actually already working together on blockchain projects, so coronavirus does not appear to be, contrary to what the release is claiming, the impetus for this). We’re never told what on earth this integrated data will do, of course. We’re also given a couple of examples of “blockchain-based monitoring systems springing up”. Again, no explanation for why in Ford’s name the blockchain could possibly be of any benefit. And then the conclusion: Dunlap concludes: “The effects of unprecedented cooperation among technology rivals coming together to solve a global crisis will continue to linger long after the coronavirus is under control. Enterprises should become accustomed to new levels of industry collaboration. This expectation will be based on a critical need for industry giants to rally together to focus attention in 2021 and beyond on helping to get the economy back on track and ensuring customers are successful.” (Please God, please, can the customers be successful.)

Compound is not a bank, in the familiar sense. Rather, it is one of dozens of new Silicon Valley groups developing so-called decentralised finance — or “DeFi” — projects aiming to disintermediate traditional financial institutions. To date, digital currencies and their underlying blockchain technologies have largely been used for speculative trading. But DeFi start-ups are trying to build an interlocking financial system denominated in cryptocurrencies, offering a wide array of lending and derivatives products available globally, peer-to-peer and without any middlemen. The movement has gathered steam in 2019, with investment from mainstream investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Ventures. Even former UK chancellor George Osborne has shown support as a partner at his brother Theo Osborne’s venture capital group 9Yards Capital, which backs several DeFi start-ups. “2019 will be known as the year of DeFi for crypto,” said Monica Desai, an investor at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. “Some of the best talent in the space right now is in DeFi. And because they’re seeing usage, more people are building there.” But DeFi is still nascent, freewheeling and largely unregulated. Most companies have only debuted their initial products in the past year, and total assets have yet to exceed $1bn. Meanwhile, critics warn that the sector’s technological limitations and untested economics may not work when handling larger transaction volumes. “[DeFi] is a sign of things to come and a super interesting sandbox,” said Simon Taylor, a former Barclays vice-president and co-founder at financial technology consultancy 11:FS. “[But] it’s both very dangerous and the Wild West.” DeFi first gained traction in late 2018 as an umbrella term for a loose collection of blockchain projects focused on eradicating any human involvement from financial services. For proponents, this promises a faster, more inclusive and transparent financial system. The movement encompasses “decentralised” exchanges and lending platforms, for example. Here there is no reliance on a central intermediary to hold funds — instead, trades and loans occur directly between participants through automated processes. “Over time you have the ability for anyone to be able to access savings accounts, to be able to access loans and to earn income in a steady currency that is not tied to wherever they live,” said Ms Desai. The applications operate on blockchains, the immutable public ledgers that record transactions in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Most are built on the Ethereum blockchain because it can be used to create smart contracts — essentially computer code that is automatically triggered when certain conditions are met. Ether, the related currency, is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation behind bitcoin, trading at about $130. But several other protocols, such as Tezos, Algorand and Dfinity, are also developing with a view to support DeFi applications. While the amount of money locked in DeFi products is relatively small — about $700m, according to data compiled by DeFi Pulse — it has nearly tripled this year, with outsize yields and a wave of new initiatives helping to propel growth. DeFi Prime, a website tracking the sector, counts more than 200 related projects offering everything from prediction markets to margin trading. The most popular applications have focused on peer-to-peer lending markets underpinned by stablecoins, cryptocurrencies that are largely pegged to fiat currencies such as the US dollar. In the case of Compound, the largest of the lending platforms, stablecoin holders supply their assets to a “liquidity pool” from which borrowers can pull. Compound’s algorithm, or “protocol”, automatically sets interest rates based on supply and demand. The transactions occur continuously, so lenders earn frequent but fluctuating interest. For their part, borrowers must pledge more collateral, in the form of other cryptoassets, than the value of their loan, providing extra protection to the system in case of default. Compound says it has more than $120m earning interest on its app. “When demand to borrow an asset is super high, the interest rate is high, and when demand to borrow an asset is low, the interest rate is low,” said Robert Leshner, founder of Compound, which raised more than $24m in a fundraising round led by Andreessen Horowitz in September. Maker DAO, which is responsible for the Dai stablecoin, is another well-known project. Billed as “the world’s first unbiased currency”, users obtain Dai by opening a so-called collateralised debt position with Maker, which provides the tokens as a form of debt backed by Ether and a growing list of other cryptocurrencies. Dai holders have locked nearly $350m in Maker’s protocol, according to DeFi Pulse, more than any other similar application, although the project has been plagued by infighting. Like other speculative ventures, DeFi start-ups have focused on building their technologies and user bases rather than profitability. This means low fees, together with chunky yields, have proven a draw to the space for users. “What is happening more and more in DeFi is not wild speculation but saving dollars with handsome return and relatively limited risk,” said Brendan Forster, chief operating officer of Dharma, which acts as a digital bank depositing user assets on the Compound protocol. But this could change in future. Dharma does not charge anything to users, though Mr Forster said the company would probably introduce fees next year. Compound collects upward of 10 per cent of the interest charged to borrowers on its application, which it sets aside as reserves. Some worry that diminishing interest rates — as more users flood the space — may not sufficiently compensate investors for the risks of the platform. “One of the big questions that hangs over DeFi is the sustainability of the economic returns for participants lending your crypto,” said Garrick Hileman, an academic and head of research at Blockchain.com, a cryptocurrency wallet company. It is too early to tell, though early adopters are predictably bullish on DeFi’s long-term prospects. “In 50 years, I can’t see us still relying on trusted intermediaries to do settlement of [foreign exchange] transactions,” Mr Forster said. “It doesn’t make sense . . . Why use humans when we have code that can do it perfectly?” But even some advocates acknowledge DeFi is highly experimental and exists in a regulatory grey zone. “It’s not ready for mainstream use and it’s not ready for human consumption . . . This early phase is really for researchers, professionals, very sophisticated speculators,” said Mr Leshner, adding that he believed DeFi would become a mainstream technology over the next decade. There are also practical barriers to widespread adoption. Ms Desai noted that users must first purchase existing cryptocurrencies such as Ether to access DeFi products, adding that the “tax regimes are confusing”. And as with elsewhere in the cryptocurrency sphere, there are risks of scams. “This in some ways has echoes of the peer-to-peer lending space [and] there’s some challenges in that space that might be instructive,” said Mr Hileman, pointing to the Chinese P2P lending industry crisis, where a spate of fraud and negligence cases has shocked investors in recent years. “In 2020, it will still be ill-defined and overhyped,” said Tim Swanson, director of research at Post Oak Labs. “Regulators will increasingly learn about how in many case DeFi is often basically non-compliant . . . with anti-money laundering and know your customer rules.” Some have also pointed to systemic risks. The initiatives all rely on the protocol that they are built on, such as Ethereum, which has faced early stumbles as it begins to handle larger transaction volumes. They are also tied to the cryptocurrencies that fuel those protocols — which remain vulnerable to price swings. “You need to solve the underlying technology problems that protocols have so that people can safely deploy those decentralised applications,” said Steve Kokinos, chief executive of smart contract protocol Algorand. Meanwhile, DeFi’s economics have not been tested at scale. And without human intermediaries overseeing transaction settlement, users must fully trust the software, meaning any glitches could fully upend the system. “What excites me is where we could be if most products could be built without requiring the paper [and] expensive legacy tech banks do,” said Mr Taylor at 11:FS. “Anyone could build financial products. It doesn’t mean anyone should.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Miles Kruppa Hannah Murphy","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-12-30","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/579ea968-e798-4392-9f2d-b40f79f1d3b9","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F353fba3f-7fd3-4a4c-b3b3-408aff602f03.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blythe’s back, but has she said bye-bye to blockchain?","INTRO":"Blythe Masters joins $473m private equity fund.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"She was once the darling of blockchain in finance.

You might recall that Mone and Barrowman had tried to raise money via an initial coin offering (ICO) for their “EQUI” token — which would apparently allow buyers to invest in early-stage businesses — but that that’d failed, in quite awkward fashion. After the ICO flop, EQUI was then rebranded to “EQUI Global”, which would focus on the company’s “Token Blockchain technology” and would only involve “sophisticated investors”. It was at that point that Woz — who is co-founder of Apple — mysteriously got involved. Last June, in its Telegram group, EQUI said a tokenised “security exchange” would be “ready in September”, and that it would be “the 1st security exchange if not one of the 1st”. There has been no such launch. But in September, the company rebranded again. The website states that EQUI Global is now EQUI Capital Partners, whose sole director, according to Companies House records, is Andrew Barrowman, Doug Barrowman’s 28-year-old son. EQUI has promised since September that further details and an updated website would be “coming soon”, but the site is still just a landing page. So there doesn’t seem to be much action on that front. That wasn’t the the baroness’s only venture into cryptoland, however; she also tried to launch a £250m luxury development in Dubai that was to be sold in bitcoin, and which was due to be completed last summer. But The Times reported last year that project had stalled, with government inspectors finding that construction had stopped on the site. And so now, Lady Mone of Mayfair wants to share her pro business tips with the rest of us. For a mere £15,000, you can attend a two-day business retreat that includes one whole night at a 5* hotel, along with other exclusive benefits including: • Business Doctors, what would you like to achieve? • Personalised wellbeing assessment • Style tips on how to dress to empower the boardroom • Goody bag There’s also “media and public speaking training”, which seems sensible — you need to be able to know how to handle definition lawyers and the like. And after all, according to the press release, Mone “was recently voted as the UK’s Number 1 Female speaker*, recognised both as an entrepreneur and as an advocate for equality for women in business”. (The asterisk was never followed up by any explanation, and we were given no further details from the PR agency when we asked them about that.) This retreat, surely, pays for itself.

Digital Asset was one of the pioneers of blockchain-in-finance, with the idea that it could make clearing and trade settlement sexy again (well OK maybe not but at least make it faster and more efficient). Its erstwhile CEO Blythe Masters, a glamorous former JP Executive who was credited with/blamed for pioneering credit-default swaps, trotted around the globe telling people that blockchain was “email for money”. So significant a role did DA play in the early blockchain mythos that artist Simon Denny immortalised Masters and the firm in a special edition of the board game Risk, as part of a 2016 art exhibition in New York. And even though Masters stepped down as CEO a year ago, Digital Asset is still seen as a big player -- crypto news site Coindesk last week called the firm a “seminal enterprise blockchain startup”. But one might have thought if the company was so seminal, it might still be actively involved in blockchain. Not so much. As Izzy and the FT’s Phil Stafford wrote back in the summer, the firm has been steadily shifting away from the distributed technicolour dream-ledger that is blockchain, and towards DAML, its programming language for creating smart contracts (i.e. contracts that self-execute when certain pre-determined criteria are met). But until now, the idea seemed to be that the smart contracts would run on top of some sort of a blockchain platform. As DAML is just a programming language, and therefore cannot be used on its own, the idea would be that you would use it to run your own DAML-based applications, on a blockchain or distributed ledger-based system (the difference between the two is slightly unclear but the latter is kind of just a watered-down version of the former). Last week, Digital Asset announced that it had raised another $35m in a Series C fundraising round. The money would be used, it said, to “accelerate the adoption of DAML across multiple industries, expand the number and variety of DAML-enabled partner products and fund new products designed to enhance the DAML developer experience, specifically project:DABL, a cloud-based prototyping and production environment for DAML applications”. Despite calling itself a “the NY-based blockchain start-up” in the press release, there wasn’t very much else (i.e. nothing) in it about blockchain, or even distributed ledger technology (DLT), except in reference to some other companies that do blockchainy things. So we asked Digital Asset to confirm whether DAML needed to be used with a blockchain or DLT platform, and they told us (emphasis ours): DAML is a smart contract language that is designed to work with blockchain platforms. DAML cannot be used on its own – it needs a platform underneath it. What’s unique about DAML, however, is that we’re enabling it to work on more than just blockchain platforms. For example, we announced in June that we will enable DAML for Amazon’s cloud-based Aurora database. Our vision is for developers to use DAML to build applications that can run on blockchains or traditional databases. The point is that (eventually) DAML-based applications should be able to run on any kind of database. Did you catch that? What is unique about this “blockchain start-up” is that although it is designed to work with blockchain platforms, it can actually work with any old database. (Also is it just us or is this a tacit admission that blockchain is, after all, just a kind of database?) So how did DA manage to raise another $35m from new and existing investors (who include Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan)? Could it be what one Alphaville friend likes to call the “Embarrassment Phase” of the technology hype cycle (ie, the bit where investors have to keep ploughing money into a project that they’ve already put money into, so as to save face in front of their own investors)? One thing seems clear: if Digital Asset is really a seminal blockchain company, then it’s likely that many other blockchain companies will stop being blockchain companies in the near future.

But elements of Deutsche Bank’s boldly titled “Imagine 2030” report, the latest edition of its “Konzept” periodical, already belong in the past. Chiefly what they have to say about the rise of “crypto”. From the report, published last week: They had been around for a while, but it was not until 2017 that cryptocurrencies really gained global attention as the price of a Bitcoin surged to almost $20,000. When Facebook announced Libra, its new cryptocurrency payment system, earlier this year, the conversation hit all levels of society and politics. And no wonder. Facebook, with its potential user base of over 2bn, has the potential to disrupt the payment industry send the use of cryptocurrencies in to the mainstream. But cryptocurrencies have always been additions, rather than substitutes, to the global inventory of money. They have not managed to take off as a means of payment despite their well-known benefits, such as security, speed, minimal transaction fees, ease of storage and relevance in the digital era. Looking ahead, this situation may be different. Looking ahead? It appears no-one told Deutsche Bank that, as Jemima wrote last week, the blockchain hype has been on the wane throughout 2019. Instead, they try to imply the growth in blockchain wallet-holders during the second decade of bitcoin’s existence will mirror that of internet users over the same time frame, with this handy chart (note the two rather different y-axes, always a warning sign in our view): Bold. Still, could all this recent gloom merely be a blip on the path to crypto-dominance? Well we haven’t got a crystal ball, so who knows if fiat money -- money backed by trust in an institution that acts as a vessel of the state -- will survive? The point we want to make here though is that Deutsche’s argument rests on a pretty shaky definition of what crypto actually is. Take their view, central to their argument, that India and China -- two countries that have banned crypto -- will decide to do a volte-face and embrace bitcoin brodom. Deutsche offer the two emerging market superpowers’ attempt to create state-backed digital money as evidence that that “cryptocurrency” will supersede fiat money by 2030 -- a claim that provoked many excitable headlines in the crypto-press. But we this is a completely back-to-front way of looking at things. Here is what they say: Details are to be confirmed but it seemed that the digital currency may have the following characteristics: i) commercial banks and the PBOC will be the only issuers; ii) the PBoC will design all wallets, possibly without using the blockchain. With government support, it is likely the Chinese people will move quickly to adopt the digital currency. “Crypto” without the blockchain? One of the defining characteristics of a cryptocurrency is that it runs on a blockchain. If it doesn’t, then it is just a digital currency. That’s why, as we argued earlier this year, Facebook’s Libra is also not a cryptocurrency. And on India: In India, change is also coming. The government declared in 2016 that 1,000 and 500 rupee notes would no longer be valid despite strong resistance to change and temporary cash shortage. And recently, a government economic panel pitched for the introduction of an official digital currency with the status of legal tender and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. We thought the whole point of crypto and the blockchain was to bypass government involvement in financial transactions and free the money supply from state control. In trying to create their own digital forms of fiat money, what China and India are doing here is the opposite of what we imagine crypto’s originators had in mind. These governments (and indeed other central banks) are looking to strengthen the state’s role in controlling money by providing their own substitutes to crypto. Substitutes that, Deutsche admits, only they and existing commercial banks will be able to supply and may or may not use the blockchain. The jury is still out on whether the public sector will succeed here. But if it does, it would sound the knell for cryptocurrencies -- and not, as Deutsche claim, fiat money.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Claire Jones","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-12-09","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/6928970f-c9cb-4315-9e02-8817c04bfe22","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fba500772-2553-4cef-87bd-92b391b8cb08.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The crypto collapse gets cataclysmic","INTRO":"Bitcoin plunges to as low as $3867, bringing down all other major cryptocurrencies with it.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Remember the halvening?

Well it wasn’t due until May, but it turns out the halvening has come early. Or a halvening of sorts, anyway. Not the halvening that’s set to cut the supply of newly minted bitcoins into two (a bit like tapering in a QE scenario), but a halvening that has cut the price of bitcoin into two. Bitcoin plunged to a 10-month low of around $3,850 overnight on some exchanges -- a more than 50 per cent drop in the space of 48 hours -- before edging up to around $5,500 at pixel time. That still marks an almost 50 per cent fall from levels close to $10,500 a month ago. Here’s a chart showing the move, from crypto site Coindesk: And it wasn’t just bitcoin. The whole of the cryptoverse slid painfully into the red on Friday, with thinking-man’s crypto Ethereum having touched $95 overnight, a 66 per cent plunge from a month earlier, and unthinking-man’s crypto Ripple (or XRP) touching 15 cents, down from 33 cents a month ago (it’s lost about 96 per cent since its all-time high). In an echo of the crypto frenzy of late 2017, two of the biggest crypto platforms, BitMEX and Gemini, went down for about 45 minutes late on Thursday night, according to The Block. Somehow, despite crypto’s ongoing claim that its tokens are not just speculative magical digital beans, but are in fact safe havens (and uncorrelated ones, at that), the same affliction that has gripped regular ole markets, with investors frantically dumping anything that they perceive as risky, appears to be feeding through into crypto. Mind. Blown. Far far away, in the disconnected Brodom of Cryptoland, there are signs of desperation. Coindesk put out a piece under the headline “6 Good Reasons for Bitcoin HODLers to Stay Calm”, which actually provided seven reasons to HODL and stay calm (maybe they didn’t think the seventh was any good): Pretty compelling stuff, we’re sure you’ll agree. Non-self-identifying bitcoin bro Antony “Pomp” Pompliano, meanwhile reckons “the alternate financial system is just getting started”: Barry Shill-bert, of course, is telling his disciples he’s going to BTFD. No surprises there from the CEO of the Digital Currency Group, a huge crypto VC firm that owns Coindesk and has stakes in Ripple, Z-cash, and BitPay, among others.

Crypto has discovered netting","INTRO":"Why Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is just another pathway back to version 1.0 of the financial system.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Yes. The technical geeks will quibble with what we’re about to say. But conceptually and practically it amounts to this. End of. To get around its epic scaling limitations the numero uno cryptocurrency system (bitcoin, duh) is finally deploying the Lightning Network (LN) to major players such as the exchange Bitfinex. And what that basically means is that bitcoin is moving firmly away from real time gross settlements and push payments and into the world of deferred net settlement and pull payments. An ironic state of affairs given its raison d\u0027être was to rid the world of intermediaries and reduce settlement risks and exposures. For a full account of how the Lightning Network really works, it’s worth revisiting these essential Frances Coppola pieces (though be mindful that at the time they were written they upset many LN enthusiasts who couldn’t grasp the entirely accurate comparisons with conventional systems Coppola was making). The basic premise of LN is that regular transactions between two parties can be taken off the blockchain via the formation of a payment channel, thus freeing up capacity on the main network. These are supposedly bonded structures to ensure the uncleared settlements are insured to some degree. Thus if two counterparts have an active two-way flow relationship between each other, they need only ever settle the net differentials between them via the core chain on an infrequent basis. Obviously, it’s not convenient in life to only transact with preapproved counterparties. But setting up a new channel with a new counterpart isn’t optimal either. Not only does it involve a transaction on the core chain (undermining the traffic decongestion objective of LN in the first place), it’s simply not practical. Thus the big idea in LN is that payments can be routed through preapproved channels until a pathway from you and your preapproved counterpart is found to your potential irregular recipient and their preapproved counterpart. But for that to work, crypto payments undergo a major change in their dynamics. As Frances noted back in January 2018: Lightning is a “pull” system. Every participant makes a payment, then “pulls” reimbursement from the previous participant. So each participant has to have sufficient “own funds” in their channel to make the payment. If they don\u0027t, they can\u0027t participate in the route, and their predecessor must find a different participant. Using “own funds” to make a payment on behalf of someone else meets the normal definition of “lending”. It may be settled within milliseconds (or not, as we shall see), but that doesn\u0027t change what it is. For Peter to pay Paul, via a network of other consciously coupled counterparts, all respective counterparts need some base amount of liquidity at all times for the whole thing to square. Sound familiar? It does to us. We think what has inadvertently been reinvented is an intraday-liquidity dependent payment system, within which liquid funds must not only be continuously present and unencumbered but extremely well distributed. A.k.a. the standing system of today, complete with its massive dependence on intraday liquidity and bilateral bonded “channel” relationships (also known as repo). The difference, the crypto community might argue, is that their system is cleared bilaterally rather than centrally — and thus remains decentralised. But that would be wrong. In reality, when you look at payments systems like that for Fed funds, they too came to be organised in bilateral and later trilateral wholesale funding structures. The aim, as with LN, was always to do as much clearing via deferred netted settlements “offFed”, settling only the very minimum via the core Fed system. This rings true for many other central banks operating real-time-gross settlement systems as well. As Daniela Gabor explained in her Alphaville piece about the evolution of the Tri-Party repo market: Banks rely on central bank money to manage the complex webs of settlement obligations resulting from their daily interactions with each other on behalf of retail and institutional clients. These obligations can be settled periodically on a net basis, or immediately, in ‘real time’ on a gross basis. Banks prefer netting because it allows them to economise on central bank reserves, an asset with significant opportunity costs (at least before the world of Basel III liquidity requirements). As banks increasingly lost intraday deposits due to funding obligations that hadn’t quite round-tripped back to square things off for them, they became increasingly dependent on access to Fed intraday overdrafts to bridge the temporary imbalances. To put that in crypto LN terms, the common pathway between all the respective institutions making payments in the system became the Fed, and it was de facto charged with plugging the gap when funding shortfalls emerged because in reality (due to the nature of life and trade) “pathways” never squared up in time. By the late 1980s four clearing banks emerged as the most common “pathway” counterparties, who in turn had bilateral “trusted” relationships with a plethora of other market players and so on. Like bitcoin enthusiasts, the Fed also began to worry about its excessive “intermediary” exposure to the system. To limit that exposure, it started to charge fees for overdrafts. The market responded creatively. Salomon Brothers realised that if it normalised a tri-party repo structure — essentially, the use of a third common counterpart to intermediate settlements — it could save fees by avoiding the Fed system entirely while reducing the risk of a funding shortfall. The problem is, all the structure did was move the risk from the Fed to the tri-party clearing banks instead. The rest as they say (the global financial crisis, ahem) is history. But this is history that has been lost on those reinventing the financial system, one recurring mistake at a time. For fun, here — from Investopedia — is the crypto explainer of how deferred netting, sorry we mean the Lightning Network clearing, occurs: Here’s a practical example of how a lightning network transaction functions. Alice opens a channel with her favourite coffee shop and deposits $100 worth of bitcoin in it. Her transactions with the coffee shop are instant because she has a direct channel with it. Bob, who has a channel open with the grocery store he visits most frequently, also buys coffee from Alice’s shop. The connection between Alice, the coffee shop, and Bob ensures that Alice can use funds from her balance with the coffee shop to buy groceries from Bob’s store. Similarly, Bob can use his grocery store balance to conduct transactions with businesses in Alice’s network. If Bob closes his channel with the grocery store (and there are no other customers in common between the coffee shop and grocery store), then Alice will have to open another channel with the grocery store to make purchases there. In this way, a web of transactions is created and routed between multiple lightning nodes in a decentralised fashion. The problems with this set up are clearly obvious to any core banking practitioner. 1) The system is massively credit dependent. 2) The system is extremely liquidity draining. 3) The system’s dependency on pre-funding is likely to be a huge deterrent to most users (do consumers really want a system that requires them to tie up funds with retailers they may or may not use?) 4) The system is hugely exposed to the coincidence of wants problem, especially when it comes to getting funds out of the system and back into convertible bitcoin. This is because there is no mutual counterpart everyone has in common or has channels with, but also because there is no compulsory clearing cycle. 5) To overcome the coincidence of wants problem the system will have to rely on an expansive pathway of pull-payments arrangement. This opens the system up to many as yet unknowable credit related risks. 6) Those funding the system and taking all that risk — unlike in the conventional depositor-dependent banking sector — get no return or reward for funding or providing liquidity to the system, or for having their funding locked up. The reality of the structure is that it is entirely dependent on intraday credit relationships. When Alice wants to pay for goods at the grocery store, she needs to find a counterpart who already transacts with one of her preapproved counterparts, and who has sufficient funds locked into the store to facilitate her payment. Failing that, she has to find a common counterpart of a common counterpart. And on and on. The further away the steps go, the more intraday-loan like the arrangement becomes and the more exposed it becomes to infrequent settlement cycles. Which means for the system to work, some sort of common counterpart with an approved capacity to lend other people’s money temporarily (or provide funds from elsewhere) has to be established. As Frances put it: The coins in the channel are effectively lent to the Lightning network, which can do whatever it likes with them. The payment channels have become deposits - and even though the risk of not getting the money back is small, it is not zero. In trying to solve Lightning\u0027s pathfinding problem, the devs have turned it into a bank. No doubt the architects of the Lightning Network will figure this out over time. It’s just that when that moment comes they will have reinvented banking.

On average, a cross-border transaction requires the exchange of 36 documents and 240 copies, says Kerstin Braun, president of Stenn Group, which provides trade finance. By 2050, experts suggest blockchain could provide a digital record of transactions. This would streamline the paper trail and improve transparency between parties, allowing the introduction of practices such as “dynamic factoring”, where interest rates change as goods approach their final destination. Trade finance bridges the gap between when an exporter ships a consignment of goods and the time an importer pays for it. Banks shoulder the interim risk, such as if the importer does not or cannot pay, and finance the transaction for a fee. A letter of credit — a promise to pay for the goods if certain conditions are met — is sent to the exporter by the importer’s bank. This gives the exporter the green light to ship the goods. The exporter then presents proof of shipping to get financing from its own bank, which recoups the money directly from the importer’s bank. At the moment, information is limited: the companies doing business are often in different parts of the world and may have little credit history. Information is also slow to reach the relevant parties as paper documents have to be physically exchanged. ‘Blockchain can provide detailed data on previous transactions, and thus provide some history to facilitate risk assessment by the financier’ Blockchain, a digital ledger, could give every party in a trade finance deal access to a single record of the transaction. This would allow them to see instantly what is happening, what changes have been made to documents and by whom, which could have far-reaching consequences for the cost and availability of trade finance. The riskiness of trade finance, in theory, reduces as the goods get closer to the importer, although this is currently hard for all parties to ascertain. Aided by satellite or radio-frequency identification technology, blockchain could allow interested parties — from exporters to banks — to see immediately when, for instance, the goods are put on to a ship or the logistics firm picks them up. Professor Hau Lee of the Stanford Graduate School of Business foresees a process of “dynamic factoring”, where at each stage of the journey, as risk falls, so too does the rate of interest charged to the exporter or importer. “Blockchain lets you track every step along the way. Therefore it lowers the interest rate, because less collateral is needed,” says Prof Lee, who expects the technology to be widespread in trade finance by 2050. Another benefit of organisations using a common digital platform to track trade finance deals is that it creates a data pool about potential clients and their transaction histories. This could make it easier for new entrants, such as large institutional investors or tech firms, to offer financing or refinancing options. “At a time when institutional investors struggle to find yield in the public bond universe, the availability of this alternative source of income would be greatly welcomed,” says Francesco Filia, whose hedge fund Fasanara Capital invests in trade finance. The opening up of the sector could even mean that by 2050 the cost of basic trade financing may fall to zero, says Cécile André Leruste, managing director for the consultancy Accenture Banking in Europe. Banks would instead earn money from selling data about, or providing ratings of, exporters or importers. Blockchain could also help to expand the pool of companies that can access trade finance. This could reduce the trade finance gap — the difference between demand for the credit, particularly among small and medium-sized enterprises, and creditors’ willingness to supply it. Recommended The trade finance gap currently stands at $1.5tn, according to the Asian Development Bank. It cites “know your customer” issues as a key reason why trade finance is refused. Many SMEs and firms in the developing world, for instance, cannot show a long history of transactions. This makes it harder for creditors to assess their risk, and therefore less likely to lend to them. “Blockchain can provide detailed data on previous transactions, and thus provide some history to facilitate risk assessment by the financier,” says Prof Hau. Banks could look at data — that would be more readily available, more comprehensive and, in theory, more trusted (because all participants can see who made changes to a document) — on the parties related to current and previous transactions, and possibly even the wider supply network. Making financing more accessible would also give importers more choice of goods and help the economic development of poorer countries. Many of the documentary contracts currently used in trade finance could eventually be replaced by self-executing smart contracts that run on blockchain, according to Tim Cummins, president of the International Association for Contract and Commercial Management. This would mean contracts could be executed quicker and more simply, for instance when someone speaks into their phone to confirm shipment. Smart contracts could also open up markets to more people, for instance using pictures to help suppliers who are illiterate to understand the terms. Mr Cummins says many contracts in the developed world require PhD-level study to be understood. “It is all about a world where we are seeking to reduce the inequalities created by the misuse of power and by ‘bullying’ — which is arguably what traditional contracts are all about,” he says, adding that by 2050 documentary contracts will be unusual. For all the eventual benefits of blockchain, some parts of this archaic world may remain untouched, however. “You’re probably never going to get to the situation where it’s paperless,” says Alisa DiCaprio, head of trade and supply chain at blockchain software firm R3. “You’re always going to have countries or regions that require paper.” Blockchain has a role in movement of goods, too / From Charles Le Gallais, Taunton, Somerset, UK","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Laurence Fletcher","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-12-03","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/349cfee2-06ad-4b2d-ada0-10a23a8e73da","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Faac85632-23ee-42c8-89e7-7ef56e4e5532.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin’s “halvening” won’t boost its price","INTRO":"And the word shouldn’t be halvening (nor even halving, though that would be preferable).

Like Vanity Fair, for example, who on Wednesday published a piece under the boosterish headline “WE ARE GOING TO SEE HIGHER HIGHS IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE”: IS BITCOIN GOLD RUSH 2.0 JUST AROUND THE CORNER? (H/t Reuters’ Anna Irrera for drawing our attention to the piece.) The subhead tells us: Predicting where the volatile cryptocurrency will net out is like predicting which way the wind will blow next week—but experts have one surefire way to do it. (You guessed it: the halvening.) Sounds intriguing, but actually no. No, they don’t. Before we get onto why not though, what is the halvening, and when is it going to happen? The halvening is the gobbledygook term used to describe the point at which the new supply of bitcoins being pumped into the system every ten minutes halves. This will happen, per bitcoin’s original design, approximately every four years until around 2140, when the total supply of close to 21 million bitcoins is reached (we’re currently at just over 18 million). The last time we had a halvening was on July 16 2016, when the number of new bitcoins that become available for crypto miners every ten minutes — the so-called “block reward” — dropped to 12.5, from 25 previously. Around May 12th of this year, that number will halve again. Vanity Fair explains: Sometime in May this year, the number of coins available will be cut in half, from 12.5 to 6.25, in an event known as the “halvening.” (Yes, it’s “halvening,” not halving.) That means that the age-old phenomenon of supply and demand will kick in. As Rose explained, every time a halvening has occurred in the past, the price of Bitcoin has risen, then eventually, fallen. This time around, he said, the climb has barely begun. So let’s start with that age-old phenomenon of supply and demand. What that principle says, as we all know, is that if the availability of a certain good or service falls, while demand remains steady, the price of that good should go up (and vice versa), all else remaining equal. But the thing is, bitcoin’s supply is not actually about to halven (nor to halve, for that matter). Its supply is increasing, and will continue to do so until 2140, so there’s no reason to believe that, by the laws of supply and demand, there should be a price increase. There are more bitcoins to buy and sell today than there were yesterday, and there will be more bitcoins to buy and sell on May 13 than there were on May 12; it’s just that the rate at which new bitcoins are being pumped out will slow. You see although crypto fans love to argue that one of bitcoin’s main selling points is that it provides a hedge against the relentless monetary easing inflicted upon the public by evil central bankers, bitcoin has actually been in a state of perpetual money printing since its very inception. So when the rate at which new supply halves, that won’t constitute any kind of removal of money from the system, or monetary tightening. How we should understand the halvening is, rather, as a form of tapering. But unlike central bank tapering, we don’t need forward guidance or dot plots to work out when this tapering will occur, and at what pace; it’s all pre-determined. There are no surprises. And what that means is that, if we are to believe that the bitcoin market is in any way free and efficient (and not just subject to Tether-fuelled pump-and-dump activity), as its advocates like to say it is, this tapering should already be priced in, as it is already known about by market participants. Of course we don’t actually think that the bitcoin market is efficient, so it could be that, even if not by the laws of supply and demand, the price of bitcoin rises on the back of shill-ticles like this one, which could increase demand even if not managing to magically reduce supply. But there’s no great reason to think that will happen, given the plethora of other factors and unknowns that affect bitcoin’s price. People like to claim that the last time there was a “halvening”, that boosted bitcoin’s price, but that’s not quite true either. Vanity Fair, again: The price [later] crashed to the $200 range, where it remained for the next few years until the next Bitcoin halvening, which occurred July 9, 2016.” That halvening, of course, led to the “Bitcoin boom” that went viral and saw the price of a Bitcoin ascend into the stratosphere. Bitcoin actually fell slightly in price on July 9 2016, and didn’t recover until October that year. At that point, it did indeed start to climb more rapidly, but not as rapidly as over the course of 2017; and the reason for that was largely the ICO boom and general cryptomania, during which time the supply of cryptocurrencies was, ironically, expanding massively. We’re not saying bitcoin won’t rise in price this year — trying to predict price movements in a market with no fundamentals and in which pump-and-dump trading is rife is a fool’s game. It might rise, but it might fall. And the idea that a slowing down of the number of new coins being added to the system is somehow going to pump bitcoin to $50,000 or higher, as some are claiming, makes about as much sense as the word halvening.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-01-31","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f1037eb5-34bd-4b44-bd6a-7a7c1e398369","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fa52e876f-c241-4f72-9969-0d208c188216.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain/chess: cheque mates sought","INTRO":"World Chess does not seem like the business to pull off a grand masterly IPO coup","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In chess, unconventional starting moves include the legendary Nimzowitsch-Larsen Attack and the deceptive Saragossa Opening. UK start-up World Chess is mulling a novel gambit of its own: a stock market flotation powered by blockchain. The business, which runs an online chess playing platform, would sell investors electronic tokens registered via trendy distributed ledger technology. World Chess would then float on London’s junior Aim market. Afterwards, the tokens could be swapped into shares, or traded as proxies for the underlying equity. The idea appeals in the wake of recent flotation flops, notably WeWork’s abortive attempt to join the US stock market. An initial public offering is nerve wracking, even on low-cost Aim. An informal sale of tokens would test the appetite of sophisticated investors with less hassle and expense to the business. The cartelised IPO industry could certainly do with the shaking up. As with chess, the rules of the game have stayed largely the same for decades, but with far less justification. Sadly, World Chess does not seem like the business to pull off a grand masterly coup. The company started out running traditional tournaments, including the prestigious World Chess Championship, as a licensee of the International Chess Federation. But relations with this governing body have been fractious. World Chess now only runs the Grand Prix, a lower tier of the World Championship series. More usefully, the company has rights to organise online chess matches under the banner of the federation. Turning these into an e-sport will take bags of investment and marketing flair. Video games lend themselves more readily to arena spectacle than two self-absorbed people slowly moving counters around a chequered square. Charismatic players in the mould of Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky would help overcome this. Current World Champion Magnus Carlsen is just a bit boring. Market innovators need the same steadiness, reflected in stable cashflows and a solid franchise. World Chess must raise that part of its game before it tries to float, with or without a token offering.

Shares in scores of tech companies with their sights on blockchain and even those of groups only tangentially related hit the 10 per cent upside limit that halts trading in Shenzhen and Shanghai. On the Shenzhen exchange, an index of blockchain-related equities compiled by data provider Wind climbed 8.9 per cent to its highest level since April, with every one of its 52 component stocks advancing. Shenzhen’s tech-focused ChiNext index rose 2.2 per cent. “It’s all because of Xi,” said Pan Shaochang, an equity analyst at Dongwu Securities, “but the talk around blockchain is all conceptual. There’s still a long way to go to actually bring it to fruition at an individual and enterprise level.” Still, “the growth potential is huge”, Mr Pan said. Government support of preferred industries in China can confer billions of dollars in cheap financing and other subsidies, and investors are always on alert for any sign of a new favoured sector. In this case Beijing laid out its intention to foster the development of blockchain. Mr Xi called it a “core technology” requiring China-led innovation, and called for more support and investment, the official Xinhua news agency reported late on Friday. Analysts say blockchain could help China overcome endemic trust issues by providing an unfalsifiable log of records for the supply chains of everything from vaccines to rice. The 10 per cent surge included shares in the internet arms of state-run news agency Xinhua and the Chinese Communist party mouthpiece People’s Daily, among other non-traditional tech stocks. The enthusiasm also reached Hong Kong, where investors sent shares in Meitu, best known for its photo beautifying selfie app, up as much as 29 per cent while Pantronics Holdings, which was acquired by Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Technology last year, soared as much as 62 per cent. Recommended The price of bitcoin rose by more than 30 per cent on Friday after the Xinhua report and held most of those gains on Monday. Nevertheless, Beijing has not indicated any relaxation of its strict ban on cryptocurrencies beyond its control, which has included shutting down exchanges and trading platforms and moving to halt cryptocurrency mining within China. The government has instead focused on rolling out its own state-backed cryptocurrency, with one central bank official indicating that the launch would be soon.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ryan McMorrow Nian Liu Hudson Lockett","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-10-28","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/1a80e38c-d89f-4b34-92aa-9a98c39a6981","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F5de9a741-0fd4-4b50-8357-82339c86ed78.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The average lifespan of a fiat currency isn’t 27 years","INTRO":"If that seems obvious to you, you are clearly not a bitcoiner.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A crypto news site ran an intriguing story last week, under the headline “Bitcoin Has Already Reached 40% of Average Fiat Currency Lifespan”. We could hear the tiny sound of your eyeballs rolling to the skies before you even got to the headline. The article had a video to accompany it and everything, and was pretty widely picked up by bitcoin bros (who may or may not self-identify as bitcoin bros) on Twitter, like by this guy: The Coin Telegraph article cites “a 2018 study by Dollar Daze” as the source for the story. But what is Dollar Daze, we hear you ask? Well, it appears to be an Anglo-Spanish blog that offers cutting-edge commentary on the dollar and sometimes crypto, like: Currently the general market has been changing and cryptocurrency calls have been changing the economy to be a new type of currency in which to bet. The dollar, as always has been the strongest currency in the world, and is being overshadowed by what cryptocurrencies are. But the “the average lifespan of a fiat currency is 27 years” idea has been showing up around the sillier corners of the internet for several years now. Economist and blogger JP Koning has done a brilliant job of finding exactly where this meme originally came from, and debunking it, in a comprehensive blog post last month. As Koning points out, the meme has been shared by a number of high-profile bitcoiners over the years, including bitcoin developer Adam Back earlier this year, and Barry Silbert, one of the biggest crypto investors. Indeed, as Koning pointed out on Twitter, Silbert’s Grayscale investment group even uses it in its promotional material: Koning worked out that the meme had first appeared ten years ago (so just after bitcoin appeared on the scene), from a post by a guy called Matt Hewitt on Dollar Daze that has since been removed (you can still read it, via the magic of the Wayback Machine, here). The 27 Club But is there any truth in it? Or did the author just decide that it would be kind of neat for “fiat currency” to join the 27 Club? First of all, it’s important to get clear on exactly what a fiat currency is, as there seems to be some confusion on this point. Bitcoiners tend to just use it as shorthand for central-bank-issued currency, but actually it’s a little more nuanced than that. Here’s Koning: Fiat currency is generally considered to be inconvertible money. It can\u0027t be redeemed for gold or silver. The world really only shifted onto a fiat standard between 1968-71 as the dollar ceased to be redeemed in gold. But Hewitt\u0027s list is replete with many metallic currencies (i.e. the riksdaler riksmynt). Are people using his data to make a claim about currencies in general, or just fiat ones? The meme isn\u0027t clear on this. But it does seem that Hewitt, the originator of the meme, did do some actual calculations to come up with the 27-year thing (albeit using some very selective methods). Hewitt claims to have counted 176 currencies that are still in circulation, and 599 that aren’t. Koning downloaded the full list to check Hewitt’s calculations. It turns out that you can indeed arrive at an average “lifespan” (more on that in a bit) of 27 years, but that’s only if you make one fairly significant omission. Yup, that’s right, it only is true if you leave out all 176 currencies still in circulation. So... just a little misleading, it seems fair to say. The other thing is that these 599 currencies that are no longer in circulation didn’t all just spontaneously combust, as the meme implies. Rather, they were actually deliberately replaced or ended for economic, political or social reasons. So the idea of counting up these currencies’ “lifespans” just doesn’t really make much sense. From Koning again: The list contains all of the pre-euro currencies (Dutch gulder, French franc, Italian lira, etc). These currencies had good reasons for disappearing: they were swapped for a new monetary unit. Existing currency holders weren\u0027t robbed. They were fairly compensated for this switch. Another example of monetary reorganization occurred in East Africa. From 1919 to the 1960s, Britain\u0027s former east African colonies relied on the East African shilling, produced by the East African Currency Board. When these countries gained their independence, the currency board was dismantled. In its place Kenya began issuing its own shillings at par with the old ones, as did Tanzania and Uganda. In each case, existing owners of East African shillings could convert their holdings into new currency. No wealth was being destroyed during any of these switches. But people who throw around the phrase the average life expectancy for a fiat currency is 27 years as a criticism of the very institution of currency are using the data in a way that implicitly assumes that the East African experience--and others like it--were negative. They weren\u0027t. There are also some other factual errors that Koning points out -- the whole post is worth a read. So by this stage, the 27-year life expectancy has been pretty comprehensively debunked. But what about the idea that bitcoin has now reached 40 per cent of that, because it’s “survived” ten or so years? That bit it also questionable. Has bitcoin actually successfully survived for ten years as a currency? One measure of success might reasonably be whether it has remained as one currency or whether it’s splintered off into different ones (because after all one of the things that gives currencies their value is some sort of scarcity). But bitcoin has “forked” into different versions of itself twice already -- into bitcoin gold and bitcoin cash, with the latter then splitting again to form bitcoin SV. So the people who originally backed bitcoin no longer agree on what the real bitcoin actually is. Adam Back might say it’s the thing most of us call “bitcoin” (ticker: BTC); Roger Ver would tell you it’s bitcoin cash (BCH); while Craig Wright would tell you it’s bitcoin SV (BSV). Another measure of success of a currency might be its continued use as a medium of exchange, and yet outside the dark net, the acceptance of bitcoin in commerce has dried up (and that was from an already low base). Furthermore, as we have said time and time again, bitcoin is not a currency. It fulfils none of the three key criteria for being a currency (serving as a unit of account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value). So comparing it to currencies makes no sense. As we have also said before, the fact that the battle cry of bitcoiners is HODL! is precisely why it makes no sense as a currency.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-10-24","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/4e6df6d2-e90a-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fe921c8f8-f0f7-11e9-a55a-30afa498db1b?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Businesses turn to blockchain for answers","INTRO":"Five case studies: distributed ledger tech applied in banking, healthcare, legal services and transport","DETAILED_CONTENT":"As the use of distributed ledgers increases dramatically, many organisations are looking at how to apply the technology.

The next pilot at the end of 2019 will be implemented in 30 UK practices with more than 250,000 patients. It will be used to ensure that doctors have complete information about a patient to prevent misdiagnosis or patient abuse of prescriptions. Medicalchain has also joined with Mayo Clinic, the US medical research group, to use patients’ anonymised health records for medical research and to update historical studies. In June, DXC Technology acquired Luxoft, a digital transformation consultancy, to help it create blockchain solutions for common business challenges in industries such as healthcare, mobility and banking. One idea developed for a South African bank offers digital banking services to underbanked customers — people who otherwise rely heavily on cash. It had to be compliant with a “know your customer” regulatory requirement, which insists on extensive verification to reduce fraud. Using blockchain technology allows customers to complete verification checks at bank kiosks. This approach has been rolled out in other locations, including Vietnam, Bangalore, Chennai, Manila and Sydney. Law company Elevate has introduced an esignature capability — powered by Integra Ledger, the legal enterprise blockchain company — into its contract management process. The system, called Cael Contracts, provides a central, secure repository in which contracts can be sent for an esignature and returned, acting as a single source of truth for all parties. Using blockchain for this process creates an indelible record of the time, signatory and recipient at a fraction of the cost of other esignature service providers, it says. EY’s blockchain platform for the mobility sector, called Tesseract, was launched as a proof-of-concept project in 2017 to allow parties to manage and share ownership of autonomous vehicles. The system is scheduled to go live on November 1. The platform is designed for use by city and infrastructure providers, mobility companies and equipment manufacturers. Each party has equal access to use autonomous car-sharing services or commercial vehicles via the Ethereum-enabled platform, which allows users to share maintenance information and costs, based on individual usage. Banco Santander is a founding member of Alastria, a Spanish blockchain consortium with more than 500 members in business, education and the public sector. Those taking part are shown how the technology can solve business and operational issues and are encouraged to help create standards for its use. The bank is also a founding member of Fnality, a blockchain consortium used for interbank payments on a global scale that will reduce disputes and the need for intermediaries. This blockchain platform lets banks settle transactions instantaneously, allowing them to reduce the $100bn liquidity buffer each must hold to support counterparty and credit risk until a transaction is complete.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-10-23","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/99f6f334-eab7-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fc200ac9c-f4e1-11e9-bbe1-4db3476c5ff0?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The great integration of data, technology and services","INTRO":"Overview: the Intelligent Business report showcases dramatic changes in how organisations operate","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Young drivers who have held a driving licence for less than two years are more likely than experienced motorists to be in a car crash. As a result, the cost of insurance is higher for all new drivers, even the cautious ones. This is changing, thanks to telematics. Companies such as Amodo, an insurance technology company, for example, facilitate recording driving behaviour via a black-box or smartphone app. Insurers can then offer motorists bespoke cover as well as advice on better driving. Data is sometimes dubbed “the new oil” for its economic value, and it is having a profound effect on business models and social behaviour. In a series of articles, the FT’s Intelligent Business report looks at the people and ideas behind the convergence of data and technology in business. We showcase the most interesting in case studies alongside the articles, and select a winner in each category. (A note on the methodology appears at the end of this introduction). The insurance industry is one of the first to feel the force of this revolution with the emergence of “insurtech”. The Intelligent Business report highlights the people and ideas behind the convergence of data and technology in business An example is the advisory firm Aon, which can now collect and analyse information on a business’s intangible assets, such as its intellectual property, allowing underwriters to offer cover based on facts rather than guesswork. Aon is also pioneering a registry for trade secrets in which information is not publicly patented but is kept strictly confidential. By having a value for their most private work, companies will be able to insure it. The public sector is also benefiting. Local government is rarely associated with technological prowess but on both sides of the Atlantic records and services are being digitised. Sonoma County, California, is in the process of delivering “whole patient” healthcare for vulnerable people by making records more accessible to the people who need to see them. In Britain, the city of Leeds is doing likewise. Legal sector disruption Convergence makes basic business operations more productive too. From managing legal expenditure to supply chains to commercial contracting, companies are gaining time and resources. Accenture, the consultancy, reckons it has saved 70 per cent on legal expenditure and slashed the cost of commercial contract drafting. Automating the contracting process is having surprising results: it is becoming more “human”. Companies, including Shell, have created visual contracts to make them less legalistic and easier to use. Professional bodies such as the International Association for Contract and Commercial Management, led by Tim Cummins, have analysed the data in thousands of contracts to create universal principles that are being used as modules to build documents that also improve commercial relationships. Mr Cummins is an example of how people working outside a sector, in this case legal, can disrupt it. Through the association, he defined the role of the commercial contract manager and so created a new profession. The legal sector is ripe for further disruption. Many young companies are poised to make commercial law more efficient. Some use artificial intelligence to do the first read of a mass of documents while others speed up and simplify the signing stage of transactions. Along comes blockchain One technology with big potential is blockchain. From tackling supply-chain inefficiencies to regulating city transport, companies and consumers are beginning to see the effect for themselves. The changes are blurring the lines between professional services: the Big Four, law firms and consultancies are entering new industries with new offerings. EY estimates that it has 160 blockchain-based proof-of-concept projects under way. In one case, the firm has worked with a software security company to set up Insurwave, a platform that captures real-time data to allow insurers to deliver flexible cover to shipowners. What makes the system so efficient and secure is blockchain. A professional services goliath such as EY can now act more like a nimble insurtech business. Expect to see other similarly fleet-footed partnerships in the years ahead. The Intelligent Business report highlights how the convergence of legal and professional services with data and technology is streamlining back office operations and transforming business models. Research to select the case studies and organisations featured in the report included a submissions and nominations process, market surveys and additional research and interviews. RSG Consulting conducted more than 300 interviews to assess case studies and organisations between June and October. The criteria used to select case studies were: peer, client and market commendations; impact on the business or market; and the degree to which companies demonstrated the convergence of legal services, professional services, technology and data.

Some even claimed it would be bigger than the internet. But despite a great deal of excitement — and an even greater number of press releases — the technology has not lived up to its promise and there are signs the hype is fading. Blockchain is the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. It is, in effect, a database system that records and processes transactions via a distributed network of computers, with no need for a centralised entity to verify them. At various points since its inception more than a decade ago, enthusiasts have claimed that blockchain could replace central banks, wipe out post-trade intermediaries like clearing houses, and become the backbone of cross-border payments. (And that is just in banking — outside the financial sector the claims become even more grandiose, with the technology purportedly having potential to cure cancer and bring about world peace.) The financial services sector has ploughed huge amounts of money into blockchain, totalling some $1.7bn a year, according to research firm Greenwich Associates. And yet, so far, beyond the wild and volatile world of cryptocurrencies, blockchain has had little to no discernible impact. Would you try to open a can of beans with a sledge hammer, or a machine gun? You could do it, but would you want to? Germany’s Bundesbank spent two years working with Deutsche Börse building prototypes for blockchain-based securities settlement. Yet earlier this year, the president of the central bank Jens Weidmann said “a real breakthrough in application is missing so far”. Outside of blockchain, the broader world of fintech has started to have a real impact on the financial sector, forcing banks and other firms to bring their technology — and their user experience, in particular — into the twenty-first century. One of blockchain’s biggest problems is that it was approached badly. Rather than beginning with the challenges banks were trying to solve and then seeing whether blockchain could be applied to them, too many projects started with the technology, tried to discern how to make money from it, and worked from there. “Blockchain’s failed promises could be a mandatory class in business school for how not to build a sustainable organisation,” says Tim Swanson, head of market intelligence at blockchain company Clearmatics. He adds that, in most cases, entrepreneurs have just recast the same market, but with their technology the centre. Now, a degree of disillusionment has set in. A couple of years ago, when cryptocurrencies were booming, blockchain panels at fintech summits and other financial conferences were packed to the rafters, but these days they attract smaller crowds. “The hype of the last few years, followed by the disappointment that many people are feeling now, is evidence that you need to understand the problems that need to be solved and then look for an answer, rather than throwing a technology at business problems before you’ve understood them,” says Martin Walker, director for banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management. Now, what Mr Walker calls “blockchain fatigue” has also chipped away at the PR value that the word once bestowed on any company that attached itself to the technology. Digital Asset Holdings, for example, was once considered a leading player — with its former chief executive Blythe Masters seen as a flag-bearer for the technology. It had planned to transform the world of securities settlement, but has since pivoted away from blockchain. Instead, it is focusing on “smart contracts”, a kind of computer programming function that does not require blockchain to work. Digital Asset Holdings now talks about “distributed ledger technology”, or DLT, rather than blockchain. The terms are often used interchangeably, but Colin Platt, an independent cryptocurrency and DLT consultant who previously worked on blockchain projects at French banking group BNP Paribas, says there is a key difference: in a blockchain, everyone on the network can see all the transactions, whereas with DLT that is not necessarily the case. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click For Mr Platt, while there is not much use for blockchain in the world of finance — even a so-called “permissioned blockchain”, where the number or parties who are allowed on to the network is limited — there could be some uses for DLT, such as for interest rate swaps and other derivatives, because they do not have one obvious trading centre. But, he adds, these new tools will not come quickly and are unlikely to be earth-shattering. “I don’t believe that I’ve ever seen a case where a blockchain — that shares everything with everyone — in a permissioned sense was justified,” he says. “But I’d argue [that] for the things that may need a DLT, we haven’t given it enough time.” For now, DLT has yet to prove itself and blockchain’s graduation into the mainstream remains a pipe dream. Even if you could use blockchain to run some banking processes, there is usually a better, quicker, cheaper and more efficient way to do so. “It’s not so much what’s wrong with the technology, it’s just that the tool has to fit the problem,” Mr Walker says. “Would you try to open a can of beans with a sledge hammer, or a machine gun? You could do it, but would you want to?” The intermediary is still providing genuine value / From Robert Shooter, London, UK","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-09-24","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/cc589998-e438-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fcad19e30-f3ba-11e9-b018-3ef8794b17c6?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ten market shapers: setting a new course","INTRO":"Pioneers use tech and data to change the way we do business","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The 10 people profiled here have all played a leading part in creating the world of today . . . and tomorrow. They include a mathematician, a telecoms expert, a serial entrepreneur, a former dentist and a Detroit college dropout. Each one of them has seen an opportunity to use technology to change the world of business — and seized that chance. The judges decided that Tim Cummins is the person who has had the greatest effect in shaping a new market. They were impressed by how Mr Cummins, at the start of his career, made himself heard by using data to present the case for industry-wide standards of contract management. He founded the International Association for Contract and Commercial Management in 1999. The network has defined the role of contract managers as well as the process of contracting within leading corporations. Leyla Boulton Chair, judging panel Profiles compiled by RSG and FT editors WINNER: Tim Cummins President International Association for Contract and Commercial Management (IACCM) Tim Cummins is a self-taught commercial contract manager who has negotiated deals in the automotive and aerospace industries. He is a professor at Leeds University School of Law — even though he has never trained or practised as a lawyer. In the 1980s and 1990s, Mr Cummins led the development of business offerings and negotiations at IBM. He soon realised that an overhaul was required and set about creating market-friendly commercial contracting practices. However, as a comparatively junior employee he had little access to decision makers, so he collected data to make his case and set up a cross-industry, customer-focused benchmarking group. Mr Cummins went on to co-found Global Executive Business Services, and in 1999 he set up the IACCM, a not-for-profit network. Today the association has 60,000 members, representing 20,000 organisations. It sets standards for contract management and provides training and certification in best practice. Before the IACCM began, few people recognised commercial contracting as a profession but it has defined the role of contract managers and raised the profile of the process of contracting within major corporations. Akber Datoo Chief executive and founder D2 Legal Technology Akber Datoo founded D2 Legal Technology in 2011 after realising the importance of data-driven digitisation for in-house legal teams at major financial institutions. He was one of the first people to be convinced of the importance of data to the sector and to work out ways to harness it to create value for clients. Mr Datoo’s London company started as a one-man consultancy and it now employs more than 100 people. D2 helps in-house legal teams at global banks extract, capture and understand data to bring added value to a business. It takes on major repapering tasks — risk-assessing, amending and/or migrating contracts — and advises on the extraction of data from contracts, combining artificial intelligence and optical character recognition. Mr Datoo sits on the technology and law committee of the Law Society and is author of the book Legal Data for Banking — Business Optimisation and Regulatory Compliance. Coty de Monteverde Director, blockchain centre of excellence Banco Santander After studying telecommunications engineering in Madrid and Stuttgart, Coty de Monteverde spent the first decade of her career as a consultant, first in telecoms and then in financial services. Since joining Santander in 2008, Ms de Monteverde has worked on blockchain applications across the financial industry. Her work has involved shifting the focus of blockchain initiatives at the bank from proof of concept to production. She leads Santander’s blockchain centre of excellence and has changed the perception of blockchain within the company by showing its business value. Her work has resulted in Santander becoming a founding member of various blockchain initiatives nationally and globally. These include Alastria, the world’s first regulated blockchain ecosystem; Fnality, which aims to bring blockchain to the world’s wholesale banking markets, and the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, which focuses on setting out open blockchain standards. Poppy Gustafsson Co-chief executive \u0026 co-founder Darktrace A mathematician and accountant, Poppy Gustafsson discovered her passion for start-up businesses while working in venture capital. When she co-founded Darktrace, she brought together Cambridge university mathematicians and professionals from GCHQ, the British government communications headquarters, to turn their ideas into a business. Six years later, Darktrace has an annual turnover of $1bn. One of the game-changing moves made by Ms Gustafsson and the Darktrace team was to understand, and persuade society to accept, that cyber security breaches are inevitable. Unlike other cyber security businesses, which defend the perimeter of organisations, Darktrace acts as a security camera looking at the inside of the business. Ms Gustafsson says the company owes its rapid growth to its willingness to challenge the status quo. For instance, she suggested that Darktrace recruit talent from social sciences and arts backgrounds — unusual for a technology company — and the move has resulted in a workforce that is 40 per cent women. Paul Hirner Executive chairman SimpliGov Born in South Africa, Paul Hirner worked as a dentist in Britain before moving to California to found his first technology company. In 2013, he used his experience in software development and building start-ups to found ThinkSmart, a no-code, automation platform to manage business processes. That company was bought by Mitratech last year, and Mr Hirner launched SimpliGov to enable the public sector to share the benefits of the digital transformation that is under way in business. SimpliGov has been used on a range of projects, from automating the trademark applications for the secretary of state in California to unifying social and healthcare provision in Sonoma County, California, It has also worked on the automation of forms that enable public servants to declare their financial records and so avoid conflicts of interest. SimpliGov has been used across numerous projects to improve efficiency in the public sector and the all-round quality of public services. Leanne Kemp Chief executive and founder Everledger Leanne Kemp is founder of Everledger, a start-up using blockchain, artificial intelligence, near-field communication and the internet of things to create more ethical supply chains for products such as diamonds and wine. Founded in 2015, Everledger seeks to improve transparency and confidence in the global markets for high-value products. A serial entrepreneur, Ms Kemp founded software provider Absoft Queensland, co-founded Fastcards — which became the national issuer of RFID (radio-frequency ID) cards — and founded the Great Australian Survey, supplying data for market research in Australia and New Zealand. Ms Kemp is in her second term as Queensland’s chief entrepreneur, supporting the development of the state’s start-ups. In addition she co-chairs the World Economic Forum’s global future council for accelerating sustainable production and is a member of the Global Future Council on blockchain. Ms Kemp works to understand the social and environmental effect of what is being called the fourth industrial revolution, and how to create healthy economic growth. Andrew Mellett Chief executive and founder Plexus Andrew Mellett is neither a lawyer nor a software engineer but through his career in corporate advisory he developed an understanding of the value of legal services in business — and realised that the relationship was not designed to optimise value. In 2011, Mr Mellett founded Plexus Legal in Australia as one of the earliest virtual law firms, with a combined offering of lawyers, technologists and engineers. He was a leader in what was to become known as “new law”. With Plexus Legal he created a model that came to disrupt the Australian legal sector by offering services that were fast, cheap and high quality — a combination that others found hard to beat. In 2019, Plexus launched a strategic global partnership with KPMG. The multinational accounting firm was one of the major investors in a series-A funding round of $4.65m, and the partnership will see KPMG offering legal services in conjunction with Plexus’s technology offering. Ajay Patel Chief executive and founder HighQ Solutions As a non-lawyer, Mr Patel was an unlikely founder of one of the very first successful legal technology companies but his time as a dealmaker made him realise the inefficiencies in the way that documents were handled in big transactions. In 2001, he set up HighQ, believing that the legal profession needed to become better at handling mass documentation and data. It took six years for Mr Patel to win his first client. Now, HighQ serves more than 400 customers, including over half the global 100 largest law firms. The company was recently sold to Thomson Reuters for £365m. HighQ was one of the first legal technology companies to offer software as a service and insist on delivering the product through a secure cloud-based platform. Mr Patel expanded HighQ’s suite of software and it became a leader in collaboration technology for the legal and regulatory market. For Thomson Reuters, HighQ is a key part of its drive to become a platform business, through which it can connect customers and suppliers with its other tech products. Andrew Sieja Founder and executive chairman Relativity Andrew Sieja, a college dropout from Detroit, founded KCura in 2001 after working as a computer programmer for multinational companies and consulting firms. Initially a consulting firm, KCura soon began to design technology solutions to improve collaboration and knowledge management in law firms. In 2007, the company introduced a legal discovery product called Relativity to help the industry handle the ever-increasing volume of legal data. The demand for the product led Mr Sieja’s team to shift its focus solely to Relativity, and the company changed its name to reflect this. Relativity is now valued at more than $1bn and it serves most of the top 200 US law firms. Now based in Chicago, the company is a global technology brand as well as being a key player in the city’s technology ecosystem. As executive chairman of Relativity, Mr Sieja is a leader in the field of ediscovery. His platform prizes collaboration, integrates with other software and provides a one-stop shop for ediscovery. Ram Vasudevan Chief executive QuisLex Ram Vasudevan first used a computer in the mid-1990s when he took at job to make money while studying for his MBA at Cornell University, New York. A willingness to try new things has helped shape his career. After a decade working in private-practice law firms on corporate transactions and mergers, he decided the process could be more efficient. In 2004, Mr Vasudevan founded QuisLex, one of the first legal process outsourcing companies, to tap into demand from corporate legal teams for cost-effective legal services. He quickly realised that to win over the sector, he had to offer services that would match the highest industry standards. Initially framed as a low-cost alternative to law firms, QuisLex now offers end-to-end business solutions, working with partners and in-house counsel as an extension of their teams. The business has helped clients automate non-disclosure agreements and other simple contracts, and recently developed a data strategy for large-scale AI-powered document review.

YouGov, the London-listed polling and market research company, has diversified its offering in recent months, in a (successful) effort to generate more revenues. It is now focusing less on traditional market research activities, and more on “real-time data analytics” — ie data that is served up in some kind of intelligible and useful format as soon as it is generated. Over at FT sister publication Investors Chronicle earlier this month, Alex Hamer spoke to YouGov chief executive Stephan Shakespeare about this strategy shift, and specifically about the company’s new “YouGov Direct” division. This, the company says, “empowers consumers with greater control of their data and creates the opportunity for them to obtain fair value from its use”. Or, to put it another way, here’s Shakespeare (from Alex’s piece): It lets you do things that would be creepy, if it wasn\u0027t for the fact that actually the person selling it is wanting to do that. Sounds great, doesn’t it? Well as you’d expect, like all great new things, YouGov Direct also happens to be blockchain-flavoured. “But Y tho?” we hear you ask, in exasperated unison. From the company’s website: We used blockchain technology to support YouGov Direct because it helps to tackle many of the challenges we see in the audience data market. It turns permission (or consent) into a verifiable audit trail of transactions that can be referenced by businesses to provide GDPR assurance and creates complete transparency of data use from data subject (consumer) to data user (advertiser). But, we’re confused. We thought the whole point of a blockchain was that it is tamper-proof? How could data held in perpetuity on a decentralised blockchain possibly be GDPR-compliant, given that one of the key elements of the new(ish) EU regulation is the right to be forgotten? (Indeed, we have written about this precise problem before.) Shakespeare got in touch with us to explain how the information held on YouGov Direct is GDPR-compliant, because personal data is not in fact held on their “blockchain”; instead, he says the record shows only an encrypted ID, value, and the type of data used, adding: All users have the right to be forgotten, which can be done by request or using the delete button within the app. All personal data is then deleted. The block that remains records only that a transaction happened between a user and an organisation, its value and the type of data used. YouGov Direct does not store personal data on the blockchain. So unlike in a regular blockchain environment -- where nothing can be deleted because i m m u t a b i l i t y -- with the YouGov Direct platform, deleting your personal information is as simple as, um, pressing delete. But that’s not meant to happen. Blockchain is meant to be an append-only system -- once data is in, it’s in (whether or not that data is to be trusted, which is one of our main criticisms of the distributed dream-ledger). The reason this can happen in this case is that the YouGov Direct blockchain doesn’t appear to really be a blockchain. Alex put this to Shakespeare, saying that what he was in fact describing was an internal company system rather than a distributed ledger, at which point he was told (emphasis ours): It is a blockchain; it\u0027s not a public blockchain. As we expand this, we\u0027re going to do something some of us have done, which is to have three or five hosts that are like academic institutions or whatever that are trusted. If you actually distribute it to hundreds or thousands, it becomes highly inefficient. As you know there are still unsolved problems with bitcoin and so on. How you make it efficient as a system, it\u0027s got a lot of friction in it, this is frictionless pretty much, and you get all the advantages, after all we\u0027re not dealing with money, this isn\u0027t a money system. What you want to do is know that this can\u0027t be tampered with, and if you have five hosts for the data, and they\u0027re all trusted institutions you\u0027re going to trust it. Shakespeare said a similar thing to us directly, adding that the “semi-private blockchain model” they were moving towards (at the moment their blockchain is totally private) “is the same model that many of the world’s biggest financial institutions and companies (e.g. IBM) have chosen to use”. But just because other companies are are doing the same thing, that doesn’t make it a good idea. We don’t think private blockchains -- or semi-private ones, for that matter -- make sense. The whole point of a blockchain is the idea that by having a distributed network of computers processing and recording data, it can’t be tampered with. The point is to “disintermediate trust”, to use the jargon. But YouGov isn’t doing that; in fact users need to put their trust in the company itself to maintain the records, or, in the future, in “three or five hosts that are like academic institutions or whatever that are trusted”. Academic institutions (“or whatever”) aren’t inherently more trustworthy than any other establishment (in fact sometimes, quite the opposite). Also, if you’re just going to use a few academic institutions to provide the “trust” element for your empowerment-via-selling-yourself platform, why do you need to do so via a blockchain? If these institutions can be trusted, there’s no need for a blockchain — the blockchain bit is meant to obviate the need for trust. If they can’t be trusted, then having them in control of the whole database seems like a bad idea.

Mr Gadnis says: “[No record] means she will never get good access to credit and she will be exposed to predatory lending; if she’s able to sell the barley, her husband or son may steal the cash.” This is where technology comes in, and BanQu, Mr Gadnis’s software company, is using blockchain to tackle the problems faced by people working in countries that suffer from a high level of poverty. One example is Zambia, where BanQu has joined drinks company Anheuser-Busch InBev to give smallholder farmers a record — accessible by mobile phone — of all their sales to the company. This enables them to build a business history, which in turn lets them secure loans and win contracts. With commodities paid for in the form of mobile money, their earnings are also safe from ill-meaning relatives. There are questions to be asked about who was involved in the making or the extraction of those minerals and gemstones The incentive to adopt new technology is often the efficiencies it supports. Shell uses Vakt, a blockchain platform backed by leading oil companies, to manage invoicing and scheduling. The system has saved users up to half their time and cut costs by 40 per cent compared with manual methods. BanQu increases efficiency, too, particularly with procurement. “Our team [can see] inventory throughout the supply chain in real time,” says Katie Hoard, global director of agricultural innovation at AB InBev. “It makes it easier to manage.” Digital technology also allows corporate buyers and consumers to discover more about the sustainability and ethics of their purchases. It can trace anything from carbon emissions to labour standards. At AB InBev, for example, BanQu’s platform means the company can be sure that farmers are paid properly for their commodities and that its training and agricultural products for use in farming reach the right communities. “This is a huge step forward,” says Ms Hoard. “It’s being able to understand where the resources are going and making sure they are getting to the people you intend to impact.” Blockchain is just one of several technologies being used to transform the supply chain. Another is satellite imaging, which makes it possible, for example, to track deforestation — where land is being cleared for agriculture. “We can build up a clear picture that makes it increasingly difficult to cover up illegal or poor practices,” says Renat Heuberger, founding partner and chief executive of South Pole. Mr Heuberger’s company taps into a range of data to create tools that help make supply chains more transparent, reducing both the risks they pose and their effect on the environment. It allows companies, governments and others to understand and tackle climate change-related risks. Leanne Kemp is founder and chief executive of Everledger, which uses “a symphony of technologies” to track and authenticate the origin of products such as diamonds, minerals, wines and high-value art. Ms Kemp says blockchain enables different parts of the supply chain to be linked. “Blockchain is the tissue that connects to sensors and scanning technologies to identify the object,” she says. “In the case of a diamond, it’s unique like a snowflake, so we can identify every single stone.” For Everledger’s jewellery industry clients, this means they can meet the demand for transparency from consumers. “Sustainability goes beyond carbon emissions,” says Ms Kemp. “There are questions to be asked about who was involved in the making or the extraction of those minerals and gemstones.” IBM’s Food Trust initiative uses the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence and blockchain to capture and share information among growers, processors, wholesalers, manufacturers and retailers. “IoT is one additional source of data to be captured for sharing,” says Ramesh Gopinath, vice-president of blockchain solutions at IBM. “With all the data that’s captured, artificial intelligence makes sense of it. And blockchain is where you keep track of the information.” IBM’s technology makes it possible to reduce food waste and to identify the source of any contamination, meaning recalls are easier. Mr Gopinath argues, however, that technology alone cannot transform supply chains. “It is one enabler to get us to the nirvana of transparency,” he says. “But it is people and their willingness to share information that [will]play a big part.” The case studies below showcase combining data and technology in business operations. They were compiled by RSG Consulting. WINNER Golden State Foods \u0026 IBM Food Trust In October 2018, IT company IBM launched its Food Trust network, which uses blockchain technology to share information along food supply chains. Golden State Foods put the network to the test last summer by placing sensors in boxes of meat to monitor temperature and humidity as they were transported. Some boxes were also tagged with locator IDs and permitted users could monitor the shipment in real time. IBM Food Trust has completed 500,000 traces on food supply chains, according to the company, and users have seen 30 per cent less product loss and lower costs. AB In-Bev \u0026 BanQu Drinks company AB InBev joined BanQu, a blockchain platform provider, in May 2018 to improve transparency in its supply chain. Distributed ledger technology is used to trace how raw materials are sourced, focusing on individual farmers. AB InBev originally opened the blockchain to 2,000 Zambian farmers and 1,200 Ugandan farmers who supply cassava and barley. Since then, the scheme has added 10 more countries, including Brazil and India. BanQu reports that companies that adopt blockchain technology have seen average supply chain savings of 15 per cent and have halved their exposure to risk. Everledger London-based Everledger uses blockchain technology to track and authenticate the origin of seven types of valuable assets, including diamonds, wines and works of art. Founded in 2015, the company uses a digital ledger to see the asset at every stage of the supply chain. Everledger works with certification houses to give assets such as diamonds a digital thumbprint for authentication. The company works with global jewellery groups, including Taylor \u0026 Hart and Brilliant Earth, and has provided provenance for more than 2m diamonds since 2015. Shell and Vakt Vakt’s blockchain-powered platform for the crude oil industry went live in February. Oil company Shell has put all its North Sea trading transactions on to the platform to cover invoicing, contract and deal recaps and scheduling. The company reports that blockchain has saved users 30-50 per cent in time and 40 per cent in costs compared with traditional, manual methods. It ensures frictionless and accurate invoicing between suppliers. South Pole South Pole is a sustainability consultancy that advises multinational companies on how to reduce their carbon footprint in supply chains. Its BigChain tool uses cloud-sourced big data and satellite mapping to assess climate risk and how a company’s activity is affecting the world’s forests. South Pole says it has screened and advised corporate and individual investors for more than $2tn worth of investments.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Sarah Murray","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-10-23","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f93d73de-dede-33fd-8d48-40380c288044","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F22992e93-8a09-4e76-aab0-8dab9661bca3.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Block.one headed","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In the year between June 2017 and 2018, Block.one — an unspecified blockchain platform — raised several billion dollars from an initial coin offering.

Block.one consented to the order without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings. We’re not sure about you, but a civil fine of $24m for raising billions of dollars outside of security law strikes us as pretty damn pathetic. It does beg the question; what’s the incentive for a company to conform to securities law if a slap on the wrist is all that’s going to come of it? We’d venture: there isn’t much of one at the moment. But whatever, we’re sure the public will go on believing in the integrity of financial markets regardless. It’s not as if, a decade or so after the financial crisis, it still has a reputation problem. We asked the SEC about the fine, and we’ll update the article if we hear back from them.

So it comes as something of a surprise when, in 2019, you’re sent a press release about a company that actually wants to do the opposite of making cross-border payments frictionless and free, and instead wants to charge a monthly subscription fee for the privilege of being able to partake in them. In other words, a company that wants to make payments sticky. Introducing Sokin, a “global cross-border payments firm” that wants to disrupt the $689bn global remittances market when it launches in early 2020. But Sokin also plans to charge users £9.99 a month (or a roughly equivalent rate in other markets, Netflix style) to send an unlimited number of payments abroad, which it says will be settled instantly. From the press release: On average the cost of transferring money across international borders is 7%, according to studies by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Koncept Analytics*. Sokin will significantly reduce this cost for all users. For example, using Sokin, the fee for sending four £200 international transfers a month from the UK to Argentina would be 53% less than current ‘best in market’ providers claim they can offer. As Sokin is a subscription-based service with no mark-up or hidden transaction fees, transferring more money, or increasing the number of transfers, will not increase costs for consumers. So if, as in the example above, you’re spending £18.85 a month on remittance fees alone, Sokin might be able to help (if you’re spending £9.99 or less on fees, it’s obviously useless). But that’s if the company can get the same rates as this “best in market” provider it’s comparing itself against. Sokin says that it offers “better FX rates than the market”, but that sounds a bit unspecific. They don’t say they will be able to offer interbank rates for all these currencies the way Revolut and Transferwise do (during currency trading hours, ie 24 hours a day from Monday to Friday). And Sokin will be accessing the 30 currencies it offers via 15 global exchange partners, some of which they say are banks but not all, and so will have to depend on these partners for their rates. Even if there are no “hidden fees” no mark-ups from the rates set by those exchanges, there might well be large bid-offer spreads involved, and the customers will bear the brunt of those. There’s also the issue of how customers who don’t have bank accounts will be able to pay the monthly subscription fee -- remittances, after all, are often sent by migrant workers who don’t have bank accounts in the countries they are working in. There are an estimated 8.4 million unbanked adults in the US, for example, which is responsible for the vast majority of the $36bn that gets sent annually to Mexico. Also, a monthly commitment of £9.99 seems like quite a lot for many people in some of the countries Sokin want to operate in. The company says its pricing will vary a little according to each country, and that their “pricing model is modelled on established subscription models across the globe such as Netflix or Spotify”. They gave the example of South Africa, where Sokin will be charging ZAR 129.99, or £6.94. But in a country where the average annual salary is £13,500, or £1,125 a month, before tax, that still sounds pretty expensive. But does it really blockchain? As with any nice new payments solution, all of this is served with a little sprinkle of blockchain fairy dust for good measure. From the press release (emphasis ours): Sokin will be available via an app or online. It will allow users to be verified and checked quickly and rigorously, and then enable them to move funds between over 150 countries instantly via blockchain, distributed ledger technology. This also provides a high degree of transparency, and a very simple and secure process for clients. Regular readers will know that we’re not the biggest fans of the distributed technicolour dream-ledger, so we asked Sokin’s CEO, Vroon Modgill (who was previously CEO at crypto card firm Wirex) how the blockchain will enable the instant transfer of fiat money, given that fiat money doesn’t run on a blockchain, and he said that bit of the press release was actually wrong. Ahem. It looks like the enabling-instant-transfers-via-a-blockchain bit was just an attempt at getting some good PR then (they’re not the first). Modgill does say they are using blockchain technology, however, in the “back end”, by using R3’s Corda platform for “transaction monitoring” and also, perplexingly, “data privacy”. (Corda has actually said it is not a blockchain, but anyway.) So all in all, we’re not convinced. Sokin reckons it is “revolutionising the archaic world of international remittances” but the thing is, other companies are trying to do that too, but without extracting a monthly charge. That’s not to say offering zero-fee cross-border payments will prove a sustainable business model for companies, like Revolut, currently offering such services. So we understand where Sokin is coming from. It is prudent to try to find some way of making customers stick around. But a subscription model is unlikely the way to go. Unlike Netflix, Spotify, or Amazon Prime, remittances aren’t a luxury, but a lifeline. The reason they’re often paid in several monthly instalments rather than in one go is because of the way the people sending the money abroad get paid. If they’re not sending through one monthly remittance payment every month, they’re unlikely to be the kind of people for whom one monthly subscription fee is going to work -- i.e. people with a stable monthly salary. And if they are only making one monthly payment, the £9.99 (or local equivalent) fee is probably not going to be worth it.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-10-07","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/e9f22342-d926-11e9-9c26-419d783e10e8","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fa3ae0d06-e3f8-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How smart tech could put a stop to wine fraud","INTRO":"Chainvine is partnering with winemakers and merchants to put an IoT device and a QR code on each new bottle","DETAILED_CONTENT":"My wine collection runs to half a case of sub-£10 claret — if I don’t count bottles of the undrinkable and unthinkable left in the kitchen at parties — but even I could tell it apart from vin de table. So how is it that billionaire wine collector Bill Koch managed to spend $2.1m on 219 bottles of what turned out to be vin de kitchen table? Partly, it is because his priceless bordeaux and burgundy vintages had been expertly faked in the kitchen of fraudster Rudy Kurniawan, using genuine empty bottles, original corks and meticulously reprinted labels. And partly, it is because establishing the provenance, let alone price, of an asset that lies unseen for decades remains difficult, if all you have is a few uncorked bottles and reference books of old labels. Until now, that is. A company called Chainvine is using 21st-century blockchain and “internet of things” (IoT) technology to address a problem that is hundreds of years old — and seems to be getting worse. Since 2005, Koch alone has had to bring three major wine fraud lawsuits, one relating to four bottles that purportedly belonged to Thomas Jefferson, US president from 1801 to 1809, but proved rather younger. “Transparency and authentication of the supply chain has long been an issue in the wine industry, particularly the fine wine market,” says Chainvine co-founder Oliver Oram, “so the community has naturally been very supportive of our initiative.” That initiative, as he puts it, is twofold. First, Chainvine is partnering with winemakers and merchants to put an IoT device and a QR code on each new bottle. These codes are scanned by the vineyard, which adds the bottles to Chainvine’s blockchain database. When the bottles are first sold, the winemaker marks them as in transit. They are scanned by customs agents and government departments as they move along the supply chain. Then sensors in the IoT devices monitor the bottles’ subsequent locations and the conditions in which they are kept, including temperature and humidity. Once in the hands of a merchant, the bottles are scanned again and logged as part of the merchant’s inventory. Second, Chainvine can access data on older bottles in existing blockchain-enabled wine databases, as its system will work with any ledger. According to Paul Hammond, chief executive of merchant IG Wines, which trialled the Chainvine system, that means “the same information can also be collated from wines stored in clients’ cellars”. Importantly, the system allows wines to be marked as drunk, preventing the reuse of bottles or labels to fraudulently “recreate” and resell a rare vintage. “Thanks to the nature of blockchain technology, the provenance trail created is immutable,” says Oram. Recommended Investors as well as drinkers should benefit, thinks Ryan Hanley, managing director of blockchain-powered investment platform TokenMarket. He believes technology could make valuations more accurate. “Investment in wine can be depressed due to concerns around provenance; there are horror stories of fake bottles filled with cheap plonk being sold as grand wines. If potential investors can see where the wine was made, when it was sold, for how much, they are in a much better position to make a decision on the true value.” However, just like a bottle of Domaine Ponsot Clos Saint-Denis Grand Cru 1945 — the non-existent vintage that proved Kurniawan’s undoing — Chainvine’s database might seem to have the right contents, but it still needs a market in which to operate. “Widespread adoption of such a platform will require participation from multiple players,” admits Oram. Rival technologies could also limit take-up of the Chainvine system. Hanley points out there is already a similar system called WiV that uses a blockchain ledger to record each time a wine is sold and for how much; investors receive tokens that represent the wine digitally. A whisky equivalent is offered by a company called Oak Group One. More traditional wine investors than the flamboyant Koch — who has had chandeliers and Roman mosaics added to his Florida cellar — might not even see a need for high-tech reassurance. Philip Moulin, fine wine quality and authentication manager at London-based merchant Berry Bros \u0026 Rudd (founded 1698), suggests a ledger of provenance could help when buying rare wines at auction. “Blockchain-based traceability will come into its own with secondary market stock,” he says. But drinkers and collectors who buy directly from merchants probably wouldn’t see any incentive to sign up, he concludes: “If dealing with established merchants, buying directly from source, it is largely irrelevant.” Still, Chainvine thinks its tracking technology should appeal to anyone seeking “frictionless trade”. English winemakers worrying about their post-Brexit exports should be among those raising a glass to that. bad news for the sellers of private jets, yachts, watches, holiday homes and all else advertised within the pages of the FT Wealth magazine: the net worth of the world’s 265,490 “ultra” rich people fell for the first time in three years in 2018, according to data provider Wealth-X.

And, as expected, that faecal vortex arrived Monday, when a class-action lawsuit was filed against Tether, Bitfinex (a sister crypto exchange), and a handful of others. The suit was made public on Monday, having been filed on Saturday in Court of the Southern District of New York by Vel Freedman and Kyle Roche. Notably, they are the same lawyers who recently (and successfully) sued Craig Wright on behalf of Ira Kleiman. For those who don’t know, Tether is a “stablecoin” — ie a digital-only currency whose value is pegged to the dollar — that is used by crypto traders to get in and out of positions quickly on exchanges. It has long been alleged, by critics such as blogger Bitfinex’ed, that Tether is used to manipulate the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. And that’s precisely what this lawsuit is alleging. The plaintiffs don’t pull any punches (emphasis ours): This action concerns a sophisticated scheme that co-opted a disruptive innovation — cryptocurrency — and used it to defraud investors, manipulate markets, and conceal illicit proceeds. Part-fraud, part-pump-and-dump, and part-money laundering, the scheme was primarily accomplished through two enterprises — Bitfinex and Tether — that commingled their corporate identities and customer funds while concealing their extensive co-operation in a way that enabled them to manipulate the cryptocurrency market with unprecedented effectiveness. They also present a pretty eye-popping estimation of the scale of the damages: Calculating damages at this stage is premature, but there is little doubt that the scale of harm wrought by the Defendants is unprecedented. Their liability to the putative class likely surpasses $1.4 trillion US dollars. !! The plaintiffs’ central allegations have been made by many others before them: that Bitfinex and Tether have printed billions of dollars’ worth of Tether tokens to artificially inflate prices, in turn convincing the market there was rapidly growing demand for cryptocurrencies: Tether issued extraordinary amounts of unbacked USDT to manipulate cryptocurrency prices. Because the market believed the lie that one USDT equalled one US dollar, Bitfinex and Tether had the power to, and did, manipulate the market on an unprecedented scale to profit from boom-and-bust cycles they created. This, they argue, “created the largest bubble in human history”. Tether, of course, “vigorously disputes the findings and conclusions claimed by that source, which rely on flawed assumptions, incomplete and cherry-picked data, and faulty methodology”. The company also insists that “all Tether tokens are fully backed by reserves and are issued pursuant to market demand, and not for the purpose of controlling the pricing of crypto assets”. However, as the class action suit points out, until February this year the company’s website continued to say that every USDT (Tether) token in circulation was “backed 1-1 by traditional currency held in our reserves”. Then suddenly in March, when under criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice, the CFTC, and the New York Attorney General, Tether changed it to say that every USDT token was “1-1 pegged to the dollar” and “100% backed” by reserves that “from time to time may include other assets”. And then in April, Tether’s own lawyer was forced to admit in court that the stablecoin is only 74 per cent backed by cash and cash equivalents. The plaintiffs write: If there was any doubt before, it’s now absolutely clear that Tether no longer has cash reserves to back USDT at a 1:1 ratio. The Bitfinex and Tether Defendants engaged in unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading acts by omitting, or failing to disclose the material fact that USDT was not backed 1:1 and that the market demand created by the Bitfinex and Tether Defendants was fraudulent. The Bitfinex and Tether Defendants’ deceptive practices were consumer-oriented aimed at manipulating the cryptocurrency market and thereby transfer wealth from consumers to themselves. This should be an interesting one to watch.

Well it’s got grander ambitions now. In some ways, anyway. It doesn’t actually want to reinvent money any more -- it wants to be “complementary” to existing systems and currencies. But it does want to be the defender of the Free World. The Free Western World specifically. David Marcus, Libra’s head honcho, was interviewed by Swiss public radio station Radio Télévision Suisse on Wednesday, and was found telling the broadcaster, in fluent French, some pretty interesting things. You can watch some clips from the interview here. But for those of you who are not Francophone or who don’t feel like watching, we thought we’d give you some highlights. On China, which recently said it was ready to launch its own central-bank-issued digital currency after five years of development, Marcus seemed to be particularly animated: China is marching towards a digital renminbi. And what is not really understood is that people think this is really just a domestic project for China. In reality it’s a far more ambitious project -- a project that really wants to replace certain financial networks in the Belt and Road countries. It’s a real risk. He went on (emphasis ours): What we see today on the internet is a fractioning into two internets. We have the internet of what I call the Free World, and another internet, which is an internet of surveillance, etc. And if we have the same thing happen with financial networks, where fundamentally, the US and others don’t have the ability to impose sanctions that are respected by financial systems, that creates geopolitical problems with huge consequences for the world. That’s right, Facebook -- literally the poster-child for “surveillance capitalism”; a company whose business model has centred around surveilling its users and selling the data to other companies -- is going to save the world from the internet of surveillance. Marcus explained that, contrary to what France has just said about Libra, it “is not a threat to the sovereignty of nations and to their ability to implement monetary policy”. Rather: It’s a project that intends to be worked on collaboratively, with states, central banks and regulators -- that’s why we’ve announced it so early, so that we get the feedback we need to create this network in the right way. Eh? Announced it so early? We thought you said it was going to be launched in early 2020, Dave? We thought it was all a fait accompli? It does feel a little like now that regulators and governments have come out and said “Non!” to Libra -- not just France but also Germany, India, and America, to name a few -- there is a palpable change in tune from Marcus. It also feels like Marcus’s rhetoric has taken on a distinctly Trumpian tone since we last analysed it. It’s worth remembering here that The Donald has publicly expressed his disdain for Libra, saying it would have “little standing or dependability” and that “we have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever”. Probably the most eye-popping of Marcus’s comments was this one: This could be an instrument of development, which allows the Free World of the Western nations to preserve the influence that in my opinion is necessary to maintain a good balance in the world. An instrument of development that preserves the influence of the West? Mon dieu. It all chimes rather well with a piece Claire and Izzy wrote last week: “Libra is imperialism by stealth”.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-09-20","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/80a985cd-a16b-37db-bcd3-dfcb83eadef9","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F32f71d3d-e5db-4b5d-b1a4-4ee686fa41ca.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"When bitcoin bros talk digitisation","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Arch-bitcoin bro Anthony* “Pomp🌪️” Pompliano is known for espousing the merits of bitcoin and berating the failings of the traditional financial system to his more than quarter of a million Twitter followers. He teaches them about the difference between dollars moving electronically and digitally (?); he tells them that “if you don’t believe in bitcoin, you’re essentially saying you don’t believe in cryptography” (!); he even goes so far as to provide them with dictionary-style definitions for words and phrases they might need in their everyday lives (/ˈevriˌdeɪ laɪvz/): On Wednesday, it was time for him to tackle a big one: financial assets. You know, those bits of physical paper you pass around between each other that represent shares in companies, or tradable IOUs, that you’re always a bit concerned about losing in a fire. Or those barrels of oil you keep beneath your desk that you’re always worried might exacerbate that very same fire. Well fear not, because Pomp has a solution for you: That’s right. In the future, asset allocators will no longer have to lug those barrels of oil and bars of gold around. And that can only be good for bitcoin, right? The only thing is, as John Paul Koning pointed out to Pomp (or worse, pointed out to his followers via the dreaded quote-tweet), the digitisation of assets is already upon us, and has been for quite some time: When bitcoin bros evangelise about “digitisation” or “tokenisation” of assets (basically the same thing as digitisation except you turn them into tokens that are native to a particular blockchain), they seem to have forgotten that we are already living in a world “where the internet gradually consumes everything”, as Tom put it earlier. But still. Maybe we can at least trust Pomp to tell us when some “bitcoin rocket fuel” has hit the market, like yesterday, when he broke the news that the Fed had cut interest rates. Here’s the price move since the rate cut: (If you are extra-curious and wondering why there’s a sudden drop in the price right around 4am UTC, we would encourage you to stop wondering.

The JPMorgan Chase-led Interbank Information Network (IIN) will this week announce Deutsche as a new recruit to a network of 320 banks which have agreed to swap information on global payments over blockchain, the mutually distributed ledger technology behind cryptocurrencies. Their goal is to free payments from the lengthy and costly delays that affect around 1.5 per cent of cross-border payments by making information about the transfers instantly accessible to every bank in the payments chain. Most of IIN’s existing members are banks who use JPMorgan as a correspondent bank to process dollar payments on behalf of their clients. Deutsche is the world’s biggest clearer of euro denominated payments. “A network that only has JPMorgan’s clients will have very big natural limitations,” said Takis Georgakopoulos, head of payments at JPMorgan. “It would mean that all of these other smaller banks would still need to have bifurcated procedures, what they do with JPMorgan and what they do with other banks would still have to be different.” Recommended “Having Deutsche join — and hopefully Deutsche will be the first of several other large banks — is going to help us drive towards ubiquity and ubiquity is a pre-requisite for the success of the network.” Transaction banking, including cash management, is one of the only remaining sources of global strength for Deutsche after a July restructuring signalled swingeing cuts to its investment bank. Ole Matthiessen, who has headed Deutsche’s cash management division since March, said the IIN would allow his bank to offer better services to their clients, and would lower the cost of processing difficult payments. “Our competitors are not just the other banks, it’s also new players in the market, we need to become efficient enough to provide seamless real time and digital process,” Mr Matthiessen said. “It [joining IIN] is definitely directionally a very important step for us because it will help drive [customer] satisfaction” Recommended Mr Georgakopoulos said IIN was saving JPMorgan both time and money, by allowing them to resolve within hours issues that would previously have taken two to 16 days. The efficiencies come because IIN puts all the information about a given payment on a mutually accessible ledger, allowing anomalies to be resolved quickly with less manual effort. Mr Matthiessen said Deutsche could also benefit from other potential uses of IIN, like using it as a platform for banks to share know-your-customer checks. So far, more than 65 banks have gone live on the system and another 255 have signed letters of intent, well up on the 75-plus banks who were signed up to IIN a year ago. Mr Georgakopoulos said IIN was on track to reach its target of 400 agreements by the end of the year and expects to announce other large banks “imminently”. The IIN is one of a number of initiatives aimed at speeding up the global payments system, including Mastercard and R3’s blockchain-based cross-border platform and the admission of blockchain firms to the traditional global interbank messaging system Swift. “If there was a global new payment system that included all of the banks and was all digital then yes probably [IIN] would be redundant,” said Mr Georgakopoulos.” It’s just we are very, very far away from that.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Laura Noonan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-09-15","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/a381d0ae-9b6e-3540-97bb-9d733677f05f","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fec6b352a-21c0-4073-9305-3840bc415408.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain goes extra-terrestrial","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"An other-worldly blockchain press release crash-landed into the our inbox this week. It contained some somewhat sigh-enducing sentences such as: SpaceChain’s vision is to remove barriers and allow a global community to access and collaborate in space. And: Ultimately, it will mean that there will be more opportunities for businesses/start-ups in the UK/EU to participate in the space economy, thanks to blockchain. And: SpaceChain is a community-based space platform that combines space and blockchain technologies to build the world’s first open-source blockchain-based satellite network, allowing users to develop and run decentralized applications in space. (Not, apparently, for all those times you’re hanging out in space trying to develop and run decentralised applications, but rather for those times you’re hanging out on Earth thinking: “I’d like to run a decentralised application in space”.) But this doesn’t look like just another rip-off crypto project that’s about to rush off into outer space with all your money. SpaceChain has just announced that it has received funding from the European Space Agency, no less, under the agency’s “Kick-start Activity” funding scheme. Just 60,000 euros, but still, this is Europe’s answer to NASA. Also the company’s CTO is the well-respected Jeff Garzik, one of the early bitcoin developers. So we thought it would be worth trying to find out what this is all about. The Singapore-based company says that its purpose is “to bring more security to the transmission of digital currencies and smart contracts by using a distributed satellite network and multi-signature transactions”. Ie, it’s about making those famously “unhackable” blockchains even more unhackable, by putting some of the nodes (ie the connection points sitting inside computers that do the processing and maintaining of the transaction records) into space. SpaceChain says it has “launched and flight-tested two blockchain nodes into space in the past 12 months”, which are still orbiting Earth (!) and has even got what it says is a geospatial tracking feature that lets you watch the node orbit the earth in real time. We thought launching a satellite was quite expensive, and probably outside the budget of a project like this. But according to Garzik, there has been “an exponential drop in the cost of access to space”, with “nanosatellites” like theirs being launched via “ride-sharing arrangements” (that’s rocket-ride arrangements, FYI). The cost of doing this launching these 10cm cuboid nodes into space is therefore (rather perplexingly): Under $1M per launch, trending towards under $300k. As for the reason for propelling these objects into Earth’s orbit, Garzik explained: Having the node in space makes physical access to the node highly improbable which reduces possible attack vectors, and independent space-base power supply and connectivity makes the blockchain infrastructure more robust. So maybe this all seems legit, after all? Gives “when moon?” a whole new meaning? It’s worth pointing out here that even though SpaceChain didn’t do a regular ICO, it did run a “private sale” of its tokens for institutional and accredited investors (which is what many in cryptoland now do because it gets you round pesky regulators’ complaints about selling to unwitting retail investors). The token is now worth about a quarter of a cent on crypto markets, having crashed by a, er, astronomical 99.5 per cent from a peak of almost 50 cents back in the crypto-manic days of early 2018. So moon might have to wait another day. But even if the project is legit and didn’t rip off retail investors, that doesn’t mean it’s not silly, and indeed we can’t help feeling it’s all a little gimmicky. We thought the whole point of a decentralised distributed ledger -- and the geographical diversity inherent in that -- was to make attack vectors highly improbable. Also, the idea is to create a multi-signature cryptocurrency wallet -- ie a crypto wallet that requires the signature of multiple private keys before funds can be transferred -- and for some of those of those private keys to be held in a satellite in outer space. But what happens if the satellites get damaged? Or if there’s some technical problem? Or if some bad actor attacks or takes possession of the satellites? They have a solution for that. Per the release: The funds in the wallet remain safe even in the event of a connectivity failure due to the fact that the two ground-based signatures can still complete the transaction. Ah yes. So you don’t actually need the extra-terrestrial satellite, but it’s nice to have it. SpaceChain isn’t the first blockchain project seeking to go extra-terrestrial -- far from it. There have been a whole host of projects competing to advance blockchain in space, like Nexus, BitSpace, Spacebit, to name but a few. It’s also not the first company to think of putting a satellite into space to safeguard against earthly attacks -- a company called Cloud Constellation raised $100m at the end of last year to launch a network of data centres built on satellites in orbit, saying it was “eliminating the risk [of data breaches] associated with terrestrial infrastructure”. But we can’t help wondering why the biggest cloud providers in the world, like AWS or Mircrosoft Azure, whose very business models depend on not having data breaches, reckon that having a geographically diverse network of data centres on boring old Earth is secure enough. Attack of the 50-foot Blockchain author David Gerard sounds about as convinced by SpaceChain as us, anyway: The idea is a dumb ICO idea of the sort that sounds like it was composed by sticking pins into a dictionary. The amazing bit is that they seem to be serious about it. I mean, good luck to them, but still nothing about this makes any sense. We’ve updated this story since being told how much it does actually cost to launch blockchain nodes into outer space.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-09-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/5d928e8d-be81-3d57-9ad8-d885069bc1fc","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F08f4a604-769a-4d2a-ad93-a102b65e0d28.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Let’s give a helping hand to Andrew Yang","INTRO":"Did we hear you say blockchain, sir? FT Alphaville is here to assist you with your media coverage.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Axios has a story out today entitled “Andrew Yang gets media cold shoulder”, in which the US news site points out that despite the presidential hopeful polling in the top six ahead of the Democratic primary, the media isn’t giving him any love. Take a look at this graphic, which stacks the Democratic candidates up against one another: This comes after a Twitter campaign last week under the hashtag #YangMediaBlackout, in which Yang’s supporters -- the #YangGang, obvs -- complained about the low level of coverage being given to Yang, after both CNN and MSNBC appeared to forget that he existed. Or, worse, deliberately sidelined him because of his lack of experience in politics. Honestly, we at Alphaville can’t see what could possibly go wrong with putting a New York entrepreneur who’s never held political office before into the White House. So as always, we’d like to offer a helping hand. You see Yang hasn’t wasted his life schmoozing with political donors or climbing up the greasy pole of Washington power. Instead, he’s a former tech executive who is taking what Reuters has described as a “technocratic approach” to politics. And as part of that, naturally, Yang wants to harness the power of, you guessed it, the blockchain -- or, as we like to call it, the distributed technicolour dream-ledger. Just like our own Spreadsheet Phil before him, who last year said blockchain was “the most obvious technology” for solving the Irish Border problem, the techophantic Dem reckons blockchain can make voting “fraud-proof”. From his website: It’s ridiculous that in 2020 we are still standing in line for hours to vote in antiquated voting booths. It is 100% technically possible to have fraud-proof voting on our mobile phones today using the blockchain. This would revolutionize true democracy and increase participation to include all Americans - those without smartphones could use the legacy system and lines would be very short. Yang’s idea is that Americans, rather than queueing up for hours outside voting booths, should be able to vote via their smartphones, with the verification of their personal identities somehow magically carried out via the power of the blockchain. The only problem with that idea is that blockchains don’t verify people’s identities (thank God). You need some kind of centralised authority to do that, which is exactly what blockchain is meant to get rid of. And how would one make voting “fraud-proof” by using a blockchain? A blockchain might do an OK job of keeping data secure once it’s been put into a database (although that depends on whether it’s a permissioned or permissionless blockchain, and whether the entities that are verifying the data are motivated not to interfere with it), but as we’ve said many times before, it can’t magically ensure that the data being put onto it is accurate in the first place. And traditional centralised databases can also keep data secure. Also, people have already tried throwing blockchain at voting systems, and it hasn’t gone too well so far. One month before the Moscow City Duma election (coming up this Sunday), the blockchain voting system that had been designed for the event was broken in the space of 20 minutes by a French security researcher. Yang also has a whole section of his website devoted to cryptocurrencies, in which he says the government should be “support(ing) innovation and development”, because “the blockchain has vast potential” (sigh). He also bemoans regulations in the US that “make it difficult for the US cryptocurrency markets to compete with those in other jurisdictions”. (Meanwhile renowned regulators like Malta\u0027s seem to be doing an exceptional job of competing with other jurisdictions.) Ah well. At least Yang’s only jumping on a tired old bandwagon, rather than doing anything truly absurd like rolling out a line of marijuana-themed merchandise. What’s that you say -- he’s selling a T-shirt emblazoned with “Math. Money. Marijuana.”!??!?! Well, we’re happy to have done our bit, anyway.

Lucky Warren Buffett.","INTRO":"A sudden bout of the kidney stones attacks young Justin Sun.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"On Thursday, the famously crypto-sceptical Warren Buffett was due to lunch with a bunch of crypto bros. That’s because, as you may remember, 29-year-old Justin Sun, founder of the TRON crypto-token (which raised $70m in an ICO in 2017) and CEO of BitTorrent, won the annual charity auction to have a lunch with the Oracle of Omaha. His winning bid was over $4.5m. Sun had been hoping he was going to school the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on crypto. He’d even invited Donald Trump to join the party, after the president tweeted that he was “not a fan” of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But as of Monday, it seems the party is off — for the time being at least. Mr Sun can no longer make it, because he’s apparently suddenly come down with a spot of the old kidney stones. Ouch. From the official TRON Twitter feed late on Monday: It appears the TRON bros weren’t that convinced about the kidney stones. Or if they were, took them as a bearish signal. At pixel time, TRON is down 16 per cent since the announcement (screenshot from Coinbase; red circle helpfully showing the time of the tweet from us): Sun invited a number of industry heavyweights to the lunch but not everyone was so keen to come to the party. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, for example, didn’t make any kind of public response to Sun’s invitation, while Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said he couldn’t make it because the lunch — which was set to take place in Silicon Valley, in a change from the normal New York steakhouse — was “too far”. That had invited criticism from cryptoland that Sun’s promise to bring \"#blockchain industry leaders” hadn’t come to fruition, with crypto podcast host Peter McCormack calling the number of people who’d declined the invitation “quite impressive”, according to Cryptoslate. So maybe the kidney stones were brought on by worries about the quality of the guest list? Or, perhaps, they were brought on by worries about getting out of the country. According to various people on Twitter, Weibo reported that Sun had been issued an exit ban by Chinese authorities just before the kidney stones announcement: We have contacted TRON for confirmation of these rumours and will update the story if and when we get it.

Headed by financial-platform industry veteran David Rutter, of ICAP and Prebon Yamane heritage, it was one of the earliest of the blockchain projects to pull in serious backing from the banking community. And yet, just as Digital Asset is also finding out, it turns out that attracting funding for blockchain-based development is far easier than delivering an actual viable and usable product to market. The rollout of the company’s flagship “Corda Enterprise” system has allegedly been plagued by delays, frustrating insiders. But, according to The Block\u0027s Isabel Woodford on Wednesday, the discontent might be much more far reaching than just that: Sources close to blockchain giant R3 say its engineers and senior management fundamentally disagree over the future of Corda; its flagship enterprise product Among the concerns are Corda’s design and development approach, which are reportedly creating a cultural gulf Others say these tensions speak to a human problem seen across the enterprise-blockchain space and blame the so-called “three-year itch” endemic among engineers for R3’s recent exodus As well as complaints about company culture and concerns about Corda’s viability, The Block notes that an internal group chat reveals engineers have lost faith in the tech, saying it lacks scalability and “doesn’t perform well”. Engineers have also complained about the five-figure monthly bills R3 has to pay for cloud services, undermining viability even further. Confirming Alphaville’s longstanding suspicion that most blockchain enterprises have massively overhyped their ability to revolutionise banking clearing and settlement infrastructure, The Block goes on to note the key riff underlying much of the discontent applies potentially to the entire sector. This, they note, is a cultural conflict between those bringing blockchain enterprises to market and the engineers working on delivering the products being promised. From Woodford, with our emphasis: The first issue is design; what Corda is and the ultimate vision. Sources suggest R3 is struggling to decide its identity, spreading itself “too thin” from being a financial software firm to a broad tech consortium. They also note frustration at the lack of ambition and clarity over what sort of blockchain Corda is trying to be – if indeed, it is intent on DLT. Specifically, there are reportedly divisions between those seeking interoperability and those within management who they call Corda “maximalists,” which has alienated some groups. As a result, there are also concerns that the product will not offer viable efficiency gains for the wide array of businesses being targeted. Engineer sources told The Block that R3 is finding it hard to manage or support its growing client base, insinuating the company is flogging software that isn’t fully baked yet. A former employee at R3 client ING*, meanwhile, told The Block that the bank was not seeing the value creation for the money it had spent to engage in a five-year revenues agreement for an unlimited number of Corda Enterprise licenses. That the factional dispute seems split between stuffy banker types focused on delivering returns and efficiencies, versus engineers who are more interested in playing around with innovative disruption than delivering financial returns, speaks volumes about the clash of cultures in the sector. It also speaks volumes about the impractical nature of a lot of the innovation in the crypto space at large. Sources FT Alphaville reached out to confirmed much of the above, citing that for a lot of in-house engineers Corda still feels like an engine without a car -- powerful but not very useful. Other informed sources implied R3 may well have run out of money by now had it not been for the sizeable settlement it received from rival Ripple over its claim that the latter had not honoured an option agreement to allow R3 to buy Ripple’s cryptocurrency tokens at a massively reduced price. *Update: 15:47: ING has got in touch to say the following: “We do not recognize the statement made in this article and it does not reflect ING\u0027s opinion. R3 and ING have a strong partnership and we are involved in the development and deployment of multiple CorDapps. Technology development continues and we regard Corda one of the leading enterprise DLT platforms.” Related links: Digital Asset Holdings’ pivot raises doubt over blockchain future - FT Blockchain officially confirmed as slower and more expensive - FT Alphaville","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Izabella Kaminska","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-08-22","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/12a9dfaa-a0f3-3369-a9c5-72263e4633a2","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F1505c2aa-faa4-4be1-ab39-b36c6f81d3a0.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"When bitcoin bros talk cryptography","INTRO":"“If you don’t believe in bitcoin, you’re essentially saying you don’t believe in cryptography.”","DETAILED_CONTENT":"You might remember that last month, chief bitcoin bro Anthony Pompliano — better known as “Pomp” — had a go at talking global finance (it didn’t go terribly well). This time round, the crypto fund manager talked cryptography. You know, that old practice of using codes (where words and numbers are converted into different words and numbers) and ciphers (where a message is converted on a letter-by-letter basis) in order to protect, or “encrypt” secrets. A practice that dates back to roughly 1900BC, when some unusual hieroglyphs were carved into the wall of a tomb in the Old Kingdom of Egypt. Modern cryptography is, of course, a little different, as it uses computers to generate and crack the codes and ciphers. It dates back 100 years or less, depending on how you want to measure it, with great advances made during World War II. It wasn’t until 2008, however, that some elements of cryptography — public-key cryptography, specifically, which was invented in the 1970s — were combined to create bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto (whoever he or she or they is or are or was or were) wasn’t creating any new cryptography, but was simply combining a number of existing bits of it. Such as a “hashing” function called SHA-256, designed by the US National Security Agency around the turn of the millennium. And the “Hashcash” proof-of-work system, designed in the late 1990s as an anti-spam measure. Fast-forward to 2019 (h/t Ed Salazar for drawing our attention to this) and earlier this week Pomp — who has over half his net worth in bitcoin — talked to CNBC about bitcoin as a “safe haven”. He argued that it was “irresponsible for institutions to not have exposure to this asset”. (Ahem.) When one of the CNBC journalists put it to Pomp that just because bitcoin is scarce that doesn’t necessarily make it valuable, as “there are a lot of things that are scarce that nobody cares about”, Pomp said: Of course. Look, if you don’t believe in bitcoin, you’re essentially saying you don’t believe in cryptography. Have a watch for yourself here (and count the seconds it takes for the others to recover from his comment, around the 4.33 mark): There is absolutely no connection between “believing” in cryptography and believing bitcoin is a good place to put your money. Maybe Pomp should go back and read some pieces from our archive to see why it might not be all that responsible to put your life savings into bitcoin. Because if you don’t believe in FT Alphaville, you’re essentially saying you don’t believe in words.

To explore how art, finance and data are becoming inextricably connected, Vaudeville will feature artist Simon Denny, one of the art world’s most fascinating cultural commentators on data, tech and systems. Denny, in case you do not know, is the man who brought blockchain to the Serpentine (including installations on Blythe Masters, Vitalik Buterin and 21). He’s also the man who put Peter Thiel into a Lord of the Rings board game and an offline cryptokitty replica into a physical bubble, with the help of an art collective-turned-blockchain-map/urban-development company called FOAM. His latest (subterranean) exhibition is called Mine and is being shown at the unique Museum of Old and New Art in Berriedale, Tasmania. It explores the relationship between human agency, data and exploitation; you can read about it here. For more about Denny and his work see this beautiful film produced by Artsy: Now consider what the imitable feedback loop that links Adam Curtis, Alphaville and Simon Denny might deliver...

In the post, soberly titled “Libra, 2 weeks in”, Marcus responds to some of the questions and “misunderstandings” the Zuckerbuck has elicited from various quarters since its launch half a month ago. But we couldn\u0027t help but take it a little... personally. As most of you will know, Alphaville is currently running a series on Libra called Breaking the Zuck Buck. It\u0027s fair to say that so far, we have found Libra wanting. And it seems Facebook has noticed. Marcus starts off with a big one for us, given that we made our position on the blockchainless nature of Libra clear as soon as Facebook\u0027s embargo was lifted, and have since added to that: Under which he provides the following “answer” (emphasis ours): (And if you thought that last bit sounded a bit like something Nick Clegg would have come up with in his “look I\u0027m going to come clean about this” tone, you could be on to something. He does now work at Facebook.) Marcus asked the question himself but doesn\u0027t seem to have really answered it: is this really a blockchain? We\u0027ve argued the fact that the Libra Blockchain doesn\u0027t feature a chain of blocks — which you\u0027d think would be important — but is rather a “single data structure” means it\u0027s not a blockchain. But it seems Marcus has a different idea of what blockchain means. If his definition is that it is “open” and “decentralised”, as he in some ways implies in the question, then he does kind of answer it, but as you can see above, the answer would be... no? Unless, if we really want to give him the benefit of the doubt, Marcus\u0027s definition of blockchain is that it is quite decentralised and quite open. (Although even then, the idea that 100 “industry-diverse organisations” running nodes is “quite decentralised” is all very well and good, but there have been only 28 organisations announced so far, including Facebook.) If that\u0027s his definition, however, then the world of blockchain suddenly gets a lot bigger. Isn\u0027t Uber quite decentralised and quite open? Is Uber a blockchain? Isn\u0027t a bank whose API can be plugged into also quite decentralised and its ownership structure also quite decentralised because anyone can buy its stock? Is a bank a blockchain? And you can\u0027t answer the question of “is this a blockchain?” by saying “there are more decentralised blockchains available” but Libra will “gradually decentralise” further over time. To go back to an analogy from our last Libra blockchain post, you don\u0027t answer the question of “is this a loaf of bread?” by saying “there are other more baked loaves of bread available but this loaf of bread will strive to gradually become more baked”. The question wasn\u0027t “are you as baked as other loaves of bread?” The question was “are you a loaf of bread?” Moving on. After a small paragraph on why there isn\u0027t already a charter in place for the Libra Association, Marcus answers “You talk about financial inclusion a lot, but can Libra really address this critical issue?” (emphasis ours): At this point it is worth giving you a little refresher from an excellent post from Brendan on why Libra will not help the unbanked: So yes. Someone did indeed write that a key reason for people to be unbanked is that they feel they don\u0027t have enough money to make it worthwhile for them to be banked. But that someone wasn\u0027t just writing an “opinion”. That someone was citing a survey from a federal US agency, in which the unbanked themselves said the main reason they didn\u0027t have banking was because of not having enough money. And that someone also pointed out that the “unbanked” is too vague a term to be useful, as the unbanked in the US and the unbanked in the developing world are likely to be unbanked for completely different reasons. In rural Rwanda, you might be unbanked because you live nowhere near a bank and nobody around you uses anything other than cash. In inner-city America, you might be unbanked because you don\u0027t want the system to know about you — you might work in the grey or black market and don\u0027t want to have to start paying taxes or be tracked. Or, as Brendan pointed out, because you don\u0027t feel you have enough money to make having a bank account feel worthwhile. (Also: have you ever been forced to pay an “exorbitant fee” just to transfer money to someone in a different country? It\u0027s worth remembering here that Marcus was formerly the president of PayPal.) Marcus continues with his answer: Again, we\u0027ve spoken about this idea that Libra can lower costs before. It is extremely unlikely to do so. As we\u0027ve already seen, Marcus tells us that literally anyone can “build services like wallets, or merchant acceptance”. Why would those third parties suddenly start providing services for free — what would the motivation for them providing services if they are not charging for it? That whole paragraph carries a whole load of assumptions that suggest that Libra cannot “address this critical issue”. Marcus\u0027s final paragraph attempts to answer: “What’s in it for Facebook? Why are you doing this now?\": Hitler, Stalin and Mao, of course, were also mission-aligned around the concept of economic empowerment. And while, David, we hope you will continue to engage with us — and we\u0027re glad you have been reading our stories — we have to disagree with your assessment. In fact we wonder, David, if you have considered that free market forces impose frictions in the transfer of value between jurisdictions for a reason? Notably because the varying standards and values of nation states — especially in terms of law, regulation and trading rules and standards — organically impose such frictions. As the original white paper by Pierre Werner that brought us the euro noted as far back as 1970: Which is to say, even the architects of the euro — for all the flaws that have since been recognised in the euro system — understood at the point of planning that a frictionless (and thus cheap) monetary system could not manifest itself in a system of heterogeneous nation states with differing policy approaches to law, trade and immigration. They, unlike Facebook, understood that the harmonisation of states and standards had to come first if the transfer of value between regions was to become easier (even if they under-appreciated how difficult that would be due to the reluctance of some peoples to subsidise even in a largely harmonised system). Which is why we still think this seems to be mostly all about Facebook, and making financial services work better for.... Facebook. Thank you!

The first person to make the idea famous, of course, was none other than Chancellor of the Exchequer Phillip “Spreadsheet Phil” Hammond himself, who said the magical distributed spreadsheet was the “most obvious” solution to the tiny issue of the Irish Border. This time, it’s the turn of the nation’s (least?) favourite provocateur Rod Liddle, whose new book on Brexit, The Great Betrayal, suggests blockchain could solve “almost all” the problems of the Irish Border. (H/T Ben Munster over at Decrypt Media for drawing our attention to this, via a Guardian review of the book, which calls Liddle’s blockchain-solutionism “childish”) So we headed on over to Google Books for a quick preview. We counted eight instances of the word blockchain. Take a look at this excerpt from the book: Borders today are not so much geographical as rooted in time. The movement of goods and people does not need to be physically checked at the point of entry: there are a multitude of ways around the problem. But the government seemed either uninterested in them or utterly ignorant of them. Blockchain technology, for example, is used to keep a record of transactions in various cryptocurrencies, but is increasingly deployed by big companies to keep track of goods travelling to and fro. Ah yes that old “big companies are increasingly using blockchain” trope. But at least the good people of the island of Ireland now know that the border that divides them is these days not really geographical at all, but rather rooted in time. Blockchain should help that. He continues: What did the government know about blockchain?... Asked about the problem of border relations with Ireland, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, said: “There is a technology becoming available… I don’t claim to be an expert on it but the most obvious is blockchain.” The insouciance and the ineptitude amaze. Why aren’t you an expert on it, Phil? Is there nobody in your department who it an expert on blockchain? Yeah Phil. Why didn’t you bother becoming an expert in cryptography and distributed database systems when you decided to become a politician? And why isn’t someone at the Treasury a crypto coder? The ineptitude of it all! (To be fair, the former chairman of Phil’s party, Michael Green Grant Shapps, was chairing an all-party-parliamentary committee on blockchain, but he stepped down after Alphaville found out he had a secret pay deal with a... blockchain company.) Then we get to the bit where Rod implies blockchain can solve “almost all” the problems surrounding the Irish backstop (parentheses his; emphasis ours): Both Leo Varadkar and the EU negotiating team stuck fast to the notion that technology would not solve the Irish question, it could only be solved by the UK ceding ground and agreeing, in effect, to a customs union with the EU. This was, of course, a convenient line for them to hold as it places the pressure on the UK -- and held it was until the spring of 2019, when Varadkar suddenly admitted that technology (basically blockchain) could solve almost all of the problems surrounding this “backstop” business, except for maybe the transportation of livestock. Brussels agreed — but the UK was still miles behind the curve. Yeah, Leo. Why didn’t you just admit that this intensely sensitive political, social, cultural, religious, economic and historical issue could be solved with blockchain? Coz technology IS blockchain after all. For anyone curious about the Irish border actually looks like, here’s a picture of a part of it, taken by our FT colleague Philip “Blockchain Phil” Stafford himself, on a recent visit: See? Just stick a blockchain on the other side of that stone wall there. Job done.

The French multinational said it would soon launch its Aura initiative, which it calls “the first global luxury blockchain”, although no specific dates were shared. LVMH will start using Aura with the Louis Vuitton and Parfums Christian Dior brands, it said, before rolling it out to its other houses and offering it to rivals. During manufacturing, each product will be given a unique digital code that is recorded on the Aura ledger. When a customer makes a purchase, they will in theory be able to access an online certificate that provides an entire history of their product including its origin, components, environmental and ethical information, and care instructions. The idea is that it will replace clunky and slow paper-based documentation. Many industries are looking at the possibility of using blockchain, the distributed ledger system that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The idea is that because blockchains are immutable and decentralised, the data stored on them is trustworthy and secure. In theory, the technology should help conscientious customers understand the provenance of their purchase and know it is genuine. But blockchain cannot detect whether a set of data is false: rather, it makes sure that once data has been recorded, it cannot be tampered with. Moreover, additional technology is needed to link the product purchased to the record of it on the blockchain. So while it might be an opportunity for jewellers to promote responsible supply chains, blockchain is no silver bullet. You can falsify whatever you want and put it in there — just because it is on a blockchain doesn’t make it right . . . blockchain is not able to filter for nonsense “Louis Vuitton offers a new service to its clients by unveiling the story behind their products,” said LVMH when it announced the project at the Paris VivaTech conference in May. “Every step of the item’s lifecycle is registered, enabling a new and transparent storytelling.” The company declined to comment for this article. The hope in the jewellery sector is that blockchain will give increasingly scrupulous customers a full product history quickly and efficiently. “Conscious consumerism is a mass movement under way across a number of different . . . markets, not just luxury goods,” says Leanne Kemp, founder and chief executive of Everledger, a London-based company that uses blockchain to track and authenticate the origins of diamonds and other valuable products. The company works with certification houses to create unique digital thumbprints of diamonds, which are then written on to the Everledger blockchain. It is particularly important for luxury companies and their customers to prove the provenance of their products. This is not just because they cost so much, but also due to the fact that some products, such as diamonds and gold, have been associated with unethical practices. “Tracking the supply chain generally is a hot topic,” says Rosie Burbidge, an intellectual property partner who specialises in blockchain at law firm Gunnercooke. “For LVMH in their jewellery that uses diamonds, being able to prove that those diamonds are conflict-free and haven’t been used in some sort of terrorist funding is really important.” But apart from helping to provide conscientious customers with a “life story” of their purchases — and, for the more sceptical observer, providing brands with good PR — blockchain is also seen by some as a way to combat counterfeiting that is rife in the luxury goods industry. The EU Intellectual Property Office estimates that the jewellery and watches sector loses €1.9bn in revenue each year thanks to counterfeit products. This year it launched the Anti-Counterfeiting Blockathon Forum to test and develop blockchain-based solutions for what it called the “global plague” of counterfeiting. “The problem LVMH will be trying to solve is a problem for their customers — how to prove that a specific object originated in their factory and providing a chain of title which, in the event of a dispute or suspicion of fraud, a user or investigators can straightforwardly audit,” says Preston Byrne, a specialist in cryptography and an attorney at Connecticut-based Byrne \u0026 Storm law firm. Aura, which was developed alongside blockchain design firm Consensys and Microsoft, is not the only blockchain system developed specifically for the luxury goods industry. IBM is leading a consortium of diamond and jewellery companies with a blockchain project called TrustChain, while watch company Vacheron Constantin, De Beers Group and Tiffany \u0026 Co have all launched their own blockchain initiatives to prove the provenance of their goods. While blockchain technology allows you to check information has not been altered, it cannot ensure the integrity of the information recorded in the first place. Furthermore, because it is immutable, if false information is put on to a blockchain, it will remain there in perpetuity. In other words, the technology has a “garbage in, garbage out” problem. “You can falsify whatever you want and put it in there — just because it is on a blockchain that doesn’t make it right,” says Tim Swanson, founder of US-based tech advisory firm Post Oak Labs. “The blockchain has no ability to filter for nonsense.” Recommended It is unclear why luxury houses need blockchain technology. They could give customers a product “life story” using a more straightforward tracking system that includes measures to keep the information safe, for example through standard encryption. Blockchain also cannot link the physical product to the one recorded on the ledger. Ms Kemp says other technology, such as artificial intelligence, is needed to achieve a fully digitised supply chain and to create “digital twins” of the physical products. These would then act as a reference point against which to check the blockchain information. Perhaps, by encouraging a focus on the provenance of items and looking at the best ways to tackle counterfeiting, blockchain will help in the search for solutions to these challenges in the luxury goods sector. But it might be that the technology is just another chance for brands to boast, as LVMH does, that “innovation is our obsession”.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-07-01","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/97f49f90-2735-3925-8dab-ae1a6cd8e566","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fca9fd058-5150-4dfa-b7a4-eabdf9183f5d.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"When bitcoin bros talk hard news","INTRO":"“BoJo has helped Bitcoin rediscover its mojo.”","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The crypto bros are a smart bunch. They know a thing or two about cryptography; they know how money is moved electronically across the world; and they know more than most about multiple interlocking positive feedback loops. But more than anything else, they know how to spin a “this is good for crypto” story when they see one. In our inbox this week, for example, an email with the subject line: “BoJo helps Bitcoin rediscover its mojo”, in which we’re presented with some incisive commentary from Nicholas Gregory, CEO of crypto outfit CommerceBlock, in the form of a list of short, punchy, copy-and-pastable, already-quotation-marked remarks. We prefer using quotations that we’ve got from actual conversations, so we imagine that we are in conversation with Mr Gregory. “It’s no coincidence that Bitcoin has risen as the Pound has gone south.” Umm, OK, but surely it is the very definition of a coincidence, sir? The UK only makes up a small fraction of the global bitcoin trade and FX is a zero-sum game: when the pound goes south, other currencies go north on a comparative basis. And the pound has rebounded by almost 3 per cent since you sent that email on Tuesday, while bitcoin has also risen. The correlation you allude to appears to have broken down remarkably quickly. Could you explain?  “BoJo has helped Bitcoin rediscover its mojo.” Ah, well you didn’t answer my first question but I’ll let it go. Could you elaborate on this one perhaps? The punchy quotes are nice but I don’t seem to be able to understand what on earth you are are talking about? What has BoJo got to do with bitcoin? “A no-deal Brexit, which is looking increasingly likely, could trigger a major breakout for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.” Oof, OK you’ve got me on this one -- the thought of any kind of major breakout gets me feeling all excited! But could you explain how this series of events could come about? What’s the logic here because I’m not seeing it? “If the UK leaves the EU on Halloween, Bitcoin could not just surge but gain a longer term, more sustainable momentum.” Ah right. So is this a Halloween thing? A surge AND sustainable momentum, you say? Wow. What would sustain it? “The prospect of no-deal is already wreaking havoc across major fiat currencies, but if it happens we could see an unprecedented rally in Bitcoin with a surge past $20,000 a real possibility.” I don’t meant to repeat myself, but I must make sure you realise that fiat currencies are a zero-sum game. If the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is wreaking havoc across some major fiat currencies, it will be doing the exact opposite to other major fiat currencies. So what you’re saying doesn’t actually make sense. And whence, pray tell, did the $20,000 figure come from? “An increasingly populist and politically unstable world is cementing the safe haven status of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally.” Ah, we’re back to the old idea that cryptocurrencies, those famously stable and un-hackable strings of 1s and 0s, are a safe haven. OK fine I give up now bye. By Thursday, it was time for the crypto bros to have another stab at making some news waves. It came on the back of this tweet from Bloomberg cybersecurity reporter William Turton. It’s a tweet about the US’s National Security Agency (NSA), which Turton reports is working on building quantum resistant cryptography — i.e., code containing algorithms that are resistant to attacks from quantum computers. But within a matter of hours, the tweet had turned into a quite different story in Forbes. The article has unfortunately since been deleted, but Turton did manage to get a screenshot of the story: “NASA to develop a quantum resistant cryptocurrency”. Yes, NASA. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Because sending humans to Mars and defending the planet from asteroids is kind of cool and all, but crypto! To be fair to the bros, crypto is these days more often used as an abbreviation for cryptoliabilitiesassets than for cryptography, to the chagrin of cryptographers worldwide. The second-most common use of the abbreviation is probably the faecal parasite known as cryptosporidium. So you can’t blame them for getting confused. But it does seem a little hasty to have written a whole news article, which was then followed by other crypto outlets, on the basis of a sentence of fewer than 260 characters that someone had somehow managed to misinterpret in two different ways. You could try to make this stuff up. But if you did, it wouldn’t be nearly as good.

Facebook is insisting the system is decentralised because “blockchain”. And that it\u0027s fully universal and democratic because, erm, “blockchain”. Alphaville, if you hadn\u0027t noticed, isn\u0027t so sure. Questions not yet answered include: 1) Would people banned from Facebook be able to use Calibra (the Facebook subsidiary that plans to offer payment services using Libra to users)? 2) Would people banned by Facebook — in the envisioned fully permissionless future of Libra — be able to acquire limitless nodes and thus potentially influence the network? 3) Would Facebook be free to rehypothecate assets acquired with customer deposits? And if so what risks does this pose? 4) Does anything stop Facebook from one day changing the rules about redeemability and/or the degree of collateralisation? But another central point being missed by many commentators is that as it stands Libra (and other cryptocurrency global currency replacement aspirants), are merely closed-loop systems. For a bit of background about the difference between closed and open-loop payments systems, and the reason why credit is usually preferable in the latter, see here. On that note, we\u0027d like to highlight the following points recently raised by Swift in an outline of their vision about how payments of the future should work (H/T Frances Coppola for bring this to our attention). With our emphasis: You can think of closed-loops as mini sovereign zones. Yes, payments can be quickly and easily facilitated within those zones because everyone in them is subject to the same autocratic overseer and thus theoretically the same trust base. They\u0027re great if the overseer has large reach. But the problem which eventually emerges is that, ultimately, nobody wants a market dominated by just one payments overseer who can dictate what value gets to be transferred and to whom, and what can\u0027t. Furthermore, in a free market nothing stops another entity from launching a competing closed-loop system anyway. While we can agree that competition is a good thing in that context, the problem with multiple closed-loops running side by side is that due to their intrinsic competitive nature (and different approaches to whom they let into their zones and how they manage risk within them) they don\u0027t interoperate easily. The inherent frictions between closed-loop systems (multiple sovereign states) is what brought about the need for open-looped solutions. Sticking with the sovereign metaphor, opened-loop systems engineer the illusion of frictionless transfer with effective multilateral “trade agreements” between all participant closed-loops systems in their network (which in the past included banks). The sovereignty clue was always in the name Visa. Once standard-based agreements have been forged between closed-loop “states”, all the respective members of those states can easily passport in and out of each other\u0027s zones. It\u0027s the equivalent of the free movement of people, but in money terms, based on the notion that everyone in the open-looped system is signed up to some basic common principles with respect to how they manage risk and who they are, and are not, prepared to bank. Hence why it\u0027s often difficult for challenger closed-loops systems to gain access to such multilateral transfer zones, especially if they\u0027re coming to market on the basis they\u0027ve found a way to bank people other closed-loop systems might avoid. The closed-loop/open-loop barrier exists on a national level, but it\u0027s obviously even more pronounced on a cross-border basis. That\u0027s because on an international level it\u0027s not just a varying business model that undermines the uniformity of the respective interoperating closed-looped systems. It\u0027s also law, the manner in which the law is enforced, culture, governance, tax, attitude to protectionism — to name a few. In other words, it\u0027s exactly the same sort of stuff posing cross-border costs and frictions that poses costs and frictions when it comes to free and interoperable trade. Bear that in mind with the following points raised by SWIFT (with our emphasis): SWIFT understands the political reality of why cross-border payment frictions exist. They\u0027re not technical problems, they\u0027re political problems. Facebook\u0027s Libra initiative in that context implies two very concerning things. The first is that Facebook — despite all its access to capital and talent — possibly doesn\u0027t understand the basic problem it is trying to solve. If that\u0027s the case, that suggests it\u0027s not a business worth investing in. The second — possibly more alarming thing — is that Facebook does understand this, but it doesn\u0027t care. And that\u0027s because it\u0027s objective isn\u0027t building an open-loop decentralised system, but quite plainly, getting the world at large to onboard, politically and financially, into its holistic and autocratic system.

Ripple said it made an initial investment of $30m to acquire MoneyGram shares and a warrant to buy common stock. The price, at $4.10 a share, reflected a significant premium over MoneyGram’s closing price of $1.45 on Monday. MoneyGram may also choose to have Ripple invest an additional $20m at a minimum price of $4.10 a share. Under the deal, MoneyGram will use Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency and xRapid, a platform that handles XRP transfers. “As the payments industry evolves, we are focused on continuing to improve our platform and utilising the best technology as part of our overall settlement process,” said Alex Holmes, MoneyGram’s chairman and chief executive. MoneyGram shares surged 152 per cent to $3.65 in pre-market trading, putting the stock on track to hit its highest level since November. It would also mark MoneyGram’s best single-day gain, eclipsing a 32 per cent rally on July 1, 2009. According to MoneyGram, its deal with Ripple will improve the settlement of cross-border payments. MoneyGram previously relied on foreign exchange markets to settle transfers, a process that required the company to purchase currencies in advance. The companies had an existing partnership, announced in January 2018, in which the money transfer group launched a pilot program to test the use of XRP. The new tie-up will have an initial term of two years. The agreement comes as financial services companies seek to leverage blockchain technology as digital currencies enter the mainstream.

A new blockchain-based currency, Libra, is an odd choice to change that image. Such digital assets are known for volatility and criminality. Yet the meeting of Big Tech and fintech represents a challenge to traditional banks. Facebook hopes to exploit their flaws, most notably slow and expensive transactions. There are good reasons to remain wary of Facebook, but a digital shake-up of banking is long overdue. Under regulatory pressure, Facebook is trying to reinvent itself as a private, encrypted network. Building a dedicated financial system is integral to the company’s pivot away from an open platform. Instead, it aims to offer an experience akin to what Tencent’s WeChat provides in China, combining features including messaging, photos and purchases on a single platform — but on a global basis. Facebook has billed Libra as a “stablecoin”, backed by a reserve of low-risk assets to avoid volatility. The company says it has created a new blockchain, which it hopes will support rapid transactions at a global level. A Facebook subsidiary, Calibra, will produce a “digital wallet” to store Libra coins, with the goal of the currency gaining traction in offline retail as well. A digital challenger with the clout of Big Tech is the stuff of nightmares for the old guard of finance. Facebook says that money transfers with Libra will be fast and cheap. That would undercut banks’ transaction fees, especially internationally. There may be scope here for central banks to ensure that commercial banks lower their exorbitant prices if they wish to compete with digital challengers. Libra also shows the increasing influence of blockchains in the banking industry. In February, JPMorgan Chase announced JPM Coin, a stablecoin pegged to the dollar. Yet experiments have not always yielded encouraging results. Last month, the Bundesbank said its blockchain trial had been slower and more expensive than traditional methods. It remains to be seen whether the proposed blockchain can scale up to deal with billions of daily transactions without slowing. Moreover, the system would offer Facebook access to an almost unrivalled treasure trove of financial information. Despite the company’s claims to have developed more of a conscience over how it uses data, executives have suffered negligible consequences. While Calibra has pledged customers’ account information will not be used to target advertising, Facebook’s record on this front gives cause for doubt. Recommended If the system is successful, there are other reasons to be worried. The question of whether Libra is a security or not must be answered: if it is, it will have to be formally registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Facebook will have to demonstrate, too, how it intends to combat money laundering. Without robust checks, it could become an attractive platform for criminals to move “dirty” money. Its ambition for frictionless cross-border transfers may also threaten governments, if payments increasingly take place not in national currencies but in Libra. It is difficult to accord full trust to Libra, as a project of a company whose commitment to users has been ancillary at best. Its unveiling is significant, however.

(But also: Y BLOCKCHAIN?)","DETAILED_CONTENT":"This is just one of a series of Alphaville posts on Libra coin, which we are calling Breaking the Zuck Buck, in which we will seek to show how nonsensical, pointless, stupid, risky, badly thought-out and blockchainless the whole thing is. We’ve been told that Facebook’s shiny new Libra coin is “a low-volatility cryptocurrency”, supported by the Libra Blockchain, a “decentralised, programmable database”. And at first look, Libra coin is just what it says on the tin: a cryptocurrency — or more specifically, a stablecoin — like any other. It has the characteristic “white paper”, the characteristic promises to empower people across the world, and even the characteristic handy charts to show the likely direction of the project. From the white paper: But look a little closer and you soon realise that Libra coin isn’t really a cryptocurrency at all, and that the “Libra Blockchain” — which is, notably, always written with a capital “B” — isn’t really a blockchain. What\u0027s more, it isn\u0027t at all clear why you would possibly need a blockchain, or anything calling itself a “cryptocurrency”. Given that Facebook simply appears to be trying to build a global pseudo-banking and payments network, there doesn\u0027t appear to be any good reason why you would want to do this using blockchain tokens, which as the authors point out themselves in the documents, have so far proven volatile and difficult to scale. China\u0027s social media-turned-payments giant WeChat Pay — who Facebook is surely trying to compete with on a global level — doesn\u0027t use the blockchain. Nor does PayPal. Or Venmo. Internet money doesn\u0027t need to be blockchain money. Which is maybe why Libra coin isn\u0027t really blockchain money in any meaningful sense of the word. Could it be the blockchain stuff is mainly PR . . .? Confusingly, sometimes it sounds like the white paper is almost explicitly telling us that the Libra Blockchain is not a blockchain (or not one that would fulfil the usual criteria for a blockchain). Like here (with our emphasis): To say something is something, but unlike the previous version of that something because its defining characteristics are different, is a bit like saying: “Unlike previous loaves of bread, which view the loaf of bread as a collectively baked set of ingredients, the Libra Loaf of Bread is a single ingredient structure that bakes the components sequentially over time.” Meanwhile, in the rather grand-sounding “State Machine Replication in the Libra Blockchain” document detailing the Libra Blockchain consensus, we’re given this explanation of the way the Libra Blockchain works, which seems almost contradictory to the last description (emphasis ours, again): It almost feels like several dozen people wrote these documents and (ironically) failed to reach consensus on what they were actually trying to communicate. Oh wait: Talk of decentralised structures is everywhere in the frustratingly wordy but detail-light introductory material. But one thing which can be unpicked immediately is that the system only aspires to achieve decentralisation at some point in the future. For now the unique benefits of blockchain’s “distributed governance” are only theoretical because in the first instance the Libra Blockchain will be coming to market in fully “permissioned” form, effectively centrally controlled by the founder Libra coin holders. To save costs and to introduce efficiencies even further, the Libra administrators even float the idea of archiving off data (possibly for a fee) in order to save space — something that would be considered anathema to most self-respecting fans of immutable blockchain technology. In short, most of the features that make a blockchain a blockchain don\u0027t seem to be there. But the problem with arguing that the Libra Blockchain does not actually constitute a blockchain is that — as we have pointed out before — outside of the world of the public blockchains that underpin cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, the word doesn’t have much meaning anyway. So maybe a “single data structure” can be a blockchain after all. And maybe Libra coin, a bit like Ripple (XRP) before it, can be considered a cryptocurrency even though, per the standard definition via Investopedia: Moving things along . . . with the power of Jedi mind-tricks. Another important aspect of the Libra Blockchain is Move, its new programming language. This programming language will, says Facebook, allow users to define their own smart contracts in the future. Smart contracts are agreements written in code whose clauses are automatically enforced when a set of pre-determined criteria is met. So far, at least in the decentralised cryptocurrency context, they\u0027ve proved highly unreliable. This is partly because they are written in code and not human language, which means even when they’re written by the world’s top programmers, errors can easily be introduced. But Facebook has pre-empted the human error problem by creating programming language that, somewhat incredibly, can . . . read your mind. From the white paper: What Facebook possibly failed to pre-empt, however, is that by calling its system Libra Reserve it brings to mind the Liberty Reserve, a Costa Rican-based attempt to create something similar. We’re sure this one will end much better though.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-06-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/12e6b06c-35eb-3771-822f-4ff213f27e0b","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F27013297-5c90-4b11-829d-9146a016ac2a.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The bitcoin price can finally be understood","INTRO":"Via the magic of multiple interlocking positive feedback loops, of course.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"We thought we’d seen the best chart that would ever be made in cryptoland when Imperial College London professor Andrei Kirilenko gave us his crypto periodic table last year.

The first site, you may have deduced, is satirical. You can download a “personal artist certificate” or create “your own artist statement” built using an algorithm that generates random pretentious nonsense. Here’s one I made earlier: “My work explores the relationship between Jungian archetypes and skateboard ethics. With influences as diverse as Derrida and Roy Lichtenstein, new synergies are synthesised from both mundane and transcendant discourse.” Good, eh? There’s an even better algorithm at 500letters.org/form_15, which incorporates your preferred media and themes. What this shows is that for centuries, artists, galleries and auction houses have been able to say pretty much what they like about an artist’s work and its value, without buyers having an easy way of checking its authenticity. But the second site is much more serious. It offers a chance to try out a new digital catalogue of artworks, with certificates of authenticity, built using blockchain technology that can keep it secure and updated. Here is what co-founder Philippe Gellman told me: “With our platform . . . we are putting official information in the blockchain to have a universal ledger of artists. It gives more transparency . . . the starting point of provenance is the cataloguing system.” What this shows is that, in the 21st century, buyers might at last have an easy way to check an artwork’s authenticity. Gellman set up the Arteïa platform two years ago, having been a pioneer of online stockbroking in the 1990s with Bourse Direct. Backed by the Taittinger champagne family and Belgium’s Marian art-collecting dynasty, he aims to fix the three inefficiencies of the art market, as he sees them: lack of provenance (is my painting a fake?), lack of transparency (am I paying the right price?) and lack of liquidity (why is it so difficult and expensive to buy or sell?). The platform uses blockchain technology to record all the important events in an artwork’s lifetime: such as changes of ownership, participation in exhibitions or mentions in articles. Arteïa gets artists, or their estates or foundations, to upload the information, which can then be verified by selected validators. Once on the blockchain ledger, works can be traded securely and changes in ownership recorded. This fixes the provenance problem by creating an ongoing and unalterable ownership register. It fixes the liquidity problem by providing a trading platform that lets collectors avoid the 30 per cent buyer’s commission and up to 10 per cent seller’s commission charged by auction houses. It also fixes the transparency problem, by storing the price of all of those transactions. But this disintermediation cannot happen until enough data is amassed. So far, only 70,000 works have been uploaded to Arteïa and, although increasing numbers of artists and collectors are using the platform to catalogue their works, it is up to them to decide if they will share this data. Gellman argues it will be in all users’ interest if they did. Advisers to wealthy collectors, however, suggest they may wish to be more discreet. Steven Kettle, head of client management at Stonehage Fleming, the multi-family office, argues — as a fee-based adviser would — that discretion and behind-the-scenes advice are how intermediaries add value. “Acting as gatekeepers for art collectors we, by definition, slow down the transaction process where appropriate to make space to ask the necessary questions and do the required research.” Caroline Garnham, who runs a law firm that specialises in advising wealthy families, says this is a service wealthy clients are happy to pay for. “These collectors tend to build strong relations with their broker or art adviser, and fees on the whole are not an issue.” Her own preferred specialist, Guy Jennings of The Fine Art Group, suggests a blockchain art ledger can only go so far. “New technologies in development, intended to solve complications of provenance in a future art market, will only be as good as the information received from the real world,” he says. A new ledger can only go in one temporal direction, too. “It won’t be able to fill in existing and persistent gaps in old provenances, so it’s not a panacea for art of the past.” Indeed, it may never be able to establish the provenance of rare 1980s works by an artist recently mentioned at 500letters.org/form_15: “M Vincent creates performances, paintings, films and conceptual artwork. Using written and drawn symbols, a world where light-heartedness rules and where rules are undermined is created. Associations and meanings collide. Space becomes time and language becomes image.” But at least you can own one of these works for just £50. Cash preferred, no bitcoin.

The work is in its early stages but Facebook has published documents revealing ideas for the currency and some heavyweight partners. Many of the details will be hashed out in the coming months. Here is what we know so far. Libra is a new global digital currency based on technology created by Facebook. The plan is for a new Swiss-based non-profit foundation, comprised of 100 private sector and civil society members with equal voting rights, to launch Libra in the first half of 2020. Facebook said the design of Libra would allow individuals to store, spend and transfer money with close to zero transaction fees. Libra is partly targeted at the $613bn annual market for cross-border remittances. “Just as people can use their phones to message friends anywhere in the world today, with Libra, the same can be done with money — instantly, securely and at low cost,” Facebook said. The digital coin will be backed by a reserve of low-risk assets including bank deposits in various currencies and US Treasuries, which will prevent its value from fluctuating too wildly. Members of the foundation will initially validate transactions and the reserve will be held by a “geographically distributed network of custodians”. In the white paper, the Libra Association’s members said it was “important to note” that the structure meant “one Libra will not always be able to convert into the same amount of a given local currency”. Individuals and merchants with Libra accounts will be shown the current value of their holding in traditional money on their screen. Facebook said any company could build a “wallet” to hold Libra. Its own service will be a subsidiary called Calibra, which will be integrated into Facebook’s family of apps and will also be available as a standalone app. Calibra will partner with “authorised resellers” of Libra, cryptocurrency exchanges and liquidity providers to help people change money into Libra seamlessly within the apps. The company would “try to negotiate the most advantageous” exchange fees for customers when they are transferring fiat currency from their bank account into Libra online, it said. Facebook said it hoped the service would also appeal to 1.7bn “unbanked” people around the world. Kevin Weil, head of product at Calibra, said the company hoped to partner with local businesses such as convenience stores where people could hand over cash and load Libra directly on to a mobile phone and vice versa. “They have a scanner and you have a QR code on your phone. That’s the way you physically would do it in a store,” he said. In the longer run, Calibra said it hoped to offer users additional services, such as “paying bills with the push of a button [or] buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code”. Other initiatives targeting the unbanked include the many mobile money platforms such as M-Pesa, which lets users transfer money by mobile phone in Africa; Aadhaar, a government ID system that brought hundreds of millions into the banking sector in India; and Mastercard’s digital identity scheme, which hopes to repeat that success globally. Yes. Facebook hopes that some of the consumer-facing companies that have been involved in funding the project — such as Spotify and Uber — will integrate the cryptocurrency into their systems. What this will look like exactly is unclear. But David Marcus, the former PayPal president who will now head up Calibra, said the blockchain technology would allow for microtransactions — tiny online purchases. In the case of Spotify, this might mean users are able to pay a couple of cents to listen to a song, for example. “Now you can start doing microtransactions . . . I think a whole range of new models can emerge when that is possible,” said Mr Marcus. Alex Norstrom, chief premium business officer at Spotify, said: “One challenge for Spotify and its users around the world has been the lack of easily accessible payment systems — especially for those in financially underserved markets.” Payments Mastercard, PayPal, PayU, Stripe, Visa Tech and consumer Booking Holdings, eBay, Facebook, Farfetch, Lyft, Mercado Pago, Spotify, Uber Telecoms Iliad, Vodafone Blockchain Anchorage, Bison Trails, Coinbase, Xapo Holdings Venture Capital Andreessen Horowitz, Breakthrough Initiatives, Ribbit Capital, Thrive Capital, Union Square Ventures NGOs Creative Destruction Lab, Kiva, Mercy Corps, Women’s World Banking Mr Weil said Libra had to be a cryptocurrency or you “inherit the fees and the existing structures that today keep billions of people unbanked”. Until today, however, digital currencies have only appealed to niche enthusiasts. But the heft of the partners involved, and Facebook’s belief that its new technology can scale to accommodate billions of daily transactions, give Libra a chance of becoming widely adopted. Facebook said it would not require the huge energy needed to “mine” bitcoin and that transactions would be far faster. But its success will also depend on how it is used by the crypto and wider business community. The Libra blockchain is open source, meaning any developer or company can build applications on it, whether or not they are founding members. The network will be governed by a Geneva-based independent non-profit association called the Libra Association. This will initially be made up of 28 groups, including Uber, Lyft, Spotify, Mastercard, Visa, eBay and PayPal, to name a few. While Facebook has led the project so far, it hopes that 100 “diverse” members with equal rights will run the foundation. Potential candidates must meet two of three criteria including having a market value of $1bn or holding more than $500m in customer balances, having a global reach of more than 20m a year, or being recognised as a top 100 industry leader for example in the Fortune 500 or similar ranking tables. Recommended There are exceptions for smaller crypto-focused investors and blockchain companies who will be committed to driving mainstream adoption, as well as social impact and academic groups. In the longer term, Facebook plans to shift the model away from being a so-called “permissioned” blockchain run by several players, to being “permissionless” and a fully decentralised one run by anyone with the technical capabilities, as was the original vision of bitcoin. It wants to begin this transition within five years of the public launch. While Facebook will be firming up its exact charter for governance over the next two months, it is proposed that there be a simple majority for most decisions by the council, and a super majority — two-thirds of the votes — for big policy decisions. Members must commit to paying $10m, at least, to operate a “node” of the blockchain, although they can invest more. They must also agree to help promote the ecosystem and push for mainstream adoption. This money will go towards covering the operating costs of the association and creating a pool of incentives for adoption that merchants, developers and wallet providers will receive. Facebook said it would also conduct a private placement of securities, “available only for a select group of accredited investors” to jump-start the project, but would not give further details. In the longer term, interest yielded from the reserve, invested in low-risk assets, will go towards covering operating costs, as well as paying out dividends to members. Cryptocurrencies are a loosely regulated space, where rules vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are still evolving. Facebook has already started talks with regulators such as the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission to discuss the impact of its project and whether it will fall within the scope of its remit. In the US, securities laws regulators are also paying heightened attention to blockchain projects. It is unclear whether Libra would fall into the category of a security, which would require formal registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, payments processors need licensing in most jurisdictions in which they operate and this can sometimes take years. Mr Weil said Calibra would be a regulated entity and was “in the process” of applying for money transmitter licenses. Facebook will also need to reassure watchdogs, including central banks, that it can undergo stringent anti-money laundering checks and prevent fraud. Mr Weil said Calibra users would need to submit government identification to sign up to use the wallet and that automated systems would be in place to detect fraud. Facebook has said that given the sophisticated technology behind the coin and the diverse members running separate nodes, a big hack is unlikely. Still, the Libra Association will “work to prepare responses” to potential attacks from hackers, including temporarily halting the processing of transactions in the case of a big breach. Recommended Users may be also wary of handing over personal financial information in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Calibra has said it will not share account information or financial data with Facebook or any third party “without customer consent”, and that user data will not be used for targeting adverts. While WhatsApp and Messenger would know that an individual was using Calibra, they would not be able to see transaction information, said Mr Weil. In the longer term, users’ financial data could be used to help Calibra sell other financial products to users, he said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hannah Murphy","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-06-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/abd7ba0b-40ef-3876-857c-cd5d49ec557e","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F7e75c677-0c1e-4fc4-bf33-48270ea82862_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"SegWit and the bitcoin transaction fee conspiracy theory","INTRO":"Nearly two years after the introduction of a coding fix called SegWit intended to help scale bitcoin, transaction fees collected by miners are on the rise again...","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Bitcoin was supposed to make finance cheap and accessible. But then in 2015 the network got jammed (mostly with spam, not real-world transactions) and transaction fees began to spike. The mystery of who was spamming the network was never really solved. But the whole thing seemed calculated. Some believed it was initiated by powers who wanted to push bitcoin\u0027s scaling limitations to the forefront of developer agendas. But nobody could be sure. Either way, fees kept soaring, peaking in 2017 at impractically high levels (who can justify paying for a coffee with bitcoin if the transaction fee is more than $10?). It was about this time the technology\u0027s champions began to change the rhetoric surrounding bitcoin\u0027s key selling point from that of a cheaper and more efficient payments system to dependable (albeit ironically erratic) store of value and unbeatable record-keeping system. But then something changed. Fees began to fall: Some attributed the 2018\u0027s dramatic decline in transaction fees to the growing adoption of the segregated witness (SegWit) fix, which was rolled out in mid-2017. As the Wiki notes, as of February 2018, over 30 per cent of bitcoin transactions were using the SegWit fix. But the rollout didn\u0027t come without drama. The proposed fix ignited deep divisions in the developer and mining community between those who believed bitcoin\u0027s scaling issue should be resolved by increasing the permissible amount of transactions in bitcoin blocks, and those who believed alternative fixes like SegWit and the secondary layer solution it enables, the Lightning network (LN), were more efficient. The spat eventually spawned an offshoot of bitcoin called bitcoin Cash. This differentiated itself from the core coin by remaining committed to bitcoin\u0027s role as a cheap and accessible medium of exchange. But fees are creeping higher again . . . Looking at historical data, it\u0027s hard not to conclude bitcoin transaction fees are just as much influenced by bitcoin prices as network traffic. Which makes sense. The two influence each other. But many wallet services also offer default fee settings in terms of satoshis (ie the micro units of bitcoin). As the price of bitcoin rises so too does the fee, unless it\u0027s adapted to a percentage rate of the transaction price by the user, creating a self-enforcing feedback loop. In that context, it\u0027s fair for us lay people to ask, what did SegWit really achieve aside from buying time before transaction fees began to explode further? What is SegWit really? One prominent critic of the SegWit and the associated Lightning network fix is Satoshi Nakamoto identity-claimant Craig Wright. He is currently chief scientist at nChain, a group which supports yet another version of a medium of exchange focused bitcoin, called bitcoin SV (for Satoshi Vision), which launched in November 2018. He made some worthwhile points to Alphaville. First, the real purpose of SegWit wasn\u0027t really to free-up block space to lower transaction fees but to enable the rollout of the Lightning Network. The impact SegWit had on freeing up capacity was simply a convenient byproduct. What\u0027s Ligntning? It\u0027s the system that attempts to solve the scaling limitation by diverting as many transactions off-chain as possible. It does this by establishing trusted bilateral channels of repeat custom, which are policed privately through bonded arrangements in code. In conventional finance terms, it\u0027s akin to a private bilateral netting system that only squares when it has to (notably, when imbalances or risks get too extended). It does this with underlying bitcoin collateral transfers. Traditional financial practitioners would probably describe it as another form of shadow money banking and shadow money creation: precisely the sort of thing bitcoin was supposed to put to an end. If you think that sounds awfully like the conventional financial system before many of its worst practices were regulated out of existence post 2008, you\u0027d be right. As it stands, acting outside of new AML, KYC, risk and capital rules is becoming increasingly hard in the bitcoin ecosystem because key service providers — in a bid to popularise bitcoin for the masses in properly regulated jurisdictions — have had to align themselves with legacy regulations to avoid being shut down or penalised. Lightning in effect introduces a regulatory workaround by reducing the amount of bitcoin entities need to process within these monitored systems. Under Lightning, the vast majority of transactions occur in private bilateral channels and are likely to be scrutinised by no one other than the parties concerned. A key issue preventing Lightning\u0027s mass roll out, however, was the costly way it would have to deal with a well known bitcoin bug called malleability. SegWit was predominantly introduced to resolve this. As stated before, the fact it became associated with a block-size constraint solution was incidental. But there\u0027s another dimension to the tale. According to Wright, the Lightning system appeals to those who want to keep extracting value out of bitcoin without creating onchain logs, a practice which helps to obscure transactions and keep the system out of the regulatory net. In so doing one of bitcoin\u0027s key attributes — its ability to deliver a permanent record of signatures which can\u0027t be tampered with — is compromised. “Bitcoin is not anonymous and cannot be anonymous. There are people in Core who want to create a system that does not maintain logs. Hence SegWit,” Wright told Alphaville. He added: Put this way, he has a point. Any dependence on a separate external system is tantamount to a trusted relationship, which defies the whole logic of arguing the world needs to turn to bitcoin because third parties are untrustworthy. It\u0027s no coincidence Wright adds that Lightning started to be developed just after the Silk Road dark market arrests happened. It was then, possibly, that nefarious entities realised bitcoin — being an immutable evidence trail — could actually be used not just to facilitate criminality but to prevent it, upping the urgency for a workaround to be developed. The mysterious network spamming that allowed such ethos-compromising proposals to be linked to scaling solutions, meanwhile, started about six months before the official Lightning white paper was released. Bitcoin and Lightning technical communities would argue Lightning is just a more scalable protocol for instant retail payment, which would support more bitcoin use cases and adoption. Nonetheless, isn\u0027t that a fun conspiracy theory?

Nothing typified the madness better than the craze for initial coin offerings meant to fund software projects that promised to revolutionise everything from online gaming to file storage. Maybe you invested. More likely, you intuited something was awry when your Uber driver started asking for crypto recommendations and a friend began touting a blockchain-based ledger designed to track marijuana supply chains. ICOs birthed a thousand millionaires before asset prices plummeted in late 2018. Now as bigger players such as Facebook start to enter cryptocurrencies, regulators at the US Securities and Exchange Commission are having to grapple with the problems caused by these investments. So far, the watchdog has focused on bringing ICOs under its traditional regime of disclosure-based investor protection rules. But my research with David Wishnick into the ICO market reveals some disquieting facts. The central innovation in ICOs rests on the possibility of using computer code to deliver on contractual promises. So we surveyed the 50 offerings that raised the most capital in 2017 and asked a simple question: did the promoters deliver on their promises to protect investors through computer code? We specifically compared the promises promoters made in their offering documents with the actual function of the cryptoassets they delivered. We audited each coin’s smart contract, the automated “if this, then that” rules coders design to govern cryptoassets. We found that most of the offerings promised forms of investor protection that the code did not deliver. Take the issue of supply. An investor in a given cryptoasset needs to know that a promoter cannot simply print more, inflating away its value. In more than 20 per cent of ICOs in our sample where cryptoasset supply restrictions were promised, we could not observe restrictions hard-coded into smart contracts. More starkly, in 25 of the 36 ICOs where promoters promised to impose restrictions on insiders selling assets and walking away, we could not find those restrictions in the code. Finally, we found 12 offerings where the code allowed a central party to modify the way the smart contract worked, but only four of them disclosed that ability in their promotional materials. Even if the SEC does expand its regulatory umbrella over ICOs, its ability to police against fraud will be limited by resource constraints; and it is not clear that private class-action lawsuits can pick up the slack. Moreover, these offerings are truly global, allowing promoters to switch jurisdictions, seeking lighter regulation. That means the market will be largely left to police itself. But our analysis found no evidence that investors punished firms for failing to put investor protections into code. Even today, crypto rating agencies look at code only to check that it is protected against hackers. We found no sign that they tried to match code with investor protections. That task is left to individual investors, who are expected to read, and understand, smart contracts. This is a hopeless enterprise. It is well documented that few people read the “click I agree” user contracts they encounter online, and the same is true for smart ones. Regulators need to step in. Here are two simple suggestions. We should require ICOs to guarantee a match between the key promises made in marketing and code. Or we should demand that promoters provide plain-English translations of principal code elements. Such market integrity measures won’t just protect investors, they will also build trust in the asset class itself and enable it to move from a curiosity to something of real economic worth.

An aide to Santorum told the New York Times back in 2005 that Santorum was “a Catholic missionary who happens to be in the Senate”, and his comments on homosexuality and same-sex marriage once spawned a campaign for the neologism “santorum”. Now, he\u0027s backing a project that combines his religious fervour with another area of modern-day fanaticism: blockchainism (thanks to Buttcoin and in particular contributor David Gerard for drawing our attention to this). Santorum is sitting on the advisory board of a company and soon-to-be digital coin (stablecoin, specifically) called Cathio. The company describes itself on its website as “a new payment, remittance and funding platform which provides efficient, secure, and transparent movement of funds within the Catholic world”, promising to provide a “turnkey solution for Catholic organizations to bring their financial transactions into alignment with their beliefs”. Santorum\u0027s son-in-law happens to be the company\u0027s CEO, so it\u0027s not hard to see how the former senator might have got involved. But there are some other big hitters on the board too, including former US ambassador to the Vatican Jim Nicholson, and former head of the US Mint Ed Moy, who also happens to have been an adviser for “bitcoin IRA”, an investment fund that encourages people to put their retirement savings into crypto (what could possibly go wrong, etc). Also on the board — and co-founder of Cathio — is Cameron Chell, chairman of ICOx Innovations, the company that ran Kodak\u0027s infamous “Kodakcoin” ICO, which managed to raise less than 7 per cent of its target. Santorum, unfortunately, wasn\u0027t available to talk to us, though he did say the following in a press release: We did get through to Cathio CEO Matthew Marcolini, however. We suggested to him that Cathio sounded a bit like Venmo for American Catholics, which he said he guessed it was, but that most churches and other Catholic organisations didn\u0027t accept Venmo. Cathio, which since the firm\u0027s inception in January 2018 has signed up four “early adopters” — including the Christian college Marcolini attended — reckons it can be more widely accepted. We can see why the Church might want to find a digital way of accepting donations in an age when younger people are carrying less and less cash, even if the barrier to adoption for Venmo — lack of scale — seems like it might be the same for Cathio. But we weren\u0027t clear on what the point of using a stablecoin or blockchain-based system was. Marcolini first told us: We suggested to Marcolini that the problem with this “permissioned visibility” was that some of the faithful might want to keep their donations anonymous. Indeed, Christians are told in the first and second verses of the sixth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew to “be careful not to perform your righteous acts before men to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.” Marcolini agreed with this, but said: Trying to identify wrongdoers while keeping everyone else\u0027s donations anonymous still sounded a little difficult to us, we said, at which point Marcolini told us: So again, why blockchain? There didn\u0027t seem to be a real answer, though another issue with Venmo is that it is owned by PayPal, which supports Planned Parenthood. Marcolini said this was “antithetical to what the church teaches” so Cathio would provide a way for Catholics to donate money using a company aligned with Christian values. Cathio really is all about giving. Apart from giving financial donations, users can also give ratings to Catholic organisations on Cathio: With some of us on Alphaville having been brought up as Catholics ourselves, we couldn\u0027t help feeling that all of this seemed a little... uncatholic. Cathio is a for-profit company that plans to charge a transaction fee for donations — a “very minimal fee” of close to 2 per cent — and its advisory-board-members all own shares in the company (we weren\u0027t told how many shares each adviser was allocated, but Santorum is being given a “few more shares” than others because he was helping with the company\u0027s fundraising). Apart from the contradictions between keeping donations anonymous — as per the teachings of the New Testament — and being able to “ask where the money\u0027s come from”, there\u0027s also the issue of usury (ie the lender making interest, which is effectively what charging a fee on a stablecoin transaction amounts to). But history repeats. During the Renaissance period, the Medici — a Florentine banking family which supplied no less than four Catholic popes to the Vatican — managed to get around laws against usury by coming up with a bill of exchange, which allowed merchants to transfer money easily across borders and to skirt currency controls. As one Izabella Kaminska wrote on her personal blog back in 2013, this was effectively the 15th-century equivalent of bitcoin. We might think of Cathio, then, as an attempt at setting up the modern-day equivalent of Medici-coin. But big-hitter-backers or not, we highly doubt Cathio will get the kind of traction that allowed the Medici family to become one of the wealthiest families in Europe.

DAH, previously fronted by Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan Chase executive credited with pioneering the market for credit-default swaps, had promised to revolutionise finance by applying the distributed ledger technology backing cryptocurrencies to activities such as trade clearing and settlement. Instead, DAH is ramping up its focus on smart contracts, which use similar code to that used in automated transactions such as direct debits and standing orders. Any blockchain-enabled financial settlement system is likely to be highly dependent on smart contract technology. The shift comes as Germany’s central bank expressed doubts about blockchain’s potential, relative to existing technologies. “The market is evolving to a place where we see the ledger platform becoming a place that is going to be very difficult for us to compete in,” a spokesperson for DAH said, adding the group had also recognised that customers were fearful of being locked into any specific platform. Ms Masters had told bankers in 2015 that blockchain was analogous to “email for money” and that the world should be “taking this technology as seriously as you should have been taking the development of the internet in the early 1990s”. She stepped down from her position as chief in December 2018 for personal reasons, stirring concerns that blockchain’s promise may struggle to live up to expectations. She remains a board member, adviser and investor in the company. Other notable departures from the company over the past six months include Stewart Cowan, brought in last April to oversee DAH’s development of a blockchain-based clearing and settlement system for the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and Gavin Wells, the former LCH executive who was its head of Europe. A hint that DAH was edging away from blockchain came in April when the company announced it would be making its smart contract language, known as DAML, easier to integrate with rival blockchain platforms such as Hyperledger. DAH’s chief Yuval Rooz stressed the company remained committed to blockchain but confirmed that increasing standardisation across the industry had started to commoditise the business, challenging the potential to generate revenue from blockchain alone. “We are focusing on where the value is for us, as well as where we think we have an immediate advantage with DAML,” he said. In a surprise move, policymakers recently poured cold water on the capacity for blockchain technology to revolutionise trade processing. Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann told a symposium in May that tests run with Deutsche Börse, Germany’s largest exchange, had shown the technology was sometimes slower and more expensive to use. “A real breakthrough in application is missing so far,” he added. The ASX, which has invested more than A$20m in DAH, said its project to upgrade its domestic settlement system using Digital Asset Holdings’ technology remained on track.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Izabella Kaminska Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-06-07","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/db411873-ef8c-39d8-910a-0cc065127b37","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fa56956f9-b718-4640-b044-2be9e7584afb_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"FSB warns tokenised liquidity could be illusory","INTRO":"Decentralised fintechs are making big promises about liquifying illiquid assets with tokenisation. But are they alert to the associated risk?","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The FSB is out with a report this Thursday on the financial stability, and regulatory and governance implications, of decentralised financial technologies. It provides a thoroughly balanced picture of the associated pros and cons of what is becoming one of the widest spread trends in the financial sector. On one hand, it notes, more decentralisation could improve stability by leading to greater competition and diversity, while reducing the systemic importance and risk of some existing entities. On the other hand, it also notes, more decentralisation could heighten the degree of procyclicality in decentralised risk-taking while introducing all sorts of new uncertainties concerning the determination of legal liability and consumer protection. It might also make recovery and resolution of decentralised structures more difficult. Which is all very fair and logical. But there\u0027s one additional risk identified by the FSB that probably deserves closer attention. It pertains to the perception that tokenisation -- the act of representing physical or intangible assets in digital form on blockchains -- can magically liquefy illiquid hard-to-value assets. Tokenisation, if you haven\u0027t heard, is gearing up as a standardised mechanism for providing access to the ownership of traditional assets by representing them in digital and programmable form on public or private blockchains. It is particularly being applied to illiquid assets in the belief that the collective digitisation and unitisation of the underlying asset can make it more tradeable. But as the FSB warns, (our emphasis): In other words, we\u0027ve been here with financial engineering and securitisation before. From the sound of it, the FSB isn\u0027t entirely convinced that just because something is tokenised and tradeable on the blockchain, its liquidity can\u0027t be dangerously overestimated by the market. Two other notable extracts being: And more interestingly still: All of which suggests the idea tokenisation can magically engineer frictionless liquidity for all sorts of assets and in so doing reduce risks, ignores the degree to which new risks may be introduced as a consequence. New risks include the complexity of key management, which exposes the system both to new frictions and capital loss risks, as well as the dependence of tokenised systems on the very human limitations of software developers, which exposes the entire system to coding mistakes, bugs and hacks, as well as uncertainties about who is ultimately accountable when things go wrong.

The UBS-led research on a “utility settlement coin” (USC) has been in the ether since 2015, when banks decided to investigate whether wholesale banking could be made more efficient by deploying distributed ledger technology (DLT). DLT, which is used in blockchain networks, enables participants to instantly share information on an open-access ledger which can never be altered or erased. The technology could theoretically replace reams of paperwork and processing, but banks must first confront legal and regulatory hurdles on everything from risk management to privacy before deploying it widely. “When we started out . . . this project has basically been about R\u0026D, we didn’t know if the characteristics [we wanted to achieve] were possible,” said Rhom Ram, head of Fnality, the new venture into which the banks and exchange Nasdaq have just invested £50m to create a market infrastructure to transfer value digitally. “The funding signals that it is possible,” he added. “The investors believe it is possible based on the evidence they have seen.” Recommended Hyder Jaffrey, head of strategic investments at UBS’s investment bank, said the research showed the USC would soon be used for clearing and settling trades and could ultimately prove “transformational” for trading. “We see a way of actually reducing the risk significantly in the post trade world,” he said, referring to the settlement, credit and counterparty risks banks take on between the time that trades are instructed and when the money and assets actually change hands. “All of these things play into costs, operational efficiency and the balance sheet.” Lee Braine, an executive at Barclays’ chief technology office, said his bank’s confidence in the project’s viability had “meaningfully” increased since it joined the effort a year-and-a-half ago. Other big banks involved in the project include Santander, BNY Mellon, MUFG, Credit Suisse, KBC, ING and Canada’s CIBC. The USC will begin life with 14 owners and members, and will be denominated in major global currencies including the US dollar, yen, euro and sterling. Every unit of a dollar-denominated USC will be backed by a traditional dollar at the Federal Reserve, and the same model will be used with other currencies, ensuring the value of the coin is stable. Its initial applications will be in relatively niche areas, such as creating a market infrastructure that allows the coins to be used to meet margin requirements in derivatives trades. Mr Ram said while at present it took at least a day for such requirements to be satisfied, using the USC the process could become almost instantaneous. Mr Braine said that while the size of the founding banks meant their efforts would have “traction” from launch, the impact would not be a “big bang”. “This ultimately is a market transformation over time,” he said. Japanese banks are also working on a digital coin — the J Coin — but they are focusing on retail banking, as is social media giant Facebook, which is developing a coin pegged to the dollar which could be used to instantly transfer value between Facebook users.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Laura Noonan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-06-03","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/5ec32986-1872-3828-9f67-465019d97044","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fd8e34b7b-894d-4065-bc83-e96cbc97a948_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How blockchain takes us back to medieval times","INTRO":"History teaches us that when credit systems are replaced with payment systems, economies are starved of liquidity.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The marketing spiel about blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) often promises to liberate financial institutions from the costly burden of having to pledge billions of dollars in margin to clearing houses on the basis that trades complete instantaneously, meaning counterparty risks are eliminated. But this, according to a new report by Greenwich Associates\u0027 Ken Monahan, is a wrong-headed way to think about things. Monahan, who in other respects is quite complimentary of DLT, notes that in most cases those savings arguments are moot. This is because what real-time gross settlement of securities offers with one hand it simultaneously takes away many times over with the other hand in terms of pre-funding costs. This, incidentally, is a point the FT\u0027s Philip Stafford has made to FT Alphaville in conversations around the hypothetical FT water cooler ever since the industry started going mad about the potential of DLT. Or as Monahan puts it: Using DTCC as an example, real-time clearing could theoretically save $8bn in reserve funds. But what that also means is that all participants would have to pre-fund (or even over-fund in a volatile market) all prospective trades fully before being able to execute them. There are two issues in play here. One: in a DLT real-time framework all trades become bilateral rather than multilateral, which makes the savings from margining impossible. Two: in a DLT real-time framework there is no netting. As a result the system requires all transactions to be fully funded on a transaction by transaction basis. According to Monahan that takes the system back to the era before the New York Stock Exchange Clearing House enabled marketwide net settlement in 1892. But that\u0027s not even how far back in time DLT takes us. Even in 1891 an investor could secure a call loan against shares during the day it took to settle them, says Monahan. This is impossible to do with instantaneous settlement. You simply cannot use shares you have yet to transact as collateral for a loan. Thus trades not only have to be pre-funded, they need to be pre-funded on an unsecured basis. Consider the relevant mechanics thusly (from the report, with our emphasis): All of which takes us not just back to 1891 but to 1584, when the Venetian Senate decided to require pre-funding of all trading done via the Banco di Rialto following the collapse of the Venetian banking system due to the bankruptcy of a number of merchant houses which had used aggressive and high-risk ledger accounting techniques. Problem is, the Senate\u0027s solution soon began to choke the entire economy. Here\u0027s the story via Monahan (our emphasis): Which is another way of saying: be careful what you wish for. DLT is in effect, an extremely narrow banking model. It\u0027s not clear at all if that is desirable for an expanded and globalised economy that depends on credit extension at every commercial interaction point.

We\u0027re still not sure that was a good way to warm up the crypto crowd). Two of the panelists had the audacity to wear bitcoin socks. They hadn\u0027t even co-ordinated their outfits. They were just wearing bitcoin socks. In 2019. This felt bullish. The conference itself was also quite buzzy (albeit in the typically slightly unhinged crypto way). One of the offensive-sock-wearing panelists, from crypto exchange Kraken (who was also wearing a #reckless cap) decided to tell the audience, after we\u0027d said a few times that we didn\u0027t think exchanges were doing enough to protect consumers, that \"bitcoin IS consumer protection\". This, unlike our comments about the paradox inherent in the panel\u0027s title, seemed to go down very well with the crowd, who broke out into rapturous applause, and then continued to do so at every word the young offensive-sock-and-cap-wearing panelist uttered. When the panel was finished, the \"chief growth officer\" at Binance, generally thought of these days as the world\u0027s biggest crypto exchange (although it\u0027s hard to know for sure because the entire economy is Fyre Festival and exchanges make up report their own volumes), was mobbed by fans wanting selfies with him. It was almost like bitcoin was... cool again? But yet, outside of this surreal crypto conference and the even more surreal #cryptotwitter-sphere, nobody seemed to be talking about it. We know it\u0027s a bit of a basic -- in the modern sense of the word basic -- move to paste Google search trend charts into articles (particularly because TEEIFF) but here\u0027s a Google search trend chart pasted into an article (for worldwide searches for bitcoin over the past five years): As you can see from the chart, interest in bitcoin has crept up a little in the past month or so, but not that much. Nothing like it did in 2017. But if you look at a chart of the bitcoin price, things do look a bit like 2017 (screenshot from CoinMarketCap, which aggregates the prices across several exchanges): Bitcoin hit as high as $13,850 last Wednesday, having surged about 75 per cent in the space of two weeks. It\u0027s now fallen sharply again-- it\u0027s trading around the $11,000 mark at pixel. But that still represents an almost quadrupling in the price since the start of the year. So what gives? Could it be, as some have claimed, because of the great invention that is Libra? Well that might be helping a bit on the margins, just because it\u0027s helped to get \"crypto\" back in the headlines, but it\u0027s not the main thing going on here. As we have pointed out many times now, Libra is neither a cryptocurrency nor decentralised and neither does it run on a blockchain. Also, bros at crypto conferences might be getting excited at numbers going up, but the retail interest -- from the kind of people who might have got drawn in by \"crypto\" headlines in 2017/18 -- just isn\u0027t there this time. Or could it be that old chestnut about bitcoin being a \"safe haven\", as Chinese media declared it to be towards the end of last week? Er, no. Bitcoin shows basically no correlation with \"risk-off\" market episodes and is also neither safe nor havenish. Ben Munster of crypto site Decrypt wrote an article last week that offers some clues as to what in the name of Satoshi is going on. Because the other thing that has happened over the past month or so is that almost $1bn worth of Tether, the original \"stablecoin\", has been printed. Its total \"market cap\" now at about $3.6bn, having almost doubled since the start of April. This, of course, is the same Tether that is being sued by the New York Attorney General\u0027s office for allegedly using its reserves to cover up $850m of funds on sister exchange Bitfinex. Munster\u0027s piece explains in detail how huge orders of new Tethers are made by \"whales\" (AKA a small group of big-money traders) just before the price starts to go up, and then dumped onto exchanges. But the particularly noteworthy thing about the piece is that the person innocently doing the explaining is Will Harborne, founder of Ethfinex, a subsidiary of Bitfinex, which is being sued alongside Tether by the NYAG. (Coincidentally Harbone was also one of the people on our panel, though obviously as an ETH bro he was one of the two not wearing bitcoin socks.) From the piece: With that in mind, here\u0027s another chart that looks a little different to 18 months ago -- one from Blockchain.info, showing bitcoin trading volumes in dollars (the big spike is in late 2017/early 2018): According to Blockchain.info, about $417m worth of bitcoin was traded on Friday on the main dollar-based exchanges. Which sounds decent until you notice that about $37bn worth of Tether was traded on Friday, according to CoinMarketCap. A post published on Medium late Friday, by Sussex University Professor Carol Alexander and PhD student Michael Dakos goes into some more detail, and features a nice chart showing the supply of Tether versus the bitcoin price over the past few months: Bitcoin blogger and Attack of the 50-foot Blockchain author David Gerard indicated to us the manipulation of bitcoin via Tether is so obvious that it\u0027s an insult to tulips to compare bitcoin to such phenomena: We have contacted Tether and Bitfinex for comment and will update this story if and when they respond. In the past, Bitfinex representatives have insisted to Alphaville that the expansion of tether supply is entirely linked to authentic buying interest. In some cases, however, tethers are also originated into reserves in anticipation of demand as well.

It can be watched here. Written by crypto-enthusiast Graeme Moore, the book is, in his words, “for kids, and not for kids”. The kids he refers to are presumably children, and the not for kids those grown adults who still dwell in their mom\u0027s basement, ranting about how fiat is a several-thousand year old fad. The book, as many children\u0027s books do, has an alphabetical format. For instance, “L”, stands for “distributed ledger”. So without further ado, here is Alphaville\u0027s own crypto ABC: A is for accountability — an unknown term in the crypto-verse. B is for blown — as in, “I\u0027ve blown all my money”. C is for centralisation — which is always going to be quicker and cheaper than blockchain. D is for divorce — for when your better half finds out what your savings are invested in. E is for Excel Spreadsheet — which is just as good as a blockchain. F is for Federal Reserve — the overseer of the true stablecoin. G is for guru — a Twitter crypto trader whose financial experience equates to a week\u0027s work experience as a teller two decades ago. H is for HODL — what you say when you\u0027ve lost your wallet password. I is for illiquid — when there are no more Tethers being printed that day. J is for joke — as in, “the joke\u0027s on you”. K is for KYC — see “accountability”. L is for Luke Wilson — a humble man using a luxury exit coin to supply fresh water in Africa. M is for money printing — which is exactly what crypto is doing. N is for net present value — see “accountability”. O is for oligarchy — the new bankster mafia. P is for pump and dump — crypto\u0027s raison d\u0027être. Q is for queue — the laborious wait to shift $0.42 between accounts. R is for robbed — the eventual status of every crypto-exchange. S is for the SEC — regulators who don\u0027t understand crypto assets are a new currency for raising capital for unrealised commercial ventures, and not securities. T is for terrorism — an often willing counterparty on crypto trades. U is for UX — of which there is none. V is for V-shaped recovery — predicted after every fall. W is for wallet — the easy to remember sequence of 34 alphanumeric characters. X is for ex — what you\u0027ll call your better half in six months. Y is for yurt — what you may end up living in. Z is for zero — Bitcoin\u0027s technical support. Of course, if Moore wanted to be true to the concept, a Bitcoin ABC book should involve showing the baby the letter and getting them to make random noises, only moving on to the next page when they get the right one.

This was because Wright had been “granted” a copyright registration for the bitcoin white paper and the bitcoin source code by the US Copyright Office. According to them, this was the “first government agency recognition” of Wright as Satoshi. He hadn\u0027t been endorsed at all, in fact. But fact doesn\u0027t matter when \"number go up\". And number did go up. A lot. Bitcoin SV — the version of bitcoin that Craig and his pals are pushing and have a big financial stake in — more than doubled in the space of about 75 minutes after the announcement, and has almost doubled again since then. Take a look at this three-month price chart (screenshot from coingecko.com): As we explained at the time, the copyright registration was in fact nothing to do with US government recognition. There is no special “granting” of such a registration; you are merely given it once your application has been processed. Furthermore, the US Copyright Office does not investigate the identities of people applying for copyright — it doesn\u0027t have time to: about 600,000 official endorsements copyright registrations are recorded every year (which works out as about 2.300 every working day). If there is more than one claim on a given work, multiple registrations will be recorded. And whaddya know? Another claim of copyright for the bitcoin white paper was indeed registered at the US Copyright Office on May 24, by a Chinese citizen going by the name of Wei Liu: Given that Wright and his men had spun the “granting” of a copyright registration for the bitcoin white paper as official endorsement, you might have thought they might like to backtrack a little at this point, or at least try to say they had in fact misunderstood the way in which US copyright registrations work. Not so much. Without addressing the question of whether this rather undermined his claims of official government recognition, Craig Wright told Alphaville, via email: When we responded to the email, asking whether Wright now recognised that a US copyright registration did not constitute endorsement, we simply got this response: It wasn\u0027t immediately clear who “this Wei Liu” was. There was some online speculation that Wei Liu was a former employee of crypto exchange Bibox, who has reportedly been sued by the company for alleged embezzlement and extortion. Which would have been fun, not just because of the embezzlement and extortion, but because that Wei Liu is a woman (highly unusual in the brodom of cryptoland). But crypto news site Coindesk quickly put a stop to that story, revealing that Wei Liu was in fact the CEO of Coinsummer, a crypto market research firm (we checked with Coindesk that they are sure about their sourcing on this. They said they are.) From Coindesk: Liu is right that anyone can register a copyright, but Wright is, er, right that submitting false information to the US Copyright Office — which is part of the US Library of Congress, a federal agency — constitutes a crime under the US Copyright Act. Prosecutions, however, as Wright and Liu are probably aware, are almost unheard of. Violations are normally punished with a $2,500 fine -- hardly a very big deterrent for wannabe Satoshi Nakamotos. Wright\u0027s team — specifically Jimmy Nguyen, the CEO of the company Wright works for and a close “amigo” — had also claimed that Wright had been given some kind of special treatment in terms of processing times for this copyright registration, telling us at the time (emphasis ours): Given that Wright made his big announcement on May 21, and Liu managed to get his copyright claim registered three days later, it seems that three business days is not so extremely unusual and extremely fast after all. It turns out, in fact, that Wright had paid the US Copyright Office $800 for “special handling” of his claim (which means the office expedites the request). The US Copyright Office (which very rarely interacts with or responds directly to the press) said in a statement: That came from the office\u0027s “press updates” page, under the excellently titled: Regarding Further Questions About Certain bitcoin Registrations. As David Gerard has pointed out, the press updates page is new: it was created on May 22, 2019. Dusty bureaucratic institutions getting sassy. We like.

On Tuesday, it was time for Craig Wright to prove he was bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto again. This time, it was via the “granting” of a copyright registration by the US Copyright Office — for the Bitcoin White Paper and the bitcoin source code. According to Wright\u0027s people, this is a big deal. From a spokesman (emphasis ours): Thing is though, it\u0027s nothing of the sort. The US Copyright Office, a unit of the Library of Congress (a federal agency) does not “recognise” authors of given pieces of work. The “granting” of a copyright registration is standard procedure; the office does not investigate the identities of people registering for copyright. The claimant, however, in making the application is certifying to the US government that the information he or she is submitting is truthful. From a Copyright Office statement sent to us on Wednesday afternoon (emphasis ours): In fact, more than one person can make a claim to have copyright of the exact same work, and the Copyright Office will happily register those multiple claims. From the office\u0027s statement, again: It doesn\u0027t cost much to register either: a piece of writing like the Bitcoin White Paper would normally cost the applicant $55. If it\u0027s extremely obvious that this is a false claim, the Copyright Office can refuse a registration application. But that requires the Copyright Office to be certain that the person claiming to be an author of a given work is not in fact who they say they are. If, for example, Alphaville wanted to register ourselves as the musical geniuses (or not) behind The Beatles\u0027 Yesterday, we might get a refusal. Proving a negative, however, is more difficult. Given that there is no consensus on the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the Copyright Office cannot be certain that Craig Wright is not Satoshi. But they are certainly not saying that he is. From the Copyright Office, again: These copyright claims, in other words, have been registered like any other claim. The Copyright Office double-checked with Craig Wright that he was indeed saying he was the author of the works, but did not attempt to verify these claims (as that is not its job). Wright\u0027s people aren\u0027t backing down though. In a statement to us late on Wednesday, Jimmy Nguyen, CEO of the Craig Wright-founded nChain, told us (emphasis ours): Exceptionally notable stuff. Also, the registering copyright of the source code doesn\u0027t protect the intellectual property of bitcoin as an invention (you would need a patent for that). Copyright protects only the expression of a creative work. From the US Copyright Office\u0027s website: But ultimately, none of the above really matters. Whatever you think about Craig Wright\u0027s claims to be Satoshi, the “official recognition” line had a big impact on the price of the version of bitcoin that he is pushing, Bitcoin SV (“Satoshi\u0027s Vision”). And we all know that price is really all that matters in cryptoland (however much the bros will try to tell you it\u0027s about the technology). In the space of 75 minutes on Tuesday, the cryptocurrency mooned from $61.76 to as high as $139.31 — a more than 125 per cent price jump. It was trading just above $101 on Thursday. Here it is over the past seven days (via CoinMarketCap): You pump, you dump. Simples.

It\u0027s quite possible he never read a prospectus.” And now Alphaville says: “If George Orwell had ever read an ICO white paper or blockchain press release, he may have lost the will to live.” Blockchain may not (yet) be political. But the scale of language abuse across the sector is already off the scale. A fantastic recent example comes by way of Jaguar Land Rover\u0027s April 29 press release announcing that Jaguar drivers will soon be able to earn cryptocurrency as they drive. As an exercise in the black arts of media persuasion and the utilisation of language for the purpose of misdirection — giving the impression that an entity is doing something innovative and valuable, when really it\u0027s not — it was genius. The impact of the release across the media space was decidedly one presenting the service as a fait accompli. Jaguar, in other words, will be or is already integrating crypto payments into its services, as far as the press is concerned. See here: But sources close to Jaguar tell us nothing could be further from the truth. To the contrary, the press release was allegedly motivated by a last-ditch effort to draw some sort of value (a.k.a. temporary buzz) out of an otherwise failed investment. The source added, if one was to go through the press release carefully one would soon discover it was phrased very cleverly to give the impression that Jaguar was committing to a crypto service when it actually wasn\u0027t. This is exactly what we did here. (See our observations on the right). The lack of any sort of commitment is evident throughout. Armed with these findings we contacted Jaguar for more information about the details of the extremely vaguely presented “Smart Wallet” initiative. Here are some of their replies: When we put it to them that vehicles equipped with smart wallet functionality can\u0027t really be properly tested without being part of a wider system of tolls, shops and data services also testing the exact same smart contract system, their reply was: When we asked Jaguar if it was true that the press release was motivated by anotherwise failed blockchain investment, possibly an ICO, they noted: Which seems a weirdly specific way to word a sentence. One piece of relevant context is that in October 2017, Coindesk reported that a blockchain startup called DOVU, funded by the venture arm of Jaguar Land Rover, had raised roughly $6m in an initial coin offering (ICO). This project was aiming to build a platform through which users would be paid with \"DOV\" tokens for the submission of their data. Jaguar tells us that investment, despite its similarities with the current smart wallet announcement, was entirely separate. Make of that what you will. Our interpretation either way is that it\u0027s very unlikely Jaguar will be bringing a smart-wallet-enabled earn-cryptocurrency-as-you-drive offering to the marketplace any time soon. *References to George Orwell, who also famously said you should \"never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print\", should be used sparingly. But we have an excuse: Alphaville has just relocated (along with the rest of the FT editorial team) to Bracken House, named after our highly esteemed founder Brendan Bracken, who just happened to be the BB that George Orwell based the character of Big Brother on.

The group will focus on developing modern electronic ledgers for financial markets, and settles, records and verifies payments in central bank money rather than cryptocurrencies. While some blockchains use ledgers available to all users, Setl uses a so-called “permissioned ledger”, which allows a small network of trusted parties to see the details of trades and payments. It entered administration in early March after it was unable to maintain the regulatory capital that was needed to sustain two businesses it had been developing — ID2S, a central securities depository, and Iznes, a record-keeping platform for European funds. Quantuma were appointed administrators. The newly formed Setl Ltd has bought the operating assets, the staff and intellectual property rights of Setl Development, the previous company that is being wound down. It has also sold its stakes in ID2S and Iznes, but did not identify the buyers. Sir David Walker, author of the Walker Report, a review of corporate governance in UK banks, has been named as chairman while Christian Noyer, the former governor of the Bank of France, will be the lead independent director. Both served on the board of the previous company. Talking about the old Setl, Sir David admitted: “We thought the case would be seen as compelling but users weren’t ready to put their hands in their pockets to contribute to regulatory capital.” “Now we will provide the tools to the infrastructure companies,” he added. The new company has reached agreement with all its major clients to continue their support and it expects to push ahead now with a number of core initiatives, Sir David said. The sale of the stakes would be part of the funding for the new company, he added. Many of Setl existing management will be shareholders and founders of the new company.

Bots and the bitcoin debate","INTRO":"For sceptics, bot activity will be further evidence of cryptocurrencies’ failings","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Last year, I took part in a noisy public debate about whether bitcoin is a beneficial innovation — or the opposite. It was an eye-opening experience: almost as soon as the event was posted online, I was trolled by furious cryptocurrency fans and critics alike. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, I concluded, arouse a level of passion rarely found within finance. Their detractors are convinced that the entire concept is a fraud; their evangelists are equally certain that cryptocurrencies are the future. Both sides may be right, depending on timing. Presently, cryptocurrencies seem to be marred by intellectual contradictions. Why does anyone think, for example, that crypto is a good payment mechanism or store of value when transactions are clunky and the value of a bitcoin has swung from $20,000 to $5,000 in the past 18 months? But I also recognise that the underlying blockchain technology is potentially very useful. It is entirely possible that future historians might see bitcoin as the MySpace of cryptocurrency — a pioneering product that was flawed but eventually replaced by better versions of the technology. However, if you want to get a less emotional view of these issues, consider a fascinating study of crypto trading that has just been conducted by an eight-strong team of computer scientists based at institutions including Cornell Tech, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Illinois in Urbana Champaign and ETH in Zurich. Their research set out to determine whether trading in cryptocurrencies is fair when it takes place on decentralised exchanges (DEXes), where individual traders cut deals directly with each other in a relatively transparent way, without a central authority. Before the study, it might have been expected — or hoped — that these venues were indeed pretty fair. After all, the whole point of cryptocurrencies is that they enable “miners” to create “money” and for it to be priced in a peer-to-peer manner with a permanent digital record. Central banks, governments and other institutions are not involved: call it digital people power. It is true that shady things have occurred when cryptocurrencies have gone on to exchanges: just last month, for example, a computer analytics group called The Tie calculated that “87 per cent of exchanges reported trading volume was potentially suspicious, and that 75 per cent of exchanges had some form of suspicious activity occurring on them”. But cryptocurrency advocates argue that the gains from democratising money outweigh such apparent abuses. However, when the researchers started tracking the DEXes (six of them, over 18 months) they had a nasty surprise: they found that the networks have become infested by computer bots, operating alongside the libertarian humans who are meant to populate them. More specifically, some unscrupulous miners and traders have apparently created these bots to anticipate and gain from others’ everyday trades by gaining advantages in the platforms’ information flows, enabling them to siphon off millions — or even billions — of dollars a year in profits. “Like high-frequency traders on Wall Street, these bots exploit inefficiencies in [DEXes], paying high transaction fees and optimizing network latency to front-run trades,” the research paper declares. “We observe bots competitively bidding up transaction fees in order to obtain priority ordering.” Translated for the lay reader, what this means is that some ruthlessly aggressive traders are finding ways to grab data on the deals that other investors are trying to cut — and then jumping ahead of them to take advantage of the prices. To be fair, crypto is not alone in this respect. As Michael Lewis’s book Flash Boysexplained a few years ago, high-frequency traders have been using bots to front-run other investors in the equity world for several years. Moreover, the scale of this bot activity is probably still small when viewed against the wider financial system. Nevertheless, there are two reasons why this tale is striking. First, it shows the difficulty of ever trying to build a truly democratic marketplace — with bitcoin or anything else — in a world of accelerating (and unequal) computing power. Second, it also shows the challenges of cleaning up this corner of finance. Thus far, regulators have shown little sign of being heavy-handed in their crypto regulation, preferring to rely instead on the principle of caveat emptor. Besides, very few crypto enthusiasts are asking for regulation (partly because they tend to dislike government intervention in any form). But can a fledgling product such as bitcoin truly flourish if there is no external oversight? Can investors find a way to clean up their marketsthemselves? Right now it is unclear. However, the next time you meet a crypto evangelist, point out the odd story of the blockchain bots — or direct them to the webpage that the researchers have provided, which tracks the bots in real time. If nothing else, it should spark more debate — and possibly another bitcoin row.

Especially when it comes to chart crime. Last April, $2m was raised in an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for a crypto token called Thor, which promised to \"fix the gig economy\". But as of last week, the project is no longer. Thor CEO David Chin announced its closure in a post last week, citing \"many regulatory challenges...that prevented us from achieving what we set out to in our white paper\". The idea of Thor, according to the aforementioned white paper, was to give temporary workers access to the kinds of benefits normally reserved for permanent employees, like pension plans, healthcare, and parental leave. All via the unique magic of the blockchain and \"tokenomics\". By April, the crypto market had taken a big dive from the dizzy heights of late 2017 and early 2018, and the idea that you could put your money into literally any ICO and the token would automatically go up in price had run out of steam. About a third as much money was raised in April as had been raised in January, according to tracker site icodata.io. So raising $2m in this market wasn\u0027t bad. You might think that some time was taken in producing the white paper -- the document ICOs use to flog their mystical ledger-beans. Not so much. Here\u0027s the first graph in it (shout out to Eric Turner, research director at industry site Messari Crypto, for drawing our attention to this chartological crime): The white paper also contained other stuff that it clearly took a considerable amount of time to come up with, like this, in the table of contents (Why is G for Gig?) The $2m the company says it raised has been reported as $21m across other media sites, but the company insists that\u0027s wrong, adding that the money \"turned into $1M during the crypto bear market\". The crypto market actually had a surge in April, in the weeks after the ICO, so the company would have had to keep most of the money in crypto to support the claim that the money they raised halved in value. But that would seems a little odd, given that presumably they would have actually had to spend some of it (most of it was raised in NEO tokens, so highly un-spendable). And it sounds like they indeed did spend it, given that there is now no money left.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-04-15","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/87ae3010-61ec-11e9-b285-3acd5d43599e","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F59f00ca4-6442-11e9-b809-6f0d2f5705f6?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"JPMorgan to widen use of blockchain system","INTRO":"Platform aimed at tackling compliance issues to be used to validate payments","DETAILED_CONTENT":"JPMorgan Chase is to widen the use of the industry’s leading blockchain technology to help smooth the banking industry’s payment system while also inviting fintechs to experiment on how to develop the platform. The expansion of the Interbank Information Network (IIN), which enables banks to share information on a mutually accessible ledger, comes after 75 of the world’s biggest banks joined the venture last year. The platform already allows banks to quickly resolve compliance issues that can delay payments by weeks. They also hope that by making the global payments rails run more easily they will be able to better defend their cross-border-payments business from the rise of digital payments providers such as TransferWise, Revolut and Ripple. The banking industry generally has cooled on the potential of blockchain technology to revolutionise the industry, but JPMorgan’s head of global clearing, John Hunter, said development of the IIN continued apace with plans to expand its functions. More than 220 banks have now signed up to the original service of allowing data sharing on payments over network so that errors can be resolved quickly. “The initial use case was around sanctions screening,” he said. “Now we’re looking at the ability to do more at the point of settlement.” Mr Hunter said JPMorgan has developed a function that would verify in real time that a payment was going into a valid account, removing the potential of it being rejected days later because of an error in an account number, sort code, address or other aspect of the transaction. “Banks straight through processing rates are in the mid-80s to the mid-90s. It’s that gap — the 5 to 20 per cent of payments — that have to be assessed by operations where we’re trying to alleviate some of that pain,” he said. The system will be live in by the third quarter, for both domestic and international payments, though JPMorgan expects it to be more useful for international payments, where error rates are higher. The IIN is also setting up a sandbox for fintechs to use the network to “develop and put out applications”. The testing environment, which JPMorgan expects to launch in the third quarter, will offer developers building blocks such as secure messaging, document file transfer and data modelling. “This removes many challenges and hurdles — tooling, ecosystem, data, environment, etc,” said Mr Hunter. “Developers only need to bring their intellect.” Recommended The IIN’s services are currently free, but it may eventually offer both paid for and commercial applications, with banks picking and choosing what they use. “Banks replicate a lot of the same infrastructure over and over again,” said Hunter. “There’s no reason banks wouldn’t deploy a utility type service with the network.” Emma Loftus, head of global payments and receivables at JPMorgan Treasury Services, said the network’s long term ownership also “depends on how it rolls out”. “It needs to be an ecosystem that’s supportive of the industry,” she said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Laura Noonan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-04-21","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/6411aaff-dd80-382f-ab1c-80cae225673d","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Faa4d12f1-c15d-4ff2-884c-f1763609cf60_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"SEC must solve its cryptocurrency custody conundrum","INTRO":"Too much regulation may stifle innovation but too little will put Main Street investors at risk","DETAILED_CONTENT":"As blockchain technology grows in popularity, the US Securities and Exchange Commission faces a conundrum: how should it regulate the safekeeping or custody of a digital asset owned by an investment fund or managed account? To solve this puzzle, the regulator has to reconcile decades-old laws with new and inherently risky technology. Too much regulation may stifle innovation but too little will put Main Street investors at risk. Doing nothing is not an option. Current law requires mutual funds to deposit securities and similar assets in a vault or other depository belonging to a bank or trust company. Registered investment advisers must also maintain client assets with a qualified custodian. The law stops short of specifying how a custodian bank must safeguard, or maintain custody of, a client’s assets. Distributed ledger technology such as blockchain presents a novel challenge: how can a custodian, or an auditor, be certain that the custodian actually has possession of a digital asset? In theory, the answer is simple. To prove ownership of a digital asset, such as bitcoin, you must have both a public key and a corresponding private key. The public key appears as a string of digits representing a unique transaction that is added on as a block in a chain of other transactions. The private key, however, is a string of digits that is intended to be kept secret, a sort of electronic bearer instrument. Whoever has the private key can transfer a digital asset immutably and potentially anonymously to anyone. The SEC’s challenge is to ensure that such digital assets cannot be stolen or misappropriated. The answer may involve a combination of physical and electronic solutions, and some creative legal thinking. Some banks assert that they have developed platforms and procedures to keep digital assets safe. These may include holding digital assets in an offline wallet rather than on an exchange, requiring multiple electronic signatures to obtain access to the private key and keeping the private key on a computer in a physical vault — without an internet connection — to prevent criminals hacking in. As there is no single answer to what kind of security is sufficient, the SEC should take a balanced, practical approach. It should not try to prescribe specific technological standards because what is appropriate for one custodian may not work for another and today\u0027s state-of-the art requirements may become rapidly outdated. Regulations should require custodians to embrace technology that is sufficient to provide adequate security, coupled with robust and ongoing testing, similar to how financial intermediaries test for the adequacy of cyber security protections. The SEC could also treat all — or certain categories of — digital assets as securities solely for purposes of the custody rules, without determining whether they are securities that must be registered for sale. This approach would provide some certainty on the application of the custody rules. This would be welcome as some senior SEC staff have suggested that some digital assets that are securities may morph into non-securities and vice versa. Bitcoin, for example, is generally thought not to be a security, but certain non-fungible tokens, such as CryptoKitties, may morph into securities depending on how their functions change over time. The SEC could also establish robust standards for safekeeping programmes. These could include internal control reports and compliance testing. It could also consider a backstop that would involve special capital requirements or a form of third-party insurance to protect digital assets. But the SEC will never be able to eliminate digital asset fraud, just as it cannot eliminate other forms of theft. No matter how many protections are required, the first time that a bad actor empties the digital wallet of an investment account, everyone — including the press and Congress — will point fingers at the SEC for failing to require sufficient safeguards. Yet, by considering novel regulatory approaches adapted to the risks inherent in digital assets, educating investors, holding market participants to high standards and vigorously prosecuting bad actors, the SEC has the power to nurture technological innovation while still protecting Main Street investors.

The San Francisco blockchain payment company wants to connect stuffy old banking with the brash world of cryptocurrencies. Tie-ins with the likes of Santander and Barclays confer respectability. Ripple’s digital currency XRP gives it kudos with crypto hipsters, even if its value has dropped from $3 to about 30 cents. Fans of the start-up hope it does not need to “hodl” (hold on for dear life) for a rally like investors in bitcoin, which is enjoying a modest bounce. XRP is meant to have a legitimate function in greasing the wheels of Ripple’s payment system. The lingering question is whether XRP is necessary. If not, the market worth of $14bn quoted by Coinbase looks high. Particularly when global financial messaging service Swift reported revenue below $1bn in 2017. Ripple’s cart is ahead of its horse. The company must prove it has a business model involving XRP that justifies the market value of the token. Investment in XRP has run ahead of its practical deployment. Ripple hopes its new xRapid service will change that. This uses XRP as a bridge between normal currencies for cross-border payments. Ripple says this will bolster liquidity and shorten transaction times from days to seconds. That should reduce foreign exchange risk. Large banks seem to prefer using Ripple’s xCurrent system This lets them message, clear and settle transactions quickly. It does not require XRP. JPMorgan Chase’s decision to barge into the same space is a problem for Ripple. Having once dismissed bitcoin as a fraud, chief executive Jamie Dimon has launched the bank’s own digital currency, called JPM Coins. These are exchanged within a closed network and are pegged to the dollar. The US bank has the muscle to extend the use of JPM Coins, albeit that some rivals will be wary. Ripple is a digital native.

Blockchain, the antidote to all the world\u0027s greatest ills, is once again being trotted out as a solution to Brexit. The last time, you might remember, it was our dear Chancellor of the Exchequer, Spreadsheet Phil himself, who decided that the distributed and supposedly immutable version of the humble spreadsheet was “the most obvious technology” to tackle... oh just the incredibly complex and sensitive Irish border question. And amazingly (although also somewhat predictably), our Phil wasn\u0027t the first to suggest such a thing. There have been whole papers written about a blockchain for Brexit; countless column inches dedicated to the fanciful idea. This time, it\u0027s the turn of an “internet pioneer” and CoinDesk advisory board member Pindar Wong, who penned an op-ed entitled “Is it time for a blockchain Brexit?” (cc Betteridge, Ian) that was published on CoinDesk, a crypto news site, on Monday. But where our Phil lacked detail (admitting that he was no “expert” on the matter), Wong has us covered. He starts powerfully; passionately; provocatively: Wow, yeah. He totally caught us out there. Clever. He carries on: With less than four days to go until we (maybe) leave the European Union, the idea that we might be able to break the current deadlock by having a quick rethink of the very things that separate each of the world\u0027s polities from one another seems a bit of a stretch, but maybe the cryptographic certainty thing can help? No. Really very much no. Cryptographic certainty is the idea that by hashing down a set of data (like, for example, bitcoin transactions) and sticking that on to a block that is part of a chain of other blocks (blockchain!), thereby encrypting it, we get mathematical certainty that this hash represents that particular set of data and the order the blocks are in is the correct one. So it gives us a kind of finality about the records of that data. But the problem is not finality of the records of data. Unlike bitcoin transactions, which are just strings of numbers moving around the internet, actual matter needs to cross borders. People. Stuff. With lives. Homes. And hugely varied perspectives on political matters. There were some nice takes on Monday that derided Wong\u0027s op-ed, like from Jessica Klein in Breaker Mag who rightly pointed out the dangers of just throwing tech at problems without considering the real ethical dilemmas underlying them: And Yessi Bello-Perez in The Next Web, who wrote: They\u0027re both absolutely right in showing contempt for such ridiculous, excessive techno-solutionism. But where they don\u0027t go quite far enough is that they that don\u0027t point out that blockchain, as we and others have said before, is a particularly crappy and incoherent technology (and this is understandable; they are after all writing for pro-tech, pro-blockchain news sites). If a mistake (whether deliberate or not) is made at the point that data representing real-world stuff is put on to a blockchain, there is no going back, because blockchain is an append-only database. If the person creating the code (which in Wong\u0027s vision would automate the payment of tariffs) makes an error in that bit of code (easy to do), we have ourselves a big problem. And if we\u0027re talking about blockchain in the context of a centralised system where data can be overwritten and changes can be made, so that these problems could be overcome, what\u0027s the point of it in the first place? Blockchain throws up all sorts of new questions and problems and it\u0027s therefore a particularly crappy idea to be throwing it at such a particularly crap-strewn spectacle as Brexit. The thing is though, the more this idea gets bandied about, the more the blockchainers expose the ridiculousness of their other ideas. Where an open-minded and uninformed reader might have (wrongly) bought into the idea that a blockchain can help combat the illegal fishing of tuna or ensure clinical trial integrity, they are likely to draw a line at the idea that blockchain can in any way solve a problem as intractable as Brexit. Or for that matter, solve the utter lack of any form of consensus in Parliament. And that, for nocoiners/blockshamers like us, is the beauty of the blockchain for Brexit idea. It\u0027s so obviously not a technology problem, but rather a political, societal, historical, cultural, ethical and economic one, that the idea that a flimsy bit of tech can come in and solve it seems, frankly, preposterous. And that means that the credibility of the blockchain for other things gets chipped away at. (The blockchain for Brexit idea also reminds us of the delightful “blockchain for Bloxwich” report put forward last year by Tory backbencher Eddie Hughes, which we felt served a similar purpose.) As for Wong, though, it\u0027s all quite simple. The obvious answer to all of this is not only the blockchain, but also the chainers\u0027 favourite new partner-in-crime, the stablecoin (a cryptocurrency pegged to a central-bank issued currency): Someone is painfully wrong on the internet.

That\u0027s the starting price in an eBay auction for all the documents, all of the branding, all of the strings of 1s and 0s, and all the broken dreams of an initial coin offering (ICO) that never managed to sell a single token. And yet, the prospective buyer is told: (STO meaning securities token offering. Which is completely different from an ICO, you understand, because it\u0027s called a securities token offering.) Below is the eBay listing (right-click to enlarge): We called up Ivan Komar, the founder of the rather wonderfully named “Sponsy” that is now selling itself off. We asked him why the project, which he founded two years ago when he was just 19, hadn\u0027t worked out. Apparently unwittingly, he managed to sum up all that was wrong with the Great Crypto Bubble of 2017-2018 with his answer: Komar acknowledged that the lawyer\u0027s advice was probably the right advice from the customer\u0027s — or token-buyer\u0027s — point of view, but not from the point of view of raising money. So what would Sponsy have done differently if they had the chance again, we asked? Instead, rather than launching in late 2017 when “this crypto craze bandwagon” was in full swing, Komar waited until summer 2018, by which stage, he says, the “market had vanished and nobody was interested in our offer”. So even though there is no market for ICOs, or at least not for his ICO, Komar is hoping his eBay auction will attract an “enterprise client” with a big blockchain R\u0026D budget — he suggested Bosch — or an individual who wants to try to launch an ICO into the non-existent market. Or just someone who wants to start a sponsorship platform that has nothing to do with blockchain or crypto. Komar told us: Again Komar — without necessarily realising it — had managed to rather nicely encapsulate the speciousness and incoherence of the ICO bubble. All Sponsy requires to function is a “typical, centralised server”, and yet its tagline is: “Decentralised Sponsorship Platform”. The eBay listing also contained some other potentially attractive promises to prospective buyers, such as: Aside from the fact that it seemed a little odd to be selling any kind of preapproved investment documents, this seemed good! Which investment bank had approved the project, we wanted to know? At that point Komar, who is Belarusian but seemed to speak perfectly decent English, appeared to get in a bit of a twist: The \"British firm\" that Komar was referring to was a Poland-based firm called Memorandum Capital, which lists various \"contact\" addresses in different countries on its website. On its LinkedIn, the company says its head office is a residential address in Manchester where 132 other companies\u0027 offices are also listed, according to Companies House Data. It is not an investment bank, or a law firm, but a company that helps companies launch crypto tokens. There seem to have been some other translation errors in the eBay listing, too, like: Here\u0027s the latest tweet: To be fair to Komar, at least he sought a lawyer\u0027s advice before launching an ICO. Props must also be given to his lawyer, who told him he\u0027d go to jail if he tried to flog tokens before he had any semblance of a product. We\u0027re not sure why he thinks someone else would now want to buy this business idea, though, when he himself has given up on it. Komar reckons $60,000 is a “very low amount for the product we are offering. The ideal amount would be $200,000\". Offers so far, with four days to go: zero. Watchers: also zero.

There was no better example of this doctrine in action than the liberalisation of the California power markets, beginning in 1996. And yet, as is often the case, things didn\u0027t turn out as expected. Rather than encouraging prices to fall as larger numbers of smaller-scale middlemen competed for business (encouraging producers to respond to higher prices with more production), deregulation instead encouraged providers to withhold supply until prices got even higher. All this was exacerbated by the fact that many entities were still committed to fulfilling retail contracts at fixed prices, even as daily prices began to fluctuate enormously, allowing them to be ruthlessly gouged by new entrants. One of the key lobbyists for this sort of deregulation — and a new entrant into the market when it was opened up — was Enron. At the time, the group was becoming extremely well-known for its innovative financial thinking, especially with respect to the creation of new and abstract markets like weather securities and other wholesale risk products. But Enron was also becoming well-known for gaming markets for its own benefit, especially the newly liberalised Californian market, which it began to ruthlessly exploit at the cost of the state as a whole. In the end, Enron became a powerful rent-seeking middleman in its own right, making a mockery of the dream of decentralisation. The group, of course, went bankrupt in 2002, following the revelation of mass accounting fraud. The inquiries into the rolling blackouts at the peak of the Californian energy crisis that followed concluded that a market approach for certain utility services like electricity would always be inherently gameable and vulnerable to exploitation by new types of rent-seekers and middlemen. Bear that story in mind when looking at the following perceptual map: It\u0027s from the “introduction deck” of a crypto company called the “Bank of Hodlers”, which depicts itself as getting top marks for ease of use — leaving traditional banks in the dust, as you can see — and also for decentralisation. But this, we\u0027d argue, is contradictory. How can something calling itself a bank — the primary purpose of which is to be a trusted entity that can look after people\u0027s money for them — call itself decentralised? It may exist within a decentralised network of banks, but with respect to its own structure, a bank by definition exists as a centralised go-between, not a headless decentralised organism. Its whole raison d\u0027être is to be a middleman. The crypto sphere, however, is convinced that decentralisation can rid the world of such middlemen forever. And yet, in order to function, so-called “decentralised assets” such as bitcoin or other digital tokens rely on countless points of centralisation in order to be usable, like wallet-providers, exchanges and specialist crypto-custodians. The idea of the decentralised “trustless” network is thus proving a fallacy. Blockchain does not eliminate trust; it just shifts it about and grants it to entities that have no history of being trustworthy, often with disastrous consequences. But far be it from us to pour scorn on the idea of a decentralised bank — which actually isn\u0027t actually a bank at all, as we will see — without getting the perspective of the Bank of Hodlers first. So we called up Naveen Mishra, the company\u0027s “head of partnerships”, who told us the following: The above implies two assumptions by Mishra. One, that by removing executive function and human oversight from an entity the said entity magically becomes decentralised. Two, that core banking is so centralised that the positioning of any new entity even slightly further up the decentralisation spectrum is a win for customers and consumers. What the view ignores, however, is that conventional banking, just like the power market, is no stranger to liberalisation and decentralisation efforts. These have been going on for generations. As have, for that matter, efforts to automate the industry and make it increasingly headless — to the point, today, that algorithmic black boxes have replaced human traders and robo-signers have in the past even replaced human credit evaluators. The problem is, just like with the California example, every time deregulation, decentralisation and automation has taken foot in the financial world, bad things have tended to follow. Most of the time what is revealed is that middlemen or rent-seekers weren\u0027t actually eliminated or disempowered, but rather regenerated into new forms. Meanwhile, where algos took on the responsibility for human judgments, they were easily gamed, and introduced all sorts of new risks into the system. Those bad things then justified the return of regulation and the effective reformulation of human-overseen processes that “recentralise” the industry. Banking, in other words, has always sat on a centralisation spectrum. Currently, with initiatives like “open banking”, the spectrum is veering back towards decentralisation. It\u0027s also veering towards the build-up of wholesale systems serviced by competing entities within a structure that still commits incumbent utility-type banks to certain restrictive regulations. Even as these new competitors — free of many of these restrictions — aggressively eat their lunch, potentially putting the core utility infrastructure at risk. In the BoH case, the pitch is to “create a decentralised bank”, which apparently will one day have some infrastructure that runs on “a decentralised back-end”. But what does that actually mean? And why is it supposed to make banking services better? Historically, one could argue, decentralisation always failed when entities forgot that the successful provision of core utility services was as much about reliability and accountability as price. People expect their core infrastructure providers to be robust and dependable. If and when they fail, they also expect processes to exist that can hold people within the organisation to account. A DAO, or Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (made famous by the blow-up of an entity of the same name on the Ethereum blockchain in June 2016) does exactly the opposite. It obscures both responsibility and accountability, due to its lack of executive (centralised) leadership, like a zombie body without a brain. But that doesn\u0027t stop Mishra being a believer about the potential of a DAO system: So what BoH currently amounts to is an enterprise (can you even call it that?) that oversees decentralised assets, but which eventually wants to become a decentralised autonomous entity when the \"legal structures\" are put in place. But how can it? A decentralised company is an oxymoron. In order for the BoH to become one it would have to cease to exist. Back to basics on funding BoH\u0027s original plan, as laid out in the white paper as well as the introduction deck, was to raise money for the project via an initial coin offering (ICO). But they\u0027ve decided not to do an ICO for the time being because they\u0027d rather take the now apparently innovative step of building a product first. (That nobody can make any money that way any more or because concerns are mounting that the SEC may come down on them like a ton of bricks is, allegedly, not a factor.) Apart from the ICO and a magically “dividend paying utility token”, many of the other ideas laid out in the white paper and on the company\u0027s website have also been dropped, such as insurance against crypto theft. (Too difficult to do, for now, apparently — they would have to “solve further technical problems” first.) The only thing the BoH is actually going to do, for the time being, is to allow HODLers of Ether (Ethereum\u0027s native cryptocurrency) to use their HODLings as collateral for loans, at a leverage rate of 1.5 per cent, to borrow from other BoH users in a kind of crypto peer-to-peer lending system. The HODLers can borrow either in crypto, or in the lovely centralised stuff that is real, spendable, fiat money — if they want to pay a 7.5 per cent fee for the privilege of doing so (on top of the borrowing fee set by the lender). The BoH says it won\u0027t take any fees for now (though it website says it will), because like all for good modern companies, market share is more important than profitability. So how do you raise money for a crypto project these days if not by ICO? Apparently it\u0027s back to old school methods like “the equity route”. Mishra says the company has managed to raise $500,000 so far from angel investors in India. But given that the introduction deck and white paper (both of which include a “road map” featuring the ICO and the crypto insurance stuff) was the only documentation available to review the offering, we wondered what information these investors had been given before they gave their money to the company. Mishra says the content shown to investors was being updated, and that he “would like to reconfirm that we have pivoted and are building a financial services product for digital assets starting with crypto assets”. So as it stands BoH has raised money for a decentralised bank that is nothing like a bank, and is not doing anything remotely decentralised beyond allowing people to use “decentralised assets” as collateral on P2P loans. (As we all know, P2P lenders mostly mutate into more centralised banking structures eventually due to scaling forces endmic in the industry ). But they do say they\u0027re “democratising access to capital”. As regards to who they are targeting? On that basis, we can assume the revolution will be decentralised, but only for as long as it\u0027s expedient for it be so. Given regulatory attention and growing investor scrutiny, it\u0027s arguably ever less so. So maybe the lessons of Enron and the attempted decentralisation of energy markets weren\u0027t completely wasted. The fact that the Bank of Hodlers has been forced to “pivot” away from the original “Hey, we\u0027re building a decentralised bank, give us your money for magical tokens” idea suggests that the actions of regulators — namely the SEC — are having some effect. The mythical allure of decentralisation is not dead yet — Enron executives after all are reportedly looking at blockchain closely — but it\u0027s clearly dawning on the Bank of Hodlers at least that it\u0027s more of a pipe dream than they realised.

Two of the businesses that Setl has been developing are ID2S, a central securities depository, and Iznes, a record-keeping platform for European funds. To satisfy regulators, companies involving in market infrastructure also need to hold significant regulatory capital -- and the amount usually depends on the amount of business they do. Those funds came from a loan note from Citigroup. But, being a small fintech group, Setl didn\u0027t have anything like the revenues or profits needed to maintain it so early this year it decided to sell both units, returning to its life as a pure blockchain software developer. That process appears to be taking longer than expected and requires \"expert, experienced and neutral management of the interests of all the creditors and stakeholders,\" said Setl\u0027s chairman Sir David Walker, who is known for the Walker Report, a review of corporate governance in UK banks that helped shape the financial services industry. According to documents filed in Britain’s High Court of Justice on March 1, and as noted on the London Gazette register under “corporate insolvency” on Thursday, Setl has apointed Quantuma LLP as their administrators. That\u0027s in order to sell the two businesses and pay off the creditors, allowing Setl to do what it reckons it does best. (That\u0027s the plan, anyway.) In an acronymn-laden statement sent on Thursday after we had broken this news, Setl said (emphasis ours): So it’s appointed admininstrators, but it is not filing for bankruptcy. Self-imposed admininstration, in the Fyre Festival economy, is a perfectly normal strategy for a fintech. It supports the growth strategy OK? Setl\u0027s last reported earnings, for the year to December 2017 showed it made £471,000 in turnover in the year to Dec 2017, with losses of £5.9m, but had £5.6m in cash at the bank. Last year was one of accelerated development but came at a cost. Alphaville understands Setl was looking for funding late last year. The company, which was trying to create a blockchain-based system for banks to settle payments instantly in digital central-bank money, should probably have made it clear a bit sooner that it was not in fact going bankrupt, though, as its filing was written up by crypto/blockchain site Coindesk under the headline “Blockchain Settlement Startup SETL Has Filed for Bankruptcy”. Fintech and public relations can make awkward bedfellows. Today\u0027s news seems pretty radical and unusual, and judging by the errors in the press release, pretty rushed. Without action, the reg cap burden would probably be crippling -- these requirements hit far bigger and more successful companies than Setl. But perhaps not quite the end yet for Setl, which only in January appointed former Bank of France governor Christian Noyer to its board. Certainly, though, a reminder that there can be a lot of painful adjustment when blockchain software development hits legal realities.

Where much of the literature has focused on cultural issues, he homes in on structural questions, notably the science of “phase transitions” — such as the “tug of war” between binding and entropy in water as it reaches freezing point. “Small changes in structure, rather than culture, can transform a rigid team,” he writes, relegating the full innovation equation to an appendix, for those who want to check his working. The “loonshots” of the title are the crazy breakthrough ideas that flourish if the two states can be held in balance. If not, they are frequently crushed or starved by organisations that have started to freeze into unimaginative bureaucracies. Bahcall makes the whole idea sing by bringing in references from across business, history, cinema and science. It is an ambitious and entertaining effort to lay out some fundamental laws of success and uncover the truth about successful group behaviour. Julie Zhou became a manager of a design team at Facebook when she was just 25, when the social network was still a start-up. She admits that after accepting her promotion she realised she had little idea what she was doing. The designer did not have that much experience of actually being managed let alone managing other people. Now a seasoned product design executive, Zhou has produced a guide for first time managers on what management is, how to navigate the first three months, how to manage yourself and how to hire well. But she is also keen to stress that once you feel you have finally got to grips with the mammoth task of managing a team, the journey will continue “like a toddler’s attempt at drawing a straight line — full of squiggles” and that the process is one of continuous development and learning. Charisma and swagger are too often seen as indicators of leadership material, says Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic. The reason is that organisations and politicians are no good at measuring competence and instead fall for confidence. Prof Chamorro-Premuzic’s book is a punchy expansion of his Harvard Business Review article of the same title that was published in 2013. It is an impassioned argument to stop believing the hype and take a cool-eyed assessment of ability. Women are often told to be more confident but he suggests such an attitude is wrong. It might be that they have a true understanding of their talents. This is not an argument for quotas for female leaders but rather for companies to promote people based on their competencies — if they do that, argues Prof Chamorro-Premuzic then it follows that more women will rise to the top. How do you encourage entrepreneurial behaviour in large organisations? This is the problem to which Sahar Hashemi offers a straightforward solution. The former lawyer and co-founder of Coffee Republic, a coffee shop franchise, draws on her own experience of both the corporate and start-up worlds, as well as the insights gained from speaking to 400 other large organisations. Hashemi aims to debunk some entrenched ideas, such as “big business can never have a start-up culture” and offers answers to common questions, such as “how can we grow big but act small?”; “how can we encourage innovative thinking?”; and “how can we be more agile?” Tha author writes that she is no innovation expert but her 10 “shifts”, as she puts it, are simple, day-to-day approaches to everyday work with an entrepreneurial mindset. These lessons are easy to understand (there’s no having to memorise complex management concepts) and take up just 140 pages. Blockchain is the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. According to Igor Pejic (a finalist for the FT’s Bracken Bower Prize in 2016), blockchain commentators, from tech analysts to industry experts, have “strong and differing opinions” on the technology’s future. However, Pejic writes that while everyone in IT and banking seems to have an opinion, “there is little systemic research or strategic analysis”. Here he aims to fill the gap by tackling common myths — that the success of blockchain will see the downfall of banks, for example — and examines whether blockchain can really boost the economy and help reduce inequality. Blockchain may make financial services cheaper, allowing banks to grab millions of customers, but as Pejic points out, this relies on a common misconception that blockchain transactions are free, when in fact they are not. However, he argues that if you are not on the blockchain frontline “sit back and enjoy the ride”, because despite the uncertainties, Pejic believes consumers will be on the winning side as competitive forces push down the cost of banking services. This trio of professors of, respectively, history, anthropology and economics, devised a “map” of social behaviour that aimed to capture “essential elements of human decision-making”. Their first attempt at such a map was technical and academic. This slim book aims to provide what they describe as “a user-friendly approach to the map of decision-making”. Instead of equations, it offers real-world examples of decision-making behaviour and the evolutionary processes underlying them. It is an enticing digest, with shades of (and references to) Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow and James Surowiecki’s The Wisdom of Crowds. Among the real-world references are the NFL draft choices in 2000, when the New England Patriots picked star quarterback Tom Brady, and Rico, the “wonder dog”, who was clever enough to identify a new object placed next to seven familiar ones. The academics claim their map is a tool to help “organise our thinking in the face of complex and dancing landscapes”. Unfortunately, their conclusion is a depressing one. Despite the utility of their map, decision-making is drifting towards a situation where a brute herding instinct overrides the wisdom of crowds. Paradoxically, they write, modern economies might as a result be less efficient in selecting life-improving technologies than they were in the past.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Andrew Hill Emma Jacobs Janina Conboye","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-03-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/70ced539-40e5-339f-9cbb-eae29f76e458","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F3230f86f-10db-43c7-a43a-3970e46d4974_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Invesco blockchain ETF to launch on London Stock Exchange","INTRO":"Move is a fresh sign of growing interest in the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Invesco is to launch an exchange traded fund targeting companies with potential to generate earnings from blockchain in a fresh sign of the growing interest among asset managers in the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. The Invesco Elwood Global Blockchain ETF will start trading on the London Stock Exchange on Monday. The ETF will invest in companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which supplies cryptocurrency manufacturers with mining chips, and CME Group, the US exchange operator that has pioneered bitcoin futures trading. Other constituents of the ETF, which carries a 65 basis points management fee, include Apple, Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Chris Mellor, head of ETF equity product management in Europe at Invesco, said the potential for blockchain to boost earnings was often not reflected in the share prices of companies such as Rio Tinto, the mining company that owns hydroelectric assets that could be harnessed for cryptocurrency mining. The ETF will initially invest in a portfolio of 48 companies based on a proprietary scoring system developed by Elwood Asset Management, a specialist crypto investment boutique backed by Alan Howard, co-founder of the Brevan Howard hedge fund. Bin Ren, Elwood chief executive, said the possible applications for blockchain extended far beyond cryptocurrencies. “We are beginning to see the technology being used by financial services companies in particular, but we expect greater application of blockchain technology across a wide range of industries,” said Mr Ren. JPMorgan Chase last month announced plans to use digital “JPM Coins” to expedite dollar-based payments for corporate banking clients, making it one of the first global banks to incorporate blockchain technology into its core business. Seven blockchain-based ETFs have been launched in the US but most have only attracted limited investor inflows. The largest, the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF, has $110m in assets. First Trust, the US asset manager, launched the first European-listed blockchain ETF on the Italian stock exchange in February last year. The Innovative Transaction \u0026 Process ETF has just over $20m in assets. Amun, a London-based financial technology company, which launched the world’s first exchange traded product tracking multiple cryptocurrencies in November, has just competed a $4.2m fundraising. Graham Tuckwell, the entrepreneur who developed the world’s first gold exchange traded product before founding ETF Securities, the London asset manager, has participated in the fundraising.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Chris Flood","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-03-09","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/c130d906-36bc-11e9-bb0c-42459962a812","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F70f7deda-0f75-11e9-b2f2-f4c566a4fc5f?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Oil blockchain platform signs up most North Sea traders","INTRO":"Boost for Vakt as it seeks to digitalise process of commodity trading","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A London-based oil trading blockchain platform has signed up companies responsible for almost two-thirds of all deals in the key North Sea crude grades, in a move they say demonstrates energy trading’s early adoption of the technology. Vakt, which is backed by a group of oil majors and trading houses, aims to digitalise the paper-backed processing of physical commodity deals using blockchain technology, with plans to expand after launching late last year. Etienne Amic, Vakt’s newly appointed chief executive, said the platform had signed up four new clients ahead of its official launch at International Petroleum Week, an annual oil industry gathering in London that begins on Tuesday. The platform has previously only been used by its direct backers, which include BP, Shell and Total and traders Gunvor and Mercuria. Other Vakt investors include Chevron, Equinor, and Reliance Industries. “We felt that we needed about 60 to 70 per cent of a market to reach ignition point [that would] incentivise other people to join,” Mr Amic said. Vakt aims to modernise the current process of physical commodity trading, where stacks of paper-based contracts, letters of credit, invoices and other paperwork are exchanged by email, fax or post. Apart from the buyers and sellers, other service providers such as terminal or pipeline operators, port agents and inspection companies are involved in helping the material to move along the supply chain. By putting the information processing and paper trail on blockchain, traders are looking to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Leading agricultural traders, including the “ABCDs” — Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Company — and Cofco are also exploring setting up a similar platform for crop trading. Recommended “It’s become more and more difficult to make money by trading commodities and any means to lower costs and shorten the transaction times is welcome,” said Jean-Francois Lambert, a commodity consultant and former head of commodity trade finance at HSBC. The desire to bring more efficiency to the processing of commodity trading comes as digitisation is affecting profit margins for traders, which have traditionally made money from proprietary knowledge of commodity flows but are now losing their edge amid greater transparency of data and information. Alex Booth, head of market analysis at Kpler, a Paris-based intelligence company, argues that levelling the playing field between dominant industry players and the rest of the market has helped correct price imbalances and inefficiencies. He said lower barriers of entry to the energy markets was leading to “fairer pricing for the end consumer”. Vakt plans to eventually expand to barges of oil products such as gasoline, in northern Europe as well as US crude pipelines. Experts say that the digitisation of the back end of physical commodity trading could hasten innovation on the front end, where the bulk of trades are still agreed by telephone. Some start-ups have already created platforms for trading raw materials, with Open Minerals offering a site for minerals and metals, and Boston-based Indigo Ag offering a matchmaking platform for US crops. “The younger people want to click, they don’t want to talk on the phone,” said Mr Amic.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Emiko Terazono","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-02-25","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/af901fb4-1f32-11e9-a46f-08f9738d6b2b","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fc32728f6-2f59-11e9-8744-e7016697f225?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The rich column: Crypto’s enduring fascination for the wealthy","INTRO":"Wealth managers are hesitant to recommend investing in something unregulated and volatile","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In February last year, Forbes magazine published its first-ever cryptocurrency rich list. But only one person in the top 10 was identified as an “investor”; the rest were either currency co-founders or ran a crypto-exchange. Less than nine months later, all those on the list were 50 per cent poorer, after the price of bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies plunged. Yet, even at the end of the year, with the boom apparently over, more than a quarter of wealthy clients at one US investment bank were saying they wanted to invest in crypto, according to Hayvn, a new digital currency platform. Crypto appears to hold an enduring fascination for the rich. Last June, Capgemini’s World Wealth report found that despite the enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies, wealth managers were the sticking point, as they couldn’t trade or advise on crypto for compliance reasons. Another 2018 survey by deVere suggested many investors would simply circumvent intermediaries: it forecast that 35 per cent of wealthy investors would have exposure to cryptocurrencies by the end of the year. In December, with the price of bitcoin down to £3,900 from £15,000 12 months earlier, one start-up hoping to facilitate crypto-investing reckoned the rich were still interested. TokenMarket, which began by giving access to initial coin offerings, told the Financial Times: “Investors, including many high-net-worth individuals, poured money in, and we’re not talking chump change here.” In some ways, this undimmed enthusiasm is not entirely dim. Ahmed Ismail, Hayvn chief executive, says the bitcoin bubble has distracted attention from the longer-term future of digital assets based on blockchain ledger technology. “Some have implications for the way we pay for things: it is quite revolutionary,” he says. “You can compare it to the tech bubble of the mid-1990s. In 2001-02, the bubble collapsed. But we still have Google and ecommerce today.” However, offering exposure to Ethereum remains anathema to wealth managers, for two reasons: cryptocurrencies are not regulated, and most assets are too volatile. Regulation is a longstanding problem. Last year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission said it had no plans to reclassify cryptocurrencies as securities — a move that would allow wealth managers to advise on them. In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority is still consulting on guidance to help firms understand whether cryptoassets fall under its regulation. A key question is an adviser’s duty to know the physical location, ownership and security of assets. Or, as Hayvn co-founder Chris Flinos puts it: “A wealth manager is not going to tell you to buy a million dollars’ worth of bitcoins and keep them on a USB stick.” Volatility is even more of a problem for managers. In light of the bitcoin fall, no wonder Alex Shaw, director of Progeny Wealth, says: “We have maintained a cautious stance due to the associated risks.” Nevertheless, solutions to these problems may present themselves — thanks to those two start-ups. Hayvn plans to offer regulated custody to investors concerned about the location and security of digital assets. Under the US Dodd-Frank rules, institutional investors with more than $150,000 of assets must have a “qualified custodian” secure the holdings. None has been available, but Hayvn is working with regulators in the Abu Dhabi Global Market to provide this security. Meanwhile, TokenMarket is planning to make a less volatile form of digital asset available with regulatory approval: security token offerings (STOs). These are digital tokens built on blockchain technology, like cryptocurrencies, but backed by something tangible, such as a company’s assets, profits or revenue. As TokenMarket chief executive Ransu Salovaara puts it: “We issue real shares and bonds on blockchain. But we do not need to use [a clearing house] for settlements or third-party custodians. So STOs are cheaper, faster and more transparent, and regulated.” Under FCA rules, companies can raise up to £8m via STOs, making them a potential alternative to venture capital investing. Even so, in a fast-moving market, most wealth managers will prefer to wait. “STOs have begun to embrace regulation,” says Shaw. “Time can only tell how this will increase liquidity, transferability and transparency. We will keep a watchful eye on its longer-term viability as an equity of the future.” Regulated custody may help, too, but not enough yet for some family offices. “Families turn to us for careful stewardship of wealth. That doesn’t sit too well with being a first mover in a crypto initial coin offering,” says James Fleming, chief executive of multi-family office Sandaire. JPMorgan Private Bank’s latest investment theme: Industry 4.0 — or the part of the Internet of Things that focuses on manufacturing. Apparently, the sector is expected to grow at 22 per cent a year to reach a value of €287bn in 2020.

Blockchain, in green, seems to have had a negative impact on economic activity around 2012, but it now appears to be going vertically to the moon, alongside, and at the same time as, genome sequencing, robotics, energy storage and artificial intelligence. Wood writes that “each of these innovation platforms\" will create “multiple trillions in market capitalisation\". Better buy the ETF, folks. We “reached out\" to Cathie Woods to explain how it all worked but she passed, this time. Good luck fighting the chartcriminals, chainers. The decentralised future is in your hands.

In the story, we reported that part of what Sponsy was selling was a “full set of investment documents . . . designed and approved by investment bankers”. We also told you that when Alphaville asked Sponsy’s founder Ivan Komar about this investment bank, we were told that in fact this was a “law firm based in the UK” and then, on further questioning, actually “just some firm that was considering investing in crypto”. The firm in question was Memorandum Capital, a Poland-based company that on LinkedIn lists its head office as a residential address in Manchester, along with 132 others companies. As one of you lot pointed out, these firms have a curiously high number of Polish names as directors. Here’s Memorandum Capital\u0027s HQ (via Google Maps): We looked up the company, and decided that it was neither an investment bank, nor a law firm (as Komar had in the end admitted), but instead, a company that helps other companies launch crypto tokens. But it seems that Memorandum Capital was not happy with that characterisation. The company got in touch with a “request for corrections”, so we thought we’d respond to its main grievances here. To start with: This seemed to be the main issue, so we went straight back to the website to check we’d got this right. There, we found the following: It seemed the company\u0027s issue was our use of the phrase “crypto tokens”, and the connotations that term carries of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Indeed, in a follow-up email from the company, we were told that “token launches in ICO is a phenomenon of the past, and we are not in that line of business”. An STO, for those of you who don’t know, stands for a Security Token Offering. It is just like an ICO, but ever since the SEC starting clamping down on these, crypto-types have been trying to distance themselves from them, and have come up with all sorts of different ways to describe the practice. A recent report from the FCA into so-called “cryptoassets” (a term we have some issues with), divided these into three categories: exchange tokens (the ones that pretend to be currencies, like bitcoin), “utility tokens” (the ones that tell that you\u0027ll actually be able to use to redeem with the company issuing them — a kind of digital coupon) and “security tokens”, which the FCA says are likely to fall within the parameter of regulators like themselves, and “provide rights such as ownership, repayment of a specific sum of money, or entitlement to a share in future profit”. If a token passes the SEC\u0027s Howey Test, it is a security, and therefore needs to be registered and regulated as such, and subject to securities laws. There should not, therefore, be any kind of regulatory or legal arbitrage available for the issuers of such tokens to exploit. So we can see why Memorandum Capital might have taken issue with us saying they help companies launch crypto tokens — even if co-founder Sergey Vostrikov calls it a “crypto investment boutique” on his LinkedIn — given that they only help companies launch one type of crypto tokens. They wouldn\u0027t want readers thinking that this was about trying to do anything that wasn\u0027t in strict compliance with regulations. Instead, under “Benefits of Security Token Offering”, the company says: They also point out some of the advantages of those famously compliant crypto exchanges: ICOs have been criticised for encouraging the kind of madness that allows people to raise millions of dollars in a matter of minutes. So we imagine that when Memorandum Capital praised its newly appointed executives for having overseen such mania, the company must just have wanted to make its new employees feel welcome (emphasis ours): So we hold our hands up here. Of course security tokens aren\u0027t crypto tokens and of course Memorandum Capital is not about helping companies launch them. Next was a complaint about Komar calling the company an investment bank, or a law firm: We felt the rationale of mentioning Komar\u0027s claim was self-evident, given that the whole article was about someone trying to flog something on eBay with some misleading assertions. But we thought we\u0027d check to see where he could have got that idea from. We didn\u0027t find much. Except this, on the Memorandum Capital website (emphasis ours): And this, on the company\u0027s Facebook page (same same): Oh and on its LinkedIn, Memorandum Capital lists its industry as “investment banking”. So again, we hold our hands up. In no way has Memorandum Capital ever presented itself as anything akin to an investment bank or law firm. We’re not sure how Komar could have got in a muddle here. Another complaint was the nature of Memorandum\u0027s dealings with Sponsy: Memorandum said all they had done was a “Brief Assessment” of Sponsy, and that the communications was “very brief”. So we went back to Komar, who told us that Memorandum had provided a “sophisticated, 7-pages long, deliberate analysis of our team, software, project, and business model” that had taken two weeks to carry out, and had included a SWOT analysis and market research. Komar also said there had been a category in the assessment called “Things to check during Deep Due Diligence”, which he felt had implied the initial assessment was doing some kind of “subtle due diligence”, as he put it. An audit, according to the dictionary, is “an official inspection of an organisation\u0027s accounts, typically by an independent body”. Again, we can\u0027t understand why Komar could have imagined a “Brief Assessment” was anything of the kind, or how he could have thought any due diligence had been done. The company\u0027s final request was: We thought that instead of removing any references to Memorandum Capital it would be fairer to just respectfully write up a whole article about them. To sum up: if someone ever tries to tell you that an STO is just a fancy name for an ICO, or that security tokens have anything to do with crypto tokens, or that the real benefit of “cryptoassets” is that they allow you to skirt regulation, or that it\u0027s strange to have 133 companies headquartered in a 2-up-2-down in Manchester, you just tell them to stop acting the fool.

The technology will facilitate near-instantaneous settlement of these money transfers and will, according to the bank, mitigate counterparty risk. The payment technology is a prototype, and JPMorgan plans to roll it out to a small number of clients within a few months. Combining shared databases and cryptography, blockchain technology allows multiple parties to have simultaneous access to a constantly updated digital ledger that cannot be altered. Having initially been sceptical about the technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, banks have in recent years started to explore its potential uses. Yet some observers question the value of using blockchain technology for intra-bank payments. Martin Walker, director for banking and finance at the UK’s Center for Evidence-Based Management, said that “fundamentally, for firms to make payments to each other instantly when they share the same bank and the same currency there is absolutely no need to use blockchain . . . there are no technical, credit or liquidity implications [of such payments]. Many banks do it already.” JPMorgan said there were limits to instantaneous intra-bank cash payments, and it hopes JPM Coin may open the way for other blockchain applications. “Even in the simplest case of money movement across institutional clients of the same bank, there are cut-offs across borders so not all transactions can be done real time 24/7,” said Umar Farooq, head of digital treasury services and blockchain at the bank. “In addition, there are various other uses for blockchain technology that may involve other types of transactions (eg, securities, asset tokens) where instant movement of value over the blockchain is necessary.” Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan chief executive, called bitcoin a “fraud” a few years ago, threatening to fire employees who traded in it, but he has since expressed regret about the comment and endorsed the potential of the underlying blockchain technology. Gabriel Wang, analyst at Aite Group, said applications of the distributed ledger technology underpinning blockchain systems in areas such as trading might lead to improvements in transparency and record keeping. “I don\u0027t think that settlements are the endgame for JPM Coin,” he said. Other banks continue to experiment with blockchain. For example, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, HSBC, MUFG and State Street teamed up on a common “utility settlement coin” created by Switzerland’s UBS, designed to be convertible into cash at central banks. The consortium had hoped to launch the coins in late 2018, but the project is yet to go live. HSBC has used a blockchain technology, dubbed “FX Everywhere” to help settle some 3m foreign-exchange transactions worth $250bn — a small part of its overall FX trading business. The tools serve to simplify internal trade flows by capturing transactions between different parts of the bank on a single ledger.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Robert Armstrong","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-02-14","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/e5f6ba4a-ccff-30ff-bdfa-ba3283076f9a","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F932f41e5-1a6f-4405-931f-547a8fcd233f_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Niall Ferguson joins blockchain project Ampleforth","INTRO":"“The ascent of money has been essential to the ascent of man.\" And now it is the turn of the stablecoin.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ampleforth: not just an ideal school to send your kids if you\u0027re Catholic and can afford it, but also, \"an ideal money\". More specifically (and perplexingly): And Niall Ferguson, the rightwing British historian and who once called himself a \"fully paid-up member of the neo-imperialist gang\", has joined its advisory board. A bit late to the crypto party? Maybe. But this isn\u0027t the first time Ferguson has dipped his toes into the world of crypto. He suggested last year in a Bank of England seminar that cryptocurrencies were \"the financial system of the future\". He also said he felt it\u0027s \"only a matter of time before the next financial crisis\". A potential answer, apparently, is stablecoins. These are digital currencies that run on blockchains, but that don\u0027t float freely. Instead, they are pegged to fiat currencies like the dollar, or currency baskets like the IMF\u0027s Special Drawing Rights, either via the (supposed) backing of those currencies, or via the magic of an algorithmic central bank that expands and contracts the money supply to keep the price stable. Ampleforth is trying the latter. Here\u0027s Ferguson, quoted in the press release: But how does this free and equal system work, we hear you ask? Well, it\u0027s quite simple really: Capiche? Good. Essentially, the idea is that Ampleforth -- named after the character in George Orwell\u0027s 1984 who is responsible for translating poetry into Newspeak -- would be pegged to the dollar by means of a \"smart contract\" that would pump \"Amples\" into the system when its price topped a dollar, and withdraw them when the exchange rate fell below $1 per Ample. It’s easy to see why Ferguson might have been attracted to such a project. In his 2008 book The Ascent of Money, he writes: If any of the Ampleforth stuff is sounding familiar to you, it might be because we wrote about a similar algorithmic stablecoin with academic backing last year: Basis, which was had John Taylor on its board. (Basis is now bygone, having returned what was left of the $133m it had raised from investors.) Ampleforth is a little different from Basis, but not very. It is cleverly not pushing the idea of \"bond tokens\" or \"share tokens\" which, as Basis found, might make the SEC nervous. Also, it acknowledges that it will be \"volatile in price and supply at launch\" (though it doesn\u0027t acknowledge that volatility might extend beyond the launch). We asked Nicholas Weaver, computer science lecturer at Berkeley, for his thoughts, who told us: We\u0027re not sure how much time this advisory role requires, nor the nature or scale of the compensation (we have asked). But Ferguson probably has some time on his hands since resigning from a senior leadership role at a Stanford University free speech programme, Cardinal Conversations, last year. We wonder whether he has commissioned any \"opposition research\" on the host of stablecoin rivals that Ampleforth must try to compete with.

While the collapse in valuations vindicated critics, it does not appear to have deterred true cryptocurrency believers from promoting its potential. New cryptocurrencies continue to emerge (more than 2000 at the time of writing). Moreover, their precipitous falls — plummeting 90 per cent for those who enjoyed the bubble — have led some in the market to describe this as a buying opportunity. The supposed investment case hinges on two complementary but equally flawed ideas: first, that each cryptocurrency has an intrinsic value; and second, that its value should appreciate as blockchain — the distributed ledgers to which cryptocurrencies are tied — delivers on its promise as the next great disruptive technology. It also makes the heroic assumption that policymakers will allow these activities to go on unchecked. To understand the main problem with valuing cryptocurrencies, it is worth dwelling on the features that make fiat money — what states declare to be legal tender — so potent. Fiat money works because it is issued by a power that: has tax-raising powers; can pay interest; can achieve productivity in the form of trade; has a monopoly on minting new money; supports all of this with the legitimate use of physical force (through writing laws and raising an army); and is recognised by other nation states. The more stable the government and the international system, the more societal trust there is in fiat money as a store of value. Libertarians and cyber utopians, who are among the strongest advocates of cryptocurrencies, correctly point out that monetary authorities have historically debased their currencies. But, in contrast to fiat money, cryptocurrencies are a claim on nobody, cannot generate an income stream and are too volatile to be considered safe for deposits. And they are every bit as prone to debasement as fiat money, not least because of the proliferation of platforms and the absence of a central authority to create a common standard — as the case of QuadrigaCX aptly exposes. In this context, it is worth making an observation about gold, which also lacks some of the attributes that help fiat money succeed. While the metal has its detractors, it has established itself as a store of value globally and over millennia. The notion that a cryptocurrency’s value might be tied to the success of blockchain is just as contentious. Blockchain may generate some utility in the form of improved security and reduced transaction costs, and may even prove to be transformative at some stage. But it does not follow that the tokens used to support transactions should be elevated to the status of tradable currency and positioned as a store of value, or worse still, an investment opportunity. It seems those distributed ledgers that use fixed exchange rate, asset-backed tokens — a digital version of the chips used in casinos — stand a better chance of prevailing in the longer run. As an asset or a currency, then, the value of a cryptocurrency is in the eye of the beholder. It has no intrinsic value, so to buy in now on the basis of how far the coins have fallen in price would be to succumb to a value trap on a grand scale. In short, cryptocurrencies are wholly unsuitable for investment. Recommended While it may be impractical to outlaw crypto trading, expect policymakers to scrutinise initial coin offerings more intensively as they are marketed as investments and homes for individuals’ savings. Even if policymakers act in an uncoordinated way, it seems unlikely they will allow the growth of independent cryptocurrencies over the longer run, not least because they appear ideally suited to the circumvention of government supervision — and the erosion of tax income — and have proved attractive to the criminal underworld. The spawning of cryptocurrencies in some ways captures the zeitgeist by responding to a prevailing lack of trust in society. Yet, by attempting to create an environment that does not depend on trust — if such an ambition is achievable — it is in conflict with other spirits of the age: greater transparency, more people and corporations paying their fair share, and environmental protection (when one considers the energy consumption associated with mining cryptocurrencies). Were cryptocurrencies to be adopted widely, they could undermine the very fabric of civil society. Whatever the future uses of blockchain, investors should steer clear of cryptocurrencies as an investable asset. Instead, they would be best advised to seek returns through active asset allocation and careful security selection of companies that support societal and economic development.

Not so in a large chunk of financial services. One of my favourite pieces of research examining this dismal state of affairs comes from French academic Thomas Philippon, who teaches at New York University. In Finance v Wal-Mart: Why are Financial Services so Expensive?, Mr Philippon crunches the numbers on costs for consumers. The results aren’t pretty, with increased intermediation just one of the smoking guns. According to Mr Philippon: “The cost of intermediation per dollar of assets created has increased over the past 130 years.” He suggests that the “unit cost of intermediation has been somewhere between 1.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent of assets. However, this unit cost has been trending upward since 1970 and is now significantly higher.” I can’t help but think that one of the biggest smoking guns is the web of fund administration functions in funds settlement and management, which helps keep the professionals in places such as Luxembourg in Audis. Let’s chart the chain of agents involved in a fund value transaction: transfer agents, fund accounting, global custody services, depository services, fund distribution solutions as well as index firms if we’re using exchange traded funds. Processes vary but we can note down calculations of net asset value, know-your-customer and anti-money laundering controls, plus a longer list of even more boring, repetitive but necessary tasks. The net effect is a decline in efficiency (with settlement of trades taking two or three days) plus the inevitable extra costs to fund manager and end investor. Perhaps technology can provide a solution? At this point I gently, hesitantly, fearfully even, introduce the dread words — crypto and blockchain. For the record I remain to be convinced of many claims made about this impossibly boosterish world of nerds. What I would be willing to place a small bet on, say a lunch, is that the disruptive technology behind distributed ledgers (DLT) could result in many job losses in Luxembourg and beyond. I’m not alone. A Deloitte report concluded: “Blockchain technology has the potential to wipe Luxembourg oﬀ the map of the fund distribution and administration market.” Bad news I’d suggest for those Audi dealers. More to the point I am beginning to run into outfits of varying size — such as Calastone, FundsDLT and Amun — that are beginning to figure out how to apply smart contracts and DLTs to the fund admin chain. Swiss-based Amun for instance has been quietly building a full-stack fund admin structure that could be used with outside firms — it was forced to build these multiple functions so as to launch its own physically-backed crypt tracker. FundsDLT has also worked with Amundi, the €1.47tn European asset manager. In effect, these early-stage companies have worked out that this long chain of fund admin functions is just a value chain of paper-based commands that need recording somewhere accessible and verifiable. Smart contracts, where technology implements actions based on conditions, can be built into permission-based ledgers and blockchains. Along the way we could see costs reduced and efficiency vastly increased with T+0 (same-day trade settlement) theoretically possible. There are already businesses building DLT-based architecture. Challenges remain: regulators will need to get behind these ideas, but the way in which central banks have begun to seriously consider digital ledgers — for emoney versions of fiat money — suggests that their bureaucratic minds may be open to the possibilities of blockchain. It is also true that the technology is not user-friendly and is vulnerable to tech-savvy manipulation. Open access to the transaction and settlement blocks scares many while even more insiders worry about scalability — my guess is that leviathans such as State Street or BNY are not quaking just yet. Looking even farther out, another vista appears: the tokenisation of most fungible assets. I would be a rich man now if I had received £1 for every opportunity spun to me about tokenising an office building (or expensive violin or bottle of precious French wine). A few projects have emerged in the US, in the property space for instance, but it is clear that the back-office settlement systems on which these projects rely are far from complete. If fund admin is blockchained, that could change; even better if the smart contracts sitting under the bonnet help cut costs (especially magic-circle legal costs) and result in access to new alternatives. This brings me to my last contrarian thought. Could a progressive regulator mandate a wholesale move to blockchain?

Here\u0027s the bank: JPMorgan, whose CEO Jamie Dimon (in)famously caused a sell-off in crypto in late 2017, mid cryptomania, when he said bitcoin was \"a fraud\", also says: So why is the bank launching the coin? JPMorgan doesn\u0027t really explain why it would want to exchange value over a blockchain in the first place, however. Unlike a public blockchain, in which the security of the system is maintained by a decentralised network of computers, JPM Coin would run on a private blockchain, the bank\u0027s own \"Quorum Blockchain\". Private blockchains are just centralised data stores, whose security is maintained by their owners (in this case the bank).

Cobalt was set up in 2015 by former Citi banker Andy Coyne and ex-trader Adrian Patten to create a cheaper and more efficient alternative to incumbents by using distributed ledger technology. The size and cost of IHS Markit’s new stake has not been disclosed. The investment comes as banks hunt for cost savings in trade processing as the margins they can demand from clients are squeezed. While trading in currencies is overwhelmingly done on electronic venues and increasingly through algorithms, processes that take place after trading have remained largely manual, fragmented and expensive. Technology investment over the years has largely focused on improving trade execution. “For too long, FX has been burdened by an ageing, inefficient post-trade environment,” said Mr Patten. “If we were to start building out connections to the market it would take years and years. Being able to plug into the [Markit] network means that we can get clients on board quicker and we can show significant cost savings to clients in year one.” Most large banks have a multitude of systems for post-trade processing, which creates additional costs and inconsistencies and leads to replication. That complexity also increases the amount that institutions have to pay for messaging and getting transactions completed. Cobalt has developed a way to create a single, unchangeable record for FX transactions, which Mr Patten said could cut costs by up to 80 per cent. Up to now, he said, the company had lacked the reach of some established peers. Recommended IHS Markit’s derivatives processing unit, dubbed MarkitSERV, is connected to more than 800 counterparties in the foreign exchange market. Through this deal, they will be able to access the full suite of Cobalt’s products and services with the existing network. “We are trying to re-engineer the whole trade lifecycle and create savings for our clients. It’s quite a profound change for the market overall because delivering confirmation at a much lower cost will allow clients to cut headcount, costs and to fully invest their balance sheet,” said Chris Leaver, managing director and head of FX at MarkitSERV.

His appointment adds to the growing number of heavyweights on the Setl board, including chairman Sir David Walker. Sir David is known for his Walker Report, a review of corporate governance in UK banks, and his recommendations have helped shape the UK financial services industry. Other directors include Rachel Lomax, former deputy governor of the Bank of England and Ed Richards, former chief executive of Ofcom, the telecoms regulator. London-based Setl offers a modern electronic ledger designed specifically for financial markets, and settles, record and verifies payments in central bank money rather than cryptocurrencies. While some blockchains use ledgers available to all users, Setl uses a so-called “permissioned ledger”, which allows a small network of trusted parties to see it. Mr Noyer, who led the French central bank from 2003 to 2015, spearheaded recent efforts from Paris to woo more finance and banking business away from London to the French capital once the UK leaves the EU. He was also chairman of the Bank for International Settlements and served as the first vice-president of the European Central Bank when the euro was launched. “Setl’s technological leadership coupled with the deep experience of the team presents a unique and compelling proposition. I look forward to helping shape this extremely interesting initiative,” he said. This hasn’t been done with hackathons or bearded men with sandals and access to table football, but by experienced professionals with access to knowledge of post-trade systems His appointment comes amid rising concerns that blockchain technology will not usher in the transformation of trade and payments its supporters have promised. Advocates are attracted to blockchain’s ability to offer a verifiable, immutable and public record. Critics argue that blockchain cannot overcome privacy concerns, nor scale up sufficiently to handle thousands of transactions per second, like credit card companies. Adding to the concern, one of its leading proponents, Blythe Masters, stepped down as chief executive of Digital Asset Holdings before Christmas. However, in its annual review of technology trends this week, professional services firm Deloitte argued that a breakthrough was likely in the next few years. “Concerns around scalability and cost-performance of transaction processing are being addressed,” it argued. Peter Randall, president of Setl, said the group was beginning to earn revenues as several of its projects, such as a central securities depository based on blockchain technology, continued to deliver. “This hasn’t been done with hackathons or bearded men with sandals and access to table football, but by experienced professionals with access to knowledge of post-trade systems,” he told the Financial Times.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-01-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/d5ba0434-1979-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fdefa2064-197a-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ford to use blockchain in pilot to trace cobalt mined in Congo","INTRO":"Carmaker to use platform in attempt to improve supply chain transparency","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ford will use a blockchain-based platform to trace supplies of cobalt from a Chinese-owned mine in the Congo for the batteries in its electric cars, in an attempt to ensure they are not linked to human rights abuses. The US carmaker will work with Korean battery company LG Chem and China’s largest cobalt producer Huayou Cobalt to create “an immutable audit trail” for supplies of cobalt on blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrency bitcoin. The project is the latest effort to use blockchain to improve the transparency of global supply chains, especially in commodities. The Democratic Republic of Congo produces more than 60 per cent of the world’s cobalt, but much of it is sent to China to be processed by multiple companies before it is used in batteries. In addition, up to 20 per cent of the DRC’s cobalt is mined by hand, often by children with picks and shovels. “We remain committed to transparency across our global supply chain,” Lisa Drake, vice-president of global purchasing and power-train operations at Ford, said. “By collaborating with other leading industries in this network, our intent is to use state-of-the-art technology to ensure materials produced for our vehicles will help meet our commitment to protecting human rights and the environment.” Zhejiang-based Huayou Cobalt is one of the biggest producers of cobalt for batteries and is listed on the Shanghai stock exchange. In 2016 the company was accused of buying cobalt mined from children working in “hazardous conditions” by Amnesty International. Since then the company says it has undergone an audit on its supply chain and made efforts to improve the condition of communities in the DRC, one of the poorest countries in the world. “This is central to our proactive approach to delivering ethical cobalt,” Chen Hongliang, chief executive of Huayou, said about the pilot. “We also want to have strong, reliable information channels to prove and demonstrate this action to our customers.” The consortium said it wanted to open up the platform to other car producers and companies in the supply chain, and expand it to include different battery metals and raw materials. The project will use the IBM Blockchain Platform and be powered by Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric. It is being overseen by RCS Global, a UK supply-chain audit company. Shares in Huayou have fallen by 50 per cent over the past year amid fears of an oversupply of cobalt.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Henry Sanderson","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-01-16","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/9eb01af6-1964-11e9-b93e-f4351a53f1c3","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F5d036c8c-1966-11e9-b93e-f4351a53f1c3?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Chevron, Total and Reliance join blockchain-based oil trading platform","INTRO":"Addition of trio gives Vakt support of half of top 10 largest oil and gas companies","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Chevron, Total and Reliance Industries are backing a new digital platform for crude oil trading based on blockchain and launched late last year, joining a consortium of investors that includes BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Equinor as well as traders Gunvor, Mercuria and Koch Supply \u0026 Trading. Vakt is the first blockchain trading platform for physical oil trades. Trading of physical commodities has historically been a cumbersome and lengthy process, executed through mountains of documents, including letters of credit, invoices and inspection certificates sent around the world by email, fax or post. By putting the paperwork on a secure, real-time blockchain-based digital platform, Vakt aims to offer faster, cheaper and more secure ways of completing a commodities trade. “Chevron is joining the Vakt consortium to stay at the forefront of the technology’s development and to help move the industry forward in the blockchain space,” said Colin Parfitt, president of supply and trading at Chevron. With the addition of Chevron, Reliance and Total as backers, the blockchain platform would have five of the world’s top 10 largest oil and gas companies by market capitalisation as investors, said Vakt. Other investors include banks ABN Amro, ING and Société Générale. The platform will initially handle trades in the main North Sea physical crude oil contract and is expected to be extended to all physically traded energy-related commodities. Energy and agricultural traders have been trialling digital platforms over the past few years. Leading agricultural traders Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus as well as China’s Cofco International are working together to create a blockchain-based digital trading system. Blockchain is an electronic information system that provides the underpinning of cryptocurrencies by recording deals in digital blocks. Encrypted digital information can be shared and corroborated. The records cannot be revised and any attempted changes are visible to all participants. Recommended The technology will reduce the need to exchange documents, reducing the time and costs needed to complete a trade. In an earlier blockchain trial for a soyabean trade by Louis Dreyfus Commodities, the processing time was cut to a fifth of the traditional model. Traders are also able to monitor the operation’s progress in real time and verify data, while the platform will also reduce the risk of fraud. Blockchain has also been used to track the provenance of produce in the trade of raw materials. Ford is trialling the technology to trace supplies of cobalt from a Chinese-owned mine in the Congo to the batteries in its electric cars, while De Beers is piloting a diamond tracing scheme. Cargill is operating a traceability programme for its turkeys, and trials for agricultural commodities including cocoa and coffee among various players are also ongoing.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Emiko Terazono","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-01-16","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/60d5a48c-17fa-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F0db83872-1805-11e9-b191-175523b59d1d?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"HSBC banks on blockchain to finesse forex trades","INTRO":"Project suggests a future for crypto tech despite crash in tokens market","DETAILED_CONTENT":"HSBC is leaning more heavily on blockchain-based tools to handle the fiddly processes behind foreign-exchange trades, suggesting banks are finding solid applications for a technology used in cryptocurrencies, which have been under pressure since valuations tumbled last year. The London-headquartered bank, a heavy-hitter in forex dealing, has processed more than 3m FX transactions worth $250bn using blockchain technology in the past year, it said on Monday. That represents a tiny sliver of its overall currencies business, but still offers a rare example of a blockchain-based product that has proven its worth in wholesale finance. Settlement provider CLS — an industry utility that ensures each side of currencies trades gets paid — launched a so-called distributed-ledger technology platform in November last year with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. But after an initial flurry of hype surrounding the potential for the technology, most DLT-focused start-ups have yet to come up with a product, stymied by concerns over speed and security. Still, a number of projects are in testing mode. DTCC, a post-trade market infrastructure provider, moved its DLT project aimed at credit derivatives reporting to a trial phase in November last year. In the same month Spanish bank BBVA and two partners completed a syndicated loan on blockchain technology. The HSBC project, known as “FX Everywhere”, has been used to co-ordinate payments across HSBC’s internal balance sheets using a shared ledger for a year. During that period it has handled more than 150,000 payments — netted down from 3m transactions — automating previously manual processes and reducing the bank’s reliance on external technology providers. “HSBC . . . conduct[s] thousands of foreign exchange transactions within the bank, across multiple balance sheets, in dozens of countries,” said Richard Bibbey, acting global head of currencies at HSBC. “FX Everywhere uses distributed ledger technology to drastically increase the efficiency of these internal flows.” Multiple executives at the bank can simultaneously use the system to view trades from execution to settlement, reducing the risks of discrepancy and delay, the bank said.

The environmental cost of the massive energy consumption needed to create bitcoin is another strike against it. Whatever happens to bitcoin, its underlying technology, called blockchain, could transform the worlds of finance and central banking. Central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, need to figure out the implications of such distributed ledger technologies and how to adapt to them. At the very minimum, there are looming changes to how central banks run monetary policy and ensure financial stability. Unofficial cryptocurrencies are not about to displace central bank currencies. Moreover, the Fed arguably has little to worry about given the dominance of US financial markets and the dollar in global finance. Still, even the Fed risks being outrun by rapid technological change in financial markets that could strike at its core functions. It should instead seize the opportunity to lead the world’s central banks by harnessing the powers of the new technology. Blockchain is an electronic distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. Each transaction is recorded on multiple electronic ledgers, is visible to anyone with a computer, and cannot be manipulated by any one party. This process is the crux of the technology’s appeal. Rather than having transactions verified by a central bank or commercial bank, blockchain does so through people power. Trust comes from the public verification by multiple agents in a network, who must all agree. Adopting distributed ledger technology could transform modern financial systems, which are rife with inefficiencies. Making payments, verifying different stages of a transaction, and ensuring the finality of such transactions remains time-consuming and costly. Banks charge steep fees to process domestic payments. International transactions are even worse, with the process taking days and involving a stiff fee. The new technology can make these processes more efficient, quicker and cheaper. It could allow a group of banks to settle transactions without having to go through a trusted middleman such as a central bank. Unlike bitcoin’s public ledger, they could restrict access to the ledger to a network of participating banks. This would also make it easier to transfer funds across countries, cheaply and with instant verification. This is all good for financial institutions and their customers, but could leave central banks with a diminished role, making it harder to monitor and control domestic and cross-border financial transactions. Some central banks, such as those of Singapore and Sweden, plan to issue digital versions of their currencies to retain their key role in domestic payment systems. Many emerging market economies, including China and Uruguay, have similar plans in the works. Their governments view official digital currencies as a way to also broaden financial inclusion. The Fed is undertaking a major effort to improve retail and interbank payment systems in the US. But it remains sceptical about whether digital currencies can contribute to this effort. Attempts by Russia and Venezuela to issue their own cryptocurrencies to evade financial sanctions have heightened scepticism about the necessity and legitimacy of official digital currencies. This could be a lost opportunity. The Fed and other central banks can deploy the technology to benefit their countries. Unlike paper currency, digital cash is potentially cheaper and easier to use, and makes it harder to evade taxes or fuel illicit activities. Central banks could also use the technology to improve the speed and efficiency of payment systems, rendering it easier to make and verify payments across people, businesses and financial institutions. Should central banks merely accommodate newer cryptocurrencies and decentralised payment systems? This comes down to whether the trust that individual citizens and financial institutions place in central banks can ever be replaced by decentralised verification mechanisms. These alternatives might work fine in normal times. But during times of financial market stress, public trust in decentralised payment systems could vanish, bringing financial systems and economies to a grinding halt. Central banks will need to innovate and adapt to changing financial technologies. But their biggest asset is the trust that households and businesses have in them. In finance, people power may go a long way but will not be a substitute for that trust. The Fed and other central banks should embrace new financial technologies to build on that trust and use them to make financial markets more efficient and stable.

Those who can still bear to look at their portfolios might prefer to eat more cold turkey than survey the damage the last quarter has inflicted on their savings. What looked, at the end of September, like another almost routine up year has turned into the worst for shares since 2008. Suddenly, it seems, there are too many things to worry about. Rising interest rates in the US, tariff wars, faltering growth in China, too much debt everywhere and the UK’s homegrown political crisis on top: it’s a decidedly unseasonal recipe. No wonder investors dashed for cash. The dashing has been fastest out of domestic UK businesses. The lament of the shopkeeper has been well documented, but shares in housebuilders, insurance and utilities have had a miserable Christmas. From an outside investor’s viewpoint, the sliding pound has compounded the damage into a truly grim year. These are just the conditions for bargains in the January sales. Housebuilders mostly have solid-looking balance sheets. While nobody can understand the balance sheets of the big insurance companies, faltering life expectancy will be a bonus next year. Now BT’s dreams of glory seem to be over, it may find it can make money sticking to the knitting instead. Land Securities, the UK’s largest property company, is at a seven-year low. The water and electricity companies’ shares are discounting the worst in their regulatory reviews. In all these sectors, yields of 6 or 7 per cent abound. Elsewhere, some are much higher: Dixons Carphone’s historic yield is almost 10 per cent. A cut from the new CEO is odds-on, but the price is discounting much worse. Physical shopping may have to reinvent itself, but is not going to disappear. The rise of the global passive investor has made exchange traded funds the largest single force in markets, amplifying swings in sentiment. To these investors looking in from overseas, Britain today sometimes seems like a place where the lunatics cannot decide who should run the asylum. Yet crises always pass, and perceptions change, sometimes with dramatic speed. When that happens, and international investors armed with their ETF billions combine with M\u0026A bargain-hunters purchasing cheap sterling to buy UK businesses, the turn could be as dramatic as the fall. A postscript on the year’s most unsuccessful rights issue, from construction group Kier. The shares had traded around £8 before the launch of a 33 for 50 issue at the deep discount price of 409p. In this uncompetitive corner of the City, these issues are underwritten as well as discounted. In this case, raising £264m left £250m after fees, but as Lex pointed out, it was not the usual risk-free money. When shareholders subscribed for only 38 per cent of the shares, the price crashed to 346p, helped down by some enthusiastic short selling. The underwriters had to take the rest, but even this disastrous result would have been less painful had they kept their nerve. They had their fees for the whole issue, but had to subscribe for only 62 per cent, so their actual break-even was just over 360p. The 62 per cent was placed at that price, including to some grateful short sellers, and the shares quickly rebounded, ending the week at 395p. Assuming the stock market’s war on construction companies ends in 2019, Kier looks cheap at today’s 380p. So no triumph, but no tragedy, either. Sad seasonal news for employees at the website Spankchain, which plans to use blockchain technology to revolutionise the porn business. The team is being cut from 20 spankers to just eight, although that might give a misleading impression of what they actually do. Far from active service, so to speak, they are developing a virtual currency to “allow us to eliminate third-party intermediaries and unfair payment practices” in the ahem, adult entertainment community. This rather stretches the definition, since porn is not generally a communal activity, but on Spankchain’s flotation nearly a year ago, the price shot to 71 cents. It’s now 1.4 cents, where it is worth $4m. Quite a hard hit, then.

No rain means no income, no food and not enough resources to replant the next year. Now, however, more than 20,000 farms in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda have access to simple and affordable crop insurance via their smartphones. The policies or “smart contracts” currently under development are based on blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. This avoids the need for paperwork and means payouts can be triggered automatically when certain conditions are met, such as a specific number of days of drought. The system uses high-resolution satellite images to detect rainfall and plant growth data. Conventional crop insurance is too expensive for more than 500m small farmers worldwide, says Christopher Sheehan, founder and chief executive of US-based WorldCover, which developed the system. “But with machine learning and blockchain technology, we can process these data very cheaply to produce a really simple crop insurance product with premiums of $20 to $50 for a farmer who might only be earning $3,000 a year.” Payments can be made using mobile money transfer services such as M-Pesa. “They might receive a payment after seven days without rain,” Mr Sheehan says. WorldCover has been working with Lloyd’s of London insurance market and Nephila Capital, an investment management company specialising in weather reinsurance, to create a viable product. Crucially, it is simple to use and at this stage focuses exclusively on rainfall — a form of “parametric” or “index-based” insurance that does not require manual assessments or decision-making. “Even a farmer with limited literacy can understand an agreement where I say I’ll pay you if it doesn’t rain for a week,” says Mr Sheehan. Ease of use is crucial, agrees Michiel Berende, head of inclusive insurance at Etherisc, which has formed a joint venture with Aon and Oxfam to develop a blockchain crop insurance system in Sri Lanka. The initial goal is to automate policies already in place and reduce operating costs, says Mr Berende. The group also wants to explore how blockchain could be used to distribute the risk of crop insurance more fairly by sharing the cost of premiums among others in the value chain. “The farmer will still have to pay, but so could the other parties involved, starting with the large producers and multinationals,” says Mr Berende. Ultimately, even the customer could make a contribution, through the retail price. “The long-term vision is that when you buy a product you will be able to scan the barcode to see not just where it was produced and by which farmer, but what part of the price is the insurance,” says Mr Berende. It is under-represented because it has not been viable to serve so many low-budget clients The fact that the policies are based on third-party data, such as rainfall measured by satellite and ground sensors, means they are objective, thereby avoiding disputes and fraudulent claims. Eventually, the Etherisc group plans to extend the system to include crop disease affected by the weather, such as brown plant hopper, which is linked to dry conditions. Insurers are keen to add crop risk to their portfolios, says Mr Sheehan, who has attracted interest from Swiss Re and Lloyd’s. “At the moment, it is under-represented because it has not been economically viable to serve so many low-budget clients.” India has an extensive government-backed crop insurance programme, but this can be slow to pay out, and the government is examining how blockchain might improve it. Aditya Das, an insurance specialist based in Bangalore, says: “If the current momentum is sustained, we should see pilots in the next 12 to 18 months and a rollout within two years.” Faster and more accurate information combined with trigger-based decisions will reduce enrolment errors and speed the process, says Mr Das, especially payment of claims. “Both of these will significantly boost farmer confidence and increase enrolment, which in turn should kick off a virtuous cycle.” Moreover, research by the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Assets and Market Access at the University of California, Davis, shows that farmers who are insured tend to invest more in the hope of higher income in good years. Removal of risk through insurance can increase smallholder investment and income by 20 to 30 per cent. This indirectly identifies the huge year-on-year cost that farmers pay when they manage the risks they face on their own. Blockchain is still in its infancy and smart contracts need to be very simple. Hence at the moment they are only being considered for conditions that can be measured easily, such as rainfall. Chris Udry, King professor of economics at Northwestern University, Illinois, says blockchain will play a supporting, rather than a lead, role in crop insurance. Being able to make mobile payouts immediately when an index insurance trigger is reached will be good, he says. “But its importance pales in comparison to designing an index that is strongly correlated with farmer profits — a goal that is still far from being achieved,” he says. Smart contracts could be used to decentralise the insurance and reinsurance contracting process, perhaps permitting more efficient diversification, he says. “But again, this is less important than the reduction in transaction costs via mobile money, the establishment of trust that payouts will be made, or the design of contracts that reduce risk.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jane Bird","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-12-05","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/video/0622eab9-71e5-49ee-a583-912feca160e6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fc4e68ebd-c166-42cd-9c29-992ab737ecb4?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/88ff36c4-f795-11e8-8b7c-6fa24bd5409c","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F97b4a0cc-f79b-11e8-8b7c-6fa24bd5409c?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Crypto miners undeterred by market collapse, Argo Blockchain says","INTRO":"Steep fall in value of many virtual coins has failed to dent demand in mining subscriptions","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Left HODL’ing the bag? London-listed Argo Blockchain on Tuesday said crypto enthusiasts are still clamouring for its coin mining services despite a market collapse that has severely dented the profitability of such operations. The company that made its debut on the London Stock Exchange this August said the total number of crypto mining packages it sold has surged to 10,325 as of Tuesday from 4,200 on October 1. “Our mining packages are being snapped up as quickly as we make these available and demand continues to exceed supply,” said Mike Edwards, Argo co-founder. The update boosted Argo’s share price by almost 25 per cent on Tuesday to 5.88p, but the shares remains deeply discounted compared with the listing price of 16p. Argo offers a service that allows users to mine coins using its servers for a monthly subscription. Mining, the process through which new coins are created by computers that solve complex mathematical problems, was lucrative during the heights of the bitcoin boom late last year but has since run into a series of pitfalls. “Because of the current depressed price, many bitcoin miners have been unable to sustain operations,” Sam Doctor, head of data science research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said last week. Mr Doctor said the cash cost of mining one bitcoin using a popular device is now $4,500 or $5,700 when also including elements like depreciation. Bitcoin traded at $3,964 per coin on Tuesday, down 71 per cent on the year to date and well off highs above $19,000 struck a year ago. Argo, for its part, remains confident: “Despite a recent downturn in the cryptocurrency market, we are continuing to experience a strong ramp-up in revenues due to good execution of our growth strategy,” Mr Edwards said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Adam Samson","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-12-04","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/fcd307ab-804e-3f99-9cc3-338ad5e00c5f","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Ff9f0ce1c-b91e-4534-a3be-d9742ffc1afa_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Calastone switches mutual fund trades to blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Calastone is making a bold bet on the power of blockchain to transform fund management by moving more than 1,700 financial companies — for which it processes mutual fund trades — to the online ledger. The London technology group will complete the switch in May. It will be one of the industry’s biggest transfers to date in terms of widescale use of blockchain to buy and sell funds. The change will help “transform the way in which funds are traded”, said Julien Hammerson, chief executive at Calastone. He said funds were “hampered by continually rising costs and threat of competition, ultimately rendering the current system economically and operationally unsustainable”. Blockchain emerged as a means to keep track of bitcoin ownership but mainstream financial groups have been keen to explore its potential to simplify processes and cut costs. In a traditional fund transaction, companies ranging from transfer agents to asset managers often have to input the same information, which is costly, time-consuming and open to error. Blockchain eliminates most of the laborious practices. Calastone estimates that switching to blockchain could shave up to £3.4bn from fund distribution costs. This figure excludes the US market where the Depository Trust \u0026 Clearing Corporation already provides a centralised system for settling trades. Calastone said it was too soon to say whether its charging structure would change, as blockchain would fundamentally alter how transactions take place. It said it was up to fund managers to pass on any savings from lower costs. BNP Paribas Asset Management and Ostrum Asset Management have completed end-to-end fund transaction tests using blockchain technology. Last month investors including Standard Life Aberdeen and Columbia Threadneedle said they had formed a retail fund platform specialising in impact funds that will use blockchain. Regulators and policymakers are scrambling to understand blockchain and whether it poses risks to privacy and security. “Rapid growth of the technology and the growing menu of blockchain platforms coupled with its differences from traditional technology has made it challenging for companies to understand how best to apply, employ and harness the value of blockchain while managing associated risks — risks they might not fully be aware of,” according to a recent report by KPMG, the accountancy group. Calastone, which used blockchain to buy and sell mutual funds under test conditions in 2017, said the technology was satisfactory. It will be using multiple data centres and clouds to protect the system. “We wouldn’t do this unless we were totally confident in terms of safety and security,” said Andrew Tomlinson, chief marketing officer.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jennifer Thompson","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-12-02","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/05d41660-f7c8-11e8-af46-2022a0b02a6c","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F1d30cee4-f7db-11e8-a154-2b65ddf314e9?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Swift takes on fintechs with new payment system","INTRO":"Banks seek to hedge tech bets with legacy platform’s latest pilot","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Legacy payments platform Swift is piloting a new system to speed up banks’ cross-border transfers and reduce errors, firing a shot across the bow of a blockchain-based project that claims to do the same thing and payments fintechs that offer cheaper, faster services. Founded in 1973, Swift was banks’ original answer to the question of how to move money around the world more quickly and easily. The platform is now owned by 2,500 banks and is used to shift more than $200bn around the world daily. Inefficiencies, however, have left the platform ripe for competition from payments start-ups such as Revolut and TransferWise, as well as the Interbank Information Network (IIN). More than 130 banks, led by JPMorgan Chase, have signed on to the blockchain-based IIN project, which shares information between banks on a mutual distributed ledger. That allows them to quickly resolve errors and compliance issues that can delay payments by weeks. In a testament to how banks are hedging their bets on the future of payments, several of those banks are now part of a pilot for Swift’s own fix for lengthy payment delays — — a new “prevalidation” system in which banks use an application programming interface (API) to access each other’s data to check things such as the validity of bank account numbers when a payment is initiated. Under the blockchain-based system information is shared on a mutually distributed ledger hosted on the cloud that can be accessed and edited by all participants in real time. The API system, by contrast, allows banks to access each other’s data on a bilateral basis, ensuring the recipient’s account information is correct before it is sent in an effort to reduce delays. “We know that there are still some payments which are badly formatted and missing some information,” said Luc Meurant, chief marketing officer of Swift. “Instead of correcting that later in the chain and delaying payment, we are trying to anticipate as many of those issues as possible (with prevalidation) so payments can be processed faster.” Swift estimated that around 10 per cent of all payments on its platform were held up because of errors. Manish Kohli, global head of payments and receivables at Citi, said the new system would “considerably reduce” the costs banks incur to resolve problematic payments and would improve customer experiences. That would “absolutely” allow banks to cut pricing and compete more effectively with fintechs, he added. Mr Meurant said that while the solution was going after “exactly the same kind of issues” as IIN, Swift’s fix was superior because its angle is “one of scale and industrialisation” and the solution could be rolled out to Swift’s 10,000-plus members relatively quickly. Recommended JPMorgan Chase has been the leading voice on the IIN, but is also one of the 15 banks taking part in the Swift pilot. A spokesman declined to comment on the relative merits of the two projects and JPMorgan’s decision to back both. Mr Kohli said his bank, which has not joined the IIN, believed the Swift solution was more viable because APIs were already widely used within banks in applications such as sharing customer data to give people an aggregate view of their accounts in one place. “We felt this would be faster to scale,” said Mr Kohli, adding that payments solutions only really work if they are ubiquitous. He pointed to Swift’s success in introducing its global payments innovation (GPI) as evidence that it can achieve quick adoption. GPI, which allowed payments to be tracked end to end and introduced transparency on fees, was introduced more than a year ago and is being used in more than 50 per cent of Swift’s payments. It will be used exclusively by 2020 by users of the Swift network.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Laura Noonan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-12-04","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/fb2b834d-c046-3fa6-9ccb-1d8056f27e6f","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fbb34ba58-4c14-4c14-a04a-60d48b994f8c_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"A visual tour of the crypto-market right now","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Bitcoin was $4,600 at pixel, according to Coinbase, which is not the lowest price it sold for on Tuesday ($4,200), but is 8 per cent less than the original crypto-coin would have got you 24 hours ago.

So when a bulk shipment of soyabeans left Argentina for Malaysia this year, the use of blockchain technology to shake up the centuries-old system of trade finance transactions caused a stir. HSBC and ING handled a letter of credit backing the shipment for US food group Cargill relying on blockchain technology developed by software company R3. This cut the time needed to exchange documentation to 24 hours instead of the traditional five to 10 days. It was billed as the first commercially viable trade-finance transaction using blockchain, an electronic distributed ledger of transactions that records data in digital blocks. Blockchain promises to save time and money for the shipping industry, which still relies heavily on paper documents such as bills of lading, cargo insurance and invoices, as well as letters of credit. Alisa DiCaprio, head of global trade strategy and research at R3, says the sheer extent of paperwork involved in a typical shipping transaction frequently produces some kind of query or discrepancy. “The packing list might say this is a cargo of ‘soyabean’ not ‘soyabean meal’, and so the documents would have to go back and forth to confirm what was being shipped,” she says. “With blockchain, both sides have to confirm simultaneously, so that catches any problems or discrepancies straight away.” The food industry has also been quick to adopt blockchain technology, in part to improve food safety after a series of scandals. In China, six babies died and thousands were ill in 2008 after drinking milk laced with a harmful chemical, melamine. In the UK and Ireland in 2013, consumers learnt they might have eaten horsemeat after it was mislabelled as beef in frozen burgers and ready meals. Food companies are now using blockchain platforms to track their supply chain. One use is to help prove to consumers that the free-range egg they had for breakfast did not originate from a factory farm and that palm oil in their biscuits is not produced by child labour. Use of blockchain means retailers can trace back in detail to where a particular crop was grown. “A baby food retailer of a sweet potato and pumpkin meal, for example, can see in the system which farm the sweet potato came from. So if there is any problem . . . they can find the farm and even which batch it came from,” says Ramesh Gopinath, vice-president of supply chain solutions at IBM. Such detailed information can help companies quickly identify and recall batches of goods if contamination is suspected. It also helps demonstrate ethical credentials to consumers concerned about the sourcing of products. In Wyoming, some cattle ranches log the identities of calves via blockchain so the ultimate buyer can prove these are open-range cattle, which command a higher price. Olinga Taeed, visiting professor in blockchain at Birmingham City Business School, says consumers are demanding more transparency. “Where [blockchain] has been adopted by businesses like food and logistics, that’s where businesses can use it to improve the bottom line and differentiate themselves,” he says. Some technology start-ups, such as Provenance, help food and drink companies track the origin of their supplies using blockchain. Jessi Baker founded the business while working on her computer science doctorate. The idea was inspired by her upbringing in the rural English county of Wiltshire, where her mother grew garden vegetables and bought local produce. “The information helps businesses themselves know where their products are coming from, and also consumers who want more and more information,” she says. “It could be for quality reasons or because of allergies or diet issues or because of their personal values.” Provenance recently took part in an international pilot tracking tuna from Maluku in Indonesia through the south-east Asian fishing industry and works with companies such as the UK’s Co-operative Group. Use of blockchain to verify the supply chain in other industries such as mining is also driven by growing ethical concerns among consumers and investors. Investment manager Hermes recently called for carmakers to adopt blockchain technology to help prove where the cobalt in their batteries comes from. More than half the world’s cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Amnesty International recently claimed child labour was being used in its extraction. De Beers is trialling digital tracking to ensure the diamonds it sells are sourced ethically De Beers, the world’s largest diamond producer, is trialling digital tracking to ensure the diamonds it sells are sourced ethically from small miners in Sierra Leone. Lord Hodge, a justice of the UK’s Supreme Court, said in a speech last month that blockchain’s distributed ledger technology could provide a record of who owns what, stamping out illegal trading in conflict diamonds. Another advantage was that it provides a permanent record. “The preservation of an accurate historical record would be an important weapon in holding people accountable for the performance of their fiduciary and other duties,” he said. The data stored on blockchain cannot be changed and some believe this could lead to fewer legal disputes. However, Christina Blacklaws, president of the UK’s Law Society, says there could still be litigation. “It may lead to fewer disputes or to different types of disputes — perhaps ones about expectations of a contract rather than the execution of a contract.” Others point out that blockchain relies on information entered by people. “Blockchain is dependent on a human being for information and if you have a human being taking a bribe to put information on the blockchain, that could potentially happen,” warns IBM’s Mr Gopinath. WINNER Flex and Elementum Increasing velocity Electronics manufacturer Flex decided to create its own private supply chain visualisation software, known as Flex Pulse, in 2015. Lawyers, supply chain specialists and data scientists created the software and Pulse centres that provide Flex with a real-time view of its 14,000 or so suppliers. This has greatly increased the speed at which goods travel around its supply chain, reducing movement times by an average 11.7 days a year. With the help of Elementum’s data on anything from a tsunami to an industrial strike, the supply chain can be viewed on mobile devices as well as at an increasing number of physical Pulse Centers. Flex Pulse alerted the company to the 2015 Tianjin port explosion and the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake moments after they happened, allowing the company to activate contingency plans that saved an estimated $55m in disruption costs. Anheuser-Busch InBev Transparency After its 2016 takeover of SABMiller, global drinks company AB InBev set out to pinpoint risk with vendors such as fraud, money-laundering and supply-side bribery. The compliance and technology teams use data analysis to assess which vendors have the highest risk of government collusion. The programme predicts with 85 per cent-plus accuracy irregular contacts with government. BHP Influencing supplier behaviours Lawyers at mining company BHP rolled out a global contract management system this year to transform the way it works with its suppliers. Use of the platform will soon be mandatory for all suppliers. The global contract management system includes a due diligence process, mechanisms for monitoring supplier activity and automation tools that integrate with BHP’s systems. This also allows BHP to reinforce its charter values and code of conduct by influencing supplier behaviour. CargoX Removing friction Until recently, bills of lading — the document a carrier issues to acknowledge the receipt of a cargo to be shipped — were mainly done on paper. If lost, paper bills could not be replaced and had to be publicly declared void, leading to costs and delays. Slovenian company CargoX began offering a bill of lading based on blockchain technology, which enables ownership to be transferred instantly on receipt of funds. This cuts the risk of loss in transit and fees. CargoX’s first shipment using the “smart” bill of lading arrived in Slovenia from Shanghai in August. De Beers Creating trust Diamond company De Beers developed Tracr in 2017 to track the path of a diamond from mine to consumer. The platform is based on blockchain and uses artificial intelligence to detect anomalies and leverages the internet of things — appliances and industrial equipment connected to the internet — to capture sensor data through the supply chain. Each diamond is assigned a unique number, which is entered every time it moves to a new stage, from mining to cutting to shop. By May, De Beers had developed a secure digital trail for all of its rough diamonds above 10.8 carats, with the ability to track any diamond above five carats. Hyundai Motor Europe Protecting consumers The Hyundai Motor Europe legal team has developed a way to ensure customers who buy cars from unauthorised dealers can still qualify for a manufacturer’s warranty. When customers go to authorised dealers to have their cars serviced, the dealer uses a new IT system that tracks the vehicle identification number to verify the original point of sale. If it was sold by an unauthorised dealer, the system helps the owner enrol in the goodwill warranty programme. Hyundai can use the data to choose which unauthorised dealers to pursue. Kenco and Smart Gladiator Transparency Retailers can make up to 10 per cent of their income from charging manufacturers for goods damaged in transit, a percentage that is increasing as compliance rules expand. To protect their manufacturing clients, Kenco, a logistics company, developed LoadProof in 2017. LoadProof is an app that uploads images, times, dates and shipment details at every stage of the supply chain, making it possible to detect where merchandise was damaged. Kenco worked with technology company Smart Gladiator to protect its customers from the financial penalties charged by retailers. In one instance, it reduced a single client’s retail customer complaints by 95 per cent. Nestlé and Starling Promoting sustainability After global food and drink company Nestlé was criticised for not doing enough to prevent deforestation in its supply chain, it partnered with Starling, a satellite-based service, created by Airbus, The Forest Trust and SarVision. Starling, implemented in September, allows Nestlé to map and monitor its suppliers. The service tracks changes in the vegetation surrounding the plantations of certain suppliers across the global palm oil supply chain. When Starling alerts Nestlé to signs of deforestation, Nestlé works with the supplier and NGOs to ensure compliance with its standards on responsible sourcing. Provenance Transparency Blockchain technology company Provenance works with UK businesses including the Co-op, Unilever and J Sainsbury to track goods from source to shelf. Each product is assigned a digital footprint to help verify marketing claims. This helps them comply with consumer protection laws and build trust with a new generation of consumers concerned about sustainable sourcing. Unilever Removing friction To help the business maintain ethical sourcing, Unilever’s legal team mapped the social footprint, a measurement of the impact on people, of its tea supply chain in 2016. The year-long pilot project was aimed at encouraging sustainable farming projects and enabled Unilever to assess the potential for human rights abuse in each location. Its data, technology and analytics cut quality problems by 20 per cent across the company. With the introduction of plain language and visual contracts, or contracts that use simpler language and images to communicate, the legal team is working to improve relationships with its suppliers.

Boasting 800 beds, a rooftop pool deck and a 20ft outdoor television, the site’s owner is turning it into a private real estate investment trust. Half of the property will then be sold via 955 tokens, priced at $21,000 each, and their ownership recorded as digital securities on a blockchain. What makes the deal notable is that the tokens are being sold by the real estate investment arm of DRW, one of the biggest proprietary traders in the US and an enthusiastic trader of bitcoin last year as cryptocurrency mania exploded alongside enthusiasm for the blockchain technology underpinning them. Nor was DRW the only representative from mainstream finance to try to ride the crypto and blockchain bandwagon. CME Group and Cboe Global Markets rapidly introduced bitcoin futures. Their controversial launch came just weeks before the price of bitcoin peaked in late December, ushering in a 75 per cent crash that burnt many. But Don Wilson, the founder and chief executive of DRW, and long-term investor in cryptocurrency infrastructure, is undeterred. The move by Convexity Properties, the real estate arm of DRW, is, he says, a small step towards a world that brings together cryptotrading and blockchain in the form of security tokens — a digital share backed by a tangible, real-world asset. “For someone who wants to invest [in property] it can be very hard to do. From our perspective it’s cumbersome to sell part of a building,” says Mr Wilson. “Any physical tangible thing you can look at tokenising. You can tokenise gold or oil.” Even as cryptocurrencies collapse, DRW is not the only company persevering with experiments in both digital currencies, tokens and blockchain. In October Fidelity, one of the world’s biggest asset managers, started a business to facilitate cryptocurrency trading for investors including hedge funds and family offices. The Nasdaq exchange is reportedly sticking with a plan to list bitcoin futures. For some, the ultimate ambition is a world in which ownership of digital securities can bypass the infrastructure of modern finance. Selling a fraction of the value of an asset that can be freely traded with ownership recorded on a ledger should, supporters claim, make it more liquid and cheaper. As cryptocurrencies raced higher last December, regulators became increasingly concerned. A year on, lawyers say the ambiguity over the regulation of digital currencies and tokens remains a risk for investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that initial coin offerings (ICOs) — backed by tokens that raise capital from investors — could be considered securities offerings, while the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority is currently assessing possible regulation of cryptocurrencies. Claire Cummings, a lawyer at Cummings in London, said the uncertainty over the regulation would deter some retail investors, for whom $10,000 was still a lot of money. Without it, they would be reliant on the technology not being corrupted or hacked, she said. This technology is developing a lot like the way derivatives were in the 1990s — on the fringes and understood by the few It is a view echoed by Axel Pierron, an analyst at Opimas Consulting. Creating digital tokens based on traditional securities such as bonds “will certainly address investors’ quality concerns, but it is riding — at no expense — on the quality assurances provided by the traditional capital markets and the regulation surrounding it”. None of which has so far been enough to sap the enthusiasm of some. Crypto exchanges such as Coinbase, Goldman Sachs-backed Circle and UK-based Archax are all planning to trade security tokens, as are existing exchanges such as Six, the Swiss Exchange, and Bakkt, a venture of Intercontinental Exchange. “This technology is developing a lot like the way derivatives were in the 1990s — on the fringes and understood by the few,” said Tom Zeeb, head of securities and exchanges at Six. “Twenty-five years later and it’s part of a fund manager’s toolkit. It’s a five- to 10-year process.” That is certainly the bet from DRW, which is separately contesting civil charges from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over alleged interest rate market manipulation. The Convexity tokens will be handled by Harbor, a US start-up compliance platform backed by ventura capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and Pantera Capital. Recommended Josh Stein, chief executive of Harbor, acknowledged that the public markets for securities such as shares would remain highly liquid, but insisted that digital tokens could make help make other assets more liquid and open them up to a wider audience. “People raise more money privately than publicly these days but there’s no liquidity in those investments. They’ll never be as liquid as public markets but they can be more liquid than they are now,” he said. Those with ambitions for blockchain and digital currencies have often collided with reality over the past year, but not everyone has given up.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-28","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/3dca8588-d061-11e8-9a3c-5d5eac8f1ab4","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fa1e31e54-e71d-11e8-8a85-04b8afea6ea3?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Digital legal papers give greater access to justice","INTRO":"Secure systems will lower cost barriers and extend the rule of law","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When Alejandro Alvarez says “greater access to legal documents is an important component to achieving greater access to justice”, the UN legal expert is underlining the importance of contracts to how society and business function from day to day. As head of the rule of law unit in the UN secretary-general’s office in New York, he is close to the UN’s Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, under which the global organisation aims to help countries “enact effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels of society”. Business has a role to play in this societal challenge, Mr Alvarez says. “Much of the innovation in using technology for access to legal documents is happening in the private sector, and we encourage partnerships between the private sector and states,” he says. Tim Cummins, chief executive of the US-based International Association of Commercial Contract Managers, agrees that greater innovation and efficiency in business contracts will lead to better access to justice. “In their current form, contracts can become a barrier to social inclusion,” he says. “People can be intimidated by the entire process of contracts.” One route to improvement, he says, is to overhaul the “artisanal nature of present-day contract writing”. Mr Cummins adds that idiosyncratic contracts may be liked by law firms, which bill by the hour for drafting them, but they are often unnecessary — and achieving efficiency in contracting is good for all. Aine Lyons, deputy general counsel at US-based software company VMware, says one of the main aims of “smart contracting” is to make legal services simple and to replicate in digital form what people are used to in daily life. VMware’s legal department has developed some digital innovations that make the process of contracts and negotiation easier, including a self-service portal for creating non-disclosure agreements. When employees need to generate an NDA, usually on sharing commercially sensitive information with suppliers, they use a smartphone app or tablet to answer a few questions, from which a contract is generated. “There [are] considerable efficiencies in the process but, as importantly, we’re empowering our employees to take responsibility [for] the process and protect our data,” says Ms Lyons. In Ukraine, Yuriy Zaremba is exploring how machines rather than lawyers can handle contracts. The co-founder of Kiev-based AxDraft says people are surprised by the breadth of work that can be automated. “Even the most complex M\u0026A deals have a lot of code-able patterns,” he says. For shipping and manufacturing clients, AxDraft can develop “smart forms” for common requirements such as claims against suppliers for delay of delivery and violation of contracts. Almost any legal document can be coded and formulated in about a week, he says. “The key is to determine the pattern and develop a template.” US tech start-up Ironclad is also working on improving the efficiency of contracting by applying technology to “problems [that] machines are better at than humans”, says James Honsa, who oversees deployment at the company, based in Silicon Valley. He says legal teams in many industries are dealing with the “same poor contracts problems” of inefficiency and lack of helpful analytics. Automation and good data processing are not the only benefits technology brings to contracts. Security and trust are also vital to contracting parties, which is where innovations such as blockchain can help. “The whole point of a contract is to create an unassailable account of an agreement. But when an organisation is dealing with tens of thousands of contracts, traditional contracting becomes burdensome,” says Chad Jerdee, general counsel at Accenture. The management consultancy’s legal team has developed a platform based on years of contract analytics and blockchain technology, which provides an immutable record of every contract, including the contract’s lifecycle and an auditable history. “This platform helps [Accenture] build trust in relationships,” Mr Jerdee says. “Access to legal services beyond the privileged few who can afford it is becoming an increasing issue in society.” Entrepreneur David Fisher says trust is the key to better contracting, which led him to set up Integra Ledger, a blockchain to support legal documents. While most blockchains — such as the one governing bitcoin — are public and can be accessed and interrogated by anyone, Integra Ledger is a private blockchain overseen by the legal industry and is a system for hosting contracts and other legal documents. “Legal contracts, which need to be kept confidential, can benefit from the immutability that blockchain provides,” he says. For Mr Fisher, blockchain technology has good potential to improve access to legal documents in developing countries. “In the developed world, where there is already a high degree of social trust, blockchain will create incremental value and add efficiencies to contracting,” he says. “For developing countries — especially where the rule of law is more tenuous — blockchain will become a massive disrupter in the same way that mobile technology leapfrogged wired telephone lines.” WINNER VMware, Apttus, QuisLex and ThinkSmart (Mitratech) Standardising contracts As the contracts essential to VMware’s global technology service business increased in both number and in complexity, the company’s legal team rewrote its entire contracting process. In 2013, the team first reduced their involvement in contracting with the help of contract management software from Apttus. This halved the number of contract templates while managing the risks and liabilities in the complex agreements. VMware automated simple contracts such as non-disclosure agreements with the help of QuisLex, the legal process outsourcer. It used ThinkSmart’s portal to enable contract approval on “any device, anywhere”. Finalising contracts now happens 50 per cent faster and the work with QuisLex saves more than $8.4m a year. Axa Smart contracts and blockchain Thousands of EU residents experience flight delays of more than two hours every year, but only a few claim compensation. The insurance group Axa is making the process easier with Fizzy, a smart contract launched in 2017 that uses blockchain to automate compensation. Customers enter their flight details and the application uses data from the previous seven years to show the risk of delay and quotes for coverage. If a flight is delayed for more than two hours, the smart contract self-executes and compensates the policyholder. It currently covers 70 per cent of EU flights. Axiom and the University of North Carolina Standardising contracts When the University of North Carolina set out to reduce the time spent negotiating clinical trial and confidentiality agreements, it looked at where negotiations had failed previously. With the help of Axiom, the managed services provider, it was able to identify contractual clauses that caused repeated problems. As a result, negotiation times have dropped by up to 70 per cent since April, generating revenues of more than $30m a year. Capgemini Smart contracts and blockchain Professional services company Capgemini operates in 40 countries, employs more than 200,000 people and works with contracts in multiple languages. The range and diversity of its contracts had grown each year, until it exceeded company capacity. Lawyers used Symfact to collate and digitise more than 10,000 contracts, storing them in a searchable central repository. Next, iManage Ravn was used to review high-value portfolios. The technology tracks obligations, flags breaches and identifies renewals. Visualisation tool Tableau was then used to create digestible reports, summarising entire client portfolios. Dropbox and Ironclad Automation The Dropbox legal team wanted to reduce the time spent reviewing simple legal contracts and turned to Ironclad, a US West Coast-based provider of contract management software. Together, they created a playbook for non-disclosure agreements that non-specialist business colleagues could execute. Almost a quarter of the company’s estimated 6,000 annual contracts have been executed on Ironclad since 2016. The software integrates with other technology and is easy to adopt, which allowed the lawyers at Dropbox to focus on more complex transactions. eBay and LawGeex Simplifying the approvals process Working with Israeli artificial intelligence company LawGeex, eBay streamlined the way it handled its high volume of “low-risk, low-dollar” contracts. When simple contracts reach the management system, the AI reviews them and assigns them a risk level. Low-risk “green” documents receive a brief human review before being sent for immediate signature. If it identifies a more significant risk, the contract is escalated for review. This triage approach reduced review times by up to 50 per cent in some cases in the past year. HPE and Apttus Reducing lawyer involvement The enterprise information technology company HPE implemented Apttus’s contract management tool to store contracts, manage and automate parts of the process, and collect new data. This cut contract response times in half from 48 to 24 hours, and halved negotiation times. The tool has also collected more than 3m data points, which are used to identify risk, predicting contracting costs with 99 per cent accuracy. London Stock Exchange Group, Radiant Law, Lawyers on Demand Standardising contracts Facing an increased need for legal services, the London Stock Exchange Group first standardised contract templates and automated its processes in 2011 with the help of Radiant Law, a technology and outsourcing boutique. Early this year it enlisted flexible resourcing firm Lawyers on Demand to help with procurement and intragroup agreements. The dual-provider model also trials technologies for the London Stock Exchange, allowing it to bring products to market faster. Shell International Visual contracts When the legal team at Shell decided to make its contracting process easier for non-English speaking customers, they designed a visual contract, which was piloted this year. Starting with Shell’s marine lubricants business, the legal team rewrote its general terms and conditions in plain English, added clear headings and visual elements and reduced the word count by 38 per cent. It has led to a significantly faster renewal of hard-to-close accounts since the change. The AA and Thomson Reuters Legal Managed Services, Syke, Thomson Reuters Contract Express, eBrevia Integrating different technologies With just eight weeks to review and amend 2,600 contracts before the introduction of the EU’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), the AA engaged consulting group Syke. Thomson Reuters then used eBrevia’s artificial intelligence tool to review and extract contract data from the AA’s agreements and automatically generate new contracts with Contract Express software. The automated process allowed the AA to meet the deadline at a fifth of the cost of a traditional approach, and agreement data were added to the AA’s SAP systems.

AP Moller-Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd and Ocean Network Express — five of the biggest six container shipping lines, which together transport nearly two-thirds of all seaborne freight — announced plans to start an association to work on standards that would be openly and freely available to all third parties such as customers, ports and customs authorities. “It’s really important. What we are talking about is simply having standards for how we communicate with each other and with our customers. We will make hooking up our customers digitally much more cost effective if we can agree common standards,” said Soren Skou, Maersk’s chief executive. Maersk and IBM have already laid out plans to use blockchain to make supply chains more efficient. But their proposals had raised fears in the shipping industry that the big groups could all use their own individual solutions, making it difficult for customers or ports to deal with them all efficiently. André Simha, chief information officer at MSC and spokesman for the group of shipping companies, said: “We collaborate on tech and let CEOs and commercial do their part. It makes a lot sense . . . There are very few standards. It comes a bit from the frustration, and of course being pushed from our customers.” The idea of the proposed non-profit association — which aims to start up early next year, subject to regulatory approval — is not to approve new technological solutions such as using blockchain but to provide standards to allow for easier information sharing through the supply chain. Mr Simha said that MSC could have something like 200 different types of message for different ports around the world, all with the same basic information. “That’s an overhead that is ridiculous for everyone . . . It’s been very difficult from the tech side that we all could communicate the required information. If we had had a standard for schedules or bookings I would have been a happy guy,” he added. He said MSC, the world’s second-largest container group, would “love to be involved” in Maersk and IBM’s blockchain initiative if it were made “more open”. He added that MSC was “more inclined to consortium-based initiatives that are not about profits”. Mr Simha said he expected the entire industry to come onboard. “If we can agree on these things all together, it will make a lot more sense whether it’s dealing with custom authorities or customers who want to see their rates.” His comments came as Maersk released third-quarter results with both revenues and profits slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations. The Danish shipping and logistics group warned that it expected global container trade to be reduced by 0.5-2 per cent in the next two years due to the tariff conflict between the US and China. “The impact right now on US-China trade is that Chinese imports to the US have gone up, and US exports to China have gone down. Obviously there will be a price to be paid some time in the first quarter,” Mr Skou said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Richard Milne","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-14","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/01ce4072-d14e-11e8-9a3c-5d5eac8f1ab4","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Ff52fdf00-d90f-11e8-aa22-36538487e3d0?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Fintech: Regulation trips Canada’s stock exchange blockchain test","INTRO":"The legal side, rather than technology, proves the problem for central bank pilot","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Stock exchange operators from Shanghai to New York are looking at distributed ledger technology (DLT) in hopes that it can make their computer systems more efficient, reliable, and secure. A pilot project in Canada suggests that these potential benefits will take time to realise, however, and that working around regulations will be a bigger hurdle than perfecting the technology itself. Worldwide, three quarters of the financial market infrastructure operators surveyed by Nasdaq and Celent are working on distributed ledger technology pilots or already using DLT. The Australian Securities Exchange is the first major bourse to commit to replacing part of its settlement infrastructure with DLT, although it recently delayed the switch by six months to spring 2021. An eight-week DLT pilot by Canada’s central bank suggests that practical applications for the technology may take even longer to arrive. “We see that there is promise in distributed ledger,” said Scott Hendry, director of financial technology at the Bank of Canada, in March when he announced the completion of the pilot, named Project Jasper Phase 3. “But when you are looking at core systems that are systemically important and have been optimised over 20 years or more, the bar is very high for this alternative technology to offer significant benefit,” he added. In the first two phases of Project Jasper, the bank worked with the national payments network operator, Payments Canada, to build a distributed ledger technology system for cash transfers between banks. TMX Group — which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange — joined for Phase 3, which involved building a proof of concept system that could instantly execute the swap of cash and equities for agreed-upon trades. Such a system could ultimately form part of a more complete DLT trading infrastructure which proponents hope will be faster and reduce reconciliation costs. The project’s leaders say, however, that there are many more questions to answer before those benefits arrive. “It’s less and less about the technology, actually, as that matures and becomes more production ready,” says Andrew McCormack, vice-president of payments and technology at Payments Canada. “It’s more about the regulatory, the legal, the monetary policy issues.” It’s less and less about the technology. It’s more about the regulatory, the legal, the monetary policy issues For example, Mr McCormack says, brokers needed digital cash in order to pay for securities within the distributed ledger system in the pilot. The most technically straightforward option was to give them access to funds issued by the central bank. A previous phase of the Jasper project had already made this digital cash available to major banks. However, Mr McCormack says giving it to brokers would have “crossed the chasm and literally broke our own bylaws and, in actual fact, laws”. Brokers do not typically meet the balance sheet requirements that banks have to pass in order to gain access to central bank cash, in what is called the high-value payment system, explains Mr McCormack. It raised the question: “How do we get the cash, on-ledger, to those who are doing the equities trades to facilitate the magic of what this platform can give us?” Ultimately, the team found a technical solution by giving different levels of access to cash and credit to different participants. The ability to set rules like this is a key advantage that a private DLT platform has over bitcoin-style public blockchains, which give everyone equal access. A private platform of this kind can be built to follow existing banking rules — maintaining the distinct roles of the central bank, commercial banks, and brokers. Even with this capacity, Mr McCormack still believes regulatory changes will eventually be required to facilitate any move to DLT. These legal questions need more attention. “Otherwise you’re just building TV on the internet,” he says. “We are trying to figure out a way to do this better.” The Bank of Canada is not yet engaging with this part of the problem. “The bank has not considered making regulatory changes in order to facilitate a change to DLT,” says Mr Hendry. “There’s a tremendous amount of governance,” says John Lee, managing director of enterprise innovation and product development at the TMX Group. The digital cash-for-equity swap might seem simple, but managing risk and ensuring ironclad reliability are not. Project Jasper simply proved that such a system could function. Whether it could perform at scale and meet security, resilience, and credit-risk standards remains an open question. Is the cost and disruption worth it? That’s exactly what we’re thinking about “If you truly want to put this into production and scale it up, you have to deal with the non-glorious elements,” says Mr Lee. “There needs to be a reason that DLT was the best technical solution for that use case.” For Mr McCormack, finding those truly useful applications means deciding which parts of a nation’s financial markets’ infrastructure ought to be included in a DLT system. The Jasper pilot was limited to securities settlement. A future system might incorporate other steps in a securities trade; other assets, like derivatives or bonds; or integrate with trading systems in other countries. The Canadian experiment simultaneously demonstrated the need to consider these more-complex applications, and the difficulty of bringing them to fruition. “If you are too narrow, it is tough to find the business case,” says Mr McCormack. “It’s more and more obvious to us now that we need to be ambitious in scope.” In the end, Mr McCormack believes the merit of any switch to DLT should be judged on a cost-benefit basis. “Is the cost and disruption worth it?” he asks. “That’s exactly what we’re thinking about.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Joshua Oliver","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-12","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/3595fc5a-0340-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F3e766dba-0349-11e9-bf0f-53b8511afd73?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blythe Masters steps down as Digital Asset chief executive","INTRO":"Former banker will remain a board member and adviser to the blockchain start-up","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blythe Masters is stepping down as chief executive of blockchain software developer Digital Asset for “personal reasons” after nearly four years in the role. Ms Masters, a former JPMorgan Chase executive and a prominent figure in the global blockchain industry, will remain a board member, strategic adviser and shareholder of the fintech start-up, according to a company statement. She joined Digital Asset in March 2015 and steered its development into a company working with global businesses and exchanges to use blockchain. Also called distributed ledger technology, blockchain underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin but has been heralded for its potential to overhaul the financial sector. Ms Masters joined Digital Asset — which works with companies to use distributed ledger and is one of the best-funded designers of blockchain software for the financial sector — a year after it was set up, following almost three decades at JPMorgan. While at the US bank she was instrumental in developing the credit default swap, a financial contract that mitigates exposure to potential company defaults on debt. “She had a pretty big impact because she was one of the only proponents of blockchain in the early days,” said a person in the industry. “She was important because of what she did at JPMorgan, where she was seen as an innovator. “She brought the [blockchain] sector credibility at a time when there wasn’t much experience.” Recommended The person noted that Ms Masters was also one of the only senior women in the male-dominated sector. At a conference earlier this year, Ms Masters said there was an “advancement problem” for women in the technology sector that was worse than in the finance sector. Digital Asset said AG Gangadhar, who joined the company’s board of directors in April, had been appointed chairman and would serve as acting chief executive until a permanent replacement was found. Blockchain is an electronic database of transactions that is continuously updated and verified. The ledger is shared among hundreds of other computer servers and guarded by cryptography, making it virtually impossible for a single entity to make changes. Advocates are attracted to blockchain’s ability to offer a verifiable, immutable and public record. Companies in the financial sector from stock exchanges to banks are looking at ways to deploy the technology to cut costs, enhance security and improve efficiencies of scale. The Hong Kong stock exchange this year said it was working with its Australian counterpart to share information on blockchain. Charles Li, HKEX chief executive, said the exchange was seeking to use blockchain in areas such as stock borrowing and lending, and for a number of over-the-counter trades. “There’s definitely a lot of interest but many institutions are still at the exploration stage and pilot phases,” said Henri Arslanian, chairman of the FinTech Association of Hong Kong. “The industry thought it would move faster than it has a few years ago, but companies have spent time in the development and testing stages. For many companies, the benefit of using blockchain is cost reduction, in areas such as trade finance to remittances.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Emma Dunkley","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-12-19","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/57b1064a-c1a5-11e8-84cd-9e601db069b8","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fbe5d61ba-ddcd-11e8-b173-ebef6ab1374a?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Banks find a use for blockchain: cross border payments","INTRO":"The JPMorgan-led Interbank Information Network is starting to work at scale","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Finally banks may have found a problem that blockchain is able to solve now and at scale: cross border currency transfers. The banking sector has seen years of overhype and experimentation surrounding distributed ledger technology, but one project led by JPMorgan Chase, the Interbank Information Network (IIN), is quietly producing results at scale. The IIN is essentially a more efficient way for participating banks to transfer US dollars across borders and institutions. Its elevator pitch is that problematic payments, which are currently being held up for as much as two days for compliance issues or to resolve errors, could go through almost instantly under the new system. The network does not have the wow factor of other fintech innovations like chatbots and robot traders, but its obscurity does not detract from its significance. A success would buoy spirits in an industry that has spent $1.7bn on blockchain projects which have yet to meet banks’ “lofty expectations”, according to analysts at market intelligence advisory Greenwich Associates. “Certainly from a size of ecosystem perspective and starting to do something in production, having [so many] banks [participate] and some of the world’s biggest banks is a big deal,” says David Treat, head of Accenture’s capital markets blockchain practice. Until the end of 2017 “everything was experimental and prototypes, production was something small and safe in the corner,” he says. “What we’ve seen this year is a move to real life production. And now the first of to those ecosystems is taking on real life use cases.” Mr Treat hints that while the IIN is out on its own now as the industry’s only blockchain project of scale, it will not enjoy that status for long. “More and more proof points are coming out that are building confidence among leaders in this industry, that we’re actually at the point where real value is going to happen,” he adds. There is still an open debate on what “real value” is. Blockchain’s early evangelists saw the technology’s potential for greatly reducing banks’ costs by eliminating manual reconciliation work and other labour intensive database tasks. Banks do not expect IIN to generate significant savings, however, either now or in the future. “Blockchain is frankly a great technology, however, I’m not sure that the initial hypothesis that everyone had about saving significant sums of money is where you’ll see a lot of the new products being developed,” says Umar Farooq, head of blockchain at JPMorgan. “It will be much more about doing things that could not be done without blockchain technology, creating new products . . . When you look at it purely as an expense saving mechanism that limits the potential of the technology.’ Instead of fixating on costs, JPMorgan has spoken about the potential for IIN to help banks fend off competition from fintech starts up which have exploited inefficiencies in cross border payments to offer cheaper and faster solutions. Whether IIN can become big enough to do that, and to have any sort of real impact in the marketplace, remains to be seen. JPMorgan estimates that IIN will handle more than 300,000 transactions a day, a relatively small number when compared with the 14.5m cross-border payments processed through the Swift system daily. The number of transactions grows exponentially as new banks join IIN. The network is growing fast, and now has more than 100 members. The dynamic between the IIN and fintech is an interesting one. For years, banks have been insisting that fintechs are friends not foes and Mr Treat says that spirit still generally holds. In the case of IIN, however, fintechs had minimal involvement in the network’s development, and the project’s objectives include protecting market share which fintechs, such as Transferwise and Revolut are targeting. “If a fintech takes an aggressive stance against a bank and it’s not a two way partnership, sure, there’s massive competition and a very tough road,” says Mr Treat. “There are more (bank/fintech relationships) that are actually flourishing . . . than where there’s outward competition.” Mr Farooq says that while fintechs were “not currently involved directly” in the IIN, “we actively participate with fintechs across all parts of the bank”. Inefficiency in banks’ legacy payment systems is arguably one of the tougher problems for a third party fintech to address, since the solution requires an intimate knowledge of the problems, which most fintech outsiders simply would not have. The next big blockchain effort might be a more collaborative venture across the banks to fintech divide.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Laura Noonan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-12","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/d0ab6b84-c183-11e8-84cd-9e601db069b8","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fbe29a8e2-d905-11e8-aa22-36538487e3d0?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Five ways banks are responding to the fintech threat","INTRO":"Acquisitions, partnerships and ‘digital attacker’ approach are among the defences","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Online banking customers are a third more profitable than traditional bank-based clients, Piyush Gupta, chief executive of Singapore’s biggest bank, DBS, told investors a year ago during a presentation of the bank’s digital strategy. The remark sent DBS shares sharply upwards. Since launching its mobile phone-based “disrupter” banks in India and Indonesia in the past two years, DBS has signed up more than 2.6m people by using fingerprint recognition to match them against biometric national identity cards. Such new digital customers generate on average a 27 per cent return on equity for the bank, compared with the 18 per cent return it earns on its traditional branch-based customers. DBS says it makes S$1,300 (£722) of revenue a year from each of its digital customers, more than double what it makes from traditional customers. Digital customers cost it S$478 each a year for acquisition and back office administrative expenses, compared with costs of S$306 for each traditional customer. These figures explain why DBS’s shares rose more than 40 per cent last year and are still outperforming almost all major rivals despite losing some steam this year. Its S$61bn market capitalisation is above many European rivals, including Barclays, BBVA and Deutsche Bank. Few big banks can tell such a compelling story of how they have responded to the rising challenge of digital disruption that is sweeping across their industry. In Europe alone, there are 1,400 new neo-banks, payment providers and fintechs that have sprung up since 2005, according to research by Accenture. As of 2016 they had managed to make €58bn of annual revenue, equal to between 6 and 7 per cent of the industry’s total. Adding to the pressure, big technology groups are deepening their financial services sector. Amazon is providing payment services and loans to merchants on its platform, while Facebook has an electronic money licence in Ireland and its WhatsApp messaging service is building a payments offering in India. Alibaba and Tencent have become dominant operators in China’s $5.5tn payments industry. “The message is out there that new digital players are in town and the banks are under attack,” says Richard Lumb, head of financial services at Accenture. “What they are scared of is a leakage of customers and that leakage becoming a flood over time.” Banks are responding in different ways to this digital threat. The Financial Times has spoken to more than a dozen bankers, consultants and fintech executives to analyse how they are doing so. Broadly, they can be grouped into five categories. Those in this group consider that the best form of defence is attack. Banks with the most advanced digital strategies, like DBS, have launched their own digital banks to enter new markets or defend their patch. Goldman Sachs launched a consumer digital savings and lending operation two years ago. Named Marcus — after Goldman’s 19th century founder — the new digital operation has accumulated more than $26bn in deposits and lent $3bn to customers, generating over $1bn of new revenue for the Wall Street bank. Marcus recently launched in the UK, its first international expansion, offering the highest interest rate in the country to entice savers. Dutch bank ING adopted a similar approach when it launched Yolt last year, offering customers a way to collate all their financial information in one place, track their spending and saving and get prompts to save money on utility bills. Yolt has signed up more than 400,000 users in the UK and recently announced plans to expand into France and Italy. Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Ross McEwan told the FT that it had six standalone digital units in development. They include one called Bó — from the verb to stay in Danish — which aims to compete with fintechs like Monzo by helping customers manage their money better. Hampered by the vast cost and complexity of maintaining their old systems, sometimes banks find it easier to buy or invest in a start-up that has built a digital platform from scratch. One that has pursued this strategy is Spain’s BBVA, acquiring a string of digital upstarts including Simple in the US, Atom Bank in the UK and Holvi in Finland. BBVA has invested $250m in Propel Venture Partners, a standalone venture capital fund to invest in fintechs around the world. BPCE, the large French mutual bank formed by the merger of Banques Populaires and Caisses d’Epargne, recently followed suit by acquiring Fidor Bank, the online bank with more than 120,000 customers in Germany and the UK. Bank bosses complain loudly of an uneven playing field that allows big technology groups to offer financial services without the burdensome regulation that traditional lenders face. That has not stopped some banks teaming up with Big Tech groups. One example possibly in the making is the potential partnership between JPMorgan Chase and Amazon, which would bring together the US’s biggest bank and the largest US ecommerce company. The deal would give JPMorgan access to 100m Amazon customers using the Prime service. The partnership might be extended into other areas such as an Amazon-branded checking account. In Asia, Standard Chartered has teamed up with China’s Alipay to launch a digital remittance service, using blockchain technology to send money across borders quickly and cheaply. The duo has also teamed up with GCash, the mobile payments arm of Globe Telecoms in the Philippines, to allow people to send money between Hong Kong and the Philippines using their mobile phones. The plan is to expand the service to other markets. While their core payments and lending businesses may be under pressure from digital competitors, some banks are using new technologies to move into new markets. Dave McKay, Royal Bank of Canada’s chief executive, recently unveiled a strategy to turn Canada’s biggest bank into a broader “platform” offering diverse services, from registering a start-up company to helping people rent their house on Airbnb. When its customers are looking to buy or sell a home, RBC offers to research neighbourhoods, move furniture, paint a house and even decide which bins to take out each week. Other banks, too, are branching out. Barclays offers to store important documents, such as passports and birth certificates, on the cloud for customers. Commonwealth Bank of Australia gives businesses insights into the spending habits of its customers through its Daily IQ tool. Sometimes banks decide that the threat from digital competition is so great that they just have to amend their business models. Ana Botín, executive chairman of Spain’s Banco Santander, said it was seeing her son using a rival service in order more quickly and cheaply to transfer money overseas, that persuaded her to make Santander the first international bank to launch a cross-border payments system based on blockchain. Five years ago, France’s BNP Paribas launched Hello Bank as a standalone pan-European digital bank. Hello Bank now has more than 3m customers, including some gained through the acquisitions of Consorsbank in Germany and Compte-Nickel in France. That said, launching new services is not easy. Switzerland’s UBS said in August it was closing its automated online investment service, SmartWealth, to new clients. It had launched the robo advisory service in 2016, as part of a $1bn investment aimed at attracting younger clients and expanding its wealth management service beyond just the seriously rich. The high price of using the service and a high minimum investment were deemed to have put off potential users, however, and UBS concluded that the “near-term potential” of the service was limited.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-12","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/c43d15d4-e445-11e8-a6e5-792428919cee","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F80546caa-c48e-11e2-bc94-00144feab7de?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Week in review, November 10","INTRO":"Lloyd Blankfein revelation; Ford hops on scooters; Google, blockchain and UBS","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A round-up of some of the week’s most significant corporate events and news stories. Goldman Sachs’ former chief executive Lloyd Blankfein was identified as the senior executive who met the man at the heart of the 1MDB scandal. The US Department of Justice said last week that a “high-ranking executive” at Goldman was present at a 2009 meeting between its bankers and Jho Low, the financier who has been charged for his role in a $2.7bn money laundering and bribery scandal. Court documents did not name the executive but two people familiar with the situation said it was Mr Blankfein. Goldman says it was duped by Asia-based bankers — two of whom are facing criminal charges — and had no idea that Mr Low was operating in the shadows of deals to raise $6.5bn of debt for state fund 1MDB. Ford announced it was hopping on the booming scooter rentals market. The 115-year-old Detroit-based carmaker said it was buying Spin, one of several scooter rental start-ups to emerge in California over the past year, as it looks to take on Bird and Lime with a plan to deploy fleets of electric two-wheelers in more than 100 cities by 2020. Ford did not disclose the price it paid for Spin, a two-year-old company, but Axios reported it was about $40m. Spain’s BBVA and two partner banks completed the first syndicated loan on the blockchain, providing a working example of how transactions in the $4.6tn-a-year market can be made faster and easier using technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. Blockchain allows multiple parties to have simultaneous access to a constantly updated digital ledger. On Tuesday, BBVA used a private blockchain network to arrange a $150m syndicated loan for Red Electrica, the Spanish grid operator, with co-lenders MUFG of Japan and BNP Paribas of France. Google said it had ended forced arbitration of sexual harassment claims by employees, as it tried to quell a storm over the way it buried cases. The group backed down after a staff walkout last week to protest against its past handling of harassment claims including not disclosing allegations against two senior executives who left the company. Swiss bank UBS’s struggle to throw off its past have culminated this week in legal battles on two fronts: in the US over pre-2008 issuance of mortgage securities, and in France over claims it helped rich clients evade tax. The US Department of Justice on Thursday filed a lawsuit accusing the Swiss bank of causing investors to lose “many billions of dollars” on residential mortgage-backed securities. The bank vowed to fight the suit. Meanwhile, UBS dismissed as “irrational” demands by French prosecutors for it to pay a €3.7bn fine in a court case in which the bank is accused of illegally soliciting French clients and then helping them stash cash outside of the country.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-09","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/85324256-d824-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Ffde22f48-e28f-11e8-8e70-5e22a430c1ad?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Banks race to make money on trade finance platforms","INTRO":"Blockchain promises big returns for $16tn industry but revenues remain elusive","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When Texas-based Tricon Energy wanted to buy polymers from India’s Reliance Energy, the two companies avoided the usual rigmarole of phone calls, couriered documents and emails by logging on to a new blockchain system called Voltron. Within minutes they had completed negotiations on the terms of the sale and then secured a letter of credit and advice from lenders ING and HSBC to complete the transaction, which was finalised on Friday. This was one of the first examples of a real-life trade deal being handled by one of many new platforms being developed by banks to use blockchain technology — which underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin — to save money and time in the centuries-old trade finance market. HSBC, Standard Chartered, Bank of China, Deutsche Bank, Société Générale and UBS, among many others, are looking to a handful of platforms to help speed up, simplify and reduce risk in the $16tn in global trade done annually. After several years of development work and testing, the first real-life transactions passing over these systems indicate that banks are getting closer to their goal of starting to make money from the investments they have patiently bankrolled. Trade finance is still mostly based on paper, such as bills of lading or letters of credit, being sent by fax or post around the world, and seems to many bankers to be crying out for modernisation. Combining shared databases and cryptography, blockchain technology allows multiple parties to have simultaneous access to a constantly updated digital ledger that cannot be altered. Banks hope the decentralised nature of the technology, which draws on and verifies information from thousands of different sources, will eliminate vast piles of paper documents and unlock up to $2bn in extra financing business within eight years. Yet getting viable businesses off the ground has proved challenging. The platforms are struggling to link up with the diverse range of parties that participate in global trade, many of which are developing their own technology. Shipping companies such as AP Moller-Maersk and Hyundai Merchant Marine are testing their own systems, which are not guaranteed to mesh with those of the banks. When banks invest in new systems, they traditionally expect to see returns within defined periods of time, or at least be able to predict when the first revenues will be generated, said Sen Ganesh, partner at consultants Bain \u0026 Company. A timetable for returns from blockchain trade finance, however, has proved uncertain. “There’s a race to commercialisation now,” said Mr Ganesh. “After a year of proof of concepts, there is a lot of pressure to make money.” The ability to eke out early returns on a system could depend on which segment of the trade industry it is focused on. Documentary trade, which includes letters of credit and involves banks taking on payment risks for the buyers of goods, already has a high level of standardisation that makes it more difficult to disrupt, said Alessio Botta, a partner at consultants McKinsey. But supplier-originated finance, in which suppliers sell their accounts receivables to generate liquidity, has no common standard and platforms focused on this business are expected to find higher demand for new products, Mr Botta said. “The area where blockchain is going to succeed will be different between these areas,” he said. “Banks are hedging on more than one platform.” The Voltron platform, backed by eight banks, announced in May that it had moved from tests to live business, executing a soyabeans trade for US agricultural group Cargill. The system focuses on documentary trade products such as letters of credit. Marco Polo, a platform designed for receivables financing and backed by another group of lenders, plans to launch this year. At least six other competing systems are expected to go into production this year or in 2019. We.Trade, backed by a group of European banks, and the Indian bank-backed Finacle Trade Connect, for example both do invoice finance. Recommended Large sums are at stake. Global annual revenues for documentary trade finance are about $25bn, while supplier-originated finance comprises another $25bn-$30bn, McKinsey estimates. Bain \u0026 Co predicts new products for documentary trade will boost annual revenues for banks by $2bn by 2026, while driving up trade volume by $1.1tn. “If we make the process more efficient, especially around financing, the need will be there, and there will be customers who will want access to letters of credit so they can receive financing faster,” said Vinay Mendonca, global head of product and propositions for trade and receivables finance at HSBC. But the gap between a few live transactions and widespread commercial usage remains wide. The Cargill soyabeans trade, for example, was considered a live transaction because it could be replicated again if the same companies and banks were involved. But ports and logistics groups will not be able to join until they onboard the technology, which will be time-consuming and costly for smaller companies. “You have the transporters, who have been forgotten by the banks but are also developing their own consortiums,” said Cécile André Leruste, managing director for banking in Europe at consultants Accenture. Banks, meanwhile, are betting on multiple blockchain systems. HSBC, for example, is involved in at least four different trade finance platforms, as is Standard Chartered. Bankers expect the most powerful systems to be able to connect with each other, while some platforms will eventually die off. “The question is how we enable them to connect together seamlessly over time — and they will become increasingly interoperable,” said Michael Vrontamitis, head of trade in Europe and the Americas at StanChart. “And there will be a few that survive.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Don Weinland","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-08","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/07f0fbfa-e096-11e8-8e70-5e22a430c1ad","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F58938a70-e116-11e8-a6e5-792428919cee?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How will algorithms change the art market?","INTRO":"‘Things are moving relatively fast for an industry bound by tradition’","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Debate over the role of technology in the art market has exploded this year. Portion, an auction house that accepts only cryptocurrency, was launched last month. Before that there was the emergence of Codex Protocol, a new registry for fine art, wine and collectibles based on blockchain technology. Even the 252-year-old auction house Christie’s has got in on the act. At its inaugural “Art and Tech” summit this summer, it explored questions that had more to do with new technologies than Old Masters. “What is blockchain, really?” was the title of one event. Will artificial intelligence one day be able to appraise art and antiques? This was another question posed by art valuation website Mearto to its clients in a survey in March. Fifty-five per cent of respondents thought the answer was “probably” or “definitely” yes. Art valuation is based on many factors. Mearto listed 10, from artist and subject to provenance, condition and, finally, the market. “You may be in possession of a beautiful work of art but if nobody’s interested in buying it, unfortunately it doesn’t hold much monetary value,” the site says. The underlying issue is taste. For an industry bound by tradition, things are moving — relatively — fast. Discussion has centred on two possible ways forward. Some in the industry are pro-blockchain, a decentralised digital ledger to which data is added in chronological “blocks”; some lean more towards the power of AI. Anne Bracegirdle, a photography specialist at Christie’s, is among blockchain’s evangelists. She sees it as one way to put more information into the hands of clients who are frustrated with the market. “They will ask things like, ‘This piece sold for £50,000 last week and now it’s selling for £30,000. Why?’ ” Bracegirdle’s vision is of a single blockchain-based industry-wide registry that would record provenance, ownership, condition and value. “Clients could understand the market themselves,” she says. Right now, no complete record of fine-art ownership exists. Using a “total registry” idea, consumers could also judge for themselves how much an artwork might be worth. There could be potential benefits for the art market too: greater transparency and trust, more secure data storage. However, such a registry would need immense amounts of data, much of it relating to pieces hundreds of years old. The investment, and workload, would be huge. Jess Houlgrave, co-founder of Codex Protocol, believes in even greater democratisation. She thinks that anyone — not just art experts — should be able to add data to Codex’s registry of artworks. The technology itself could be used to “verify the identity of the person adding something” — a good solution in an industry that is “all about reputation”, she says. Not everyone is convinced. Noah Wunsch, Sotheby’s vice-president of digital strategy, believes it is still too early to tell what part blockchain might play in the art market. He wants to establish whether nanotechnology could be used to connect a physical object — be it a painting, sculpture or vase — to its entry on a digital registry. The link between object and online record “is a big part of the conversation that is often missed”, he argues. Without it, blockchain is not worth the hype. AI, Wunsch argues, is better developed for immediate consumer needs. Indeed, Sotheby’s paid an undisclosed sum in January to acquire Thread Genius, an image recognition platform that uses machine learning to personalise recommendations of art to clients. Wunsch is sensitive to the idea that automation could replace a specialist with years of market experience. “I think we are going to find out in the coming years whether the algorithm will be able to price art,” he says. But he points to the success of other algorithms as a sign of how things might change. “We didn’t think that a machine would be able to guess what music you might like.” For the moment, and without much industry consensus, neither AI nor blockchain looks set to replace human taste and judgment. But, as Wunsch points out: “The algorithm is never complete. It gets smarter and smarter.” Follow @FTMag on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

The approval to run a central securities depository from the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, the main French securities regulator, is a further coup for proponents of blockchain technology, who argue it can be harnessed to improve slow and inefficient back-office settlement and cut the amount of collateral held up in global payment systems. Critics argue it is little better than some existing technologies on the market. A depository, or CSD, is the part of the market plumbing where deals are finalised and cash is exchanged for securities. Its recognition will allow Setl to connect to the eurozone’s Target2-Securities platform, a €1bn European Central Bank-run project that speeds up cross-border payments. The money for settlements can come from other commercial banks or accounts held at a central bank. Some banks prefer using a dedicated central bank account as it reduces their exposures to counterparties. Official approval for Setl’s link to it is likely to be granted in the coming weeks. The CSD is likely to go live in early 2019. Setl was designed specifically for financial markets as it settles payments in central bank money and not a cryptocurrency. While some blockchains use ledgers available to all users, Setl’s blockchain is a so-called “permissioned ledger”, which allows a small networks of trusted parties to see it. The London group also announced a management reshuffle on Tuesday, with co-founder and chief executive Peter Randall becoming president. He will be replaced by Philippe Morel, formerly a consultant at Boston Consulting Group. The group is chaired by Sir David Walker, best known for his Walker Report of corporate governance in UK banks, whose recommendations have since shaped much of the way the financial services industry is run. Citigroup, Crédit Agricole and Computershare are among its shareholders. Mr Morel “brings a wealth of experience in the capital market, financial, and regulatory spheres and we are very pleased to have attracted such an impressive talent”, said Sir David. Mr Randall, best known for co-founding share trading venue Chi-X Europe, will focus on Setl’s international business, as well as marketing and corporate communications.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-10-23","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/62dbb0ae-d822-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F883b4e52-d8fb-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Auditors grapple with crypto and blockchain","INTRO":"Big firms respond to new products but there is a lack of consensus on rules","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Top professional services firms are hiring hundreds of blockchain and cryptocurrency experts to offer auditing services to companies involved in the nascent and loosely regulated sector. Cryptocurrency prices skyrocketed towards the end of last year in the biggest speculative boom since dotcom fever, fuelling the creation of numerous crypto start-ups. Major accountancy firms, including EY, PwC and KPMG, have since rushed to offer services to those with a foothold in the sector, despite a lack of consensus around how digital assets should be accounted for, as well as concerns that the market is vulnerable to fraud and money laundering. These Big Four firms are ramping up their investment by hiring specialised staff and developing their own in-house technologies to support the crypto audit process. “It’s a no brainer,” said Jeanne Boillet, global assurance innovation leader at EY, which said it had more than 150 clients worldwide involved in crypto assets as of September. “We have no choice than to address this because some of our clients have invested in that space.” Ms Boillet said that in addition to companies holding and trading in cryptocurrencies, EY’s clients included crypto exchanges, crypto mining firms and traditional companies using blockchain technology. Rival PwC said it had taken on a similar array of clients and currently employed about 400 “blockchain experts” globally, across multiple divisions, including its consultancy business. “We are in the midst of a rather significant effort,” said Ralph Weinberger, leader of Pwc’s global network assurance methodology group. “We are devoting significant resources to how we might provide audit services in not just cryptocurrency, but blockchain.” Cryptocurrency prices have slumped from their mid-January peaks, as the sector battles concern over fraud and manipulation, and continues to be viewed with scepticism by most mainstream banks. But even as the hype dies down, accountancy firms argue that businesses will continue to use the blockchain technology underpinning it. Blockchains allow encrypted data on anything, from money to medical records, to be shared between many companies, people and institutions. This protects data from fraud while instantly updating all parties concerned. Proponents expect companies from many sectors to increasingly launch their own private blockchains in the future. Both EY and PwC have launched their own blockchain auditing tools this year. EY said it was building a further seven blockchain platforms “for the cryptocurrency ecosystem”. But there are risks associated with such rapid progress. There is currently no clear guidance for how the assets should be accounted for or audited, as they do not fall neatly under current standards — so firms are drawing up their own processes. “It’s really about proper careful application of current rules and reading the lines between what fits and what makes sense,” said David Lyford-Smith, technical manager at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, an industry body. “But that does lead to some disagreements about what’s the best treatment.” He said that most auditors viewed cryptocurrencies as intangible assets, though in some cases they were being treated as inventory. Regulators are also beginning to circle the fledgling sector. Recommended In a letter sent to MPs as part of an inquiry into the cryptocurrency sector earlier this year, the Financial Reporting Council, the UK’s accounting watchdog, said: “In the absence of specific guidance, there is a risk that diverse accounting practices will develop and become entrenched.” The watchdog told the Financial Times that auditing cryptocurrencies was not currently “a material issue for UK financial institutions and large corporates”, but that it was monitoring the situation and would intervene if there were “significant divergence of practice”. In September, the International Financial Reporting Standards’ guidance committee discussed “how an entity might apply existing IFRS Standards in determining its accounting for holdings of cryptocurrencies”, according to its website. Its standards board will assess in future whether the topic needs to be added to its formal agenda. “It’s clear that more work needs to be done by the FRC and others,” said Andrew Gambier, head of audit and assurance at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, the global professional body. But there are additional challenges for auditors appraising cryptocurrencies rather than traditional money, such as valuing assets prone to wild and unexpected swings in a market where pricing can differ between exchanges. Jatin Patel, a director in the investment management and funds audit practice at KPMG, said “the hardest piece is verifying ownership”, given the anonymity afforded to holders of most digital currencies. Recommended KPMG audits several dozen funds that hold cryptocurrencies, as well as crypto exchanges in Japan and the Cayman Islands. But Mr Patel added that proof of ownership was becoming easier as crypto custodians — companies that store cryptocurrencies securely from hackers in the same way that custodian banks safeguard financial assets — become more prevalent. Firms also argue they carry out due diligence on potential crypto clients, sometimes going beyond their standard procedures. “We are pushing and challenging companies in this industry so that [their] controls are proper and secure,” Ms Boillet of EY said. “There’s a lot of negative reputational [issues],” said Mr Lyford-Smith of the ICAEW. “But if corporate companies are making use of these technologies . . . then they are going to need to be audited. It’s reasonable that the top [accounting] firms are going to respond to that need.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hannah Murphy","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-10-29","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/2b12d338-e1d1-11e8-a6e5-792428919cee","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fbe5d61ba-ddcd-11e8-b173-ebef6ab1374a?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Banks complete first syndicated loan on blockchain","INTRO":"The technology can slash transaction times in the $4.6tn-a-year market","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Spain’s BBVA and two partner banks have completed the first syndicated loan on the blockchain, providing a working example of how transactions in the $4.6tn-a-year market can be simplified and made faster using technology that underpins cryptocurrencies. Syndicated loans were identified early on as a key use for blockchain in financial services, since banks rely on outdated and inefficient processes including faxes to share information between different parties who are structuring complex agreements. Combining shared databases and cryptography, blockchain technology is the basis for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Banks have seized on the technology, which allows multiple parties to have simultaneous access to a constantly updated digital ledger that cannot be altered, as a way to cut costs and speed up many activities. On Tuesday, BBVA used a private blockchain network to arrange a $150m syndicated loan for Red Electrica, the Spanish grid operator, with co-lenders MUFG of Japan and BNP Paribas of France. Legal advisers Linklaters and Herbert Smith Freehills also had access to the system which allowed all parties to exchange information instantly. The information was time-stamped, to show exactly when each event occurred, and the network was secured with user codes. Once the contract was signed, it was given a unique identifier that was recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, preserving its authenticity. BBVA says the blockchain technology, which is being rolled out on a pilot basis, simplifies and speeds up the process of completing syndicated loans from about two weeks to a day or two. Loan signing and documentation processing, which traditionally takes a few hours, can be done in minutes. As well as the saving time, moving syndicated loans to the blockchain will also deliver a “huge reduction in internal costs” for clients, Ricardo Laiseca, BBVA’s head of global finance, told the FT. He said: “Everything is automatically recorded by the system, in terms of back office and operational costs.” Mr Laiseca said that BBVA had a pipeline of “five or six” other syndicated loans that would be done over the blockchain in the coming months as the pilot continues. “We are offering these technologies for collaboration with any other banks . . . This is not just for BBVA, we feel that as a second stage (we are) working on a new markets infrastructure which will be good for everyone.” Another platform built by fintech group Finastra and pioneered by the UK’s NatWest is offering syndicated loan servicing over blockchain, using the Corda distributed ledger technology. which is due to go live on November 17. In the broader lending space, BBVA earlier this year issued the world’s first corporate loan by blockchain. The banking industry’s single largest blockchain project remains the Interbank Information Network, where more than 75 banks led by JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Canada and ANZ are using distributed ledger technology for some interbank payments.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Laura Noonan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/8b8c2aab-5eba-3178-8d23-96f2e91c4dd9","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F28267b5a-d378-4aff-bf9f-d913c34dcee3_FINAL.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Is Baroness Mone\u0027s true idol Steve Wozniak or Sylvester Stallone?","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Dreams do come true. He has been my business idol since I was a teenager...I’m delighted to announce that tech legend..co-founder of Apple, Steve Wozniak, has become my business partner at https://t.co/EdTRyr19xB https://t.co/J1ccpri030 #SiliconValley pic.twitter.com/JSQNEvAlX2 That\u0027s a tweet from last week, by former lingerie company boss Baroness Michelle Mone, OBE, after it was announced that Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak was joining her blockchain venture, EQUI. We were a bit surprised that Lady Mone of Mayfair\u0027s teenage \"business idol\" was the Woz, who co-founded Apple in 1976 but whose influence on the company started to wane considerably in the early 80s, before he left it entirely in early 1985, when Mone would have been just 13. Even then, Wozniak was less a business icon like Steve Jobs, and more a tech icon -- as a scene from the first episode of HBO\u0027s Silicon Valley series suggests. He would have made a strange idol for Mone, who didn\u0027t seem particularly tech-focused until last year, when she started selling apartments in Dubai for bitcoin. (A few months later, she proclaimed herself \"one of the biggest experts in Cryptocurrency and Blockchain\" in a tweet that was later deleted.) In Mone\u0027s autobiography My Fight to the Top, there is no mention of the Apple co-founder. There are, however, four mentions of Sylvester Stallone, who she refers to as her \"childhood hero\". Then we came across a video filmed by Mone at a March conference held in Sharjah, in the UAE, where she was a speaker. In it, she doesn\u0027t seem completely confident about who the Woz actually is. We can\u0027t post the video here for copyright reasons, but it features Mone flicking through the conference agenda. She comes to the page where Wozniak is listed and, as she reads the bio, says to the man sitting next to her: (That would have been Sheikh Dr Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, the sovereign ruler of the emirate of Sharjah.) The message conveyed by the video seems to be that Lady Mone was quite excited that she had been invited to speak at the same conference as some kind of Apple co-founder, and some kind of distinguished Emirati ruler (even if she doesn\u0027t know his name). The video is not on her LinkedIn page today. When we asked why it had been removed (while other posts from the same conference remain), we were told: We asked Baroness Mone\u0027s press representative about the apparent discrepancy between her calling Wozniak one of her \"business icons\" since she was a teenager, and her hesitating over his role at Apple in the video. The representative said: The Factiva newspaper database shows no articles in which Mone and Wozniak are both mentioned before August this year. We asked for details of these past business interviews, but are yet to receive any. After asking some further questions, and indicating a story was in the works, the responses became more hostile: We were later told that actually Baroness Mone had known of Wozniak before the conference but that until this year they had never met. The email continued: We barely had time to wonder who litigates dictionaries, when another missive arrived: This isn\u0027t the first time Mone\u0027s people have got a bit cross and threatening with us. You might remember that back in late August, when we were looking into EQUI and its ICO flop, we were told \"we are watching your every move with our lawyers\". We replied to the latest one by thanking them and telling them to let us know if they had anything further to add. At this point, we were sent two VERY URGENT emails from two solicitors at the same law firm, one of whom was Eddie Parladorio, a celebrity lawyer. We were also told by Parladorio that \"our client does not wish to be approached directly by you or your colleagues any further\" and that Parladorio would be handling any further questions. In the early hours of Monday morning, we were sent a statement attributed to Jason Silva, the Venezuelan TV star, \"thought leader\" and fellow conference speaker, who appears in the video. It said Baroness Mone had told Mr Silva that Mr Wozniak was one of her business idols way before the video was made. That seemed strange given that, according to a tweet from Lady Mone in April, she had met Mr Silva at the conference (as you can see from this screenshot, \"Daily Mail Celebrity\" has helpfully been tagged): That screenshot was taken Monday afternoon. The tweet has since been deleted. Contacted directly, Mr Silva clarified his statement to: Definitely tongue-in-cheek then! Baroness Mone, meanwhile, continues to serve as one of 600 lifetime peers in Britain\u0027s upper house of parliament. House of Lord figures show that, in the last parliamentary year, Baroness Mone attended the HoL on just 19 out of a possible 157 days -- an absence rate of 88 per cent -- and did not turn up to the key debate on June 20 over the Brexit bill. After having been branded the \"Layabout Lady of Mayfair\" by a member of Scottish parliament on the back of the figures, a spokesman for Lady Mone told the Times that she was \"proud\" to be \"part of the House of Lords\", and that \"this year she has launched a global business as well as overseeing her other companies but will always take her duties in the House of Lords very seriously.” We couldn\u0027t possibly comment. We wouldn\u0027t want to risk aggravating the definition lawyers. NB: Because of all the Tories getting into crypto of late, we have decided to start a series on the matter.

ANZ, Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Standard Chartered will co-operate on the project, the Trade Information Network, by the end of the year. The project would give access to all banks and corporations to directly exchange and verify trade information in the hopes of lowering the risks — and the cost — of financing smaller companies currently ignored by large banks. “What this platform will do is allow our clients to connect and provide information on to that network, and make it much cheaper and effective to deal with our own clients,” said Michael Vrontamitis, head of trade in Europe and the Americas at Standard Chartered, adding that it would also enable the banks to take on new customers. The project, originally known as Wilson, comes as a number of banks and governments around the world roll out digital or blockchain-based trade finance platforms in an attempt to upgrade the $9tn global trade finance industry. Hong Kong’s de facto central bank, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, has launched a blockchain-backed trade finance platform linked up with 21 banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered. HSBC said in May that it had launched the world’s first live blockchain trade, which processed a letter of credit for US food and agricultural group Cargill. Following a number of heavy fines for violating sanctions and other regulations, banks have sought to de-risk their client portfolios by dropping the coverage of small companies in many high-risk countries in Asia and the Middle East. Recommended The Trade Information Network is hoped to be one means of reducing the level of risk associated with trade finance for banks. The system plans to allow trading companies to submit purchase orders and invoices to request trade financing from banks. The information can be verified within the system and will help banks better assess the risks of double financing and fraudulent trade. This can lower the cost of taking on clients and help banks accept smaller companies. The addition of companies left out of the formal banking sector is projected to be lucrative. The Asian Development Bank has said there is a $1.5tn shortfall in trade financing, mainly for small companies, because banks have been unwilling to take on higher risks. “The possibility to unlock additional financing opportunities along the entire supply chain will further support the overall growth in global trade,” Daniel Schmand, global head of trade finance at Deutsche Bank, said in a statement. Unlike many of its competitors in digital trade finance platforms, the Trade Information Network will not use distributed ledger technology, the underlying technology behind blockchain and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. But Mr Vrontamitis noted that the Trade Finance Network would be able to connect to other, blockchain-based platforms.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Don Weinland","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-10-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/d6b8188d-22a8-397a-8d41-0dde747b18c8","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F35e3c907-993d-4582-95b7-ebf7e868c22a_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"People are freaking out about Tether","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The whole point of Tether, the “stablecoin” suspected of having been used to manipulate the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is that it is a digital version of the dollar. The idea is that Tether is easier to move around than real dollars, and it can be used instead of the greenback on crypto exchanges that don\u0027t have access to real, central-bank-issued money, to get in and out of trading positions quickly. And Tether is used a lot. In fact, it is the second-most heavily traded cryptocurrency in the market, according to Coinmarketcap, after bitcoin. That\u0027s why people are starting to get jittery about the fact that since the start of October, Tether has been breaking the buck. It\u0027s not the first time Tether has failed to hold onto its dollar peg. But this time, its discount to the dollar looks a little more sustained, and has been widening. Take a look at this price chart, showing the average price of Tether across various exchanges since the start of the year (screenshot from Coinmarketcap): It started falling more precipitously over the weekend, and on Monday slid to an average price of just above $0.94, according to Coinmarketcap, dipping to as low as $0.90 on the Kraken exchange, according to Bloomberg. Over on Twitter, people have been freaking out. There\u0027s been lots of talk of Tether \"dying\", and bank runs: Tether, the cryptocurrency which is theoretically backed 1:1 by USD held in a bank account and available on demand, is currently in the early stages of a bank run. Bizarrely, also, there was a tweet on Saturday night from Zhao Chenpeng, CEO of Binance, the biggest exchange globally and one that doesn\u0027t allow access to fiat so does a huge amount of volume in -- and makes a huge amount of money from -- Tether, with a screenshot of its price along with the comment: \"Regulated stable coin, lol\". Many questions have been raised over whether Tether has the dollars in its bank account that it says it has, and which give the tokens their value. But until now, the market has largely bought into the company\u0027s assurances that it -- and its sister company Bitfinex -- is solvent. But it seems like the market is starting to question that, as liquidity worries grow amid reports of yet more banking problems for Bitfinex. As Tether tumbled, the average prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rose across the board as calculated by aggregators like Coinmarketcap and Cryptocompare, largely as a result of the fact that on crypto-to-crypto exchanges, prices are derived from Tether (so as that fell, other cryptos went up). But also because on those crypto-only exchanges, the only option anyone holding Tether had to sell in exchange for was those well-known safety assets: other cryptocurrencies. Some crypto evangelists seemed to be suggesting that this was a good thing for the industry (Phillip Nunn is a self-professed \"blockchain evangelist\"; Arianna Simpson was \"into crypto before it was cool\"): Couldn’t agree more. It’s a positive. https://t.co/z8Pp1SKzB6 You gotta love the crypto.

But this year, both currencies flopped. Ether’s sell-off has been even more severe than its larger peer. After rising fivefold in the final few months of last year, it has lost around 70 per cent in the year to date to trade around $200 today. Bitcoin has fallen about 50 per cent to reach $6,500. The slide suggests that Ether, like bitcoin, was swept up in last year’s cryptocurrency mania without becoming a mainstream investment. “The narrative that everyone was expecting, for all these institutional investors to come in pouring in their money — it didn’t happen. The narrative popped,” said Fadi Aboualfa, founder of blockchain research company Diar. “It was all a very, very big bubble.” But there are other factors at play behind Ether’s fall. During the 2017 boom, entrepreneurs and get-rich-quick schemers rushed to create hundreds of their own tokens via so-called “initial coin offerings”, a barely regulated way of tapping retail investors for money. Many of these ICOs used Ether’s underlying technology platform, known as Ethereum, and investors would use Ether to buy the new tokens. Experts said that as Ether began to slide, many ICO projects have sold down the balances of Ether they held, turning it into fiat currency and putting pressure on Ether’s price. Some warn this trend could continue, particularly if new projects fail to start generating revenues. “Demand for ICOs really drove up the price,” said Martin Walker, director at the Centre for Evidence-Based Management, a think-tank. “Now, money coming out of the ICOs is one of the things that’s really battered Ether in recent months.” The data suggest it is largely retail investors who have borne the brunt of the price fall, rather than the ICO projects. Analysis of more than 220 ICOs by trading platform BitMEX found they had already sold almost as much Ether as they raised in US dollar terms — around $5bn worth — while many are still sitting on “unrealised gains”. “They raised so much money, the price collapsed but [by then] they had cashed out billions of dollars,” said Mr Aboualfa. Nevertheless, many of Ether’s fans say the price of the currency is not how success should be measured. Instead, the real focus should be on Ethereum and its technological potential. First proposed in 2013 by Russian-Canadian programmer Vitalik Buterin, a teenager at the time, Ethereum can be used to create so-called smart contracts — essentially computer code that is automatically triggered when certain conditions are met. This makes it a distributed platform for all kinds of business transactions beyond payments, while Ether was simply a way to reward developers building apps on the platform. “The founding vision of Ethereum . . . wasn’t to have a currency that competes with the US dollar,” said Simon Taylor, a former Barclays VP and co-founder at financial technology consultancy 11:FS. Instead, it was designed to allow internet users to be “more in control of [their] data,” he said. Where bitcoin aims to eliminate the middlemen in finance — banks and central banks — Ethereum hopes to bypass online giants such as Amazon, Facebook or Uber by allowing automated agreements to guarantee users a service. It has attracted its own cultish following and a vibrant community of open source programmers. “People interested in building applications tend towards Ethereum,” said one industry analyst, who did not wish to be named. “For the bitcoin folks — [the talk] is all about ‘digital gold’.” Advocates said that developer interest has not waned despite the price drop. Jeremy Millar, a founding board member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA) and chief of staff at Consensys, a 900-strong blockchain technology company, said the space continued to attract talent and capital. “You can identify projects that were more hyped . . . Those projects may not be able to realise the promises they made,” he said. “That does not mean the industry is not highly transformative. We’re seeing that maturity come through.” Recommended Alistair Milne, professor of financial economics at Loughborough University, said that there was “serious investigation of commercial application of Ethereum” across a range of sectors, including banking. The EEA, a non-profit founded in 2016 to test its enterprise uses, boasts members including JPMorgan and BP. Last month, energy groups including Royal Dutch Shell and banks including Société Générale and Citigroup announced they were backing the development of Komgo, an ethereum project designed to improve commodity trade financing. But there is no shortage of sceptics who regard Ethereum as highly experimental, with few practical uses to date beyond the gaming world. One of the most popular projects has been Cryptokitties, a game that allows users to breed and exchange virtual cats. Many highlight technological limitations such as a lack of scalability or user friendliness. Ethereum can process around 15 transactions per second — far lower than the 45,000 processed by Visa. In 2016, a hacker exploited a software flaw to steal $50m of Ether, prompting developers to create a spin-off of Ethereum that is the version widely used today. Others are quick to shoot down the ideology behind it. “You can never have a contract that specifies what can happen in every single circumstance. That’s why courts exist,” said Mr Walker. “Life is uncertain and contracts can never cover every eventuality. Trying to capture everything in code is unrealistic.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hannah Murphy","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-10-19","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/b4209f5f-706b-39c8-bcb2-c442857d3295","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F8bc17652-2cb4-4c95-8df1-08a846b097c9_FINAL.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"It\u0027s really happening...

In one of his first public moves since leaving the White House earlier this year, the 58-year-old former president at Goldman Sachs has joined fledgling fintech firm Spring Labs. The 20-strong start-up, which has offices in Los Angeles and Chicago, is developing ways to use the blockchain to allow lenders and data providers to exchange credit and identity information more efficiently, in a challenge to big credit consumer companies like Equifax and Experian. “[It’s] an obvious place to take a very, very analogue industry and digitise it,” Mr Cohn told the Financial Times, labelling the project a “unique opportunity”. During his time in the White House, Mr Cohn played a major role in the Trump administration’s tax reform package, which was passed by Congress late last year. But he resigned in March after objecting to the president’s plans to roll out steel and aluminium tariffs. Mr Cohn said that since his departure he had been advising private companies in “traditional industries”, though he declined to provide further details.But he added that he had looked at “a bunch of different opportunities” in the blockchain sector after studying the potential of the technology while in the White House. While he made clear that he was not an advocate for individual cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, he said that blockchain technology was a “huge new invention” that could also be used for smart contracts, or in currency settlement. “We all know all the inefficiencies of the existing currency world and blockchain clearly helps to eliminate them at some point in the future,” he added. Mr Cohn will join Bobby Mehta, former chief executive of big US credit company TransUnion, and Brian Brooks, chief legal officer at Coinbase, one of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, on Spring Labs’ board of advisers. Mr Cohn also has an undisclosed amount of equity in the company, though it is unclear whether he received the stake through an investment or as part of an arrangement with the company. “When you look at the two challenges Spring Labs has, one is building the technology. Once you’ve built the technology you’ve got to get it accepted and adopted,” Mr Cohn said, adding that he would use his experience in financial services to help the company tackle the latter. Blockchain technology allows for information storage and transmission without a central control body. While it is best known for its role in underpinning the exchange of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, its decentralised functionality has made it popular with companies seeking to manage large flows of data. However, critics have questioned whether its usefulness has been overstated, and the technology has also been tainted by its association with the cryptocurrency world, which many have warned is vulnerable to fraud. Recommended Under the current credit system, banks hand over customer data to credit reporting agencies such as Equifax and Experian, before buying back aggregated reports from those companies. Last year, Equifax disclosed that it had suffered a massive data hack in the US, affecting 143m clients and raising concerns about the safety of customer information. Adam Jiwan, Spring Labs’ chairman and chief executive, said his company was building blockchain-based applications that would allow such data to be shared directly between parties in a “highly secure” and “anonymous” way that complies with data privacy regulations. He added this could “ultimately . . . replace the credit bureaus you see today”. Set up in 2017, Spring Labs is the brain-child of the founders of Avant, a US consumer loans provider that has originated more than $5bn of loans since it was founded six years ago. In March, Spring Labs raised nearly $15m in seed funding, including from previous Avant backers. It expects to launch several applications — which may include fraud and identity verification tools — in the first half of 2019 and is also in “deep discussions with industry partners”, Mr Jiwan said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hannah Murphy","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-10-12","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/06bb9a76-c7b7-11e8-ba8f-ee390057b8c9","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Ff1d75da8-c7ba-11e8-ba8f-ee390057b8c9?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Air France-KLM signs up blockchain partnership","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Air France-KLM said it was exploring ways to use blockchain-based technology to cut costs for flyers and increase profits for suppliers by cutting out middlemen.

Blockchain is a technology which allows for information storage and transmission without a central control body. It makes it possible to carry out transactions between two parties, without intermediaries. AF-KLM said it hoped the partnership would provide “a more advantageous travel offer for customers which is more profitable for suppliers, in particular by reducing the number of intermediaries.” The move follows a similar deal between Lufthansa and Winding Tree in October last year, while research group Sita has separately completed a six-month trial of blockchain technology with BA and Heathrow and Miami airports, which focused on flight-status information.

Now, you wouldn\u0027t expect Alphaville to tell you that journalism based on “crypto-economics” is a good idea, a clever idea, or even an idea that has a discernible meaning. And we won\u0027t. But: although the blockchain is what separates Civil from other news organisations, the start-up\u0027s problems go way beyond its distributed technicolour dream-ledger. Civil has ambitious and lofty plans: It reckons it can “fix” the problem of a lack of public trust in the media — and the problem of sites that deliberately publish misinformation — by means of a voting system, whereby holders of the “CVL” token can have a say on whether a certain piece of journalism constitutes “ethical journalism”. We spoke to Vivian Schiller, CEO of the Civil Foundation -- the non-profit bit of the start-up, whose job it is to uphold these “ethical journalism” standards. Schiller is a high-powered media executive whose previous roles include head of news at Twitter and CEO of NPR (she incidentally has no prior blockchain experience. “I\u0027m learning blockchain,” she told us). Schiller explained the voting system as follows: If a token-holder finds that a piece of journalism has breached the Constitution, they stake $1,000 worth of tokens to mount a challenge against that “newsroom” (the name Civil gives to each of the news outfits in its network). If other token-holders agree, half of the $1,000 is given to the challenger, and the rest shared out to the other people who voted. Democracy in motion! Game theory for the win! But this system throws up many problems. So, so many problems. So yeah, there\u0027s this thing that Civil has grandiosely called “the Civil Constitution” (eighteenth-century French revolutionaries are presumably turning in their grave). It tries to do the impossible: to throw a set of rules at a something that is inherently subjective and open to interpretation. One person\u0027s conspiracy-theory nonsense is another\u0027s fearless and righteous #WAR journalism. One person\u0027s facts are another\u0027s lies. But hey, at least they\u0027re trying. And the contents of Civil\u0027s constitution, broadly, look like principles that journalists should indeed strive towards, such as only publishing original work, verifying information before showing it to the public, and minimising harm to sources. There is some stuff that seems problematic, however. The opening line, for example: Although Civil clearly has generally noble aims, it doesn\u0027t really seem to be aiming at a free press. It is incentivising its members to, in effect, censor each other. And how is any given token-holder supposed to know whether the article in question has breached the terms of the Constitution? The Constitution includes things like realising “that private people have a greater right to control information about themselves than public figures”, avoiding “pandering to lurid curiosity, even if others do”, and “disclosing any political affiliations, endorsements or agendas”. Isn\u0027t the whole problem with false, misleading or unethically sourced news the fact that readers don\u0027t know when they are reading it? How are they meant to determine whether the writer has an agenda? How does a token-holder know whether the writer has realised private people have a right to control their information? Also, is it fair that a whole newsroom gets booted out of the Civil network -- losing the Civil “badge” that the start-up hopes will become a kind of stamp of quality journalism -- when only one journalist has produced the offending article? Also, what\u0027s to stop newsrooms from voting tactically to boot out competitors? Also, why would token-holders bother voting when the payout is so low ($500 worth of tokens divided between the lot of them, currently)? Wouldn\u0027t it be more likely that those people who had some kind of agenda when it came to this particular newsroom who would be incentivised to vote? Civil says it is setting up a “Council” that will act as the arbiter if there is a disagreement over a vote, to prevent some of these problems. But if the Council is the ultimate arbiter, what\u0027s the point of the voting system? How can we trust the Council? Civil says the Council\u0027s decision can be overturned by a “supermajority” of voters. Back to the same problems. We asked Schiller about the free press thing. She said we had a point and that she would consider changing it to “independent press”, and that this wasn\u0027t yet the final draft of the Constitution. She also said she\u0027s spent the last few weeks consulting news organisations, ethicists and free-speech lawyers on what the Consitution should contain, she told us, and she seems to genuinely want to “find a new solution” for the lack of trust in journalism and the problem of falling revenues. But this ain\u0027t it. And finding some kind of neat “solution” to the lack of trust in the media seems quite ambitious -- let alone finding a solution that simultaneously fixes its funding woes. Civil should probably focus on its own funding woes, for now. It is in the middle of an initial coin offering (ICO), in which it is trying to raise between $8m and $24m (having ditched an initial goal of $32m). But it\u0027s not going too well so far. The company said on Wednesday -- five days before the ICO closes -- that since its launch on Sept. 18 it had raised just $2.1m, with only $1.3m of that “completed” (the other $800,000 is merely pledged, at this point). From CEO Matthew Iles\u0027 blog post on Wednesday: Oh dear. We think we do. Furthermore, 82 per cent of the completed token purchases -- $1.1m -- has been from a single source, blockchain firm ConsenSys, which just so happens to be Civil\u0027s parent company. (It gave Civil $5m of seed money last year, which is what the company has been running on until now.) So that leaves just $200,000 of “completed” token purchases. A large part of the issue with the ICO is the fact that Civil is actually trying to discourage people from buying the CVL tokens for speculation or investment. And — a rare occurrence in blockchainland — this doesn\u0027t appear to be empty rhetoric (it is presumably not driven by sheer integrity, however, but also by the fear of the SEC coming down on them like a ton of bricks). It genuinely seems like there are a lot of hurdles to clear before buying the tokens — for proof, have a read of this great piece from NiemanLab a few weeks ago, in which John Keefe tells us “how to buy into journalism’s blockchain future (in only 44 steps)”. CVL tokens also won\u0027t be available to trade on the normal crypto exchanges, so good luck getting rid of \u0027em. So does this mean people don\u0027t buy tokens — even “utility tokens” like these — if they can\u0027t flip them to a greater fool for more cash? WHO KNEW!? The “blockchain-based journalism” bit is, unsurprisingly, the least compelling bit of a not-very compelling proposition. Among the main ways in which Civil says blockchain can save journalism are: “The displaying or transmission of journalism and the archiving of content to the blockchain.” We\u0027re not sure what the first part of that sentence means, but the archiving of content to the blockchain sounds interesting, doesn\u0027t it? What it means is that a given article can be “hashed” down to a string of digits and stored on an immutable ledger -- the Ethereum blockchain, to be precise. (Newsrooms can be destroyed, but the hashes of their rogue stories live forever.) If anything in the article is changed, its hash will also change, and therefore it will become apparent that the article has been edited. But don\u0027t we want to be able to edit articles sometimes? How can the hash tell if the person doing the edit is a bad actor or someone from that newsroom? It can\u0027t. If the original article gets deleted by a someone nefarious, can we get it back from the hash? Nope. Hashing is a one-way function. You can\u0027t unhash it. Also, don\u0027t we have archiving systems and ways to find old versions of things that appear online already, both in news organisations and on the internet? Y blockchain? Another is: “A network for journalists to find interested audiences and for the public to find, fund, commission, consume, and contribute to journalism.” What? How? Maybe via the ICO? Can\u0027t the public find, fund, commission, consume, and contribute to journalism already? Y blockchain? Then there\u0027s: “The operation and governance of the network by its participants.” Well we\u0027ve gone over the problems with that already. But can\u0027t we do this with existing technology? Y blockchain? They also talk about micropayments, with “no transaction fees” and “no middlemen”. We don\u0027t have space to go over that now, but please refer back to the entire, unhashed, Alphaville bitcoin archive for evidence that crypto does not remove transaction fees and middlemen.

First, there is the rise of artificial intelligence-based services, such as data-miner Lex Machina, helping companies win cases and close deals. Second, consultancies such as Deloitte have been launching legal management consulting arms. Eugene McNamee, head of the school of law and executive director of the Ulster Legal Innovation Centre at Ulster University, says the pressure stems from a critical tension increasingly felt around innovation in legal technology. On the one hand, law firms want to hold on tightly to the legal services they have offered for decades. On the other, they believe that to survive and compete against management consultancies and tech start-ups encroaching on their space, they must innovate in areas of business operations where they might feel less comfortable, such as financial technology. “Law firms feel they need to do something big with technology and analytics, but they’re not exactly sure what,” says Prof McNamee. Add to that a sense that other law firms are doing exciting things that will give them an edge, mix in some confusion from an inundation of new product suppliers “promising to deliver the next big thing” and, says Prof McNamee, law firms are concerned they may be left behind. “Everyone is looking over their shoulder at everyone else, and over their other shoulder are the big insurance and accountancy firms that are holding themselves out as able to do a lot of the work that lawyers have traditionally done,” he says. Everyone is looking over their shoulder at everyone else, and over their other shoulder are the big insurance and accountancy firms Two law firms stand out for tackling the situation head-on in the financial services sector, and producing innovations seemingly at odds with the age-old business model of charging billable hours for legal services. Allen \u0026 Overy has made a modest equity investment in fintech start-up Nivaura, which is registered with the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority. The law firm helped the company design a platform for issuing financial instruments. The platform can service bonds for the instruments’ lifetime, then redeem them at the end of their life cycle. The process is completely automated and could arguably do away with much of the lawyering in the traditional transaction process. Then there is Linklaters: it partnered with the bank UBS, which is leading a consortium of banks, and financial technology company Clearmatics to develop a digital representation of money, dubbed the utility settlement coin (USC). The system is a blockchain-based interbank payment system that can settle transactions instantly. The law firm gave initial advice for free and was paid once the project went ahead. Paul Lewis, global co-head of innovation at Linklaters, says the USC project is one of a significant number of blockchain-related mandates on which the firm is working. In such instances, it often works with other partners in a consortium rather than simply charging billable hours. “Blockchain is looking to disrupt areas where the legal framework has evolved over hundreds of years and in a different paradigm,” says Mr Lewis. “Current financial law often looks to where an asset or a person is located in order to determine various legal rights, such as who owns the asset, who can transfer it, and so on. With blockchain, where there is no single location, existing approaches simply do not work.” It is like traditional legal services, but with everything being done for the first time and breaking new ground Whereas many see blockchain as a natural enemy of lawyers, Mr Lewis says Linklaters is busy coming up with “groundbreaking legal structures” designed to put blockchain-use cases on a sound legal footing. This, he says, is because it will enhance the firm’s ability to take advantage of the way some clients are using the technology. “It is like traditional legal services, but with everything being done for the first time and breaking new ground,” says Mr Lewis, referring to the way law firms need to adapt the way they provide services to clients. At Allen \u0026 Overy, senior associate Richard Cohen foresees a time when law firms will need to change their method of remuneration and types of services they offer. “Capital markets are likely to see much greater use of technology and automation,” he says. “We will be there to advise on the legal implications of that and how you can manage the introduction of the technology in a way that complies with existing regulations — which invariably do not keep pace with the technology.” Mr Cohen rejects suggestions that automation is replacing lawyering, although he admits it will affect the current law firm model, particularly the billable hour. “Law firms are still going to be advising on the law and helping clients achieve their commercial goals and manage risk,” he says. “One can also see law firms being able to offer more of a consultancy-style service to clients wishing to deploy this type of technology. It offers the opportunity to be much more of a strategic adviser.” Mr Lewis says legal services will become increasingly “tech-enabled” and there will be some form of technology element to their delivery. Capital markets are likely to see much greater use of technology and automation — we will be there to advise on the legal implications In areas such as regulatory compliance, which could be embedded into the coding of compliance software, or so-called smart contracts for financial products, which digitally verify or enforce themselves, Mr Lewis thinks the involvement of law firms is likely to change rather than vanish. “There is a huge legal input required to be able to codify the legal requirements in a tech wrapper,” he says. Mr Cohen says lawyers must understand what technology in various forms can do, but not the minute detail of how software systems work. “You can then advise as to its legal implications and work out how you can use the technology to improve delivery of legal services,” he says. While the financial services sector is in the vanguard, tech innovation will not be specific to financial services law. “There is obvious application to conveyancing but also areas like shipping law,” says Mr Cohen. “The automation techniques we’re using could be used in pretty much any area of law that has relatively commoditised documents.” Mr Lewis says: “Even in the blockchain space there are any number of other uses that are not financial services.” He cites property ownership registration and anti-money-laundering initiatives. Prof McNamee warns there will be winners and losers as the efficiency and innovation drives form a new battleground for legal services. But “whether it will all happen so quickly as to turn things upside down as opposed to allow some to press ahead relatively before the others respond, is an open question”, he says.

But a proposed A$300m ($216m) resort on Great Keppel Island, a former tourism hotspot near the Great Barrier Reef, has sat on the drawing board for a decade. To break the logjam, Tower Holdings, a Sydney developer, says it is using cryptocurrency to sell its 1,000-hectare landholding. The plan is to deliver a project the Queensland state government hopes can boost the A$6bn reef tourism industry and revitalise island communities. “Since the financial crisis it’s been difficult to raise funds,” said Anthony Aiossa, chief executive of Tower Holdings. “Now we have been approached by a consortium that plans to use blockchain technology to finance the development.” PropertyBay, a company leading the group, plans to issue tokens backed by the land to institutional investors in an initial offering and later open the tokens to trading by retail investors. The tokens would allow people to trade in and out of the investment, said the developers, and capitalise on the fascination with blockchain assets. The plan is ambitious and untested. It also underlines the difficulty developers face attracting investors for resort projects, even when located near the largest reef system on the planet. Great Keppel Island was at the centre of a 1980s tourism boom for Queensland, which was mainly financed by Japanese money and promoted under the slogan: “It’s a great place to get wrecked”. But since then almost half the 35 tourism island resorts in the region, including Great Keppel, have closed due to financial problems, damage caused by cyclones and a lack of tourists. “A lot of these island resorts were built by Japanese investors in the 1980s and suffered when Japan’s real estate boom turned to bust and competing destinations began emerging in south-east Asia,” said Pierre Benckendorff, associate professor at the University of Queensland Business School. Resorts in Indonesia, Fiji and the Philippines have become lower-cost destinations for Australian travellers, making many of Queensland’s islands — with the exception of Hamilton Island — too expensive for mass market consumers. Resorts have pivoted to the luxury market but strict environmental regulations, the high cost of basic services on islands and a strong Australian dollar over recent years have deterred investors. Weather has caused problems, with abnormally high temperatures causing coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017, which killed almost a third of the coral on the Great Barrier Reef. Since 2011, three big cyclones have buffeted the region, causing billions of dollars in damage to vital infrastructure. In 2017, luxury resorts on Daydream Island, South Molle Island and Hayman Island were forced to close after they were hit by Cyclone Debbie. But there are signs island tourism may finally be recovering, with a depreciating Australian dollar attracting more foreign visitors, particularly from the US. The Queensland government has also injected A$50m in water, waste and electricity infrastructure on the islands, generating interest among investors from China and elsewhere. Hotel occupancy rates have increased 15.1 per cent in the Great Barrier Reef over the first seven months of 2018, compared with the same period a year earlier. Revenue per available room has surged 19.2 per cent to A$297.49 in the same period, according to Smith Travel Research and JLL Hotels \u0026 Hospitality Group. “Times have changed, the market is shifting and valuations are rising,” said Tom Gibson, vice-president of hotel investment Asia-Pacific at JLL, a real estate agency. He said Asian groups were showing interest in long delayed resort projects in the region. Great Keppel Island was once at the heart of the luxury resort industry but foreign competition caused the resort to close in 2008. Tower Holdings is in talks with a cryptocurrency consortium that wants to build a A$300m resort with a golf course designed by Greg Norman The first resort on Hayman Island was built in the 1950s by the businessman and aviator Reg Ansett. The resort closed after Cyclone Debbie in 2017. But Malaysia’s Mulpha is overseeing a A$100m redevelopment, which will open in 2019 under the InterContinental Hotels brand China Capital Investment bought Daydream Island for A$30m in 2015 and South Molle Island for A$25m a year later. Both resorts, with a combined 450 suites, were hit by Cyclone Debbie and have been closed. Daydream Island is undergoing a A$100m refurbishment and is due to reopen in early 2019 China Capital Investment, a Shanghai-based investor, spent A$55m in 2015 and 2016 acquiring resorts on Daydream and South Molle islands, shortly before Cyclone Debbie caused extensive damage and closed the resorts. The company is investing a further A$100m to refurbish Daydream, which is due to open next year. Mulpha, a Malaysian property developer, is close to completing a A$100m refurbishment of Hayman Island, which will be managed by InterContinental Hotels. Chinese media tycoon William Han plans to build a A$600m luxury resort, golf course and air strip on Lindeman Island. Whether this recent spending splurge is enough to persuade investors to plough hundreds of millions of dollars into a cryptocurrency token project aimed at returning Great Keppel Island to its former glory remains to be seen. “Island resorts are challenging businesses given the logistic difficulties of getting supplies, tourists and infrastructure in place,” said Daniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Industry Tourism Council. “But the fact these islands are located in the most pristine reef environment on the planet is a very significant advantage.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jamie Smyth","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-10-03","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/ccd43262-ba0e-3325-952a-cc4f0dab9197","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F6777b5cb-4117-4f77-ac25-8cfebbaa0cb4_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Chancellor\u0027s blockchain idea is a desperate scrape of the Brexit barrel","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Knowing only a little about the intricacies of Brexit, but rather more about overhyped financial technology, we\u0027d have to guess the former isn\u0027t going too well. The reason is a statement from Philip Hammond, chancellor of the exchequer, reported by Reuters on Monday: The problem is the Irish border. The post-conflict settlement in Northern Ireland rests in part on a fluid and frictionless relationship with its southern neighbour, which in turn has rested on both sides belonging to the European Union. Brexit threatens to undo that settlement. If the UK is to fully leave the EU, or rely on World Trade Organization rules in a no-deal scenario, a (wildly unpopular) hard border must spring up if Northern Ireland goes with it. Or there must be some sort of special status for Northern Ireland, which fragments the UK. Or the post-Brexit relationship of the UK to the EU must be close to what it is pre-Brexit. (Martin Sandbu is the must-read guide to it all). It is safe to say technology used at the border is a red herring, as even the best database can\u0027t poke its nose inside a lorry. Here, for instance, is one of the IT experts quoted in the Irish Times calling the idea of technological solutions to the border question “complete nonsense”: Wired also looked at tech solutions for dealing with 6,000 heavy goods vehicles per day crossing the border, and decided that they were “untested or imaginary”. Blockchain as a border solution is both. So what inspired Hammond to jump on the blockwagon? It might have been a “white paper” literally called “Blockchain for Brexit”, released last week by Reply Ltd, a consultancy which promised a “solution that could save global businesses billions of pounds through seamless border checks and virtually infallible tracking systems for their goods”. Or maybe he\u0027s been spending time with fellow Tory block-nonsense enthusiasts Grant Shapps, Michelle Mone, Damien Moore, and Eddie Hughes. David Cameron (pictured here by Alphaville at a bitcoin-wallet envelope-opening office-opening party back in February 2017) might also be a role model: The thing is, a shared record-keeping system for online payments isn\u0027t the same thing as an “infallible tracking system” for goods. A blockchain, in its purest form, is an energy-intensive, slow, unwieldy bit of technology which keeps a record of cryptocurrency transactions. But that “currency” is nothing more than a string of digits. It doesn\u0027t exist outside of the internet. In order to track goods digitally, you need to somehow “tokenise” them and trust those tokens represent the physical goods. Blockchain can\u0027t do that. It\u0027s also very unclear what “blockchain technology” actually refers to. Outside of the world of cryptocurrency, its essential characteristics have become so watered down to make the term meaningless. The only common definition for it is a “distributed ledger technology”, which just replaces one incomprehensible bit of jargon with another. The chancellor might have come across it because so many companies are throwing money at it, but perhaps someone could let him know the effort has been going long enough to produce experts willing to say the Emperor has no clothes. Here, for instance, is Angus De Crespigny, who spent the last four years consulting on blockchain and crypto assets at EY, but has now quit: That\u0027s from a piece published by Coindesk last week, in which he explained why he\u0027d “lost the faith”. De Crespigny also argued that the benefits of blockchain often cited, such as encrypted data, automated reconciliation and almost-instant data transfer and tracking, can all be achieved with existing database systems. Perhaps all a bit techy and complex for a chancellor who\u0027s not an expert on these things. But this paragraph might resonate: When the world is crumbling around you, it is worthwhile staying ahead of the curve. So, even if this elusive blockchain technology could provide a “virtually infallible” tracking system for goods (it can\u0027t), it doesn\u0027t begin to solve the conundrum of how to separate one country that is a member of a trading union from another that isn\u0027t, when both sides want a fluid border. More than two years after the referendum, with the analytical heft of the civil service behind him, the chancellor is grasping at straws in the wind.

The new platform has been developed by SBI Ripple Asia, a joint venture between Japan’s SBI Holdings and US blockchain specialist Ripple. It will be launched by three of the country’s mid-sized lenders: SBI Net Sumishin Bank, Suruga Bank, and Resona Bank. Japanese banks charge customers about $3 to transfer even small amounts of money to other accounts via the Zengin domestic payments system, which only operates until 3pm on weekdays, meaning people often have to wait a day or more for money to arrive. That is much more expensive and slower than in many other countries. “We would like to change peer-to-peer and interbank payments in Japan, which are very inefficient,” said Takashi Okita, chief executive of SBI Ripple Asia and a former official at Japan’s Financial Services Agency. “The FSA is trying to reduce cash as a percentage of the economy and once people use the new MoneyTap system they will never go back,” he said. “The banking industry in Japan is still living in the non-internet era — even the banks realise they have to change.” Alipay, the mobile payments arm of China’s Alibaba, launched a service in June to provide a quicker and cheaper way for people to send money from Hong Kong to the Philippines over its GCash blockchain system using Standard Chartered as its banking partner. Ripple caused a stir in the payments industry in April by teaming up with Banco Santander to offer a service based on Ripple’s blockchain messaging technology that allows the Spanish bank’s customers in the UK, Spain, Poland and Brazil to send money in many currencies around the world. More than 100 financial institutions have registered with Ripple to use its blockchain-based messaging system, known as XCurrent, which allows banks to co-ordinate the transfer of money between currencies in seconds. Recommended However, the launch of MoneyTap in Japan will mean it is the first big country to have a blockchain-based system for transferring money between different banks. Mr Okita said SBI Ripple Asia had been working with a consortium of 61 Japanese banks on the new system and it hoped more of them would sign up to use it soon. He also plans to expand its offering to include cross-border payments. The MoneyTap app does not use Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency, which is meant to be a cheap and universal bridge currency, providing an alternative to the expensive nostro and vostro accounts of correspondent banking. But Mr Okita said this option would be open in future to any banks that wanted to use it.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-09-30","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/4fca4e76-9c86-11e8-88de-49c908b1f264","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F51c1a7da-bdfe-11e8-94b2-17176fbf93f5?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Humanitarian groups keep an eye on blockchain","INTRO":"Biometric identification offers displaced communities choice and autonomy","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When Abed Alraheem Alomari picks up food for his family at a supermarket run by the UN World Food Programme in the refugee camp in Jordan where he lives, he does so without reaching for a wallet, an ID, or cash. After stocking up on staples such as sugar, rice, oil and flour, Mr Alomari, who is 36 and fled Syria in 2016 with his wife and four children, goes to the checkout to have his iris scanned. The WFP began using iris scans — which experts say are a faster and more reliable form of biometric identification than fingerprinting — to check individuals’ identities against a UNHCR database of registered refugees. This database, in turn, is the gateway for providing a range of services to more than half a million refugees registered in Jordan. Meanwhile, blockchain, which tracks transactions securely, is the newest technology being trialled by the WFP and is invisible to the naked eye. It keeps a record of how much food Mr Alomari has collected, and how much vendors are owed. In an emailed comment sent to the FT via the WFP, Mr Alomari describes the system as “easy” to use, and “safer” than coupons or electronic cards that might get lost or misplaced. “Our pilot is the largest implementation of blockchain technology for humanitarian aid in the world,” says Houman Haddad, the WFP’s head of emerging technology. The aid agency piloted its Building Blocks programme with 100 people in Pakistan last year. This was expanded, first to 10,000 people, then 100,000, in Jordan. “Our next goal is to increase it to 500,000 people — in other words, all the people we serve,” says Mr Haddad. Many refugees, whether Syrians in the Levant, Somalis and South Sudanese in Kenya, or Rohingya Muslims in Bangladesh, fled their homes under desperate circumstances, often with few — if any — documents confirming their identity. The issue of IDs is particularly sensitive in the case of the Rohingya, an oppressed minority to whom their native Myanmar denies citizenship and who — even before last year’s brutal military crackdown — were described as “immigrants” with severe restrictions on their movement and other basic rights. The new technologies piloted in the humanitarian sphere, including blockchain and advanced biometrics, offer refugees confirmable identity documents that can be stored in the cloud. These, in turn, enable refugees to rebuild lives and careers, either when they return home or in asylum countries. While Building Blocks is, for now, solely used by the WFP, it could in future be used by other parties to store and confirm vaccination records, educational achievements or address information. “The technology allows the end-user — in this case the refugee — to take ownership and control over their own data,” says WFP’s Mr Haddad. Donor countries support the idea of cutting-edge identification and payment systems for migrants that can make their financial contributions go further, minimise fraud and — possibly over time — even eliminate middlemen from the aid business. The whole point of giving cash . . . is that you confer dignity and choice on the beneficiary In future, says Marcel Dietsch, co-founder of Covee Network, a blockchain start-up seeking to sell its services in the humanitarian sphere, “you may not need central organisations like the traditional firm, or bureaucratic aid organisations like the UN, to get people to do something valuable together”. The technological advance coincides with a debate in the humanitarian community over the best and most cost-effective ways of helping — or, to use a more fashionable word, empowering — refugees, while minimising the collateral economic damage their presence can cause to the countries they find themselves in. Part of the debate centres on whether refugees should be given cash or food aid in kind via electronic cards. “The whole point of giving cash as opposed to in-kind food aid is that you confer dignity and choice on the beneficiary,” says James Shepherd-Barron, a disaster management consultant. The evolution in philosophy is happening quickly and is mirrored in the WFP’s transition over the past decade from providing hot meals to food boxes, then to supermarkets that accept electronic cards. With more donor countries pushing for direct cash payments, the aid agency is now moving into a combination of electronic vouchers and cash. Aid officials acknowledge that advanced technology alone will not eliminate waste or fraud, but it can lessen it. To give one example, the US is now investigating alleged identity fraud among members of Myanmar’s Chin minority. They entered the country via Malaysia, where the UN captured refugees’ fingerprints. Fraudsters, however, are believed to have bought other refugees’ identities or used false names. In Bangladesh, the UN is working with the government to verify and create a joint database for Rohingya refugees, whose influx last year was massive and at times chaotic. Some were registered more than once and there was little record of family groups. The government had issued laminated paper cards that are now being replaced by plastic ones with bar and QR codes that are hard to counterfeit.

More than 70 banks, including Société Générale and Santander, are joining the Interbank Information Network (IIN) which JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Canada and ANZ have been testing for 11 months to see if blockchain technology can speed up payments that are not run of the mill. The idea is that a mutually-accessible ledger across banks would allow them to quickly resolve issues such as compliance checks, faulty addresses or missing data, which can lead to payments being held up for weeks. The banks expect to put about 14,500 US dollar-denominated payments a day through the enlarged network. “Payment is one of the segments banks worry most about in terms of ceding to non-bank competition,” said Jason Goldberg, banks analyst at JPMorgan. “Blockchain is a way to keep more of that [payments business] in-house.” There is no comprehensive data on how much market share has been won by payments start-ups using technology to offer cheaper services but individual companies have achieved significant scale, including UK-based TransferWise, which processes more than £3bn in payments every month. Emma Loftus, head of global payments and receivables at JPMorgan Treasury Services, said the IIN would help protect its businesses. “One of the complaints that the non-banks have been pointing out [relates to] these frictional processes in the existing cross-border payment mechanism,” she said. “Given that things like blockchain are addressing some of these age-old problems, we’re able to solve the problems ourselves.” Ms Loftus said only a “small percentage” of total payments instructions get held up but it can take up to two weeks to resolve any issues, making it a “significant pain point” for clients. Apparently simple cross-border payments can involve a chain of three or four companies because banks can only send payments directly to other banks with which they have “correspondent” relationships. When the instruction has missing or faulty information, or banks have to make additional compliance checks, they have to send queries back through the payments chain, bank by bank, until it reaches someone who has the information and can send it back along the same path. Recommended Accessing all the information through the blockchain creates a distributed ledger that all banks can query in real time, allowing for near-instant resolution of issues. The IIN also facilitates secure peer-to-peer messaging. The number of transactions put through the IIN will expand exponentially as the number of participating banks increases. JPMorgan plans to continue adding banks, and also hopes to expand the IIN offering into payments in non-US currencies. “If you look at [IIN] in terms of what blockchain applications are live, there are very few and most of them are either in pilot or proof of concept stage,” said Umar Farooq, head of blockchain at JPMorgan. “This is the single biggest.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Laura Noonan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-09-25","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/11353528-bb9d-11e8-8274-55b72926558f","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fc5cbd350-bbea-11e8-94b2-17176fbf93f5?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Civil wants to use blockchain to fund journalism. Can it work?","INTRO":"The start-up is trying to combat fake news and win over a new generation of readers","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Vivian Schiller has never owned cryptocurrency. The 57-year-old is about as far from a “bitcoin bro” as you can imagine. Having spent most of her career as a senior executive at media organisations including CNN, the New York Times and NBC News, she is, in her own words, a “dyed-in-the-wool cynical journalist”. So when she joined Civil, a blockchain-based platform that is selling its own currency to fund the future of journalism, I took notice. In a blog post explaining her decision, Schiller asked: “What if we had a time machine that could take us back 25 years, when news organisations were just starting to experiment with the World Wide Web? . . . Knowing what could go wrong, how might we have thought about governance, integrity of information, identity and legitimacy?” Civil aims to increase trust in journalism, and help media groups achieve financial sustainability. Schiller tells me that she wants Civil to be a community that is an “antidote” to platforms such as Twitter (where she was head of news in 2013-14) and Facebook, which, she says, have prioritised shareholder value over the value of the journalism produced by news organisations shared on their platforms. But what exactly is Civil? It was co-founded by Matthew Iles, a digital marketing entrepreneur, who felt that efforts being made to improve the business model of journalism were “too tactical”. “I thought it was pretty revolutionary if we could go back to a place where the web was open and owned by the people,” Iles tells me. Civil is more than just a platform where stories are posted for users to read. It aims to be a new media ecosystem running on a new kind of money — a token called CVL. CVLs will be sold in an initial coin offering, the cryptocurrency version of an IPO, through which the organisation hopes to raise between $8m and $24m. So will readers use the coins to pay for stories? Yes, Iles says — but he goes further, claiming CVL will be the “money of journalism”. This sounds oddly unspecific, like many blockchain projects. The Civil organisation is divided into a for-profit start-up, which is run by Iles and will sell tools such as apps and online widgets to journalists, and a non-profit foundation, run by Schiller. The foundation will distribute the funds raised as grants to a selection of journalism partners. The initial 14 newsrooms include local outlets such as the Colorado Sun, formed by journalists who had left the Denver Post, and Global Ground, which showcases local reporting on global issues. The non-profit arm will also fund its own journalistic projects. So what makes Civil different from everywhere else we go to consume news? First, to enter its “marketplace”, every organisation has to agree to its constitution — a statement of values and a code of conduct of ethical journalism — which is currently being drafted by the community. Partners will then bear the logo “This newsroom runs on Civil” on their sites, which they hope will become a mark of quality. Second, running on blockchain allows Civil to decentralise the power over what constitutes ethical journalism, giving token owners (ie readers) a voice, rather than handing power to policy teams in Silicon Valley. Readers can use tokens to object if, say, a news outlet that does not uphold the constitution wants to join the platform. Final ethical decisions will be made by the foundation’s court of appeal that includes journalists, academics and free-speech lawyers. Civil’s first challenge lies in explaining Civil. But there are other hurdles that may be more difficult to overcome. How will the organisation persuade enough people who are addicted to social media to instead crave ethical journalism — and pay for it? What happens to the Civil economy if the value of the token soars or plummets? And how do you decide and enforce a code created by a global community, with different definitions of ethical journalism and what constitutes political bias? I admire its ambition to create a viable business-model journalism — but, as a cynical journalist myself, I fear we might not yet be civilised enough for Civil to work.

Energy groups including Royal Dutch Shell, Mercuria and Gunvor, and financial institutions such as ING, Société Générale, Citigroup and ABN Amro are backing two new blockchain platforms. By digitising the large amount of contracts, letters of credit, invoices and other paperwork currently sent around the world by email, fax or post, and putting them on the Ethereum blockchain platform, they are hoping that the new platforms will lead to faster, cheaper and more secure ways of completing a trade as well as settling the transaction. “Blockchain technology will answer the needs of key participants in commodity trading by improving efficiency and security,” said Souleima Baddi, chief executive of Komgo, which will focus on commodity trade financing by digitising the lenders’ customer identification documents as well as electronic letters of credit. Komgo will launch in November alongside VAKT, which will focus on the raw material transaction, putting the information and paperwork needed for a deal to be processed on the platform. The two blockchain platforms share seven common shareholders and will work in tandem so that users can complete a transaction on the physical material side as well as the deal’s financing. From the archives Blockchain is an electronic information system that provides the underpinning of cryptocurrencies by recording deals and related information in digital blocks. Encrypted digital information, stored in linear, chronological order, can be shared and corroborated by those with permissions. The records cannot be revised and any attempted changes are visible to all participants. Commodity trading and finance, by contrast, is a centuries-old sector still reliant on the exchange of physical documents. This can lead to delays, high costs and also an increased risk of fraud. In an attempt to move into the digital age, banks and big commodity traders and their lenders have been trialling deals using blockchain, using the technology to process paperwork. One of these experiments saw document-processing times cut to a fifth of the average, while another oil trade led to cost savings of 25-30 per cent, according to participating banks. Blockchain has also been used to track the provenance of produce. Commodities group Cargill, for example, is operating a pilot scheme for its turkeys. Elsewhere, AP Moller-Maersk, the Danish shipping group, is using it in marine insurance contracts and some of Europe’s biggest banks, including HSBC and Deutsche Bank, in cross-border trade finance. The two new platforms are also based on successful earlier experiments. A blockchain-based platform was used in early 2017 for an oil cargo deal involving Mercuria, the Geneva-based energy trader, and banks ING and SocGen, while at the start of this year agricultural trader Louis Dreyfus completed a soyabean transaction with a Chinese buyer with banks ING, SocGen and ABN Amro. VAKT is looking to focus on the North Sea oil market when it launches later this year. Both platforms are talking to other players to increase the number of participants. “The projects are unique in that you see both traders and lenders backing the ventures, and the solution is answering to the needs defined by the industry itself, and co-constructed together,” said Ms Baddi, a former deputy head of commodity finance at SocGen.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Emiko Terazono","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-09-19","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/b2d866ca-a6d7-369d-991d-6fc61efd3435","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fb3016dd2-425c-4f2a-b549-0281dbe4697d_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The ICO behind the tragic Everest stunt is now “airdropping” tokens from rockets","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Remember ASKfm, the Ukraine-based social network that was encouraging people to climb Mount Everest in search of crypto tokens, while not telling them that a man who was guiding the climb, Lam Babu Sherpa, had died on the descent? Unbelievably, we received an email with the following subject line on Sunday: There is, truly, no shame in crypto publicity. ASKfm\u0027s PR representative told us they thought the email title might “grab [our] attention” which, we must say, it did. Then we got to the body of the email (emphasis theirs): That\u0027s right -- ASKfm have once again gone for the making-a-metaphor-literal promo stunt. The thinking behind burying the tokens at the top of Everest was that they would then be at “the closest starting point to reach the moon” -- a reference to the “to the moon” rallying cry of crypto HODLers worldwide. This time, they\u0027re reifying the “airdrop”, a popular technique in initial coin offerings (ICO) like ASKfm\u0027s, which involves giving out a certain number of crypto tokens for free as way of creating a buzz about the upcoming money-raising ICO. (ASKfm did not actually drop tokens out of the rocket; instead, part of the rocket parachuted into Northern Scotland carrying tokens and ASKfm took them out and buried them nearby because, er, Skyrora wanted its rocket back.) We called up ASKfm\u0027s CEO Max Tsaryk and asked whether it might be a little distasteful to be continuing with this kind of adventurous stunt given that a person had died during the last one. He told us: Just another PR campaign, indeed. But Tsaryk told us that whereas this time, he actually expects people to go after the tokens that the company says are worth $100,000 (though the public sale of the tokens needed to validate such claims for their value has not started), the Everest stunt was actually only that. The company never really thought people were going to go up the Himalayan mountain in search of the tokens (which have yet to be found): Perhaps, the undiscovered tokens -- or, better, the $100,000 they\u0027re supposedly worth -- should have been dug up and sent to Lam Babu Sherpa\u0027s family. The video promoting the tokens at the top of Everest is still on YouTube, with more than 30,000 views. Tsaryk said the company has stopped promoting it, but that it was really difficult to delete a video from the internet, and that was why it was still there. (The video features a strange man\u0027s voice saying “ASKfm puts 100,000 dollars worth of tokens at Mount Everest. If you\u0027re brave enough, go get them.”) Tsaryk also told us that he had not known about the Sherpa\u0027s death when the Everest stunt was being promoted, and that he only got confirmation of the death from our story. “You probably had more information than us,” he said. The fact that our story had confirmed the Sherpa\u0027s death -- the CEO said he had only known the Sherpa was missing before that -- and the notion that we had the most information seemed to rather contradict an interview published by Finance Magnates in May, in which Tsaryk spoke about our story and was quoted as saying: Aside from its ICO, ASKfm is a “question-and-answer” format social network, which has had over 215m people sign up. Most of its users are teenagers -- half are under 18. But ASKfm says that these marketing campaigns are “targeting a mature audience that could potentially invest in our project, not our user base”.

That was after we asked about disclosure of an \"unpaid\" position at a property start-up where he was in line to receive tokens estimated to be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds if a proposed initial coin offering went ahead successfully. He resigned from the start-up as well, saying: \"I don\u0027t want to overstretch myself\". On Tuesday, Alphaville went along to Portcullis House for the first blockchain APPG evidence session without Shapps (yes, we were surprised they let us in too). The now sole chair, Tory MP Damien Moore, was coping just fine. In fact, Shapps wasn\u0027t mentioned at all, the evidence session went ahead as if nothing had changed since the last time the APPG had convened. The only thing that may have changed is the attendance. Shapps had told us \"literally hundreds and hundreds of people\" turned up to each of these sessions, but we counted not more than 65 people in the room. Shapps must have been quite the draw. It\u0027s worth pointing out that despite a Labour call for a parliamentary inquiry into Shapps\u0027 entry in the register of members\u0027 financial interests regarding his role with the start-up, he is confident his disclosure complied with requirements and the advice he had received. He implied last month that we hadn\u0027t got all of our facts straight: Or maybe don\u0027t believe everything you read on a blog. I guess that told us. Shapps also told the Welwyn Hatfield Times -- his local paper -- that the only reason we\u0027d written our piece was that we \"basically hate everything to do with distributed tech”, and that far from being involved with the ICO for money, he had been doing it \"for the love\". The evidence session, to be frank, was pretty dull. Distributed databases are strangely uninspiring. The liveliest bit was when we introduced ourselves and asked Moore why a new vice chairman had been sworn in, fishing for a reference to Shapps. We were told, rather crossly, \"that\u0027s not part of this evidence session I\u0027m afraid\". Stares were directed our way. Another almost-highlight was when someone said it might be useful if one of the three men brought to the session to \"give evidence\" -- which often seemed astoundingly like recommendations for how parliament should treat the industry -- could define blockchain. All agreed that it wouldn\u0027t be \"a good use of [the session\u0027s]\" time to do so, so no definition was given. One of those testifying was Paul Worrall, founder and CTO of Zonafide, a company offering a \"digital wallet for securing activities\" (?) that was going to do an ICO but has rescheduled it \"due to current market conditions\". Here\u0027s a flavour of the session, when he spoke about regulatory impediments: Evidence, recommendations -- what\u0027s the difference? We\u0027re not sure business has been very hesitant about getting involved in blockchain, but there you go. Moore seemed to think this was a good point anyway: Regulators of Britain: it\u0027s not investor protection you need to worry about in the blockchain and crypto asset industry. It\u0027s removing impediments.

Many investment schemes “are not really based on blockchain technology but are hyping the blockchain concept to raise funds illegally”, the People’s Bank of China, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, the Public Security Bureau and two other agencies said in a joint statement on Friday. The agencies did not announce specific policy actions but warned the public to be on guard against “fraud” and report suspicious activities to authorities. Marketing claims such as “value will only rise, never fall” and “high return, low risk” are characteristic of fraud, the statement claimed. The warning was issued as Chinese regulators escalated their crackdown on cryptocurrency trading and initial coin offerings. A multi-agency task force on internet finance will take measures against 124 cryptocurrency and ICO platforms with servers located outside China but which substantially target Chinese residents, the official Shanghai Securities News reported this week. The report did not specify how authorities would act against foreign groups. Internet group Tencent also shut down at least four major public accounts related to cryptocurrencies on its popular WeChat mobile messaging platform. The company said in an emailed statement that the accounts violated instant messaging regulations that the Cyberspace Administration of China issued in 2014. ICOs enjoyed a brief but intense boom in China in mid-2017, but in September the government declared them illegal and shut down platforms that facilitated such deals. Days later, a multi-agency task force on internet finance shut down exchanges for trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Before the shutdown, local exchanges had been permitted to continue operating after an earlier campaign forced them to strengthen controls against money laundering and capital flight. Even after local platforms exited, however, trading and ICO investment continued under the radar, with investors using WeChat or other messaging tools to facilitate informal transactions. Recommended Chinese investors were also able to access foreign-based platforms, sometimes using a virtual private network to evade China’s internet controls. In addition to targeting overseas platform, the task force is also forcing third-party payments groups to strengthen measures to ensure that they do not process payments for cryptocurrency trading and ICOs. Also last week, a district government in Beijing issued a notice banning office buildings, hotels and shopping malls from hosting sales and marketing events related to cryptocurrencies.

Environment. Ethics.\" The proximity of the Crypto Challenge Forum to the Houses of Parliament\u0027s corridors of power didn\u0027t seem purely incidental. Among the speakers at the conference were not one but two Tory parliamentarians, who took to the stage to espouse the glory of the distributed ledger. We\u0027ve written about the Conservative party\u0027s love affair with all things blockchain and crypto before -- so much, in fact, that we last week began a series on the subject. Readers might remember one of the conference speakers, Eddie Hughes, MP for North Walsall, who in the summer was pushing for a \"blockchain for Bloxwich\" -- one of the towns in his constituency -- because \"blockchain for Walsall North wouldn’t have the same ring to it\". More on him later. Another of the conference speakers was Lord Chris Holmes of Richmond, a nine-time Paralympic medal-winner and now lifetime Tory peer. He put out a paper last year on the use of distributed ledger technology \"for public good\", in which he talked about blockchain as a \"game-changer\" (he released an update to the report this week). Monday\u0027s speech was in a similar vein, with the technology pitched as a central part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution -- \"4IR\" -- and the presentation delivered with plenty of enthusiasm as well as a few good jokes. The problem -- as so often in the world of blockchain -- was trying to make sense of any of it. Lord Holmes told the audience: Yeah! When did everyone stop optimising stuff? He continued: Sorry, what? Maybe that bit about the modicum of sh*t was a joke? But was it all a joke or what does any of the rest of it mean? At one point Lord Holmes\u0027 tone became positively priest-like, with the kind of repetitive and proselytising phrases one would normally expect to hear in a sermon: Eddie Hughes, speaking on the \"blockchain and the future of the world economy\" panel, took a slightly less evangelising tone. He gave us his verdict on the recent report from the Treasury select committee\u0027s inquiry into crypto assets -- which we thought was quite good. His take was pretty damning: Oh dear. First Brexit and now blockchain -- Britain is screwed. Hughes also told us he\u0027d spoken about blockchain on a panel at the Tory conference earlier this month (the same conference that Philip \"Spreadsheet Phil\" Hammond suggested that distributed spreadsheets could solve the Irish border problem): No, that\u0027s not the right way of putting it. And if he weren\u0027t speaking on blockchain panels and putting out 36-page reports on the subject, that would be a fine mistake to make. (He did later clarify that to say it was 21 pounds\u0027 worth of bitcoin, after one of the other panelists pointed this out.) The rest of the conference was also a little unusual. It had caught our attention because of an impressive line-up that included Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, Apple co-founder-turned-token-offerer Steve Wozniak, and \"Bitcoin Jesus\" himself, Roger Ver. But none of those people actually showed up. A pre-recorded video of Ver was played on Tuesday. The other two were not mentioned. For an event that was pitched to us as \"not just any crypto conference, but the crypto conference\", we thought we might at least get a mini pain au chocolat and some watery coffee, but no. The \"networking breaks\" featured no refreshment, and the \"networking lunch\" featured... no lunch! \"We made a mistake with the programme\", the compere told the audience. \"It\u0027s a self-organised lunch.\" We were later told by the conference organiser that it was too expensive to put on lunch. As members of the media, we didn\u0027t pay for our tickets so didn\u0027t mind too much popping out to Pret during the break, but we might have been a bit peeved if we\u0027d spent the £660 the conference tickets cost -- plus VAT -- without being given so much as egg and cress sandwich. For another £800 plus VAT it was possible to buy a ticket to the \"Halloween Crypto Gala \u0026 Awards Giving Ceremony\", at another venue near Trafalgar Square. This was a glitzy affair featuring actual food and drink, an £8m Stradivarius violin and some awards, which all somehow went to attendees of the gala! Here\u0027s a picture from inside: One of the award recipients was HYGH, a Berlin-based blockchain firm, who won ICO of the year. They also happened to be one of the conference\u0027s main sponsors. We asked the conference organiser at the gala whether he thought it was a bit off that sponsors were being given the awards, but he said that while HYGH had provided \"support\" to the conference, that support was \"not pecuniary\" in nature. HYGH is listed on the conference website as a key sponsor and HYGH told us that had cost them at least $15,000, so that all seemed a little off too. All in all, it was a strange conference. At one point we were told by a speaker that \"citizen mining\" via the blockchain could eliminate recessions and inflation; at another that the most famous bubble of all time -- the tulip bubble -- wasn\u0027t a bubble. Business cards were being handed out that had \"embedded tokens\" in them. (Our personal highlight was interviewing artist MIA about the idea of blockchain in the music industry.

Mr Shapps, the MP for Welwyn Hatfield, said on Tuesday that he was resigning as an adviser to blockchain start-up OpenBrix, after the Financial Times asked why he had listed the role as “unpaid” in the parliamentary register of members’ financial interests. OpenBrix CEO Shahad Choudhury indicated on Monday that the company had proposed paying the MP tokens expected to be worth about £170,000, assuming its planned sale of tokens to the public in a so-called “initial coin offering” — or ICO — went ahead successfully. Mr Shapps said he had listed the matter in line with advice from the House of Commons’ registrar of interests. He said he would forgo any entitlement to tokens, and stand down as co-chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Blockchain, as he didn’t “want to overstretch” himself. Jo Platt, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, wrote on Wednesday to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Kathryn Stone, asking for an investigation in relation to Mr Shapps’ potentially lucrative role. “The Register of Members’ Financial Interests is designed to provide information about any and all financial interests which a Member of Parliament has which might reasonably be considered to influence his or her actions of words as a Member of Parliament,” she wrote, adding that she wanted the commissioner to open an investigation into Mr Shapps’ conduct as “a matter of urgency”. The standards commissioner declined to comment. Under new rules approved by MPs, her office no longer discloses whether it has opened an investigation. Mr Shapps said he had recorded his original conversation with the registrar of members’ interests, the official responsible for advising MPs about how to disclose their financial interests. He said on Wednesday that he would “actually welcome” an investigation by the standards commissioner, because “it would mean that I would be able to provide the full recording and transcript to the House authorities. “This would confirm that I specifically both sought and then explicitly followed detailed advice given to me by the Register of Financial Members’ Interests to the letter,” he said. In 2015 Mr Shapps was criticised for holding a second job a year after becoming an MP despite previous denials. He stepped down as chair of the Conservatives later that year after a bullying scandal for which he was ultimately cleared of responsibility. He returned to the headlines last October when he led a shortlived attempt to oust Theresa May as prime minister.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Henry Mance","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-08-02","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/fc9d3b82-de7b-3e67-bd3c-835575172608","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F4d9accaf-a4cd-42a0-8f05-f59f94607e3c_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The baroness, the ICO fiasco, and enter Steve Wozniak","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Earlier this year, we brought you news that Scottish lingerie entrepreneur-turned Conservative peer Michelle Mone and her businessman boyfriend Doug Barrowman were launching an initial coin offering (ICO). The plan was to raise money for a token-based crowdfunding venture, EQUI Capital. But the project has ended in a fiasco that exposes the total absence of oversight in the ICO market, and in particular the lack of protection for those at the bottom of the crypto, er, FUDchain: \"bounty-hunters\" -- essentially online marketers who promote ICOs on social media and across the internet, supposedly in return for digital tokens. EQUI told us in February they hoped to raise up to $80m. Even if they raised less than that, the token offering would be \"going live\" no matter what, Barrowman said. Lady Mone of Mayfair, OBE, calling herself \"one of the biggest experts in Cryptocurrency and Blockchain\", told Business Insider that she and Barrowman were staking their \"incredible reputations\" on the ICO and that there was \"no way [they were] going to do anything untowards (sic) to let these people down\". The reassurance might have been welcome, because initial coin offerings are effectively an unregulated way for companies to raise money from the public, bypassing securities laws designed to protect investors through the use of so-called cryptocurrencies. Regulators may yet step in, with those in the US indicating the rules still apply to what are securities in all but name. For now the ICO boom has prompted a flourishing in the number of businesses offering tokens, with more than $6.8bn raised so far this year alone, according to icodata.io, which tracks the market. The EQUI ICO didn\u0027t go quite to plan, however. It isn\u0027t going live, and lots of people seem to be feeling pretty let down. (But as you will see, dear reader, we wouldn\u0027t want to say it failed, because EQUI are watching, and they\u0027re going to tell our editor, and we might get sued.) After launching a two-week pre-sale a on March 1, with a minimum required investment of $100,000, EQUI put out a press release on March 6 boasting that it had raised a nice, round $7m \"in only a few days\". Barrowman said in a statement at the time: Then, having still only apparently raised $7m on March 30, EQUI announced the \"good news\" that it would be extending the public ICO -- minimum investment $100 -- until June 30 (having originally planned to close it on April 12). By the end of June, the total amount raised still seems to have been stuck at $7m. At that point, EQUI decided to abandon the ICO idea altogether and to relaunch, on September 18, as \"EQUI Global\". It is still promising to be the \"ULTIMATE DISRUPTOR TO TRADITIONAL VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTING\", the logo looks the same, and the founders are pretty much the same -- Mone, Barrowman plus one other \"soon to be announced\" (more on that below). But there is no initial coin offering. The ICO World Of Business is a very strange place of doing business EQUI explained, via email: We asked how it was possible for the founders to have a track record of \"over 300 years in business\" given that there were only two of them. That must have been a typo, we were told -- actually that figure also includes the advisory board, of whom there are four members (apparently very sprightly-looking 90-year-olds): Here\u0027s the breakdown of the $7m EQUI says it raised (emphasis ours): It\u0027s unclear just how close the \"consortium\" of investors is to the EQUI management team. But the statement appears somewhat inconsistent with the earlier one about \"investments ranging from the minimum hundred thousand dollar threshold up to a solid couple of million per investment\". On top of the $6m, EQUI\u0027s \"short\" four-month-long ICO raised ether, a popular cryptocurrency, worth about $250,000 at current rates. (At the ether rates back in March, when this $7m was first announced, the ether was worth about $700,000.) When we suggested that according to their numbers, no money at all had been raised between the \"frenetic trading\" of early March and June 30, we were told that the pre-sale had in fact raised \"between $6.5m and $7m\", and that the 843.33 ether had been raised in the public sale. Thus the $7m originally announced grew to... $7m. Rounding, huh. Barrowman told FT Alphaville when we spoke to him earlier this year that he had spent a “seven-figure” sum on the project since beginning in summer 2017, though it\u0027s wasn\u0027t exactly clear what that money referred to. Either way, the paltry $7m EQUI had raised -- less than 10 per cent of its target -- then started to ebb further. Here\u0027s EQUI: Some were refunded without their consent, as this post on the EQUI Reddit channel suggests: When we asked about this, someone who wanted to be described only as an \"insider\" told us that first of all investors were told they would be refunded. But, as not all of them had wanted a refund, the \"sophisticated investors\" were allowed to stay on, while the others were refunded, the insider said. It is these sophisticated investors who will now be allowed to participate in the new EQUI venture which, as we\u0027ve seen, focuses on \"Token Blockchain Technology\", but is strictly not an ICO according to the company. The reason for the change in tack after the wildly successful and not in any way failed ICO, our insider told us, is that -- as has been reported in the crypto-press -- an Apple co-founder called Steve Wozniak is to join the company, and will become EQUI\u0027s third co-founder. He didn\u0027t want to be part of an ICO, and \"he’s come up with a different way of doing it\", we were told. Woz told CNBC in June that he wanted bitcoin to become the single global currency because \"that is so pure thinking\" (the whole video is worth a watch). The most miserable cryptojob of them all A dispute has broken out -- reported first by Scottish politics site Wings over Scotland -- over how much the \"bounty-hunters\" we mentioned before should be paid, given that the ICO no longer appears to be going ahead. It highlights another aspect of the ICO world. Unlike, say, the highly legalistic prospectuses produced for securities offerings in the traditional financial system, the legal status of the promotional documents associated with coin and token offerings remains untested. In EQUI\u0027s original \"White Paper\" it was written, under \"token distribution\", that \"2 per cent will be available for Bounty Rewards\", with a pie chart to illustrate that as a proportion of the total supply: Given that the price of one of these tokens was $0.50 and there were to be 250m tokens, bounty-hunters say they were expecting to share a pool of $2.5m, and indeed this is what was said in EQUI\u0027s Bitcointalk group for bounty-hunters: EQUI say they were not responsible for the post but we understand that it was reviewed by them before it was posted by the company managing the bounty programme, as is standard practice. In a later Bitcointalk post, we find similar wording: \"A total of 2 per cent (5,000,000 EQUI) of the total token supply will be assigned to the Bounty Pool.\" But EQUI seem to be a bit confused about what that 2 per cent meant. They told us, via email: So in the first paragraph, they tell us that the bounty-hunters raised just $2,000 between them, and that they should therefore only be given $40 to divide between themselves (2 per cent of $2,000). That seems strange; bounty-hunters are not meant to be \"raising\" money per se. Rather, they are effectively online street teams -- typically from low-income regions of the world -- who are paid a certain amount of tokens for each task they perform, such as sharing promotional tweets and posts on social media, adding their logo to their online \"signatures\", creating videos and writing puff pieces for the ICO they are toiling on behalf of. But EQUI says all the money it raised except for $2,000 -- again a nice round number, which is apparently an \"estimate\" -- came from its own contacts, and that therefore the bounty-hunters should really only get a share of this tiny amount. Confusingly though, in the second paragraph above, EQUI seems to be saying it had a \"legal contract\" in which they promise that 2 per cent of the total raised after refunds -- so the 785.33 ether -- should go to the bounty-hunting pool. That would be 15.71 ether, currently worth just over $4,000. But as a \"gesture of good will\", they\u0027ve decided to increase that to just under 40 ether, or about $11,000. Because of lax KYC checks in such schemes and therefore the possibility that people register more than once, it is difficult to know how many real people were involved in this bounty-hunting effort. EQUI say between 1,000 and 1,500 while AmaZix -- the company that was originally managing the bounty programme but who stopped working with Equi back in May, citing \"irreconcilable differences\" -- said there were 7,600 unique usernames in the bounty. Either way, $11,000 doesn\u0027t seem like a very big pool to share among them. \"Police can track you down\" We spoke to several of EQUI\u0027s bounty-hunters and were shown Telegram messages. When they complained about the amount there were getting paid or the way they were being treated, EQUI threatened them with lawyers if they \"bad-mouthed\" the company. One Telegram message sent to a group of bounty hunters said \"police can track you down if you threaten \u0026 track and bad mouth our brand name\"; another sent the same day said \"you are all so stupid\". EQUI declined to comment on the messages. That a peer of the realm\u0027s business appears to have threatened criminal consequences for people encouraged to take part in its unregulated investment scheme is, if nothing else, a bad look. One bounty-hunter, Maksim Koselev, a 29-year-old Russian warehouse worker, told us he had spent about 10 to 15 minutes per day, seven days a week, promoting EQUI online for the months during which the ICO was running, which included writing two promotional articles about the company in Russian. He\u0027s worked as a bounty-hunter for more than 100 ICOs, he said, and apart from the exit scams -- where those raising money disappear with the funds they have raised -- this is the worst experience he\u0027s ever had. He, and others, said bounty-hunters should have been paid 2 per cent of the $7m Equi raised, particularly given that EQUI is still planning to raise money from investors. He told us: Our experience of interacting with EQUI has also been a bit... strange. When we contacted the company via its website we were replied to by Baroness Mone\u0027s press officer, who offered us a \"deal on an exclusive\". When we asked some questions about the bounty-hunters\u0027 complaints, we were told that \"anything that is written that is defamatory to EQUI or our founders we will take severe action\". Not only did Equi copy in their lawyers, but all this came with a “UK parliament disclaimer” at the bottom, a nice reminder this was a member of the upper house of the British parliament we were dealing with. EQUI\u0027s solicitor Paul Tweed -- a celebrity media lawyer so renowned that the New York Times dedicated a whole story to him earlier this year, who has represented everyone from Sylvester Stallone to, er, Britney Spears -- was copied in conspicuously to emails, as was Egg Media, a PR company \"specialising in crisis management, corporate brand and individual reputation\". These are well-connected people who seem to know what they\u0027re doing and don\u0027t appear to be struggling for cash. \"We are watching your every move\" In an email on Monday, we were told: To check the bounty participants had received the cash, we sent a message to the Telegram support group asking if members had received anything. We were told no one had yet been paid, as it turned out. EQUI later said it had paid the money to a third party, who will distribute this to bounty-hunters shortly. But straight after we\u0027d sent the message to the group, things got creepier. EQUI Support got in touch on Telegram with the following: We at Alphaville have a history of frustration over the baroness\u0027s media team\u0027s antics, but telling us that our every move was being watched kind of felt like another level. We look forward to learning how EQUI Global can be relaunched in a way which isn’t an ICO, given its business model was built around the tokens it hoped to sell. It seems that yet another Conservative parliamentarian has learned that dipping one\u0027s (cryp)toes into the murky waters of ICOs can be a rough experience.

I have a crazy schedule on this trip,” says the serial entrepreneur, who jumps up on the deck with a broad smile as she shakes my hand. “I see you have met Mum,” she says, pointing to a pretty green urn on the table near where I’m sitting. “My friends have often mistaken this urn as some type of fancy oolong tea jug — so there have been some embarrassing moments when I’ve had to yell at them ‘don’t drink Mum’s ashes!’ ” Kemp is founder and chief executive of Everledger, a technology company headquartered in London that uses blockchain technology to track the provenance of diamonds and other valuable products. Last month the World Economic Forum named Everledger as one of the most promising technology pioneers of 2018. In March the company completed a $10.4m funding round led by the Canadian arm of Fidelity Investments, enabling Everledger to ramp up its global expansion by opening an office in Israel. It already has offices in the UK, India, Australia and Singapore. Since founding the company in 2015, Kemp spends her time travelling between Everledger’s offices, customers and trade events. She returns to Brisbane at least once every two or three months to visit the local Everledger office, recharge her batteries and reconnect with family and friends. “This is an oasis for me. I get to regenerate all the cells in my body and detox in this beautiful environment. It really is something special,” she says. Kemp’s seemingly boundless energy is infectious as she leads me on a tour of her six-acre estate, which is built on a former grass bobsleigh and ski resort about 40 minutes’ drive outside Brisbane. The resort closed in 1993 and was subdivided into nine properties, one of which Kemp purchased in 2007. She introduces me to Charlie, one of her horses, her chickens and raves about the 60 goats her neighbour keeps on his nearby property. Her godson lives in a big ramshackle house on the estate while Kemp stays in the “Train Mahal”, the home she has built out of an old Victoria Railways train carriage that she bought on eBay in 2010 and had shipped more than 1,000 kilometres across Australia. “My friends call it the Taj Mahal of trains — they think it’s a bit over the top. But I love it,” says Kemp, who completed a lot of the renovation work herself. “I’m a self-taught engineer and whether it’s the deck here in the train or building a piece of software code — it’s kind of within me to do it.” The train is a 12m long by 3m wide guards’ carriage, which was built in the early 1970s. The dark grey steel structure is grafted on to the side of a small wooden house to create a unique two-bedroom home that nestles under a row of Drooping She Oaks, a native Australian tree, which provide shade from the sun. The kitchen and living room are built into the train carriage, which means they have to be compact and bijou due to the narrow dimensions. The original doors and windows of the train have been retained. Two large gold and red ampersand sculptures hang on the walls of the living room. “The thought that this symbol literally means ‘and’ always pushes me to go farther,” says Kemp. “I have an ampersand sitting next to my computer in London and when I’m working on a concept, it always catches my eye and makes me think ‘\u0026’ what else Leanne? The thought challenges me to keep creating.” Kemp founded and sold a handful of technology companies before Everledger, providing her with the experience of managing businesses and the financial security that she craved following the break-up of her parents’ marriage when she was 13 years old. “I think this may have given me the drive and determination not to be affected by external risk and [the] push for financial security,” she says, when asked to reflect on why she became an entrepreneur. “And I have a curious mind.” This is an oasis for me. I get to regenerate all the cells in my body and detox in this beautiful environment Kemp is one of a new wave of female entrepreneurs in the traditionally male-dominated technology industry, which has a reputation for sexism and paying women less than male employees. Last year a survey of 950 technology workers by Women Who Tech, a non-profit group, found 53 per cent of women had experienced harassment, compared with 16 per cent of men. The US Department of Labor said in 2017 it had found evidence of “systematic compensation disparities” at Google, which has denied the allegation. Kemp says she hasn’t experienced sexism in the sector, which probably reflects the fact she hasn’t had a conventional role that leaves employees at mercy of a company’s corporate culture. “I’m quite sure it does happen but I’m probably just ‘bulldozer blind’ to it all,” says Kemp, who nevertheless has recruited a 44 per cent female workforce at Everledger. Kemp built the “Train Mahal” after her own personal life “imploded” with the end of a long-term relationship in the mid noughties. She took a backpack to Nepal to do some thinking and then came back to Australia with the impetus to build something of her own in a sustainable manner. “The property here is all run on solar energy and is fully sustainable. If you sit out here this is God’s country,” says Kemp, with a sweep of her hand towards the estate. We can move beyond diamonds to tackle problems in the world’s biggest supply chains “We have something special in Australia and it saddens me to think of what is happening to the Great Barrier Reef and other natural wonders.” Kemp’s Australian hideaway is a far cry from her apartment in the heart of Westminster, London, which she says incorporates all the “vileness” of big city life, including high-end bench tops, air conditioning and central heating. However, she has made one concession to comfortable living at the Train Mahal in the form of a large spa bath in the bathroom, which is the biggest room in the house. The main bedroom is conventional with a double bed, wood panel walls and a splash of colour provided by canvases of an electric guitar and a dog riding a skateboard. “I have been around dogs since my childhood and have always loved being in the company of our four-legged friends,” says Kemp, who wears a puppy dog necklace of white and black diamonds around her neck. “My dog was with me every day — through the early years of my career, in every meeting under the desk, a constant companion. My dog’s death was much worse than my separation,” she says. When Kemp finished renovating the Train Mahal she sought a new challenge and moved to London, where she began learning about blockchain — the distributed ledger technology that sits at the heart of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. “I saw a large amount of financial institutions employing cryptographers and thinking about bitcoin — so I just started to ask some questions and then one thing led to another,” she says. Kemp was invited to be part of a Barclays TechStars accelerator programme, which provided seed funding for Everledger. The start-up developed a suite of different technologies — blockchain, RFID and data matrix coding — to track diamonds from mines to retailers and is now diversifying to prove the provenance of fine wine, gemstones, metals and the lithium and cobalt in next-generation batteries. “When I look at what we can do at Everledger, just like Amazon moved beyond books, we can move beyond diamonds to tackle problems in the world’s biggest supply chains. These are huge tectonic plate shifts happening,” she says. “I think we are going to have a billion-dollar impact.” These were made in Italy and handed down to Kemp by one of her life mentors, Andy Donaldson, a farmer and strong influence over the past 15 years, who passed away recently. “We talked about everything over those old wooden balls and a good bottle of red wine — the principles of marriage, raising kids, theology, careers and even cooking,” says Kemp.

Until recently Tom Snyder, the zoo’s director of programming and conservation action, had little idea how effectively these funds were spent. “You send the money and you get an annual report on how it is going,” he says. “Sometimes, because non-profit organisations are so stretched, the report doesn’t arrive for six months after the end of the review period. So it can be 18 months before you get any information. Many times the money doesn’t go towards the things they say it will.” Snyder believes blockchain could solve his information problem. Seneca Zoo has partnered with Ixo Foundation, a non-profit open-source software development organisation, to monitor the Madagascar tree-planting effort through Ixo’s blockchain-based platform. It is not just blockchain riding to the rescue. A whole collection of technologies, from smartphones to wirelessly connected sensors and publicly available satellite imagery, is coming together to verify what is happening on the ground in a Madagascan rainforest in a way that was simply not possible before. When each seed or sapling is planted, for example, the forester can snap a picture of it, with GPS co-ordinates of where it was taken. These pictures can be compared with satellite imagery of the forest canopy or light readings from sensors at ground level to verify that there really has been an increase of trees in the area. Blockchain is the network that knits it all together. The same distributed ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin makes it possible to maintain and verify digital records continuously in ‘blocks’. It can be used to capture many proof points, creating a unique record that cannot be tampered with, but which can be easily viewed by anyone. The plan, says Snyder, is that from next February, you will be able to walk into the zoo, donate money towards the conservation project and then receive real time updates on your phone — including pictures — of your trees being planted. “We hope it will encourage more people to donate,” Snyder says. Seneca Park Zoo’s own conservation budget may be modest, but the US Association of Zoos \u0026 Aquariums collectively invests more than $250m in international conservation each year. Other organisations are looking at blockchain as a way of tracking previously difficult to verify outcomes. Vestergaard, a Swiss-based health company, for example, is working with Hiveonline, a Danish blockchain start-up, to provide microfinance for farmers in Ghana. We can’t stop people cheating but we can make it harder for them to do it Vestergaard already sells farmers insecticide-impregnated crop storage bags to help stop grain becoming infested with weevils and other pests. Now the bags can be filled with a wireless chip for tracking and the quality of the grain can be assessed with an image recognition app on a smartphone. Based on this data, farmers can borrow money against the value of the crops they have stored with a local broker, for example. The money can be sent in the form of cryptocurrency, without the need for conventional banks. Blockchain is not infallible, nor does it solve the fundamental logistics problems that African farmers face, says Sofie Blakstad, founder and chief executive of Hiveonline. “We can’t take away the fact that it can still be a nightmare moving goods from one place to another in Africa, but we can put more transparency in,” she says. “We can’t stop people cheating but we can make it harder for them to do it.” There are other problems too, such as making sure that data is not misused. Snyder, for example, is looking at ways to make sure poachers do not get hold of biodiversity information that would show them where rare animals might be found. For blockchain pioneers, the tracking and verification possibilities are just the tip of the iceberg. The bigger vision for Shaun Conway, founder and president of Ixo Foundation, is potentially bringing in new money and investors into areas such as impact investing. Conway says Ixo’s Blockchain for Impact platform could turn any desired impact investing outcome — such as the education of girls in rural India or the replanting of a number of hectares of rainforest — into a tradeable unit, or token. These could then be traded on a secondary market, like a bond, with the value going up and down depending on the progress of the project. Does it look like those rural Indian girls are getting high scores in their school exams? You may be in for a bonus payment — and the value of the token goes up. “It would establish a market and create liquidity around these projects,” says Conway. Might the trading introduce moral hazard, however? Could someone short the reforestation tokens and start a forest fire to ensure their value plunges? Conway admits it cannot be ruled out. For Snyder, the possibility of trading tokenised trees and education outcomes is interesting but a little hypothetical. For now the tracking is exciting enough. “People have to get comfortable with the system first,” he says. “A year or two down the road we can see what else comes out of it.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Maija Palmer","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-09-23","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/e50d2f32-a6a9-390d-b267-fcac302daf7d","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Ff1060c95-4466-4413-aef2-f4bd2f369b96_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Britain\u0027s first blockchain-enabled co-working space isn\u0027t blockchain-enabled","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Primalbase is a company that raised money through an initial coin offering (ICO) last summer and is now fulfilling its promise to token-holders. That is an unusual thing for us to be writing here on Alphaville, but we are happy to give credit where it\u0027s due. As readers may be aware, however, we\u0027re not so happy to dole it out where it ain\u0027t. We were sent a press release earlier this week with the following headline: We were curious to see what a blockchain-enabled workspace might look and feel like. Were our movements to be tracked on a tamper-proof ledger? Were we to be granted access via a smart-contract-enabled electronic key? Would our identities be checked against the biometric data we had stored on a chain of blocks? It was all rather exciting. So to find out, we went along to Primalbase\u0027s new digs in London on Thursday, when its token-holders -- from whom the company raised $7.5m last June in less than 24 hours -- were being given a tour. Although the space is not finished -- it will open on October 4th -- it looks very nice! It occupies the entire 32nd floor of the CityPoint tower, near Moorgate, and has panoramic views of London. Here\u0027s a shot we took: But to our dismay, we couldn\u0027t find much evidence of it being “blockchain-enabled”. It looked and felt and was pretty much like any other shared office space, except men in orange hats were busy constructing stuff, and there weren\u0027t any desks or coffee machines or free beer in it yet. But there didn\u0027t seem to be much high-tech stuff to come either. The techiest thing seemed to be the following, as explained to us by CEO Ralph Manheim, who was giving us the tour: The redboard, apparently, will be written on in white. The future is bright; the future is red and white. Primalbase, which has already opened “blockchain-enabled” offices in Amsterdam and Berlin, appears to be much the same as any other co-working space, except for the fact that it has 1,000 token-holders who now have a lifetime membership. These lifetime members paid 3 bitcoins each per Primalbase token (PBT), which if they had bought on the day of the ICO would have cost them about $7,500. For those who were already hodling crypto, it would have been a lot less -- bitcoin had almost in tripled in value since the start of the year alone. (Oh, the salad days of 2017!) This lifetime membership allows token-holders to use not only the London office, but also the other two that are already up-and-running, as well as two more that are currently being built in Brooklyn and Singapore, and any more that open in the future. Furthermore, lifetime membership is underselling it -- the tokens have no expiry date, nor are they restricted to the buyer, so holders can donate them to others in their will. As we\u0027ve seen, the most anyone paid for a Primalbase token in the ICO was $7,500 -- about £5,800. WeWork hot-desk spaces start at £200 a month, which means that it would take 29 months -- 2-1/2 years -- to make the money back if we\u0027re assuming similar rates to the market leader (though Primalbase did not want to disclose its own rates). And if token-holders decide they don\u0027t want to use the space any more, they can sell their PMB to someone else, potentially for more than they bought it for (hence turning “renting into an investment”, as per the press release). So, as long as the company doesn\u0027t go bust before then -- which is not gonna happen, says Manheim -- this seems like a prettttty good deal. Had we heard about this at the time of the ICO, we would have probably doubted it would actually happen, because... it seems a little crazy! It\u0027s reminiscent of when American Airlines sold unlimited lifetime flights, or “AAirpasses”, back in the early 1980s for $250,000, only to realise that -- as whopping an amount as that might have been then -- they were losing millions of dollars a year from the scheme. We asked Primalbase how this could be a sustainable business model. They explained that there were two other revenue streams alongside the money that came from the ICO. One is events: the company puts on blockchain conferences, workshops and meet-ups and says it makes decent money doing so. (We asked what would happen when the blockchain bubble bursts -- apparently that has not happened yet -- and they said they would pivot to other emerging technology. Simples.) The other revenue stream seemed to be kind of crucial though. From the press release: So in other words, Primalbase has regular tenants who effectively subsidise the token-holders. There will be spaces for 60 token-holders, who will hot-desk, as well as 16 offices, which can accommodate roughly another 75 people, so it will be almost evenly split between the two groups (although the private tenants get their own rooms). We asked whether this might cause some resentment among the paying tenants, but were told, by Manheim: Not sure how unique that USP is, but fine. According to Manheim, who seemed like a genuine guy who believed in Primalbase\u0027s utopian vision, it will all be one happy family and the tenants will be pleased to pay more than they would otherwise so that they can market their products to the token-holders. Here he is, in the aforementioned orange garb that we all had to wear: The token-holders, who were being fed a free Pret A Manger lunch, all seemed pretty happy too. Georgi Georgiev, a 30-something Bulgarian, who is a partner in a crypto trading firm, told us: Georgi is right. It does just happen to be a token. Sure, that token runs on a blockchain, but when it\u0027s exchanged, it\u0027s on a regular old website. And bookings for the co-working space are also made on a standard online system (though they say this will move onto a blockchain-based system in future. Watch this space). The press release tells us: But we don\u0027t quite see which processes are being streamlined, or where the transparency and efficiency come in. For now, Primalbase is just another co-working space, with a bunch of people getting a good deal on their membership. Like WeWork, it might be hip and cool -- in some circles -- but it is less a fresh-and-new tech company and more a plain old commercial property firm, with the blockchain seemingly more about marketing than technicolour dream ledgers.

Today, that bandwagon has slowed. A painful crypto bear market has begun and critics are increasingly raising questions over whether blockchain’s distributed ledger technology can deliver on its promises to revolutionise finance — as well as other industries. Some of these start-ups — including the cryptocurrency exchanges — remain private, and some have attracted high-profile backers such as Goldman Sachs. Others have opted to raise funds on the public markets, despite growing scrutiny from global regulators — Bitmain Technologies, the world’s biggest producer of cryptocurrency mining chips, was this week reported to be planning a $3bn Hong Kong listing. In London, however, the public crypto and blockchain companies are very much minnows — and as the market turns, they are having to swim against the tide. Argo listed on the London Stock Exchange at the beginning of August, raising £25m in a placing that it said was “significantly oversubscribed”. The Quebec-based company aims to “democratise” crypto-mining, the process of creating digital currency using extensive computing power. Its business model involves renting out its specialist computing capacity for a monthly fee — but as yet it only has around 20 staff and, as of June, zero revenue. Argo priced its offering of 156m shares — 53 per cent of its issued share capital — at 16p a share, valuing the company at £47m. But the stock sank to 12.9p on its first day and has since lost more than 40 per cent to stand at around 9p. The rapid drop comes as more mature rivals wobble. Genesis Mining, an Icelandic company with a similar “cloud mining” business and 2m users, said this week that the falling bitcoin price had “reduced mining outputs”, meaning some of its clients had not been able to pay their fees. It has told its customers to sign up to a five-year contract with no termination — or lose its services altogether. Still, Argo’s flotation attracted several mainstream investors, including Miton Asset Management, Janus Henderson and Jupiter, according to its website. The company has said it is hunting out cheap renewable power in Iceland and China. Several days after listing, it announced a multiyear agreement to lease two data centres in Quebec for at least three years, adding to an existing data centre in the city which it says “supports 407 subscribers”. Online Blockchain was known as On-line until it moved to cash in on the crypto craze late last year, shifting its strategy from incubating internet and information businesses. The switch saw its share price soar more than tenfold from around 14p in October to a peak in January of 152p. However, as crypto prices fell, Online Blockchain has since lost 75 per cent to trade at around 40p today, giving it a market capitalisation of about £3.8m. The company, which boasts former General Electric executive William Louden as a non-executive director, has long held a stake in markets data site ADVFN. But in January, it raised £1m in a share placing for its new blockchain projects. These have yet to bear fruit, however. According to a recent announcement, it has bought several mining processors and developed a platform that allows cryptocurrency miners to pool their computing power. This has begun to generate commissions — paid in crypto — but these are “not yet material”, it said. Together with ADVFN, Online Blockchain has also launched a cryptocurrency called PlusOneCoin to enable social media users to rate each other’s content. While there are “currently no financial arrangements” between the two in respect to the project, Online Blockchain said it anticipates it will charge ADVFN a licence fee for the crypto software “in due course”. This week, it bought a 35 per cent stake in Encryptid Gaming Inc, a crypto start-up that develops gaming software, for $100,000. Like Online Blockchain, Blockchain Worldwide changed tack as crypto prices were soaring. It originally listed as telecoms investor Stapleton Capital in September 2017, raising £1.5m. But in January, it announced a rebranding and shift to focus on crypto, sending its shares up by nearly 50 per cent. Since then, no further transactions have been announced and the group has not changed the name on its website . In its half-year report in May, the group’s chairman Jon Hale said Blockchain had continued “to make good progress towards a potentially game-changing deal within the blockchain space” and would update the market when it could. The company’s maiden results for the half year to the end of December showed it lost £7,501 in the half-year to the end of December, but had cash assets of £1.45m and no debt. The shares are now trading at close to 5p — below where they were before the name change.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hannah Murphy","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-08-17","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/49d17cfc-924e-355e-909c-e188383ae8e6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcct-images.ft.com%2Fproduction%2F7f48da63-226f-4ec9-8a5b-0bb5b544e8f3_FINAL.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"One for the ladies...","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"We would not encourage our readers to trap themselves on a boat containing hundreds of crypto bros and fugitive-turned- bitcoin-maniac John McAfee. But if you do fancy a “blockchain cruise” around the Med in September, tickets for ladies are surprisingly cheap. They are less than a quarter of the price of the next-cheapest tickets, in fact: That is a curious price differential! We wonder what it means. After clicking on “details”, we found the following listing: This raises more questions than it answers. Why is it that only two of the four lucky “18+ only” ladies will get passes to the conference? The conference is the whole point of the cruise, right? Also, why would a four-woman suite have only two “twin beds”? (We were initially told this meant two single beds, then two doubles.) Why don\u0027t the other room listings mention age requirements? Could it be that we are missing some glaringly obvious subtext here? We called up an external spokeswoman for Coinsbank, the Russian company hosting the cruise, who said of the price gap: But if only half of the women in the room get conference passes, how would that fix the gender gap? When asked, the spokeswoman said the organisers had made an error in the translation and that they would be changing it on the site. Now we have an entirely new set of questions. Who did they hire to translate? And more importantly, is that translator OK? Did they suffer a bout of numeric amnesia immediately after translating the phrase “four women” into accurate English? Since we spoke with the Coinsbank rep, the room\u0027s listing has been changed to list four beds, and does not mention conference passes at all. The mysteries of the blockchain continue to multiply.

Shapps, a former chair of the Conservative party until his resignation amid a 2015 bullying scandal, had been due to receive cryptocurrency tokens expected to be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds for his role advising the blockchain startup OpenBrix, ahead of a sale of tokens to the public, in what is known as an initial coin offering (ICO). In the register of members\u0027 financial interests, the MP had listed this role as \"unpaid\". Approached on Tuesday for comment about the lucrative advisory position and the accuracy of this disclosure, Shapps told FT Alphaville he was resigning from OpenBrix. The MP also said he had stood down from his co-chairmanship of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Blockchain, which he had set up last year with another Tory MP. He said, \"I don\u0027t want to overstretch myself\". The dual resignations shine a spotlight both on the flimsy nature of rules that govern the intersection between business and politics in UK parliament, and also the role of APPGs in fostering little-noticed links between companies and legislators. Informal cross-party groups that have no official status within parliament, APPGs can appear in effect to function as lobby groups funded by companies with an interest in favourable policy outcomes. A co-mingling of business and politics took place at the first \"extraordinary meeting\" of the Blockchain APPG, a group which has the stated aim of \"ensuring industry and society benefit from the full potential of blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies\". It brought together two of the four founders of OpenBrix, one of whom, Adi Ben-Ari, is a permanent \"expert advisor\" to the cross-parliamentary group. They developed a plan for a \"decentralised property portal\" run on a blockchain that they hoped could challenge the duopoly of Zoopla and Rightmove for residential listings. Embracing the new -- and so far largely unregulated -- world of initial coin offerings, the team hopes to have raised $25m by the time the ICO closes in December. The marketing for the ICO includes paying \"Bounty Hunters\" to promote it on social media, and includes a invtation to top investors to a \"parliamentary strategy dinner\", which until Tuesday morning featured as the \"pinned Tweet\" at the top of the Twitter page: Shapps, who has previously attracted controversy for his involvement in get-rich-quick schemes, was roped in to sit on the advisory board as chair of governance, according to the company\u0027s founder. It appeared to be a role which fit with his enthusiasm for the tech, shown for instance by his telling a conference in June he had been mining Ethereum in his garage during a speech entitled \"Building a Blockchain Britain\". Indeed, after we wrote about another MP\u0027s misguided enthusiasm for blockchain, he invited us to Portcullis house, telling us at a July 10 meeting that he was compelled to start the APPG after discovering just five references had ever been made in parliament to blockchain. He appeared excited about the APPG\u0027s two-year programme, which had only kicked off in January. Board meetings at the family restaurant OpenBrix founder and CEO Shahad Choudhury -- a full-time civil servant working for UK Export Finance and a key speaker at the first APPG meeting -- told FTAV over the phone that he didn\u0027t understand why Shapps had felt he had to resign. Choudhury said the MP\u0027s contract hadn\u0027t required any further time commitment until after the ICO closes in December. After that, Shapps would be given his tokens and any further work would be paid. Our conversation with Choudhury on Tuesday came a couple of hours after we had spoken to Shapps. He appeared to suggest our questioning provoked the MP\u0027s departure: Over a long lunch on Friday of paneer curry and vegetable thali at his family\u0027s Bengali restaurant in Shoreditch, Choudhury and Phil Millo, one of four co-founders and a key financial backer, had filled us in on the details of the arrangement with Shapps. Choudhury told us that Shapps had signed a consultancy contract for which he had already fulfilled his obligations: writing an article in which Shapps expounded on the potential of the blockchain for the property market, and attending an OpenBrix event. Choudhury and Millo also explained that the pool of tokens assigned to the advisory board Shapps sat on would be \"roughly comparable\" to that allocated to the co-founders: 8 million BRIX tokens. With each BRIX token worth 0.001 ether, or around 46 US cents at current rates, that\u0027s a pool of roughly $3.7m, or £2.8m. The five advisers would not all be given exactly the same amount, we were told. Indeed chief commercial adviser Tom Fox, based in the US, had agreed to sit on the advisory board unpaid. Shapps and chief innovation officer Tracy Follows, however, would be paid the same amount, Choudhury said. We weren\u0027t told how much that would be but the roughly £2.8m would at that point have been shared among four advisers. Here is what a webpage on the site looked like up until about 8pm on Tuesday: Following up by phone on Monday night, Choudhury then told us there was a plan to reduce the total amount of tokens issued, meaning the co-founders and advisers would all get less. Again, he did not specify Shapps\u0027 remuneration, but there was a proposed pool of 8.2m BRIX tokens for 17 advisers and team members. Advisers, he said, would all get more than the mean. So under the new proposal, which Shapps hadn\u0027t yet agreed to but which would pay him less than before, he could expect, at the very least, 482,353 BRIX tokens -- about £170,000 worth. Sudden change of heart The next time we spoke to Shapps was Tuesday morning. He told us: Birgitte Andersen, CEO of the Big Innovation Centre, which provides the \"secretariat\" for the blockchain APPG, declined to say when she had been made aware of Shapps\u0027s resignation. When we had spoken to her on Monday morning, however, she had given no indication he might be about to quit. It\u0027s unclear what Shapps meant by \"coming to the end of [his] advisory period\" at OpenBrix, given he had fulfilled his side of a contract that the founder had told us now made him entitled \"by law\" to payment. We asked why he was standing down when he was in line to receive hundreds of thousands of tokens. He answered: The position was registered on July 2, and Shapps went to the OpenBrix event he was contracted to attend on July 19th, 12 days before his resignation. When we met Shapps three weeks before the resignation, he didn\u0027t mention OpenBrix, though he did tell us he held some cryptocurrency. But he also showed no signs then that he was intending to step down from the APPG. In fact, he seemed to suggest the work was only just starting. He said: We asked Shapps why he had listed the position at OpenBrix as an \"unpaid\" role, and he said that\u0027s what he had been advised to do \"to the letter\" by the MPs\u0027 registrar. The prospective financial gain would only be registrable if and when realised. The biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular Shapps wanted to paint himself as the person who had brought blockchain to the attention of parliament when we met him three weeks ago, telling us: FTAV’s own search of Hansard found 15 references to the word \"blockchain\" before August 1st 2017 (and 11 references to \"distributed ledger technology\"). In none of these instances did it seem the term had been used out of context, nor used in the context of terrorism financing. Shapps had repeated this tale at the OpenBrix event on July 19, according to attendees. The MP said on Tuesday: Another claim by Shapps was that \"literally 300 people\" had shown up to some of the APPG\u0027s evidence sessions. On another occasion he said \"every time we do an evidence session, literally hundreds and hundreds of people turn up\". Andersen, however, told us that the biggest room any of the sessions had been held in was a room that seats up to 120 people. Another was held in a room whose capacity is 70. This isn\u0027t the first time Shapps has appeared to have a dubious relationship with actuality. It emerged in 2015 that he had continued working for a marketing business for at least a year after becoming an MP in 2005 under the name \"Michael Green\", after he had denied having a second job on several occasions. Unlike what readers of his Stinking Rich 3 were told they could expect back in 2006, however, it looks like Shapps will no longer be making a ton of cash by Christmas.

A fire sweeps through the home of an art collector, reducing their treasured hoard to ashes. But they find that not only have the much-loved artworks gone up in flames, so have their documents of ownership, tucked away in a drawer in the same home. Proving the collector’s ownership rights now becomes considerably harder. But what if the history and proof of their purchases, the provenance of works in their collection and all related legal and insurance documents were held on a permanent, trusted database to which the collector and trusted advisers could gain access via a secure key? “If you have all the certificates and no questions about provenance and authenticity, then it’s easy for us to settle the claim,” says Gleises. This is one example of the potential benefits of the distributed ledger technology — otherwise known as blockchain — currently animating a wave of entrepreneurship in finance, healthcare, manufacturing and the art world. Used since 2009 to underpin the cryptocurrency bitcoin, blockchain allows a transaction to be permanently recorded on a database shared between computers, without relying on a third party to authenticate or process it. Immutability and security are written in to blockchain; when no single authority is in charge of the ledger, no one may remove entries or fiddle with them. It could bring efficiency and transparency to the buying and selling of art, currently a fragmented and opaque marketplace. But it also poses some searching questions about the future of the dealers and auction houses accustomed to carving off a profit: the market’s traditional middlemen. Christie’s, the venerable 252-year-old auction house, is one of the last institutions one might expect to embrace the potential of this disruptive technology. But last week it brought together technologists, art experts, entrepreneurs, financiers and lawyers at its London showrooms to discuss how blockchain could redefine processes and relationships in the art market. Anne Bracegirdle, a specialist in Christie’s photographs department, said blockchain had a “potentially revolutionary impact on our business” in its ability to host all data about an object or artwork, from catalogue details, sale prices and provenance, linked to invoices and certificates of authenticity. In her view, it reduces the room for human error, boosts trust and therefore could tip hesitant buyers and sellers over the line. “Property titles and full provenance are often missing, and that information can make or break a sale.” Digital artists are particularly captivated by the possibilities of blockchain. The market for art created to exist on a screen has suffered from the ease with which it can be replicated. But blockchain allows artists to create digital editions of their work — just as photographers create a limited number of prints — and ensure that ownership can be tracked and verified. Smart contracts — an innovation of the Ethereum blockchain on which nearly all art-related blockchain activity is taking place — also allow them to make more money out of their work, even perhaps selling portions of their work on blockchain, bringing fractional ownership to the art market. Digital art, however, is where incumbent companies appear especially vulnerable, since the role of the dealer or auction house in authenticating art, judging value based on previous prices, researching provenance and bringing together buyers and sellers could become redundant when all that information is held on a blockchain. John Zettler, president of Rare Art Labs, a digital gallery for artists, says: “A simple coding script could ask where this artist has already sold and where this particular piece has sold in the past. There would be no concern about the authenticity of the piece — and no real need for a physical location where buyers and sellers gather.” One of the pioneers of blockchain-based digital art is Matt Hall, co-creator of “cryptopunks”, a series of 10,000 unique digital artworks in the shape of pixelated heads that he and his business partner released on Ethereum last year. They no longer control the art; it has taken on a life of its own, with rare cryptopunks changing hands for the equivalent of thousands of dollars. There would be no concern about authenticity; no need for a physical location for buyers and sellers to meet While he sees the experiment as an unexpected success, Hall says it raises “tricky questions” about people’s willingness to buy art that only exists online. Debate also rages about the technical question of where the digital art should reside. Since keeping work on the blockchain itself is expensive, it is typically used to host a proof of ownership and a link to the work itself on a separate third-party site. Purists say that offends the principle of independence that is the point of the technology; it also leaves owners vulnerable to the possibility the third-party company could go out of business, putting their art out of reach or even destroying it. Few deny that dealing with blockchain is currently tedious: users have to go through the process of acquiring a “digital wallet” and negotiate a barrage of technical jargon. For art entrepreneurs wishing to launch services on Ethereum, the price of engaging with the network to set up or make changes to data — known as the “gas price” — is also painfully volatile. “There are so many rough edges. You can’t plan for success by buying a bigger server. You don’t control the servers and you can’t call the helpdesk,” Hall says. Podcast Others worry that data held on blockchain will fall foul of the European general data protection regulation (GDPR) that came into force in May and has required monumentally complex and expensive preparations on the part of big corporations. Richard Entrup, Christie’s global chief information officer, says doubts over blockchain’s compliance with GDPR were an “aha moment” for him. “It immediately takes it off the table for a number of applications,” he says. Christie’s is nonetheless exploring the technology’s potential, with hints of an as-yet-undisclosed blockchain initiative coming soon. For some, the lack of a central authority overseeing the Ethereum blockchain is both its central appeal and its Achilles heel, since it leaves unanswered questions about what happens in the event of disputes. This is particularly acute where the blockchain is linked to artworks in the physical world. When that fire rips through the luxury apartment, who is in charge of telling the blockchain that the items in question are gone? “If a trusted party is required to do that, then how decentralised is the system really, and how different is it from doing it the old-fashioned way?” asks Hall. The need for expertise in navigating these dangerous shoals means, for the time being at least, that dealers and auction houses are likely to have a role to play. Gleises also believes they have other reasons to keep a tight grip on the market. “There are plenty of intermediaries who don’t have any interest in change. It’s a very small market, and very profitable for some. Who is going to be willing to let go of some of the margin for the market to grow?” Follow @FTLifeArts on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

Quartz drew a nice Venn diagram of the overlap between the two groups in an article back in May: But while six months ago it was all “RIP fiat” and “we don\u0027t need government”, it appears that some in the crypto community are changing their tune. (We\u0027re not sure if this has anything to do with the more-than-halving of the estimated value of the crypto market since the start of the year.) On Friday, Andreesen Horowitz-backed crypto giant Coinbase said in a public filing that it had set up a Political Action Committee, or a PAC, to spend on upcoming elections. (PACs are organisations in the US that collect donations of at least $1,000 specifically to influence the outcome of elections or to campaign for other initiatives or legislation.) That came in the same week that the New York Post reported that the Winkelevoss twins donated $100,000 to the re-election campaign of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo -- less than a month before the twins\u0027 Gemini crypto exchange was given approval to operate in the state. Once the approval had been secured, the Winklevii chucked in another $30,000 for good measure, according to the Post. It\u0027s not yet clear exactly who the lucky recipient(s) of Coinbase\u0027s PAC funds will be, and the company wasn\u0027t immediately available for comment on that. It\u0027s likely that this is largely an effort to show its investors that it\u0027s working on getting greater (Wall) Street cred. (Getting “whitelisted” by Facebook probably helps, too.) But it\u0027s clear that Coinbase, Gemini, and others in cryptoland have become very keen to get a stamp of approval from government. Tim Swanson, founder of tech consultancy Post Oak Labs, told us: But while the heavyweights court the powers that be directly, the humbler crypto bros are begging to be accepted by the SEC by writing in to try to get the latest bitcoin ETF approved. (The SEC has already rejected about ten.) The SEC published some of the letters on its site and they make for a great -- if often perplexing -- read. We didn\u0027t have to go far to find some absolute, utter gems. (If there was ever any doubt that “crypto bros” is an apposite term, take a quick glance at the names of the letter-submitters.) Take this one, to which we have added emphasis but not sic notations for space and readability purposes: Vive la (government-backed) révolution! And if you thought that was deep, it got way more existential in some of the other comment letters: The winning comment letter is probably from the guy who managed to get this published on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States of America (emphasis ours, again): Related links: Crypto\u0027s most devout believers are suffering a crisis of faith - FT Alphaville Winklevoss twins donate $130k to Cuomo after getting state approval - New York Post Frenzy to get bitcoin ETF listed is clogging up the SEC\u0027s email - Bloomberg","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jemima Kelly","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-07-24","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/60ca61b7-3528-3323-b8d5-db07e6ecf9d6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcct-images.ft.com%2Fproduction%2Fb0f133e8-cd0f-4374-969a-8f967a1865a5_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Fujitsu\u0027s new blockchain offering: really cheap or really expensive?","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Fujitsu, the Tokyo-based IT conglomerate, has been long blockchain for some time. As early as 2015, the company was trialling the technology for cross-border settlements; in 2016 it said it had developed tools for securely sharing documents via the power of the distributed ledger; and in 2017, it built ConnectionChain, a blockchain system for connecting... blockchains. Fujitsu has also filed almost 50 patents related to the technology in the hope that some day, these copyrighted blockchain-based inventions will generate cash. But much like most of the blockchain space outside of the magical world of ICOs, Fujitsu\u0027s long blockchain position is unlikely to have yielded any real returns so far. So now, Fujitsu is taking on a bolder approach to making some money out of the nebulous technology. For as little as 9,900 euros, the company is promising to develop a “blockchain proof of business” for any customers in Europe, Middle East, India and Africa, within just one working week! From the press release last Tuesday: Don\u0027t know about you guys but they had us at “extremely rapid blockchain productization”. Fujitsu says customers\u0027 business plans will be put through a five-day-long assessment, during which the client and company\u0027s “global blockchain experts” work together on creating “new business ideas based on blockchain or other Distributed Ledger Technologies”. This “proof of business” approach, it says, will help firms avoid projects that are unlikely to provide any value, by testing them on the Hyperledger Fabric -- a “blockchain framework” that Fujitsu is a paid-up member of -- before committing to any kind of larger-scale trial: The PoB would presumably slot into to the usual blockchain development flow-chart somewhere around about the “blockchain ideation” mark (as illustrated below -- screengrab from LeewayHertz). But the idea that in five days, the application being tested would “create enough value so that people are willing to use it, demonstrate enough future potential to retain the loyalty of early adopters, and provide a feedback loop to guide future development”, seems like a rather tall order. How would they know which business models would fulfil these criteria, given that no such models yet exist in any meaningful way? The promise that any given company can be told whether their blockchain-flavoured business plans are viable by a team of “global experts” for little more than $10,000 sounds like, well, a steal, doesn\u0027t it?! But a steal for whom? We weren\u0027t sure, so we called up Tim Swanson, who now runs his own fintech advisory firm, Post Oak Labs, and who was previously head of market research at R3 -- a company that leads a blockchain consortium and whose Corda platform is a rival to Hyperledger -- to see what he made of it. He told us: That\u0027s kind of what we thought -- there are whole industries out there offering blockchain consultancy, advisory, training and other services, and none of them offer anything as fast or cheap as this. So what\u0027s this all about? So according to Swanson, this is about bringing customers in who buy into Fujitsu\u0027s blockchain expertise and therefore will buy more of its related services. It\u0027s also, from the buyer\u0027s point of view, an opportunity to show would-be investors that their product is the real thing, by getting the Fujitsu stamp of approval. The company is thus able to monetise its blockchain work without a single distributed transaction taking place in the real world. Fujitsu aren\u0027t the only ones offering people the chance to get blockchain-certified for tidy sums of cash. Last week we wrote about a £1,800 six-week cryptocurrency investment course at the London School of Economics, and there are comparable courses on offer at Oxford and MIT, to name but a couple. Swanson, again: We think businesses considering another step in the blockchain flow-chart could save themselves a lot of time, and money, by using a simpler one, like this one, from “ Nancy Nakamoto”: People ask me, “When should I use Blockchain”\u003e@davidgerard @ofnumbers @izakaminska @jemimajoanna @Tr0llyTr0llFace @Nouriel @el33th4xor @angela_walch @prestonjbyrne pic.twitter.com/TfzEUZUbna Fujitsu weren\u0027t immediately available for comment.

The prolific, prolix former McKinsey consultant has been saying the same thing, at high pace and volume, since his career took off in the 1980s, when he and Robert Waterman wrote In Search of Excellence. In this book, he complains that in 3,000-odd presentations over four decades he has been shouting: “‘People first!’ at the top of my lungs again and again and then again”. Undaunted, in this book — a sequel to that first bestseller, according to Peters — he remakes and reapplies principles of business excellence to the technology challenges of today. This is a shouty book. Chapters are divided into short sections, with bold capitalised subtitles and sub-subtitles, acronyms, breakout sections, and lots of exhortations: ‘RE-RE-RE-RE-TOOL OR PERISH”, “SOCIAL BUSINESS: WHO? EVERYONE! NO HALFWAY!”, and so on. The Excellence Dividend is tiring and at times virtually unreadable, despite Peters’ own prescription for chief executives to “READ! READ!! READ!!! READ!!!!” Buried beneath the hyperbole, though, are some well-polished nuggets and anecdotes about how to build and maintain a culture of excellence. The economist and tech advocate takes the reader through the evolution of Google from the beginning, and why its system of aggregating huge amounts of data to create adverts will inevitably break down. “Google is not just a company,” writes Gilder, “it is a system of the world and it is cracking under the weight of this ideology.” Gilder states that his book makes the opposing case to the “hyperventilating haruspices” Yuval Harari, historian and author of Homo Sapiens, Google’s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Tesla founder Elon Musk. They, he says, see a world-changing AI juggernaut. But it is “an industrial regime at the end of its rope”. Gilder likens the current situation — the dominance of Google, Apple and Facebook — to a time when humans thought the world was flat. Our system is 2D, and we will evolve into a 3D one, as it is unlikely that major issues — such as cyber security and privacy, for example — can be solved within the computer systems and networks we use today. The author believes that the likes of blockchain and bitcoins will fundamentally change the system because their very nature will lead to more widely distributed computer power and commerce. Former Financial Times Mumbai correspondent Crabtree uses a vivid comparison with America’s late 19th-century Gilded Age to drive his account of 21st-century India, with a teeming, colourful cast of the super-rich, the ultra-poor, the politically ambitious and the irredeemably corrupt. The multistorey Mumbai residence of tycoon Mukesh Ambani and his family looms over the story as it does over the city’s slums, a symbol of extravagance and disparity, as well as a sort of promise of the potential of India if it could overcome its flaws. Crabtree makes clear just how intertwined the business and political fates of the country are, but while his tale of self-dealing, crony capitalism and corruption is shocking, he also claims it is optimistic. “In a country changing this quickly, it is always possible to imagine reinvention,” he writes, assuming India makes the right trade-offs between growth and graft. After all, America’s Gilded Age — with all its flaws — ultimately gave way to what became known as the Progressive Era. Read the FT’s in-depth review by Meghnad Desai If you think the 200-year history of an American bank sounds dry, think again. Borrowed Time is a highly entertaining and informative run through a long list of the crises faced by Citibank, formerly the City Bank of New York, the instances when it came close to collapse — and rescued by US government (and taxpayer) intervention. We may remember 2008, when then Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson “declared that Citi must not be allowed to fail because, in his view, ‘If Citi isn’t systematic, I don’t know what is’.” Freeman, a Wall Street Journal writer, and McKinley, a banking and finance expert, visiting scholar at George Washington University and research fellow at a rightwing think-tank, come at this story with an agenda (nothing much that the government does seems to be any good). But it does not detract from the thrust of some of the rollicking tales of hubris, over-reach and outright catastrophe within these pages. The earliest chapters in particular are excellent — and informative about the extraordinary growth and bust in the US economy in the 19th century, and the extent to which it relied on cotton, an “economy . . . built on America’s original sin, the monstrous institution of slavery”. The author, a professional strategic facilitator who is trained in conflict resolution, shares ideas from 15 years’ experience of designing and advising on meetings and events. Based on her interviews with more than 100 people from all walks of life, Parker offers tips on how to make gatherings more meaningful and successful. From deciding who to invite, what to focus on and how to open and close an event, she brings her advice to life with stories and anecdotes. For example, the purpose of an off-site company meeting may not be to get out of the office, but to build and practise a culture of candour, or to revisit and reconsider a team’s mission. Parker believes that crafting a purpose or focusing on the desired outcome will determine all the practical steps. The author warns that gatherings without purpose are best postponed until the organiser has come up with one.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-07-19","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f2cacb86-85a3-11e8-96dd-fa565ec55929","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F4d1e8a84-864c-11e8-9199-c2a4754b5a0e?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Hong Kong launches blockchain-based trade finance","INTRO":"Monetary Authority works with Ping An to cut paperwork and reduce fraud","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Hong Kong’s de facto central bank will go live next month with a blockchain-backed trade finance platform set to link up with 21 banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered. The launch of the system, designed by China’s Ping An Group, will be one of the first and largest examples of a government-led project aimed at upgrading the $9tn global trade finance industry. Blockchain is expected to slash the time and paperwork needed to push through routine trade finance and supply-chain finance transactions by making it easier to verify each step of the complicated process and confirm the credentials of the parties involved. A number of bank-led trade finance platforms that use blockchain are already under development. In May HSBC announced it had executed the world’s first commercially viable trade finance transaction using blockchain. Deutsche Bank and Rabobank have joined forces to launch a similar businesses. Among government-backed trade finance platforms, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s project will be one of the earliest to go live. “Instead of individual banks trying to do this you have the regulator trying to bring the banks together,” said Jessica Tan, Ping An’s deputy chief executive. The platform will be owned by the banks that have partnered with the Hong Kong regulator. The final number of financial institutions has not been confirmed but 21 banks are expected to join. OneConnect, Ping An Group’s financial technology company, designed the Hong Kong trade finance platform using technologies it has already deployed in China. One key feature, according to Ms Tan, is that it would allow small companies greater access to trade and supply-chain finance. Recommended Small companies around the world are regularly denied access to banking services due to the increasing costs of due diligence required to sign up new clients. OneConnect’s technologies are able to extract a wide range of company data, at a low cost, to evaluate potential customers. This will allow the trade finance platform to take on more small businesses. Blockchain is the decentralised ledger technology underlying cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Instead of using a central clearing process, blockchain employs thousands of individual computing nodes to verify transactions, making it nearly unhackable. The technology is expected to shake up trade finance by slashing the amount of documentation and manpower needed to process transactions. It will also reduce the amount of time needed for some transactions from a fortnight down to just one day. Fraud will also be easier to detect on the new trade finance platform. Companies often request more financing from banks than needed to fund the trade. Once trades are logged in the blockchain, all parties will be able to view the level of financing requested and reduce the ability to acquire excess funds. Until this year, OneConnect’s business has been focused on China. However in early 2018 it opened an office in Singapore and now employs more than 100 people outside China. The Hong Kong trade finance platform is one of its biggest ventures outside mainland China.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Don Weinland","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-07-15","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/56b1abd6-4c0f-3d07-815c-3c5cde6963d6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcct-images.ft.com%2Fproduction%2F68817836-80f9-498d-a62e-14e936ce08ac_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The London School of Cryptonomics","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The London School of Economics is a venerated institution that has educated some 34 heads of state and 18 Nobel laureates, with a star-studded alumni directory that includes John F. Kennedy, Bertrand Russell, and Friedrich von Hayek. Now, LSE appears to be lending its considerable prestige to the world of crypto trading, with a new online course entitled “Cryptocurrency Investment and Disruption”: The blurb for the course reads a bit like it was written in late-2017/early-2018, when crypto-euphoria had well and truly set in and everyone was quitting their jobs for the love of the digital token (emphases ours): Highly disruptive trend!!! Correct. Especially for the job-quitters. And regulatory bodies are certainly taking note. The following factoid is to be found innocently decorating the prospectus: Below is what exponential growth has looked like since the start of the year. (Screenshot via coinmarketcap.com.) No mention, anywhere, of the fact that $700 billion figure is now more like $270 billion. Prospective students are given some juicy promises on what they can expect to get from the course, such as: Several questions arise from that buzzword-ridden phrase alone. How does one gain a taxonomy? For that matter, what on earth is a unique cryptocurrency taxonomy? How about a disruption case? And how would one go about applying an understanding of cryptocurrencies to other such phenomena in the future? We\u0027re not too sure we\u0027d be any the wiser after completing the course. And it feels like quite some promise in a world where fundamentals are basically non-existent. Then there\u0027s this one: Which feels like a pretty bullish statement on the potency of the blockchain. Shouldn\u0027t LSE be discussing whether it will radically reshape the business world, and not promising to make students understand how it will do so, given how many major question marks remain over the technology? This isn\u0027t some token-touting ICO, after all; this is a world-class academic institution. Which brings us to: No prior qualifications required. For just £1,800, anyone who completes the six-week online course gets to put the London School of Economics on their CV -- seems like a pretty decent investment even if you choose not to throw away invest any of your money into crypto on completion. It all felt a bit PR-y and lacking the kind of critical approach we would expect from a serious university like LSE, so we called up Dr Carsten Sørensen, the course convenor and a reader in digital innovation in the university\u0027s management department. When we questioned him about some of the promises and statements in the prospectus, he said: Maybe it just seems odd to think about marketing in the context of an academic course, but we kind of expect them to at least be aiming to convey a truthful message about what students are signing up for, especially at the London School of Economics. (Dr Sørensen was not wrong about the marketing. Just a few hours after downloading the prospectus, which required supplying a phone number and email address, we got a call from GetSmarter, the online learning company that LSE -- along with Harvard and other top universities -- partners with, wanting extra info from us and asking if we had any further questions. These guys are on it. Needless to say they hadn\u0027t realised we were journalists.) But Dr Sørensen explained that, despite the exuberance of the prospectus, the course does actually take a critical approach to both crypto and distributed ledger technology, and that it points students towards pessimistic pieces on cryptocurrency and blockchain such as this brilliant one by anti-futurist Kai Stinchcombe, as well as positive ones. Dr Sørensen told us: He also put in touch with Saul Estrin, founding head of the department of management, who we asked to discuss LSE\u0027s decision to run an online course in crypto investing. The professor said, via email, that he thought we had the wrong end of the stick: OK, but if you don\u0027t want the course to sound like it\u0027s aimed at crypto traders and is more about understanding the technology, putting “Cryptocurrency Investment” at the start of its title is probably not a great idea. Here\u0027s another excerpt from the website page where the course is listed (emphasis ours): (“Theoretical thought leadership”. “Evaluate the analytics of an ICO”. Double-shudder.) But come on guys, learning “the practical skills to interact with cryptocurrency exchanges” sounds very much like teaching students how to invest. And at another point in the prospectus, LSE promises to teach students “the key theoretical and practical knowledge to become an active participant and investor in cryptocurrency markets”. Even if this is just marketing material, is it right to simultaneously say you\u0027re not going to teach students how to invest in crypto, while making one of the key aims of the course learning how to invest in it in all the available information? If you\u0027re really not going to teach students how to invest in crypto, aren\u0027t you mis-selling the course? We\u0027re sure LSE isn\u0027t the only university that does this kind of marketing to attract students. But it just all feels a bit off. Might be worth remembering that the next time you see the London School of Economics at the top of someone\u0027s LinkedIn profile or CV, you might just be looking at a certified crypto bro.

They are being tagged and castrated and branded with irons, as is normal, a couple of months after birth. But what is new is that their IDs are now logged on a blockchain: part of a push by America’s least populated and most minerals-dependent state to position itself at the front of the “crypto” revolution. According to ranch owner, Ogden Driskill, blockchain technology can help to capture and preserve value along every step of the supply chain. He says that if he can prove to the ultimate buyer that these are open-range cattle, reared on sunshine and grass in cowboy country — rather than a cramped pen — he can get a premium of up to $700 per head, or almost 30 per cent. “We always had a superior product but it would always get blended in, like if you sold Volkswagens with Cadillacs and Mercedes,” says the beef rancher, 59, who was elected as a Republican member of the Wyoming Senate seven years ago. “This gives us a chance for our quality to stand on its own.” Other US states have big ideas for blockchain, the digital ledger technology that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and which has been tipped to transform sectors such as shipping, logistics and finance. But only Wyoming has passed legislation to create a framework for blockchain and crypto businesses, giving it a head-start on would-be rivals such as Arizona, Michigan or North Dakota. About 200 new companies have sprung up in Wyoming over the past few months, according to state records, with names like Bison Crypto Power and Something Something Blockchain. Matt Mead, the state’s Republican governor, says technology could become a vital “fourth leg” of Wyoming’s economy, behind energy, tourism and agriculture, helping to revive one of the handful of US states that still has not regained its pre-financial crisis level of output. Others dream of creating some kind of hipster enclave within the deep-red state, just like Austin has lured Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, among others, to the middle of Texas. But there is some nervousness about the headlong plunge into crypto. Marian Orr, the mayor of the state capital Cheyenne, says she worries about an invasion of bitcoin miners, sucking the electricity grid dry of cheap power and then heading off without paying their bills. Others fret about rampant fraud in the market for the sale of so-called utility tokens, which act like prepaid software licences, allowing the owner to use some kind of a blockchain-embedded product or service in the state. HB0070 Recognises tokens issued in initial coin offerings as distinct from money and securities SF0111 Frees cryptocurrencies from taxation HB0019 Exempts all cryptocurrencies from state laws on money transmission HB0101 Allows the recording and storage on a blockchain of corporate records, filings and votes “It can be hard to tell the ‘black hats’ from the ‘white hats,’” says Sarah Reese, manager of economic and community initiatives in Laramie, a university town 50 minutes west of Cheyenne, alluding to the old western films where the bad guys dress in black. “We don’t want to sell our communities down the river. The problem is, there are all kinds of shades of grey.” Unlike a lump of coal or a barrel of oil, a blockchain can be hard to visualise. It is in essence an online database: a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are secured by cryptography and validated by several different computers in constant communication with each other. The key point, say enthusiasts, is to enable the transparent sharing of data, in order to process transactions among multiple parties that may not know or trust one another. Hence the appeal in financial services, where dozens of big banks are looking into applications in areas such as internal payments, trade finance or the syndication of loans. Or in retail, where Walmart — in collaboration with IBM — has roped in Dole, Unilever and Nestlé to try to improve the traceability of basic foods such as bananas, chicken and chocolate. What blockchain offers is certainty of identification, says Rob Jennings, the fast-talking chief executive of BeefChain, the start-up that was tagging cows at Mr Driskill’s 10,000-acre ranch. A former radio host and events promoter, hiring the likes of Jay-Z and Kid Rock for political conventions, he is a founding member of the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, a group of lawyers, accountants and former Wall Street types, many of them — like Mr Jennings — born or raised in the state. At the moment, he says, tracking a cow from pasture to plate tends to be a paper-intensive business, full of opportunities for error as herds are traded back and forth to munch down crops or to fatten up in feedlots. Somewhere along the way, the value gets lost. “You’ve heard of craft beer,” Mr Jennings says. “This is craft beef.” Tyler Lindholm, a 35-year-old rancher who has served in the state’s House of Representatives for the past three years, helped craft a package of bills passed in March. One recognises tokens issued in initial coin offerings as distinct from money and securities, while another frees cryptocurrencies from taxation. Cryptocurrencies are now also exempt from state laws on money transmission and corporate records, filings and votes are allowed to be recorded and stored on a blockchain. Mr Lindholm, a Republican with a strong libertarian streak, says he wants to use bills like this as a way to get revenge on Delaware. Wyoming invented the Limited Liability Company structure in 1977, but Delaware industrialised it in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming the destination of choice for company owners wanting to maximise business profits while shielding personal assets from creditors. Company registration fees alone are expected to net the east coast state close to $1bn this year, or about one quarter of its budget. Wyoming should appeal to any cryptocurrency start-up, says Peter Hatzipetros, a New York-based lawyer, because of its cheap rents and cheap power. It is also one of a handful of states with zero individual income tax and one of two (along with South Dakota) without any taxes on corporate profits or revenues. Tax is not the big clincher, Mr Hatzipetros says: if people really wanted to avoid it they would go to Puerto Rico, where there is no federal income tax either. But in terms of laying the crypto groundwork Wyoming is “well ahead of the game”, he says, drawing parallels to Nevada in gaming and Colorado in legalised cannabis. “We’re hungry, we’re on the hunt,” says Mr Lindholm. “If you look at the landscape of crypto and blockchain, these folks are just really trying to find a place they can conduct their business in a legal manner.” Wyoming has tried to diversify its economy before. In the 1960s it was Mr Mead’s grandfather, Governor Clifford Hansen, who considered moves into the production of cement, beer and Barbie dolls before deciding to build a lot of highways and reservoirs. Today, though, the state remains more dependent on mining and drilling than any other in the US. Wyoming is the nation’s top producer of coal and uranium, number six in natural gas and number eight in oil. Roughly half of the state’s $2.5bn in annual revenue, excluding investment income, comes from taxes on natural resources. So when commodities get hit, so does Wyoming. Labour department statistics show that no other state suffered as much, in terms of declines in payrolls, after the recession that began in December 2007. Today the state’s total labour force of just over 290,000 — down about 6 per cent since 2012 — seems especially feeble alongside Colorado to the south, up 11 per cent over the same period to 3.1m, or even Montana to the north, up 4 per cent to 525,000. Too many graduates leave and never come back, scattering to the coasts or to big cities nearby like Denver in Colorado or Boise in Idaho, says Fred Schmechel, assistant director at Wyoming university. “We want a Wyoming solution to the Wyoming problem,” he says. “So far it’s all spitballing; nothing has stuck.” Kip DeCastro, a graduate from the central Wyoming town of Casper now working with BeefChain, says it can be tempting for young people to look for jobs in energy, where high school leavers can start on $80,000 a year. He did it himself as an undergraduate, earning $24 an hour on fibreglass crews, hauling pipes from one site to another or, if he was lucky, welding steel at a gas plant. “I don’t see crypto as the thing we should tie ourselves to completely, but I see it as a good jumping-off point,” Mr DeCastro says. “The [energy] booms are great but the busts [are] really terrible.” It is still early days for Wyoming and crypto. Cheyenne Leads, a local development agency, is offering cheap land, fee waivers and all the connections would-be applicants can handle. But despite the flurry of company registrations no one appears to have moved in to prime office space like the Grier Building in downtown Cheyenne, a former cattle-baron hang-out just over the road from the Historic Plains Hotel. And some fear the big legislative effort will not result in much of a boost to output. Erik Voorhees, a Colorado native now running ShapeShift, a digital asset exchange based in Switzerland, says crypto businesses may struggle to find enough good people in Wyoming — population 579,315 according to a US Census Bureau estimate, about the same as the city of Albuquerque — despite “the best legislation any state has passed, ever”. But many argue that the state has nothing to lose. Even if sceptics do not think that tomorrow’s financial system will be built on blockchains and digital assets, they say it makes sense to move in that direction. Passing bills costs almost nothing, says Ms Orr, Cheyenne’s mayor, and there is no great investment required in infrastructure or buildings or people. “You’ve got minimal downside and huge potential upside — the kind of bet I like to take all day long,” says Apneet Jolly, co-founder of Crypto Lotus, a San Francisco-based hedge fund. He says he is thinking about opening up a security consulting business on the side, and basing it in Wyoming. Also considering a permanent shift is Tony Rose, a west coast entrepreneur who is now chief technology officer at BeefChain. He says he is tired of seeing crypto businesses spring up in friendly jurisdictions such as Malta or Singapore or Estonia. On that hot day in May at the Campstool Ranch he wrestled dozens of calves himself, wearing leather boots he had specially bought for the occasion. One day he might swap his baseball cap for a Stetson. For now though, he says, “I’m just a tech guy from Silicon Valley, learning how to be a cowboy.” Albert Forkner wants to believe in crypto. As banking commissioner for the state of Wyoming, he can see the appeal of new laws to encourage the development of all manner of businesses which use blockchain technology. “I guess that’s the hope: if you build it, they will come,” he says. But at the same time, he worries about attracting undesirables. He remembers a company which set up in Wyoming a few summers ago, purporting to specialise in trade finance, which had a nice website with “sailboats and whatnot” and which registered an office above the Hypnotic Hookah lounge in downtown Cheyenne. Within a couple of years it had folded and skipped town, after Mr Forkner and his colleagues started querying its ties to companies in Russia, Pakistan and Ukraine. “It did not appear to be a legitimate business,” he says. “If you have a human element in finance you’re going to have fraud at some point.” He also worries about bumping heads with Washington. Cheyenne’s classification of cryptocurrency tokens as distinct from money or securities clashes with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for example. In the wake of explosive growth in the market for initial coin offerings — which have raised almost $14bn for blockchain-backed businesses, according to Coindesk — the SEC has taken a hard line: any cryptocurrency offered through an ICO should be treated as a security, and thus subject to existing laws on disclosures and other investor protections. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, meanwhile, seems anxious to separate cryptocurrencies from the regulated banking system, which has “know your customer” rules designed to combat money-laundering and terror finance. Several FDIC-insured banks in Wyoming have received takeover approaches from crypto businesses. “Even if I thought I was the most progressive bank regulator in the United States, we have federal banking laws — and the FDIC would immediately say ‘no, this is not permissible. You either cease and desist or we will pull your insurance’”.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ben McLannahan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-07-01","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/a8e0df28-7aeb-11e8-bc55-50daf11b720d","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F310f25dc-7027-11e8-852d-d8b934ff5ffa?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Switzerland looks to liberalise cryptocurrency banking access","INTRO":"Traditional banks have refused to operate accounts for the country’s ‘crypto valley’ start-ups","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Switzerland’s fast-growing cryptocurrency industry could have full access to conventional banking services by the end of the year, removing one of the restrictions to future growth, a top Swiss policymaker has said. Traditional banks have so far largely refused to operate accounts for the country’s “crypto valley” start-ups, citing tough anti-money laundering and other rules on managing clients. The new companies, largely clustered around Zug, a small lakeside town near Zurich, have instead turned to banks in Liechtenstein and elsewhere for banking services. Heinz Tännler, finance director of Zug canton, said he expected Swiss politicians and regulators to remove obstacles in coming months, allowing crypto companies to operate with banks in the same way as other companies. “We hope to clarify relationships by the end of the year at the latest,” he told the Financial Times. “Time is pressing — other jurisdictions such as Malta and Singapore are very active and making a lot of effort to attract these companies. The lack of access to bank services is a significant competitive disadvantage.” Switzerland’s central bank, financial supervisor and federal government “are willing to help”, Mr Tännler added. “We have to push certain national institutions to resolve this problem quickly and effectively, but that now seems to be going well.” Despite scepticism among regulators globally about cryptocurrencies, Switzerland has sought to steal a lead in the emerging financial products. Earlier this year, Johann Schneider-Ammann, economics minister, said Switzerland wanted to become the “crypto nation”. The affluent Alpine country last year ranked second after the US in funds generated from “initial coin offerings” — when start-ups sell tokens or coins — to investors. Zug is home to about 200 blockchain-based companies. However, the lack of access to normal banking services has become a worry. “You can do a lot with crypto — but you can’t pay rents and salaries,” said Alain Kunz, chief executive of Coinlab Capital, a Swiss start-up offering blockchain asset management services. Recommended “On one hand, the government declares Switzerland a crypto nation and wants to become a business hub for blockchain technology. On the other hand, the banks make life difficult for the blockchain and crypto start-ups to obtain banking relationships — essentially killing the emerging businesses.” Crypto Valley companies have started to take their own measures to resolve the problem by moving into financial services themselves, Mr Kunz said. Coinlab Capital had agreed a partnership with TokenPay, a blockchain-based payment platform registered in the British Virgin Islands which has banking operations. Under the deal, Coinlab Capital will become TokenPay’s asset management arm. Mr Tännler described Zug as an “exceptionally economically-liberal” canton. “Of course, rules on money laundering and other rules must be adhered to by blockchain companies. I can understand that banks are careful with respect to ‘know your client’ and anti-money laundering. But experts reckon the danger of money laundering is lower than in other sectors of the finance industry.” “Companies active in the blockchain area should receive banking services just like any other company. That way they will be stopped from choosing other domiciles — in countries where access is easier, such as Liechtenstein.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ralph Atkins","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-07-02","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/011cf9b6-69a7-11e8-aee1-39f3459514fd","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F36b7b8f0-6e29-11e8-8863-a9bb262c5f53?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Business schools race to offer lessons in blockchain and bitcoin","INTRO":"Academic predicts that what should be taught and by whom could start a turf war","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Business schools and universities are rushing to launch courses on cryptocurrencies and blockchain, as demand for greater understanding of the technologies grows after the crypto boom. But what exactly should be taught and who should teach it? As academics take stock, debate is growing over where the future of cryptocurrency education lies. Demand from professionals for teaching on cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that underpins them had increased steadily. More recently, however, there has been an explosion of interest amid turbulent changes in the price of bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, and the hype around it. Business schools and universities are racing to train students in a specialism once seen as inhabiting the nerdy fringes of finance and technology but which has been propelled into the mainstream. It is not just banks, central banks and governments assessing how to use the technologies; other sectors, from logistics to mining, want to understand what it means for them. “This is moving much faster than people expected. Business schools will have no choice but to update curriculums,” says David Yermack, professor of finance and business transformation at the New York University Stern School of Business. He started teaching one of the first courses in cryptocurrencies and blockchain within the university’s MBA programme in 2014. The most recent course had 230 students, more than double the number the previous year. “We moved to the biggest auditorium in the school so we would not have any limits. The growth is exponential,” he says. Bitcoin’s value doubled in the space of a month to peak at about $20,000 in December, before retreating to about $6,500 last week. The rise spawned excitement about other cryptocurrencies, as well the proliferation of initial coin offerings (ICOs), a crowdfunding mechanism where entrepreneurs issue their own digital tokens or coins in exchange for services or software. Blockchain, the shared ledger technology that powers cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and many ICOs, is also an emerging field. Blockchains allow encrypted data on anything from financial transactions to medical records to be shared instantly in a database that can be public and immutable, or accessible only to permitted parties. “The increase in value in the cryptos played a large part in the increase in public interest,” says Jens Martin, programme director at the University of Amsterdam Business School, which offers a blockchain and cryptocurrencies course on its master in international finance. “However, we feel that the finance industry is very interested in the technology itself and the possibilities it offers,” he says, citing smart contracts and ICOs. “We see many applications not only from people with a banking background, but a more diverse group who are interested in applying these concepts to finance.” Robert Wardrop, director and co-founder of the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, part of the university’s Judge Business School, says that demand for knowledge and skills relating to cryptocurrencies is also coming from companies such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft. “The core focus of interest is growing from non-financial firms,” he says. “[These insights] are essential to related projects that these businesses are working on.” He highlights the growth of “tokenised assets”, which are traded via digital tokens on online exchanges. Here, instead of receiving physical assets, investors receive a digital receipt that represents their holdings. “Understanding issues like asset tokenisation is quite fundamental . . . in terms of your business model but also to your capital raising,” he says. Carsten Sorensen, a professor of information systems and innovation at the London School of Economics, is the convener of a short online course, cryptocurrency investment and disruption, coming this summer that costs £1,800. However, he questions if cryptocurrencies are mature enough to warrant an entire specialised masters in finance. “It is still quite difficult to analyse this market in terms of all the advanced mathematics and statistics you can use in finance,” he says. “The whole idea of bitcoin was [about] creating fundamentals that were decoupled from the rest of the world.” The varied approaches highlight the plural nature of cryptocurrencies and their applications, which are in their infancy. Different university departments are waking up to the demand, in what could lead to tussles, some predict. The topics were all but unheard of . . . it is more difficult than teaching a course from a textbook Garrick Hileman, a research associate and lecturer at the University of Cambridge, says accounting, economics, business, finance and law departments are increasingly weighing up the space. “It wouldn’t surprise me to see some turf wars break out over who owns the blockchain curriculum at business schools,” says Mr Hileman, who taught an elective course that covered cryptocurrencies in the university’s master of finance course for two years. “It’s interdisciplinary,” says Prof Yermack. “The computer science and finance industries have merged and this needs to happen in universities too. But universities are bureaucratic — it will be political and take time.” Universities are also encountering challenges unique to crypto and blockchain. Creating a popular elective course requires not only good teaching but also wooing sought-after names, in what is still a niche field, as guest speakers. Academics describe the difficulties of keeping pace with a fast-evolving field. In his latest course, Prof Yermack had to adjust his curriculum to add lessons on the creation of new versions of cryptocurrency known as hard forks, as well as on ICOs. “These topics were all but unheard of a year ago,” he says. “This is much more difficult than teaching a course out of a textbook.” Campbell Harvey, at Fuqua School of Business at Duke University in North Carolina, who teaches a course on innovation and cryptoventures to MBA students, describes a similar experience. “You could be walking into the classroom and something in your course becomes redundant,” he says. Dealing with inquiries about the field from students and non-students is time-consuming and adds to “the hidden cost of teaching an innovative course”, he says. Still, Prof Harvey has faith that engaging with the cryptocurrencies is vital. “Schools should be preparing students for the future not the past. Unfortunately most . . . don’t have these courses that are focused on the future.” This article has been amended to correct the spelling of Carsten Sorensen’s name","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hannah Murphy","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-06-17","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/1b1b137e-760f-11e8-b326-75a27d27ea5f","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fb0d363c4-7634-11e8-8cc4-59b7a8ef7d3d?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"‘Fake it till you make it’ — but know when to stop","INTRO":"An appearance of strength can be as good as the real thing","DETAILED_CONTENT":"“Fake it till you make it” is a well-worn strategy in business. It is a perfectly valid approach, but it has limits. During the financial crisis Deutsche Bank under-reported huge derivatives risks. Asset prices later recovered and the paper losses evaporated — in finance, in particular, the appearance of strength can be as good as the real thing. Less successfully, Lehman Brothers used an accounting scam known as Repo 105 to boost its liquidity position but it could not fake hard enough to survive. For years, Vice Media sucked in attention, investment and staff. At times it relied on a Potemkin village approach. To make it seem like a buzzy, fast-expanding workplace, friends were roped in to wander around toting laptops. New York Magazine reported that for one single, crucial meeting to impress Intel, a potential advertiser, a neighbouring office of architects was implored to vacate their space, which was quickly converted into a swanky annex (“an employee answered a buzz at the door to find a plumber who’d come to install a fancy Japanese toilet”). Vice won the Intel marketing money and, despite plenty of ups and downs, it endures. Eventually, though, the bluffing can grow wearisome. For a while Oracle, a venerable enterprise software company, has portrayed itself as a cool “cloud” business. You can see why. Upstarts such as Salesforce, run by Oracle alum Marc Benioff, have commanded soaring valuations with their web-based subscription alternatives. Oracle did not want to be seen as a fading old colossus. Yet the company’s spin has never rung true: it has struggled to make the case that it has moved beyond its traditional licensing model. This week Safra Catz, Oracle’s chief executive, led the company’s earnings presentation by highlighting “a tremendous number of wins in the cloud”. There were a whopping 66 mentions of the C-word on the conference call. But Oracle also surprised investors with a decision to stop disclosing cloud revenues. “There is no hiding,” Ms Catz insisted. “It’s quite clear that we had a superb quarter and we’re expecting the same next quarter.” The shares dropped 5 per cent. Oracle is on the gentle side of exaggeration. It has just, arguably, overcooked its presence and prospects in a whizzier adjacent sector. The lure of exciting tech, though, extends even to companies in totally unrelated fields that are looking for a boost. Long Island Iced Tea Corporation decided late last year to change its name to Long Blockchain Corp. For a brief moment it came good: the company’s shares jumped 500 per cent as cryptocurrency nuts piled in. Then Nasdaq accused it of trying to “mislead investors and to take advantage of general investor interest in bitcoin and blockchain technology”. This week Long Blockchain was delisted. There was more fizz when Long Island stuck to soft drinks. At some point the jig is always up. BP first deployed its “Beyond Petroleum” campaign 18 years ago but is still making the vast bulk of profits from hydrocarbons. The same is true of Royal Dutch Shell — which chief executive Ben van Beurden describes as an “energy transition company”. They could follow the route of Big Tobacco, wringing plentiful cash from a slowly dying industry. Or they will have to gird investors for an expensive gamble on a real shift to clean energy. The “fake it” part can be fun but the “make it” part matters too.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Tom Braithwaite","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-06-22","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/3443b111-4ab7-33bc-a05a-c49c1e4b75e1","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcct-images.ft.com%2Fproduction%2Fdd0473f6-878f-4b08-b87a-42646fd7c2ff_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Crypto-courting in Kaliningrad","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"There\u0027s evidence of the Alphaville team in several places today -- not just here on the blog, but also in the Palace of Westminster where Izabella Kaminska will give evidence on digital currencies to the Treasury Select Committee (we\u0027ll be live-blogging). Over at the FT Magazine, meanwhile, you can read a piece from Kaliningrad on how the Russian exclave encourages crypto miners to set up shop there. (Yes, it\u0027s an exclave not an enclave. More on that at a later date.) We even managed to film some stuff while we were in Kaliningrad, including a human bitcoin miner blowing dust out of non-human ASICs miners in a derelict former Soviet factory. Cryptolyfe is as glamorous as it is high-tech: The gist is that this region, surrounded by the EU and Nato while a member of neither, and separated from Mother Russia by two other countries and about 300 miles, has had to be a bit creative when it comes to encouraging business. With Russia on less than friendly terms with Kaliningrad\u0027s neighbouring Lithuania and Poland, the vast majority of the exclave\u0027s exports go to the mainland. But shipping goods across three borders is costly, difficult, and slow, so the federal government is offering tech entrepreneurs generous tax incentives, part of the privileges Kaliningrad gets as a special economic zone. Exporting virtual stuff is much easier than the physical variety. The mayor of one Kaliningrad town is even trying to set up a “Silicon Valley on the Baltic”. We look forward to seeing how that one turns out. While crypto regulation is still pretty unclear in Russia -- not to say downright confusing -- the region has decided that crypto miners aren\u0027t doing anything too shady: That was how Sergei Evstigneev, the region’s IT and communications minister, described the situation when we met him in the offices of the state-owned Kaliningrad Region Development Corporation. (Apparently we were “under a positive impression” of what we saw in Kaliningrad, according to the KRDC, who put out a press press release about our visit describing how we were one of a number of news outlets from “Foggy Albion”, who had come to visit the region ahead of the England v Belgium game to be held there next Thursday.) Mr Evstigneev and the KRDC\u0027s director-general Vladimir Zarudny, who we spoke to separately, both told us they had no concerns about the environmental impact of crypto miners in the region. Kaliningrad is in the process of building several more power plants, one of them coal-powered, which it reckons should attract more crypto miners. We\u0027re not judging. As we Foggy Albionians know all too well, given our own impending separation from the rest of the European Union, sometimes, desperate times call for desperate measures. In totally unrelated news, the Right Honorable Grant Shapps MP was to be found in London on Tuesday delivering a speech called “Building a Blockchain Britain”. The run-up to our visit was filled with apprehension and stress, for several reasons: the only novels we had found based in Kaliningrad all involve murder; we were told it was bleak and we\u0027d need a holiday to recover from a visit; the visa/accreditation process for journalists is painful; and the local mayor had been forced to warn locals not to beat up foreigners. But it was actually fascinating, and we\u0027d recommend a visit. If you\u0027ve used up all your leave, though, and you\u0027re not one of the England fans travelling there next week, fear not. This will be the first in a series of posts on the region, which we will call “Of Kant, crypto, and contradiction”. We hope you enjoy it.

Since the explosive growth in the market for initial coin offerings — which have raised almost $14bn for blockchain-backed businesses — the SEC has taken a hard line: any cryptocurrency offered through an ICO should be treated as a security, and thus subject to existing laws on disclosures and other investor protections. But at a conference in San Francisco, William Hinman, the SEC’s director of corporate finance, drew a distinction between the original cryptocurrency issuance through an ICO and additional cryptocurrency created later, when it does not necessarily benefit the original backers. He was alluding to the growth of Ether, the digital asset associated with the Ethereum blockchain. Its use has expanded from a small group of pioneers in 2014 to a community of more than 100,000 developers. Applying federal securities laws to ongoing issuance of Ether “would seem to add little value,” he said, as there are no longer any “central actors” steering the success, or otherwise, of the effort. “This is great news; it acknowledges that something can start out as a security while a platform is being created and then, once unleashed, change its stripes,” said Caitlin Long, a former Morgan Stanley executive now working to position her home state of Wyoming as a crypto and blockchain hub. A regulator whose whole job it is to call things securities and then fine people The speech had the standard SEC disclaimer that it did not necessarily reflect the views of the commission. But crypto enthusiasts took heart, welcoming the director’s careful choice of words and his suggestion that there comes a point in the life of any cryptocurrency when securities laws are no longer appropriate. They noted that Mr Hinman drew a parallel between Ether and bitcoin, the first mass-market cryptocurrency, which the SEC has already backed away from supervising as a security. Others welcomed a more nuanced view from the regulator, which some have accused of responding too defensively and dogmatically to the emerging world of crypto. Speaking to the FT earlier this week, Erik Voorhees, chief executive of Shapeshift, a Switzerland-based digital-asset exchange, dismissed the SEC “as a regulator whose whole job it is to call things securities and then fine people”. Marco Santori, president at Blockchain, a big provider of cryptocurrency wallets, and a fintech adviser to the International Monetary Fund, said on Twitter that Mr Hinman’s position was “a Really Big Deal”, adding that it could “pave the way for a robust token economy, and a great variety of compliant tokens”. Recommended The price of bitcoin gained about 5 per cent in the wake of Mr Hinman’s remarks, while Ether rose as much as 15 per cent. The pair are the top two cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation, worth $114bn and $52bn respectively.

A new paper from University of Texas finance professor John Griffin -- an academic who is known for uncovering fraud and manipulation in more traditional financial instruments such as the VIX index -- and graduate student Amin Shams provide some strong evidence for such up-propping. Here\u0027s a summary of the report\u0027s findings, released Wednesday, (emphasis ours): Using algorithms to analyze the blockchain data, we find that purchases with Tether are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin prices. Less than 1 per cent of hours with such heavy Tether transactions are associated with 50 per cent of the meteoric rise in Bitcoin and 64 per cent of other top cryptocurrencies. The flow clusters below round prices, induces asymmetric autocorrelations in Bitcoin, and suggests incomplete Tether backing before month-ends. These patterns cannot be explained by investor demand proxies but are most consistent with the supply-based hypothesis where Tether is used to provide price support and manipulate cryptocurrency prices. ...we find that Tether has a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. The report appears to back up heavy speculation, most notably from a guy calling himself “ Bitfinex\u0027ed”, that crypto prices had been deliberately manipulated by the printing of Tethers -- which are purportedly backed by real US dollars. Tethers first came into the spotlight around spring time last year, after Bitfinex, a major Hong Kong-based crypto exchange, lost access to its US correspondent bank, Wells Fargo. Because customers could no longer access their real dollars, Bitfinex clients could use Tethers instead. Those Tethers could be swapped into another cryptocurrency on Bitfinex, which could then be moved onto other crypto exchanges. If those exchanges had correspondent banks, fiat money could then be withdrawn. It is hard to tell where Bitfinex ends and Tether begins. Both entities share the same chief executive, chief financial officer, chief strategy officer and general counsel. At Bitfinex the headshots are presented in squares, while on Tether\u0027s website the same images are circular. Meanwhile, the supply of Tethers rapidly ballooned, from $50 million to $2.2 billion. That led to an increasing number of questions o ver whether the dollars that were meant to back the cryptocurrency really existed. It was reported in January that both companies had been subpoenaed in December last year by US regulators, who wanted to look into this. Griffin and Shams looked into whether Tether has been “pulled” (demand-driven), or “pushed” (supply-driven), to see whether the issuance of new Tether has facilitated demand for crypto, or whether it was the other way round... If the Tether founders, like most early cryptocurrency adopters and exchanges, are long on Bitcoin, they have a large incentive to create an artificial demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by ’printing’ Tether. Similar to the inflationary effect of printing additional money, this can push cryptocurrency prices up. Second, the coordinated supply of Tether creates an opportunity to manipulate cryptocurrencies. When prices are falling, the Tether creators can convert their Tether into Bitcoin in a way that pushes Bitcoin up and then sell some Bitcoin back into dollars to replenish Tether reserves as Bitcoin price rises. Finally, if cryptocurrency prices crash, Tether creators essentially have a put option to default on redeeming Tether, or to potentially experience a ’hack’ where Tether or related dollars disappear. They found the results were “most consistent with the supply-driven manipulation hypothesis, through which Tether is being pushed on market participants”. Take a look at this chart, from the report: It does look like a pretty good correlation between the supply of Tether and the bitcoin price, right? Until January, that is. New Tethers stopped being printed on January 23. Since then the price of bitcoin has almost halved. The report also said there was evidence that someone or some people at Bitfinex had been working to push up the price of bitcoin when it was slipping on other exchanges: By mapping the blockchains of Bitcoin and Tether, we are able to establish that entities associated with the Bitfinex exchange use Tether to purchase Bitcoin when prices are falling. Such price supporting activities are successful, as Bitcoin prices rise following the periods of intervention Here\u0027s a nice visualisation of the aggregate flows of Tether between major cryptocurrency addresses: In response to the report, Bitfinex CEO JL van der Velde said the following (via an emailed statement): Bitfinex nor Tether [sic] is, or has ever, engaged in any sort of market or price manipulation. Tether issuances cannot be used to prop up the price of Bitcoin or any other coin/token on Bitfinex. A spokeswoman also said via email that his statement represented the views of both Tether and Bitfinex, despite them supposedly being different companies. (We asked them about this latter point but are yet to hear back.) The report\u0027s conclusion is as follows (again, emphasis ours): By mapping the blockchains of Bitcoin and Tether, we are able to establish that entities associated with the Bitfinex exchange use Tether to purchase Bitcoin when prices are falling. Such price supporting activities are successful, as Bitcoin prices rise following the periods of intervention. These effects are present only after negative returns and periods following the printing of Tether. Indeed, even less than 1 per cent of extreme exchange of tether for Bitcoin has substantial aggregate price effects. The buying of Bitcoin with Tether also occurs more aggressively right below salient round-number price thresholds where the price support might be most effective. Overall, our findings provide substantial support for the view that price manipulation may be behind substantial distortive effects in cryptocurrencies. These findings suggest that external capital market surveillance and monitoring may be necessary to obtain a market that is truly free. Yeah, sorry guys, libertarianism is great and all but you kind of need surveillance and monitoring -- ie financial regulation -- to keep the market truly free. Hayek could\u0027ve told you that, but let\u0027s stop dragging Hayek into bitcoin. All the major cryptocurrencies were sharply down across the board at pixel time Wednesday.

Data from Chainalysis, a blockchain research company, seen by the Financial Times showed that in April this year, there were some 1,600 bitcoin “wallets” — the digital stores held by individual users — containing at least 1,000 bitcoin each. These unidentified, so-called whales captured a third of the market, around 5m bitcoins, stripping out bitcoin deemed lost or unused for years. Just under 100 wallets contained between 10,000 and 100,000 bitcoin, roughly worth between $75m and $750m at today’s prices. That the bitcoin market is so tightly held stands at odds with bitcoin’s mission to democratise finance by setting up an alternative monetary system free of central bank control and open to all. It also brings risks for smaller speculators. “This concentration of wealth means that bitcoin is at risk of volatility, as the moves of a small number of people will have a large effect (on the price),” said Philip Gradwell, Chainalysis’ chief economist. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, enjoyed a dramatic bull run last year as retail investors rushed to try to cash in on its rise. Its price rose more than 1,000 per cent in 2017, peaking at about $20,000 in mid-December, but it has since fallen back to trade at around $7,500 as regulators begin to circle the freewheeling sector. The Chainalysis data also revealed how some early investors were able to cash out their holdings as speculators arrived in droves. Recommended Last November, the amount of bitcoin owned by those who held the asset for more than a year was roughly three times that held by short-term investors who traded more recently. However, by April 2018, the data showed the amount held by long-term investors, at about 6m bitcoin, was much closer to matching the amount held by short-term speculators, with 5.1m bitcoin. Chainalysis estimated that many longer-term holders sold at least $30bn worth of bitcoin to new speculators over the December to April period, with half of this movement taking place in December alone. “This was an exceptional transfer of wealth and conditions for it to occur again are unlikely to form again soon,” said Mr Gradwell. Experts also warn there are opportunities particularly for larger players to engage in market manipulation owing to the lack of regulation and the existence of informal over-the-counter markets. “A number of these larger holders do communicate with each other, they know [each other], they take stock of market activity,” said Dr Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain and co-founder of Mosaic.io, a platform for market intelligence on crypto.

Citizens live on meat-only diets, official conference after-parties are held in strip clubs, enthusiasts are encouraged to find worthless tokens on mountain-tops (even though such pursuits can be deadly), and the ultimate goal in life is making enough money to buy a “ Lambo”. So we were a little surprised to see City AM run a story over the weekend with the following headline: We’ve been to lots of crypto conferences and events, spoken to many a HODLer and probably spent too much time on #cryptotwitter and yet, we\u0027ve never got the impression that women were the ones “leading the market for crypto investment”. We decided to ask the source of the report, the erm, London Block Exchange, whether we could see the data behind it ourselves. As we suspected, it didn\u0027t quite back up the headline. When the sample group was asked whether they would definitely buy or would consider buying crypto -- a somewhat leading question -- around one in eight women gave a positive response, compared with roughly one in six men. Apparently the point was the number of women interested in investing had increased, whereas the number of men interested had shrunk. But given that the survey was asking about future intentions rather than current holdings, and that only one in 25 women was “strongly considering buying or investing” -- compared with one in 17 men -- the assertion that “w omen lead the way when it comes to new cryptocurrency investors” seems a bit off. Furthermore, copycat “social trading” company eToro ran its own research on the crypto market earlier this year based on the profiles of its 9 million users and found that 91.5 per cent of crypto investors were men. A quick glance at Forbes\u0027s crypto rich list -- subtitle “Prophets of boom” -- doesn\u0027t yield many surprises either. In its list of the top 19 crypto investors (counting the Winklevii as one of course), as of February 6, there is not a single woman. CityAM isn\u0027t the only publication that\u0027s been pushing the “you might not realise but women actually are really into crypto” narrative recently -- perhaps because many news organisations have now armed themselves with cryptocurrency reporters just as the hype starting to die down, or perhaps because these articles tend to get lots of clicks. Whatever the rationale, we’ve noticed an increasing number of these stories pop up. For instance, take this article back in May from Coin Telegraph (written by a man, naturally): Umm, tackle gender inequality? So we can be equally as REKT as you? It\u0027s OK thanks; we\u0027ll pass. They did speak to an actual woman though, who was quoted as saying: Ohhhhh, wait! Ladies, it’s less complicated than it appears! Maybe we can The thing is, ”gender equality\" isn\u0027t something we should indiscriminately aim for in all areas in life; it should bring real value for the people involved. And that doesn\u0027t include the speculative, highly risky, bro-led and often downright stupid world of cryptocurrency investing, How many articles have you read that argue women need to get more involved in gambling? We haven\u0027t read too many, despite big gender gaps. And crypto investing \u003d gambling. (Even TV comedians have realised that by this point.) Most women aren’t as into crypto as men and that’s OK. It’s actually good! Cryptocurrencies consume huge amounts of energy, enable criminality, often lack security, and generally just don\u0027t work very well (particularly when people try to use them to pay for actual stuff). Back in January, venture capitalist Alexia Bonatsos posted the following to Twitter: Women, consider crypto. Otherwise the men are going to get all the wealth, again. To be fair, we can see where she was coming from: at that point the estimated crypto “market cap” was around the $570bn mark, having increased around 3,200 per cent in the previous twelve-month period. But the advice has not aged well. At pixel time, this supposed “market cap” was hovering just below $300bn. Depending on which tokens they chose, women who had followed Bonatsos\u0027s advice and would have lost around half of their money. Here\u0027s a tweet that has aged better (posted on Saturday, before the most recent market crash), from user Nancy Nakamoto (we assume that\u0027s a pseudonym and therefore aren\u0027t sure whether Nancy is in fact a woman): If anything proves the superiority of my gender it is the lack of faith shown in cryptocurrencies. This group in Canada is trying to drag us down to the level of the basement living cryptoboys. @angela_walch @izakaminska @davidgerard @jemimajoanna https://t.co/b5HXEg4osf Yes, that\u0027s the “CryptoChicks” group, which sets out to be a somewhat oxymoronic “blockchain educational fun hub”. There are, of course, serious points to be made here: there should be more diversity in technology generally, and tech bro culture can often discourage women from entering into the industry. There are undoubtedly women who do want to be involved in the crypto and blockchain space, and it goes without saying that they should certainly not be subjected to intimidation, mansplaining and even sexual harassment if they choose to do so. But let\u0027s not encourage other women to throw their money away on nonsense. And let\u0027s not think that just because a lot of men are doing something, we should do be doing it too.

Business West said its pilot certificate of origin on blockchain, issued to Renishaw, which supplies precision devices to several industries including aerospace and healthcare, is the second such project in the world following one in Singapore. Certificates of origin, typically provided by chambers of commerce, are needed to prove where goods were made for customs purposes. If the UK after Brexit is no longer in a customs union with the EU, it will be subject to complex “rules of origin” and companies will need to show which part of which product was made where in order to benefit from preferential trade deals. James Monk, commercial director of Business West, said his organisation issues 30,000 to 40,000 certificates of origin annually, a number that might rise sharply after Brexit. Such documents, and the many other requirements for exporting goods, could be digitised and shared through a blockchain. “A standardised process could simplify and make it easier to check many parts of the supply chain including customs declarations, bills of lading [certifications of ship loads] and letters of credit,” he said. The technology — which creates a “distributed ledger” spread across thousands of computers to verify transactions — should make the processes of sending goods abroad simpler and more transparent. There’s a good chance that the UK will have had time to leave the EU, realise its mistake and rejoin it before blockchain sees any significant implementation within customs borders Currently, obtaining a letter of credit to send goods to some Middle Eastern destinations can involve up to eight people and a paper form hand-stamped, signed and sent by courier. By contrast, Mr Monk said information on consignments entered in a blockchain remains there forever and can be tracked via a QR code. After being made, no blockchain entries can be changed, reducing the risk of false declarations to obtain lower tariffs. “It’s a lot easier to Photoshop a paper certificate of origin than to alter an entry in a blockchain,” Mr Monk said. Mr Monk is keen to stress that the application of such technology to trade is in its infancy — the blockchain certificate of origin was issued alongside a conventional paper version — and there are many obstacles to its expansion. In the UK, HMRC, the customs agency, is currently rushing to install a new customs declaration system ahead of Brexit. “HMRC have other things on their minds for a while, and to put the customs system on blockchain could take a decade,” Mr Monk said. If the UK leaves the EU single market, the technology will also not remove the need for time-consuming product inspections at borders, though it will enable information from such checks to be shared more easily. Nicolas Botton, a researcher at the European Centre for International Political Economy think-tank in Brussels, said that an unproven technology and lack of regulatory oversight could prevent blockchain’s widespread adoption in trade supply chains for decades. “There’s a good chance that the UK will have had time to leave the EU, realise its mistake and rejoin it before blockchain sees any significant implementation within customs borders,” he said. Recommended Adam Underwood of the managing director of the software company i2i, which created the information technology for Business West, said some companies have already adopted blockchain to monitor cargoes, such as the shipping group Maersk in association with IBM. But he added: “The whole shipping process involves a great number of smaller traders and other players including chambers of commerce, whose processes need to be digitised to make the overall solution work.” Mr Monk said that some private sector participants might resist having their operations made so transparent. “A freight forwarding company telling the client that the lorry just left with their cargo loaded on it may not welcome them being able to check whether it is still in the warehouse,” he said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Alan Beattie","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-06-13","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/601790f8-10d7-11e8-a765-993b2440bd73","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F39bcda62-6d6b-11e8-8863-a9bb262c5f53?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How to fix business schools’ fintech problem","INTRO":"Breaking down academic silos can overcome clash of cultures and the lack of expertise","DETAILED_CONTENT":"“Bitcoin is a bubble!” “But how about the endless possibilities of the blockchain?” “Nothing but pixie dust!” I found myself in the middle of such discussions when teaching finance MBA students at HEC Paris. The idea was to discuss challenges in regulating fintech companies, but the debate quickly turned to the technical aspects of blockchain, decentralised applications and token economies. American economist Paul Volcker once said: “The only useful thing banks have invented in 20 years is the ATM.” Mr Volcker has a point. Banking services are pretty much what they used to be 40 years ago. But this status quo is changing at breakneck speed thanks to fintech. Artificial intelligence is affecting almost every aspect of our financial lives, from credit scoring to regulatory compliance. And the blockchain enables financial services that no longer rely on traditional intermediaries such as banks. This has created a clash of cultures in business schools where finance professors are faced with rowdy students who declare the entire financial system is obsolete and requires a reboot. In a recent Financial Times column, Helen Barrett points out that fintech is regularly among the worst-rated courses at business schools, despite the obvious appeal to students and topical relevance. So what can business schools do about it? There are two aspects to this clash of cultures that make it difficult for business schools to include fintech in their curriculum. First, many of the crypto enthusiasts do not have a background in finance and misunderstand elementary concepts of financial theory. They care more about consensus mechanisms than adverse selection and only shrug at the intricacies of corporate finance. An example of this is to use the term cryptocurrency for bitcoin, ethereum, and other alt-coins. But bitcoin is neither a medium of exchange nor a store of value, both necessary conditions for it to be a currency. Only niche companies accept bitcoin as payment and the price of bitcoin has dropped more than 60 per cent since mid-December. So much for store of value. Recommended Second, most faculty at business schools do not understand the details of the underlying technology. Take initial coin offerings as an example. Launching a successful ICO is difficult. Start-ups need to give a detailed description of their technology in a white paper, start advertising the ICO, build a community, and ultimately build a prototype to bootstrap their token economy. All of this happens with minimum involvement from traditional financial institutions and a maximum focus on the underlying technology. Teaching fintech at both HEC Paris and at the University of Cape Town, I have learnt two things. Business schools must embrace collaboration with computer scientists. To make this work, computer scientists need paths to tenure at business schools that do not require publishing in coveted journals because computer scientists publish mostly through conference proceedings and are appalled by the idea of waiting months for a referee report. This is less of an issue at top business schools but too many institutions are stuck in their disciplinary silos. A cultural shift is also necessary. Business schools need crypto experts to contribute their unique technical understanding. At the University of Cape Town, the faculty of commerce — working with the statistical science and computer science departments — has introduced a new fintech masters programme. The degree focuses on hard skills and coding and has seen extraordinary demand. HEC Paris has a joint masters in data science for business together with École Polytechnique, which also focuses on hard skills. Second, the traditional classroom paradigm needs to be broken up. It is not enough to have case studies of successful fintech companies; students actually need to get their hands dirty. UCT, for example, ran a 10-day blockchain boot camp and hackathon — #UnlockTheBlock2018 — with blockchain company Linum Labs. Bitcoin is volatile but fintech is here to stay. The last time we saw such rapid technological development was in the late-1990s. When the dotcom bubble burst, companies like Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook emerged and changed the way we do business. There is no reason to think that this time will be different. Business schools would do well to open their doors to those driving the fintech revolution. The writer is a visiting professor at HEC Paris.

It follows that for each of the bitcoin millionaires, there have been numerous casualties; the “get rich quick” punters who entered the market a little too late. “These are people that see something moving up and start buying — they jump on the bandwagon,” says Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University and an investment strategy adviser for Man Group. “Initially in the crypto space, you had people who really understood the technology. Then there was a typical bandwagon investor situation and you know how it ends — and it did.” But how many have gained — and lost — from the bitcoin bubble? Exclusive data from blockchain research company Chainalysis seen by the FT provides some tantalising answers. The Chainalysis data quantifies this distinct shift in the make-up of bitcoin owners from longer-term investors — those who held the asset for more than a year — to short-term investors who have traded more recently, by analysing how regularly coins have changed hands. Last November — before December’s pricing peak — the amount of bitcoin held for investment was roughly three times that held by traders. However, by April 2018, the data show the amount held by investors — about 6m bitcoin — was much closer to the amount held by short-term speculators, with 5.1m bitcoin. Indeed, Chainalysis estimates that longer-term holders sold at least $30bn worth of bitcoin to new speculators over the December to April period, with half of this movement taking place in December alone. “This was an exceptional transfer of wealth,” says Philip Gradwell, Chainalysis’ chief economist, who dubs the past six months as bitcoin’s “liquidity event”. Mr Gradwell argues that this sudden injection of liquidity — the amount of bitcoin available for trading rose by close to 60 per cent over that period — has been a “fundamental driver” behind the recent price decline. At the same time, bitcoin trading volumes have now fallen in tandem with the prices, from close to $4bn daily in December to $1bn today. So will the price of bitcoin ever surpass December’s peak? Part of the answer lies in who holds bitcoin now that the hype has died down. Born in 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis, bitcoin is rooted in a libertarian quest for a means of exchange that is unshackled from the central banking system. Proponents — among them, computer experts and political activists — heralded the arrival of an alternative monetary system that could replace fiat currency. But despite the recent crypto boom, there are few signs that this is happening. According to research published this month by Morgan Stanley, only four of the top 500 US e-commerce merchants accepted cryptocurrencies in the first quarter of 2018, compared with three at the beginning of 2017. Chainalysis notes that the “vast majority” of transactions it analysed showed bitcoin being received from exchanges and rarely sent to merchant services to pay for goods or services. Only a finite number of coin — 21m — can be created. Of this, about 4m are yet to be mined. Just as physical coins can be lost down the back of a sofa, so can bitcoins if users lose or forget the passwords needed to access their online wallets. The Chainalysis data separates out coins it deems to be lost or unused for years — which total 3.7m bitcoin, worth about $28bn. The proportion of bitcoin it estimates to be held by groups such as exchanges or merchant services held steady between December and April at about 2.2m bitcoin. Critics argue that bitcoin’s volatility and a lack of fundamental underpinnings disqualifies it as a reliable store of value, and that this is unlikely to change. This leaves droves of new opportunists dabbling in what has been dubbed a “Wild West” marketplace, with regulators still weighing up how best to tackle the space. “Speculation remains the primary use case for these digital assets; merchant or institutional adoption does not appear to be a primary driver of price,” says Preston Byrne, an English structured finance lawyer and cryptocurrency observer. Given this breakdown in bitcoin owners, most market watchers do not rule out another rapid price run-up. However, they say this would likely be the random movement of pure speculation or market manipulation rather than anything else. “It’s very important to stress, this is not in any sense a rational market,” says David Gerard, the author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain. “It’s very thinly traded, very badly structured . . . and it’s stupendously manipulated,” he adds. “Anyone who goes in not realising just how manipulated the crypto markets are will get skinned.” Some argue there is an art to trading bitcoin regardless — but it is a stressful business that takes nerves and can be addictive. Donnie, a.k.a bitcoin Dad, puts his successes down to careful research, “patience” and avoiding the trap of obsessive, leveraged day trading. But others are unconvinced that bitcoin millionaires actually show investment nous, drawing parallels with gambling. “It’s the luck of the draw, where everyone who won the draw seems to feel like they deserved it for being smarter,” Vitalik Buterin, the Russian-Canadian programmer who invented the smart-contract blockchain Ethereum, told the Financial Times recently. The Chainalysis data also show that the bitcoin marketplace is skewed in terms of wealth distribution. A small cluster of investors — known colloquially as “whales” — capture a hefty proportion of the market, which stands at odds with bitcoin’s mission to democratise finance. This brings its own risks. Overall, some 1,600 bitcoin wallets — managed by both speculators and investors — contained at least 1,000 bitcoin each in April, according to Chainalysis, collectively holding nearly 5m bitcoin, or close to a third of the available total. Of those, just under 100 wallets owned by longer-term investors contained between 10,000 and 100,000 bitcoin — so between $75m and $750m at today’s prices. “This concentration of wealth means that bitcoin is at risk of volatility, as the moves of a small number of people will have a large effect,” says Chainalysis’ Mr Gradwell. However, the situation suggests bitcoin’s volatility is “of low risk to the wider financial system”, he adds, as “only a small number of people will face large changes in crypto wealth”. Still, there are opportunities particularly for the larger players to engage in market manipulation, due to the dearth of regulation and existence of informal over-the-counter markets — and this leaves smaller players at a disadvantage. “When you build up a big enough position in any asset you can move the price,” says Dr Garrick Hileman, head of research at Blockchain and co-founder of Mosaic.io, a platform for market intelligence on crypto. “A number of these larger holders do communicate with each other, they know [each other], they take stock of market activity.” Analysts at Morgan Stanley echoed this concern in a note this month, saying that it was “noteworthy” that the more sophisticated investors were “willing to give up traditional investor rights for potentially faster liquidity”. Nevertheless, some point out that the excitement and influx of fresh funds into the market has allowed its infrastructure to mature — albeit gradually — which could be a boon for those looking to trade bitcoin more safely in future.   Buying and selling bitcoin had traditionally been challenging for all but the most tech-savvy. As last year’s cryptocurrency frenzy heated up however, some consumer finance businesses rushed to capitalise on the zeitgeist and offer their customers access to digital coins through apps they were already familiar with using. Many exchanges have strengthened their due diligence processes in response to customer concerns and invested in bigger customer services teams. Transaction fees have come down as technology has improved — but hacks are still commonplace. Institutions have also been making inroads. These include prominent US futures exchanges, such as the CME Group and Cboe Global Markets, which now offer bitcoin futures. Meanwhile, Nasdaq’s chief executive, Adena Friedman, said this year that the group would consider offering cryptocurrency exchange services in future. Alternative funds are also muscling in. Morgan Stanley data show there is now more than $3.5bn in estimated assets under management across 250 dedicated crypto-funds, although the pace of the creation of new funds has slowed recently. A more formalised over-the-counter market has started to develop, with players such as Cumberland, an arm of Chicago-based DRW, and Goldman Sachs-backed Circle growing rapidly. Much of the future of bitcoin trading will depend on the approach that regulators take, experts say. There are stirrings across the world, though to date, little coherence. Asian financial centres such as Tokyo are now regulating crypto exchanges, while China has banned them outright. Meanwhile, the US Securities and Exchange Commission last month announced a criminal probe into potential bitcoin price manipulation. Banks in particular have been reticent to engage with cryptocurrencies and the companies that handle them, partly due to the difficulty of conducting anti-money laundering checks on transactions. “Bank compliance officers really, really hate cryptos . . . be prepared to demonstrate the provenance of every penny from every crypto,” says Mr Gerard. Mr Hileman predicts that one day there will be a “legitimate regulated retail investment market” in bitcoin, although not anytime soon. “We’re talking years,” he predicts. Any more widespread adoption of bitcoin would need regulators, central banks and tax regulators to allow the transfer of wealth movement from the current financial system into the new one, says Gavin Brown, senior lecturer in financial economics at Manchester Metropolitan University and director of cryptocurrency hedge fund Blockchain Capital. Nevertheless, there are those who still hold unwavering faith in bitcoin. Sunnie, who has been investing in bitcoin since she started working for a crypto exchange back in 2014, did not cash out in December, burnt by a previous experience in 2016 when she sold thinking the price was high. With 50 per cent of her assets currently in 10 bitcoin — bought initially at $3,000 a piece — she believes in its potential as the first project that uses burgeoning blockchain technology. “If bitcoin can survive under such a high rollercoaster period, I have faith in it,” she adds. “When I reach six figures I’m probably going to cash out what I have and completely retire. The price will go to the moon again — maybe higher.” Additional reporting by Chloe Cornish","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hannah Murphy","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-06-08","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/e3f6396e-5449-11e8-b3ee-41e0209208ec","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F66cfde00-5902-11e8-806a-808d194ffb75?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Entrepreneurship: How Xunlei’s Lei Chen pivoted to blockchain","INTRO":"The tech chief changed tack — but ran into trouble with regulators and investors","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Xunlei has had a wild year. Once a video-sharing network, the company pivoted to blockchain after introducing a virtual token — the Link Token — in October. Its Nasdaq-listed stock increased sixfold, only to fall 40 per cent less than a month later after Link Token came under scrutiny from China’s finance regulator. But the man behind Xunlei’s splashy entrance into the cryptocurrency scene says he eschews China’s rough-and-tumble tech culture. “As a manager of a company, you need to have a very steadfast personality,” Lei Chen, Xunlei’s chief executive, comments drily as he reflects on the events of the past year. Mr Lei, 44, has a distinctly restrained presence. He speaks in measured tones and with the intense focus of a programmer. Unlike many crypto entrepreneurs, he wears suits and ties to work. Xunlei’s rapid transformation from video company to crypto pariah reflects the unpredictable nature of China’s tech scene. Mr Lei is known as the single-minded enforcer behind Xunlei’s blockchain makeover, but he still sees his role as the voice of moderation. New tech, he says, can be dangerous. “The bad guys always figure out a way to use it first,” he says. Nor does he see an end in sight to the battle against abuse. “This challenge of combating speculation will always be a problem. As soon as you take preventive measures, the other side will come up with new ideas to overcome them.” Xunlei was established as a file-sharing platform in 2003. Less than seven years later, it became one of the world’s most popular torrenting tools, before switching to video streaming to monetise the content being uploaded — sometimes illegally — on to its site. Mr Lei became Xunlei’s chief executive in November 2014, only months after the company listed on the Nasdaq. A former software engineer in the US for Google and Microsoft, he was fascinated by the applications of blockchain attracting attention in the US and Europe. He immediately commissioned Deloitte to help the company examine the viability of a new business model based on the technology. By 2015, Xunlei was selling servers that allowed users to pool and rent out idle bandwidth capacity to others. The move reflected Mr Lei’s beliefs — ingrained from his stint as chief executive of Tencent’s cloud computing division — that global internet demand could be satisfied through networked servers, rather than corporate hosts. Leadership requires putting oneself through the mill time after time “The bandwidth used by companies will always be vastly exceeded by that of individual users,” he says. To incentivise users to rent out their unused space, Xunlei allocated virtual tokens to reward those who did. The tokens could in turn be traded with other Xunlei users in exchange for other Xunlei services. In October 2017, they began offering the questionably named Wanke Coin, a blockchain-backed token. (Wanke Coin was then renamed Link Token.) Such was the frenzy over bitcoin at that time that Xunlei’s stock surged 250 per cent within two weeks on the back of the launch. The shift from video streaming was timely. Starting last year, Chinese regulators ramped up policing of “inappropriate” online content, targeting viral video platforms on prominent sites such as Sina Weibo and Jinri Toutiao. At the same time, Wanke Coin quickly became one of the most-traded virtual tokens in China. By November, the intense speculation had drawn the ire of regulators who had banned bitcoin trading the month before. Xunlei quickly banned trading of Wanke Coin on other platforms and introduced anti-money laundering measures, but it is still facing a class-action lawsuit filed by investors, who allege the company issued false information that affected the stock price. Xunlei has denied Wanke Coin was ever a bitcoin-like cryptocurrency or portrayed as such. The company is contesting the claim. As Mr Lei, buffeted by both praise and criticism, watched Xunlei’s stock rise then fall, he says he reminded himself to stick to his plan: “Leadership requires putting oneself through the mill time after time.” He says Xunlei’s critics fixated on the company’s market cap as a way to measure his success. “Stock price does not have much value to a company. A company only needs a high stock price during two or three times, such as when they are raising capital,” he argues. “Any innovation business will be controversial early on, because many people will not recognise its value.” Users will become more and more respected and it will be difficult for them to be recklessly used by a big company These days, Mr Lei is working on OneThing Cloud, a multifunctional internet server which can “mine” or validate transactions for Xunlei’s virtual token. His utopian enthusiasm for disrupting existing internet architecture remains unabated. “The future I see is that every individual becomes more and more powerful,” says Mr Lei. “The computing resources will be controlled by a plurality, not a small group of companies. Because computing power is concentrated in the hands of many users, users will become more and more respected and it will be difficult for them to be recklessly used by a big company.” Those dreams could run up against another hurdle — technology restrictions between the US and China as trade tensions worsen. Mr Lei says he is reconsidering entering the US market. Long term, however, his vision has always been global. “Blockchain will let the user connections become increasingly diverse and free, and the demarcations between countries will in practice not be that important,” predicts Mr Lei. “[High tech] is reliant on ideas, new business models, the flow of information with users connected through the internet, and tariffs cannot block the ability of people worldwide to go online. The force of technology cannot be avoided.” This story was corrected on June 7: Xunlei’s cryptocurrency is called Link Token, not Link Coin","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Emily Feng","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-06-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f9c1422a-47c9-11e8-8c77-ff51caedcde6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F00abda5c-6802-11e8-aee1-39f3459514fd?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"CryptoKitties, CryptoPunks and the birth of a cottage industry","INTRO":"Blockchain technology hosts virtual art collections that cannot be replicated","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Seth Spalding, a portfolio manager at investment firm Passport Capital and a former vice-president of investment bank Goldman Sachs, is amassing an art collection. But you will not find paintings at his home in San Francisco, or sculptures in storage. The art Mr Spalding owns does not exist anywhere, as such. His carefully curated collection is digital — works that exist on the cryptographically secured technology known as blockchain. “The concept that we’ve all grown up with, about digital stuff, is that it’s ephemeral, it can be wiped off your hard drive . . . it’s worthless because it can be copied infinitely at incremental cost,” says Mr Spalding. “But blockchain allows you for the first time to create digital scarcity [which] tips the whole idea on its head.” Mr Spalding is part of a vanguard of enthusiasts curious about blockchain’s novel potential to affix value to digital art by making it rare and unreplicable. Riding a wave of interest in cryptocurrency, a new industry of digital collectibles sees blockchain art and other digital items created and traded for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, the digital money associated with the Ethereum blockchain. Among the cryptocurrency-wealthy there are willing buyers — one digital cat, which was part of a game called CryptoKitties, sold last month for the cryptocurrency equivalent of $140,000. Mr Spalding collects unique digital pictures called CryptoPunks — his favourite of the tiny pixelated faces has 3D glasses and a Mohican hair style — as well as Curio Cards, which are small digital artworks hosted on blockchain, often featuring graffiti styles and lurid colours. Recommended Computer gamers have been collecting virtual items inside games for years, spending money on better weapons, or gold to use in the digital world. Many gamers would, for example, spend money on “a costume or skin that you put on your character,” says David Pekar, co-founder and chief executive of Rare Bits, an online marketplace for blockchain items, which has raised $6m in a fundraising, according to TechCrunch. A “rare and beautiful” costume confers “gravitas as you move through the digital world”, he says. While you might pay for those items, however, you never exactly own them. Virtual swords could be deleted from the centralised server by the developers who made the computer game. Blockchain technology, by contrast, is decentralised, meaning no single entity controls it. If your digital item is stored on a blockchain, “the property that you buy actually holds a lot more value because it can’t be taken away from you”, says Mr Pekar — although it can be stolen by hackers. John Watkinson, a Canadian software developer who works for a small digital agency, was behind the first blockchain collectible project. “I had collected everything from hockey cards and magic cards when I was a teenager,” says Mr Watkinson. But creating the digital equivalent of paintings and baseball cards posed a difficulty: “Is it too easy to copy?” Mr Watkinson and his partner “stumbled across the idea of using blockchain” to make digital collectibles in early 2017. They created simple pixel faces, and wrote their code into tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Each of these CryptoPunk characters was unique, and because the cryptographic tokens cannot be copied, the CryptoPunks were safe from duplication. “I wrote a [CryptoPunk] generator,” says Mr Watkinson. “There are stock faces . . . including some rare ones like a zombie, ape and alien.” To that he added accessories including hats, sunglasses and earrings, with an algorithm that combines them. It was an experiment, he says. “We posted it to some of the forums and newsboards . . . initially we were giving it away.” After paying a small transaction fee, the CryptoPunk token would be transferred to your cryptocurrency wallet, the public blockchain record proving your ownership. We posted it to some of the forums and newsboards . . . by Saturday morning they had all been claimed. In one night everyone had gone crazy. Just 20 or 30 of the 10,000 free CryptoPunks were claimed that Friday. “We were starting to think, ah no, this doesn’t really have it,” he says. That changed when the website Mashable ran a story about the CryptoPunks. Mr Watkinson recalls that “by Saturday morning they had all been claimed. In one night everyone had gone crazy.” A secondary market quickly appeared, with buyers trading the tokens in exchange for ether. One sold on that Saturday for 10 ether, equivalent to, at that time, $3,500. “That was just sort of astounding,” says Mr Watkinson. The most expensive CryptoPunk yet sold was an alien, a rare variety that went for the equivalent of $16,000, according to Mr Watkinson. Newly minted cryptocurrency millionaires are a “pretty spendy crew”, he adds. “Not to compare our project with Andy Warhol, but it’s this kind of thing where people dismiss it because it seems easily copiable.” Yet other digital art and collectibles are growing on blockchains. CryptoKitties, which is also based on Ethereum, are attracting millions of virtual dollars and the websites DADA and the R.A.R.E. Digital Art Network are trying something similar. Elsewhere, the Rare Pepe Wallet facilitates the purchase of scarce Pepe memes — the green frog associated with the alt-right movement in the United States. At a rare digital art festival in New York in January, one image in a live auction — the Homer Pepe — sold for the equivalent of $39,000. But digital art has drawbacks. “You can’t easily hang it on your wall,” says Mr Watkinson. But he adds, “you don’t have to get Christie’s involved and 50 per cent of the value is gone to them if you sell it”. Actually, Christie’s does want to get involved. The auction house is holding a summit in July to “explore the potential applications of blockchain within the art market”, according to its website. One application is provided by Codex Protocol, a business that aims to store provenance documentation privately on blockchain. A cryptographic key would, in theory, allow an art piece’s holder to share information about the work with insurers or galleries who need to see documentation. This would make the art piece easier to trace and make its paper trail more secure, in a similar way to initiatives in use in the luxury watch market. “If it was just a database, people would have to still trust us,” says Jess Houlgrave, Codex’s co-founder and chief operating officer. “With Codex on the blockchain, even we can’t see it.” It is not clear how well blockchain art will hold its value but Mr Spalding is hopeful that his early entry into digital collecting will have historic value, at least. “Time is the ultimate blockchain,” he says.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Chloe Cornish","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-06-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/2b579948-47ce-11e8-8c77-ff51caedcde6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Ffaa5841a-6819-11e8-aee1-39f3459514fd?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Insurers hope blockchain will fill their sails","INTRO":"Industry could reduce costs by an estimated 30 per cent using the technology","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When Maersk’s container ships embark on their voyages around the world over the next few months, their hulls will be tracked and insured via a blockchain-based system. Blockchain will also be used to help decide how the ships will be insured if they sail through war zones. The shipping company has teamed up with the consultancy EY, insurers XL Catlin and MS Amlin and the broker Willis Towers Watson to create a system which, they hope, will lead to more efficient insurance policies that are more tailored to what Maersk needs. The system has come a long way since it was first tested last year. “What we have created is completely different from the proof of concept last March,” says Shaun Crawford, global insurance leader at EY. “We are not digitising processes. We are creating new business models.” The Maersk system is just one of dozens of blockchain initiatives in the insurance industry. The big incumbents, including Axa, Allianz and AIG, are working out how best to use it, as are a series of start-ups. They range from Blocksure and ChainThat, which are developing blockchain-based systems for insurers, to Buzzvault, which uses blockchain to store details of the possessions that its customers want to insure. Hopes for the technology are high. “Blockchain is a game changer,” says Gerhard Lohmann, chairman of B3i, a start-up formed by a group of 13 insurers. Recommended “Companies are now actively incorporating it into their capital allocation plans,” says Gerald Glombicki, a director at the rating agency Fitch Ratings. “A lot of time is being put into thinking about how it can transform the industry.” One of the big benefits of distributed-ledger technology is cutting costs. “The orchestration and automation that blockchain provides is a big efficiency,” says Craig Polley, founder of LimeStreet Digital Partners, a consultancy. That efficiency could take several forms. First, there is the convenience of all parties to an insurance contract — from the insurer to the broker and the policyholder — being able to see all of the documents in the same place, with changes being verified by all parties. That can save a lot of the time-consuming data re-entry that goes on across the insurance industry, and cut down on the risk of mistakes or misunderstandings in a contract. Blockchain can also make the claims process more efficient. This is especially relevant in cases where claims are straightforward. According to Mr Polley, “blockchain is most useful where there is no claims adjusting”. Fizzy travel insurance, offered by Axa, is an example of this in action. If a policyholder’s flight is delayed, the information is relayed automatically to the blockchain, which triggers a payout to the customer for the delay, taking out several stages in the traditional claims process. The potential for savings is big. B3i estimates that some insurers could cut 30 per cent off their costs by using blockchain. Consultants at BCG say that the property and casualty insurance industry as a whole could generate an extra $200bn of profits by using the technology. Despite all those potential benefits, and the many experiments under way, blockchain has yet to make a serious impact in the insurance world. It is past the trial stage, but not at scale yet “It is not being used at scale,” says Mr Glombicki. “It is past the trial stage, but not at scale yet.” Insurance companies are generally cautious when it comes to innovation. “The industry is in general seven to 10 years behind banking in adopting any sort of technology,” says Max Hauser, a partner at BCG. That reluctance could be even more stark for blockchain, which may require the insurers to put some of their data — one of their main assets — into a system that they do not entirely control. Added to that is the challenge of getting a consensus on which system to use. Blockchain in insurance will work well, say experts, only when everyone involved in a contract is signed up to the same infrastructure. “As long as the insurers are playing on their own with it, you won’t have a breakthrough as you are just replacing one technology with another,” says Mr Hauser. “The whole disruptive potential will only kick in once you go past the realm of your own company.” B3i is an attempt to solve that problem. Founded 18 months ago, it started life as an internal project at Swiss Re but rapidly expanded to become a consortium involving some of the biggest names in the insurance world, including Allianz, Zurich, Generali, AIG, Chubb and AIA. This year B3i has become a company in its own right, and is raising money to develop blockchain-based products for insurance. The first is a system for use in property catastrophe reinsurance, which should be ready in time for the January contract renewal season in 2019. “The catastrophe . . . market isn’t going to be the biggest, but it is a good place to start as it is simple, short-dated and easy to implement,” says Mr Lohmann. “We are using [it] as a test to prove the technology but we see much wider uses,” he adds. “In the next three to five years you are going to see quite significant developments.” Those developments, however, require insurers to sign up to the technology, and be prepared to put money into it. “It is a question of whether, rather than a question of when,” says Mr Hauser. “It’s not that we are not optimistic on the technology, but if you don’t get an industry consensus then the application of this technology might not be ground breaking.” Greg Brown, at the specialist insurance consultancy Oxbow Partners, is more sceptical. “While we have no doubt that it is an interesting technology, we do question to what extent it solves the insurance industry’s problems,” he wrote in a blog post. “Insurers should continue to focus on their challenges . . . rather than necessarily finding problems for blockchain to solve.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Oliver Ralph","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-06-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/0f03ac3e-47cc-11e8-8c77-ff51caedcde6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fe47b0c08-68ac-11e8-aee1-39f3459514fd?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain and cryptocurrency jargon buster","INTRO":"Bitcoin, Ethereum, mining — distributed ledger technology decoded","DETAILED_CONTENT":"These are some of the key concepts and terms to understand when talking about blockchain technologies. After the 2008 financial crisis, technologists wanted to create a financial system that existed without banks; a way for people to send a new type of money to one another, without any company or authority getting involved. That money became known as cryptocurrency, after the cryptographic maths that made it possible. The grandfather of the cryptocurrencies is bitcoin, which was envisaged by its pseudonymous creator (or creators) Satoshi Nakamoto as a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system”. Although bitcoin is the best known digital coin, more than 1,600 are on the market with more being created all the time. Ether, Ripple and Litecoin are among the better known of the growing list. The technique that bitcoin’s creators settled on to create decentralised digital money was a huge, public record-keeping system. Rather than being controlled by a single entity, the distributed ledger is spread across thousands of computers that work together to verify transactions. Blockchain is one type of distributed ledger, where hundreds of computers create a growing list, or chain, of time-stamped transactions that cannot be altered. Each new transaction is added as a “block” to the chain. Blockchain is attractive to many users because it offers a verifiable, immutable and public record. A network of connected computers work together to agree on a transaction history, crunching through cryptographic calculations to verify the transactions. This process of confirming the record is known as mining. In return for maintaining the record, or chain of blocks, miners are rewarded with new bitcoin, a system known as proof of work. The code underlying bitcoin determines that no more than 21m bitcoins can ever be created — 17m have so far been mined. There is about $15m worth of bitcoin available as a reward every day, which miners compete for. Blockchain’s proof-of-work system requires vast amounts of computing energy, so it is energy-intensive and slow. When bitcoin demand is at its highest, once-speedy bitcoin transactions start to take days rather than minutes to complete and incur high transaction fees from the miners. The more computational power that the miners can dedicate to verifying transactions, the greater their likelihood of being rewarded. Miners in countries with low electricity prices, such as Russia, China and Canada typically had an edge over the competition, although the Chinese crackdown on cryptocurrencies has damped activity in that country. Technologists are experimenting with alternative ways to achieve the same consensus between the computers that power bitcoin, a protocol called proof of stake. There are various techniques being tried, including voting systems, which should use less power. A faction within the online bitcoin community believed bitcoin should still act as cash, moving more freely between users rather than becoming an asset that people expected would gain in value. They split off the bitcoin blockchain, creating a new digital currency called bitcoin cash. It is important to note that even though blockchains are designed so that transactions are impossible to duplicate, the protocol which underlies the chain can be replicated so that two chains with the same structure run in parallel. The most important evolution of blockchain after bitcoin came from a then 19-year-old Canadian-Russian computer science student, Vitalik Buterin. He proposed a way to make a blockchain system more useful than simply moving value from one place to another. Mr Buterin showed that programmers could code functions into the blocks, often referred to as smart contracts. That meant you could build decentralised applications, or “dapps”, opening up the blockchain to a host of other possibilities. Games have become popular dapps. CryptoKitties, a game that allows you to collect, breed and trade virtual cats, is the most famous. However, there are relatively few applications that actually work yet and, like bitcoin, Ethereum’s blockchain is also liable to getting clogged up with transactions. Ethereum underpins many of the blockchain projects that sprung up last year. It allowed hundreds of new digital tokens to be produced — EOS, for example, has just raised $4bn in a token sale — creating a proliferation of cryptocurrencies that some traders have used as vehicles for speculation. Bitcoin gained a cult following of people who wanted to transfer cash to each other outside of the traditional money systems — sometimes because they valued privacy, at other times for illegal activities, such as buying drugs. While bitcoin is often referred to as anonymous because IP addresses are not connected to names, law enforcement bodies have identified drugs traffickers and other sellers of illegal goods by uncovering their bitcoin wallets and using the public record to track their transactions. Until recently, decentralised blockchain projects were generally open source, with developers collaborating on the public blockchains without necessarily being backed by a company. Now enterprises, which are by their nature centralised organisations, are increasingly interested in using blockchains. In contrast to the rebellious, decentralised spirit behind bitcoin, with these new blockchains companies are in control and reap most of the profits. But as businesses from banking to shipping are experimenting with their own purpose-built blockchains, there is deep scepticism over whether the technology can live up to the hype. Blockchain has proved difficult to scale and its use by corporations contains an inherent contradiction: blockchain was developed to be decentralised — without that, it becomes simply a less efficient database.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Chloe Cornish","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-06-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/6f138722-47d4-11e8-8c77-ff51caedcde6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fc78de4c4-681d-11e8-aee1-39f3459514fd?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain offers cure for patients’ fragmented medical records","INTRO":"System may give patients more control of their data, improve accuracy and cut costs","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Data is to modern medicine what the microscope was to enlightenment physicians, expanding our understanding of human biology and helping us to more skilfully heal the sick. Its biggest drawback is fragmentation. Hospitals, general practitioners and specialist clinics all use different electronic records systems, giving each one an incomplete visibility into a patient’s health history or treatment record. Blockchain has emerged as a possible solution to this problem. Distributed ledger technologies, such as the ones that underpin cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, have no inherent connection to money. They offer a way of decentralising information without compromising integrity and security. To date, health-focused blockchains are mostly confined to proposals and a scattering of pilots. One, led by MedRec, a project from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a prototype proof of concept at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. It used the Ethereum network to create so-called smart contracts that pulled patient data from different local storage systems and allowed separate medical practitioners to see it, if given permission by the patient. Healthcare blockchains have also been piloted in environments where medical records are hard to maintain. Refugees and migrants have little to no access to their medical history, and the humanitarian workforce that treat them is often transient. In May, start-up Iryo deployed blockchain-based electronic health records in refugee camps in Jordan, enabling people to store health data on their mobile phones, and take it with them. It plans to expand in Syria, Jordan, Iraq, Egypt and Djibouti. Recommended While patient care has attracted the most attention, blockchain is also being used to enable large-scale data collection for research. Machine learning tools can surpass humans in speed and accuracy of diagnosis but need vast amounts of training data, which can be hard to access without invading people’s privacy. Even when patients volunteer their data to be used in research, it can be hard to manage the large volumes of information securely and in a way that gives patients control over permission rights. BreastWeCan.com, a project that encourages women to share the results of their mammograms with medical researchers, uses blockchain to allow people to control their data and grant or deny permission for its use. Healthcare experts are cautious, however, about becoming too caught up in the hype. Blockchain itself is not sexy. This is like saying TCP/IP — the technology behind the internet — is sexy “Blockchain itself is not sexy. This is like saying TCP/IP — the technology behind the internet — is sexy,” says Navin Ramachandran, a radiology consultant at University College London Hospital. “Distributed ledgers are not a silver bullet to all our problems, but just like the technology behind the internet, I believe they are fundamental for data integrity and control,” says Dr Ramachandran, who is working with the IOTA Foundation, a German non-profit organisation that is developing distributed ledger technology. Some of the most practical uses are likely to come from medical professionals themselves, who often innovate from the front lines in response to problems they see during their work. Abdullah Albeyatti, a doctor at Leeds General Infirmary, built a website to standardise the paperwork for the discharge of patients — the documents in which doctors tell general practitioners what happened to their patients and the treatment they received. These often contained patchy information or were inconsistently completed by time-pressed junior doctors. T Dr Albeyatti’s standardised forms improved accuracy and lowered costs and so were adopted elsewhere, such as by the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich. Dr Albeyatti has now founded a blockchain-based start-up called Medicalchain, to create a way to securely share and store patient records. Proliferation is a problem, however. If multiple blockchain platforms spring up in healthcare, they could replicate the fragmentation bedevilling existing systems if they are not interoperable. Top-down orchestration from government agencies might help co-ordinate the industry, but is typically tough to execute. To avoid a spaghetti of blockchains, interoperability between them will be key. Dr Ramachandran, who was part of a team proposing a draft strategy to deal with the fragmentation of cancer information in the NHS, is hopeful that medical blockchains could be designed to work with each other. “We need an overall technical architecture, but one that accepts local differences,” says Dr Ramachandran. “So you can build a sandbox [a virtual space where new software is run safely] in each region, use similar technology so they can interoperate, and let local actors innovate within the constraints of that interoperability.” This story has been amended.

The industry has long been ripe for a shake-up. Supply chains are lengthy and complex, entailing multiple parties and, in many cases, several jurisdictions. Trust is low, dented by scandals ranging from the horsemeat scandal of 2013 in the UK to melamine-spiked milk that killed six babies and left hundreds of thousands of others sick in China in 2008. Blockchain is attracting interest as a way to track and monitor food through the supply network, ensuring its origin and that it has not been tampered with en route. “The general use case in regards to provenance, whether pharmaceuticals or food, is getting a lot of traction because of the usually problematic long supply chain from raw materials to the end consumer,” says Torsten Zube, the head of blockchain at software giant SAP. It also helps reduce costs and paperwork across logistics and financing, adds Thomas Olsen, a partner at consultancy Bain \u0026 Company. “Food is a great use case for blockchain,” he says. Walmart was among the early adopters and deployed blockchain to ensure the provenance and quality of pork in China, which is plagued by food-safety scandals. The US retailer subsequently teamed up with IBM and Tsinghua University’s National Engineering Laboratory for E-Commerce Technologies to create a blockchain food safety alliance. This aims to create a standards-based way of collecting data about the origin, safety and authenticity of food, using blockchain technology to track it in real time through the supply chain. Commodities groups have also spotted the attractions of a distributed ledger system when it comes to shipping foodstuffs across the globe, complete with paperwork such as letters of credit, customs clearance and other documentation. Thus HSBC’s trailblazing use of blockchain in trade finance concerned a cargo of soyabeans shipped from Argentina to Malaysia in May. By using the Corda blockchain platform, developed by the technology consortium R3, HSBC was able to process the relevant documents in 24 hours — and cut costs into the bargain. Recommended Walmart has also found blockchain can reduce tracking times dramatically: it takes just two seconds to trace a package of mangoes at any point from the farm to the store — previously it would have taken days or even weeks to work through the paper chain. One of the key reasons for deploying blockchain is to increase food safety. It was a large part of the message from Frank Yiannas, vice-president for food safety and health at Walmart, when he announced the alliance in December. Blockchain can increase accountability and transparency among the multiple suppliers, middlemen and retailers. When something goes wrong, the point in the chain — and the participant — can immediately be identified and verified. Also important is that blockchain allows parties to see the extent of any damage to goods: if, for example, cans of formula were tampered with at one specific warehouse, any recall can be restricted to products that passed through there. Provenance is another issue the food industry hopes blockchain can help solve: not just ensuring that the pork from black acorn-fed pigs does hail from a German forest rather than a cramped sty in southern China, but that neither child labour or trafficked workers were involved in the production process — be it children picking cocoa beans or shrimp fished by trafficked adults. Someone, or some process, has to change so that tuna fish or coffee beans can be tokenised and tracked from their origin Sustainability is another concern. Using registered entries to prove that tuna has not come from overfished waters, for example, or been caught in a way that harms other sea creatures. Monitoring suppliers and making sure what is recorded on the blockchain is accurate can be tricky. Provenance.org, a UK start-up that uses technologies such as blockchain to promote supply-chain transparency, has tried to simplify the process for fishermen. They are first registered by a local non-governmental organisation, and can then send simple messages by phone to register their daily catches. Putting a blockchain system in place is not just about technology. It requires small changes all the way through the logistics chain, such as sticking a tracking code on a hessian sack of coffee beans; something not always easy in hot and humid weather. “Someone, or some process, has to change so that tuna fish or coffee beans can be tokenised and tracked from their origin,” Mr Olsen says. Some novel solutions have been found. Borrowing a practice used in the diamond trade, one organic apple orchard is lasering its tracking code into its fruit. Recommended Other hurdles include standard setting, because all parties in a chain must use the same protocol and data formats. Ports, banks and commodities companies must also standardise protocols so that they can share files and transact on the same platforms. In some cases this requires regulatory changes to permit, for example, electronic bills of lading or letters of credit. Mr Olsen says achieving harmony on standards is a big hurdle. He adds: “[Big retailers] Carrefour and Walmart are driving this with large experiments because they are big. That works, as they are doing more than experiments now. “But for it to be [more widely] spread we’re going to need more standards from different suppliers and governments. That’s going to have to evolve. We’re starting to move from proof of concept to production cases, but it’s still piecemeal.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Louise Lucas","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-06-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/631af8cc-47cc-11e8-8c77-ff51caedcde6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Feb0a6490-68b3-11e8-aee1-39f3459514fd?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ripple and Swift slug it out over cross-border payments","INTRO":"More than 100 banks have signed up with the blockchain-based challenger but the incumbent is fighting back","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A rivalry is raging that looks set to decide how cross-border payments are handled for decades to come. It is a contest that encapsulates much of the debate about blockchain and cryptocurrencies, pitting a start-up company betting heavily on these new technologies against a long-established group arguing for more incremental change. In the blue corner is the challenger: Ripple, a California company created in 2012, promising to make payments faster, cheaper and more reliable using blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies. In the red corner is the incumbent: Swift, a 45-year-old interbank messaging service that handles half of the world’s high-value cross-border payments and is run as a co-operative owned by its thousands of member banks. Ripple caused a stir in the payments industry in April by teaming up with Banco Santander to launch a service based on its blockchain messaging technology that allows the Spanish bank’s customers in the UK, Spain, Poland and Brazil to send money in many currencies around the world. “There were some pain points experienced by our customers when making cross-border payments that we wanted to address with the new OnePay FX service,” says Ed Metzger, head of innovation, technology and operations at Santander UK. “We have had very positive feedback and good take-up. It gives the customer much more certainty over how much money will arrive in the destination account.” Santander is one of more than 100 financial institutions that have registered with Ripple to use its blockchain-based messaging system, known as XCurrent, which allows banks to co-ordinate the transfer of money between currencies in seconds. We are signing up a new financial institution as a customer every week “We are signing up a new financial institution as a customer every week,” says Asheesh Birla, senior vice-president of product at Ripple. The rise of Ripple and scores of similar blockchain-based payment companies represent a direct challenge to the longstanding dominance of Swift, a non-profit company based in a palatial country estate near Brussels. Blockchain — or distributed ledger technology — can be much quicker, cheaper and more certain in sending money between currencies than the traditional correspondent banking system on which Swift is based. Often transfers via Swift pass through multiple banks before reaching their final destination, making them time-consuming, costly and lacking transparency on how much money will arrive at the other end. Swift has responded to the threat by improving the efficiency of its own messaging system and carrying out its own tests on the potential of blockchain technology. Recommended “It is no secret that correspondent banking is a 1998 model and we are busy addressing that, bringing it to a 2018 model,” says Harry Newman, head of banking at Swift. “But in terms of speed, what problems are you trying to fix? We have our own cloud and API solutions and are already doing payments in minutes or even seconds.” Swift has launched an upgraded service, called Global Payments Innovation, which is being used by 165 banks. In some payments corridors, such as US-China, GPI accounts for four in 10 transactions. Mr Newman says the improvements mean that more than half of the payments on the GPI service are reaching their beneficiary within 30 minutes of being initiated. Correspondent banking is a 1998 model and we are busy addressing that, bringing it to a 2018 model. In terms of testing blockchain tools, Swift has found it hard to hide its scepticism. This year, Swift said a test carried out with 34 banks led it to conclude that it would be difficult to achieve the required scale with a blockchain system. To avoid confidential information being seen by rival banks, Swift says it would have to build more than 100,000 sub-ledgers to accommodate all its 11,000 member banks — making it impractical. “[Blockchain technology] is not straightforward to scale and it is not yet appropriate to do so,” says Mr Newman. “All the announcements [by banks about their blockchain payments projects] made to date, they are either in-house or bilateral projects between banks. As you bring scale you get escalating complexity.” Mr Birla at Ripple says that the company dealt with this scalability issue three years ago by allowing banks to connect “point to point like the internet” so that only the banks directly involved see the details. Another criticism of Ripple is that most banks use only half its solution — the messaging part — while shunning its XRP cryptocurrency, which is meant to be a cheap and universal bridge currency, providing an alternative to the expensive nostro and vostro accounts of correspondent banking. “If you don’t have money on the blockchain you are just doing a different kind of messaging system for correspondent banking,” says Mr Newman. “Currently cryptocurrencies are just not fit for purpose — they go up and down too much.” A solution may not be far away, however, as several groups are working to create so-called stablecoins — tokens on a distributed ledger backed by fiat currency on deposit at central banks. Circle, the cryptocurrency and payments group in Boston, is creating the USD Coin; a group of economists including Jacob Frenkel and Myron Scholes have launched the Saga token; and three Princeton University graduates have raised $133m from investors to create Basis. They all aim to avoid the volatility that has affected cryptocurrencies such as XRP. These developments are unlikely to cool the rivalry between Ripple and Swift. Their one-upmanship was underlined last year when Ripple tried to upstage Swift’s Sibos conference — a global financial services networking show — in Toronto by holding a parallel event in the same city with Ben Bernanke, the former US Federal Reserve governor, and Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web. The tit-for-tat tussle over blockchain’s role in cross-border payments is just getting started.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-06-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/bf9b8c04-4d0f-11e8-97e4-13afc22d86d4","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F14b10ec4-6400-11e8-bdd1-cc0534df682c?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Australia 2018: three case studies in legal expertise","INTRO":"Mortgage finance for home buyers, dispute resolution and Australian Securities Exchange plans for blockchain","DETAILED_CONTENT":"First finding, and then buying, a new home is a protracted and arduous experience. Australia’s REA Group has set out to remedy this by enabling online buyers to obtain approval for a mortgage directly through its platform. The digital property marketplace launched the joint property search and mortgage broking service with National Australia Bank (NAB) in September. REA, which operates in Australia, the US and Asia, believes it is a world first. Because the scheme involved handling detailed information, the mortgage approval tool had to be carefully built to comply with Australia’s Privacy Act and financial regulations. REA’s in-house counsel and lawyers at law firm Corrs Chambers Westgarth were therefore vital to its development. “There’s a bunch of financial regulation that was drafted for banking a very long time ago,” says Sarah Turner, REA’s general counsel. “You need to be able to work within those parameters and you need to be able to work in a way that’s best for the consumers and not for you or the bank.” At both REA and Corrs, the lawyers’ innovations were led by tech, which increasingly underpins legal expertise in Australia, one of the world’s most competitive legal markets. Usually, REA and NAB use and treat data differently. “We needed to mesh those ideas together to bring the experience to life,” says Ms Turner. “But the end result is that we can provide a clear indication of what someone can afford as they search.” REA believes the new tool will disrupt traditional loans for residential property in Australia. As chief executive Tracey Fellows put it in November, “that decision of how much money you can borrow is so inextricably linked to finding your place [to live]”. We didn’t draft an agreement and fit the work to it . . . as the work flexed, we followed iteratively Led by partner Justin Fox, Melbourne-based Corrs advised on and negotiated the relationship terms between REA and NAB. Corrs suggested a process-driven approach, whereby REA and NAB undertook the development work together and checked in at scheduled intervals. The project pivoted and changed as the engineers, developers and user experience team worked together. “We didn’t draft an agreement and fit the work to it. Rather, as the work flexed, we followed iteratively,” says Ms Turner. At MinterEllison, the Sydney-based law firm, an analytical tool helped to resolve a highly complex, very public dispute — in which claims totalled A$1.1bn — between the consortium behind the Wiggins Island Coal Export Terminal (Wicet) development in Queensland and engineering firms Monadelphous Engineering and Muhibbah Construction. The conflict, under way for years before MinterEllison stepped in on behalf of Wicet, related to many and varied disputes connected with the costs of a 1.8km approach jetty and ship berth. MinterEllison tasked a team of consultants — including forensic accountants, quantity surveyors, data analytics specialists, time experts and legal process outsource providers — to build a tool that lawyers could use to assess contractor claims against its documents and data, coupled with Wicet’s own information. It gave MinterEllison insight into where a contractor’s 1,200 staff were at any single point in time along with information about what job they were doing. Queries could be used at a detailed level to detect duplicate claims over resources including workers, plant and equipment, or for example if a particular worker was said to be present in two places at once. “The disputes were able to be settled on acceptable financial terms to Wicet in a short time period after sharing the tool and some of its outputs with the contractor,” says Andrew Orford, a partner at MinterEllison. New technologies such as blockchain, a distributed ledger used to track and record certain transactions, are being explored by some firms, as businesses start to harness the tech for use other than cryptocurrencies. such as bitcoin and ether. Gilbert + Tobin worked with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) on a blockchain project that will allow settlement and clearing transactions to be logged and recorded on a digital, decentralised, public ledger. G+T advised on the legal and regulatory framework for the platform, which will replace ASX’s Clearing House Electronic Sub-register System (Chess) with distributed ledger tech built by Digital Asset Holdings. G+T partner Simon Burns says his firm sees an opportunity to become one of the go-to law firms for blockchain. To develop its expertise, it has formed relationships with experts such as Taylor Gerring, co-founder of the Ethereum Foundation, which developed the ether cryptocurrency, as well as blockchain vendors such as IBM and R3. “We set out trying to develop our understanding of [blockchain] and then, on the back of that, develop our understanding of the potential legal implications and [related] things which flow from it,” says Mr Burns.

A great guy, even, if his Facebook followers are anything to go by: Thing is, great guys don\u0027t always have very well thought-out ideas. Mr Hughes has just written a paper published by FREER -- a new initiative from conservative think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs -- called \"Unlocking Blockchain: Embracing new technologies to drive efficiency and empower the citizen\", which was pitched to us as \"an enthusiastic call for government to embrace the opportunities of blockchain and associated technologies\". It\u0027s enthusiastic, alright. Here is an excerpt from the paper: A fundamental rewiring of public services. Tackling the trust deficit. A digital dividend. No shortage of buzz phrases here. But there doesn\u0027t seem to be a whole lot of meaning behind them. You might wonder, as we did, where this blockchain idea came from -- Mr Hughes was only voted into parliament for the first time last June, but he previously worked in the construction and housing sectors. So we called him up. Did he have a secret side-project in coding or cryptography? Not so much: (Bloxwich is one of the two major towns in Mr Hughes\u0027s constituency, which also happens to be one of the poorest Conservative areas in the country. Was there a reason for Bloxwich being a particular target, we asked? Nope, it\u0027s just that \"Blockchain for Walsall North wouldn’t have the same ring to it.\" ) Mr Hughes is a refreshingly candid and straight-talking MP. He admitted to not having technological expertise, acknowledged that blockchain might be all just a lot of hype, and even said it was possible he hadn\u0027t really understood it: But if he\u0027s not that sure about it, it doesn\u0027t seem like a great idea that he\u0027s just written a 36-page paper on the subject and has written think-pieces to be published today by the Telegraph and Huffington Post. Confusion breeds confusion, and there\u0027s plenty of that already in this space. Along with the paper, Mr Hughes is making several proposals, including for a \"public-facing Chief Blockchain Officer\" who could coordinate government work on blockchain across different departments and ministries, and for a \"blockchain departmental target\": \"a longterm aim for government departments to make a 1 per cent efficiency saving by embracing blockchain and other associated innovative technologies\". (The verb \"to embrace\" comes up in various forms 14 times in the paper.) The 1-per-cent efficiency savings sound nice. So where did that figure come from, we asked? Again, we got a pretty honest answer: nowhere particularly rigorous, although \"one of the things that would sit behind it would be comparisons to the Estonian model\". (Estonia has reportedly managed to save 2 per cent of its GDP per year in salaries and expenses by digitising its processes, and uses a digital identity system for ID cards called KSI Blockchain which has generated a lot of excitement. But as Attack of the 50-Foot Blockchain author David Gerard has pointed out, this was a rebrand -- the KSI system was started in 2007 and also, it doesn\u0027t even use blockchain.) You can\u0027t really blame Mr Hughes for being what he calls a \"crazy bullish enthusiast\" about blockchain technology when there is so much literature out there that propagates the idea that this is world-saving technology, without actually explaining how it will work. Nor is Mr Hughes the only one in government getting excited about blockchain. Fellow Tory MP Grant Shapps was to be found at a blockchain conference in London the week before last delivering a speech called Building a Blockchain Britain. And Theresa May, after Mr Hughes enthused about his blockchain paper at prime minister\u0027s questions, suggested he distribute the paper to all members of parliament.

Watches worth a total of more than £1m were stolen in central London in the first quarter of this year, some of them in brazen attacks by scooter-riding gangs brandishing sledgehammers and swords. The sheer size of the problem is reflected by the burgeoning databases of organisations such as the Watch Register, an offshoot of the Art Loss Register, which was set up 28 years ago to locate stolen works of art and reunite them with their rightful owners. “From when the Art Loss Register began in 1990 until the specialist Watch Register was set up in 2014, we amassed a database of 60,000 watches,” says Watch Register managing director Katya Hills. “But we have added more than 10,000 during the past 12 months alone.” The Watch Register is the largest UK-based database available to the trade and is a paid-for, “closed” service that is searchable only by register staff. It takes information about stolen watches from the police, insurers, dealers and private individuals, which remains on the database until the watch is recovered, regardless of how long that takes. For £2 dealers, jewellers and pawnbrokers can submit a search by sending the serial number, make and model of a watch by email or text. They should receive confirmation of whether the watch is registered as stolen within five minutes. Ms Hills says that running the database in this way prevents it from being used by criminals who could otherwise check whether a stolen watch they are holding is being looked for. When a watch is tracked down through the system, the register charges a 5 per cent “location” fee based on the piece’s value — or a not-insignificant 20 per cent to arrange the release of the watch from where it is being held and to reunite it with the owner. Last year, the Watch Register recorded its greatest success to date when London-based dealer Nadeem Malick was sentenced to 18 months in prison on two counts of “concealing and converting criminal property” after he tried to sell a £13,500 Rolex to another trader in the city’s Hatton Garden jewellery district. Before buying it, the trader checked the watch against the database, which revealed it had been stolen from a Mayfair watch store in 2016 during a £1.1m smash-and-grab by robbers who escaped on mopeds. Detective Constable Kevin Parley of London’s Metropolitan Police Flying Squad says a dramatic increase in the public’s interest in the luxury watch scene is partly responsible for the equally dramatic rise in thefts. Recommended “There has been a huge explosion in watch crime in recent years, much of it due to the fact that there are now many, many more dealers specialising in pre-owned models, but also because of increased brand awareness — for a long time, Rolex was the only name many people recognised,” explains DC Parley. He adds that Rolex remains by far the most stolen make, followed by Omega, Breitling, Tag Heuer, Breguet, Cartier and Patek Philippe. The problem of large-scale watch crime is not, of course, confined to the UK. The Watch Register, which works with a similar database called Safer Gems, last month recovered a Rolex in Germany that had been stolen from its Dubai-based owner while he was visiting a casino in Las Vegas. Two years ago, the service reunited a Swiss national with a Patek Philippe that had been snatched from his wrist in Naples and later surfaced in New York. The situation is leading to a steady growth in the number of commercial “finders” who offer to reunite owners with their missing timepieces. One of the fastest-growing services is MyStolenWatch.com, which was launched in early 2017 by 20-year-old student Fabio Giannone, whose family has been in the luxury watch business for 30 years in San Remo, Italy. There has been a huge explosion in watch crime in recent years, much of it due to the fact that there are now many, many more dealers specialising in pre-owned models In a similar fashion to the Watch Register it offers a free registration service for users to add technical details, photographs, the location at which a watch was lost or stolen and any police theft reports. The site charges €5 per search. The database covers more than 35 popular brands and, at the time of writing, featured 48 missing Audemars Piguets, 81 Patek Philippes, 197 Breitlings, 234 Omegas and 1,436 Rolexes. “I decided to launch the site after noticing the increasing number of suspicious watches that were being brought to my family’s shop,” explains Mr Giannone. A new database that uses blockchain technology is taking this one step further. ChronoBase records legal ownership and the entire provenance, service and sales history of a timepiece. Founded by German watch collector and former police officer Andreas Fleischer, the Dresden-based start-up launched in March. It raised more than $250,000 in a presale event by selling 3.5m crypto “tokens”, of a total of 100m that will be made available. Holders will be able to exchange these for access to its services. These include providing instant notification of thefts and revealing whether a watch is stolen or fake.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Simon de Burton","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-31","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/c03b699e-5918-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F12035fb6-591e-11e8-806a-808d194ffb75?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Santander shows potential of blockchain in company votes","INTRO":"Spanish bank points to way to improving annual meetings","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Santander has scored a digital coup: the Spanish bank has become the first company in the world to use blockchain to make it easier for investors to vote at an annual meeting. The eurozone’s largest bank by market capitalisation said it and Broadridge Financial Solutions, a technology company, ran a test at Santander’s annual meeting in March. Voting took place by traditional methods but they used blockchain, a giant online public ledger, to produce a shadow register. The bank said its pioneering move could help revolutionise corporate democracy. Investors at present often have to vote two weeks before a meeting to allow time for ballots to be counted. The process has been criticised, and some people claim that votes are frequently lost or that it is difficult for investors to vote outside their home market. Santander said the use of blockchain would speed up the process at annual meetings and make it easier for more shareholders to take part. Sergio Gámez, global head of shareholders and investor relations at Santander, said the annual meeting was “one of the most important corporate governance events” for a listed company. “In the case of Santander, having very fragmented capital, it is important to ensure the participation by investors and shareholders. This year using blockchain technology for the institutional vote has been a great help in terms of transparency and agility,” he said. The bank has more than 4m shareholders with 60.7 per cent of stock belonging to institutional investors. The proxy voting pilot, which was run in collaboration with JPMorgan and Northern Trust as custodian banks, included 21 per cent of those who participated in the annual meeting. Blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, gained prominence as the technology underlying cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, but it has attracted increasing attention from traditional banks, asset managers and other financial services companies. Santander has been one of the most active international banks in the area. Last month it launched a blockchain-based cross-border payments system and it has taken stakes in blockchain specialists such as Ripple and Blythe Masters’ Digital Asset Holdings. How did the 2008 financial crisis affect you? Last month its Spanish rival BBVA became the first global bank to issue a loan using the technology, while UK group HSBC this week completed the world’s first commercially viable trade-finance transaction using blockchain. Despite the rush of interest and several successful tests, however, some groups are sceptical about the potential to use blockchain at scale. This year, academics at Tilburg and Ghent universities said blockchain could offer “smart solutions for classical inefficiencies in the corporate governance field”, arguing that it could reduce costs for both shareholders and companies by modernising annual meetings. “Blockchain can . . . decrease the organisation costs for companies and increase the speed of decision-making, making the AGM a fast and lean corporate organ,” they wrote. Justin Chapman, global head of market advocacy and innovation research at Northern Trust, said one of its asset management clients took part in the Santander pilot. “We are excited about the next phase in creating end-to-end vote transparency using blockchain as an enabler,” he said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Attracta Mooney Nicholas Megaw","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-17","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/a3f24e26-5ace-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F4b9b29a2-25e8-11e8-9274-2b13fccdc744?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Banks and tech groups urged to join forces to deal with IT risk","INTRO":"Increasing use of cloud, AI and blockchain fuels concerns, says research paper","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Banks, technology companies and regulators should work together to find new ways of categorising risks emanating from burgeoning technology, which could affect a lender’s regulatory capital requirements, a new research paper urges. The explosion in the past two years in the banks’ use of the cloud, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology means lenders’ traditional ways of managing risks — and regulators’ means of supervising them — are outmoded, reads the paper by industry lobby group UK Finance and management consultancy Parker Fitzgerald. The paper, published days before sweeping EU legislation around data protection is introduced, argues that while these technologies bring efficiency and a way for banks to move off notoriously inefficient legacy systems, they also carry new risk. Regulators already force individual banks to hold more capital if they judge that they are exposed to more operational risk, which includes cyber security and how a lender manages its relationship with outsourcers. “As firms adapt so too must the regulatory principles under which they operate,” the paper stated. “This process should consider both how to achieve a consistent treatment internationally and also how capital charges could be evolved to place greater emphasis on the effective management of technology and cyber risks.” The paper comes as financial groups are increasingly storing their data in the cloud. They are also exploring how artificial intelligence and distributed-ledger technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, might inform business decisions and make transactions more efficient, from insurers using machine learning in calculating premiums, to clearing houses using blockchain to make the settlement of securities and derivatives quicker and cheaper. This has caught the attention of financial regulators, which are increasingly grappling with how to effectively supervise these new ways of doing business. Recommended Watchdogs are also worried about the concentration risk of three big tech companies, Microsoft, Amazon and Google, dominating cloud provision for the world’s biggest banks and insurers. Banks are also in an increasingly tense relationship with their tech providers as “this dynamic based on collaboration may well give way to a more competitive relationship in the future,” the paper said. Amazon offers payment services and loans for merchants on its website, while Facebook recently secured an electronic money licence in Ireland. Big tech’s scale and brands mean they can “monetise on insight with speed and scale”, the report said. The EU’s introduction of open banking, which forces lenders to provide access to accounts of customers who authorise it, has also left senior bankers worrying that tech groups will cherry-pick the best parts of their business. Meanwhile, regulators have typically viewed cloud provision as a traditional outsourcing arrangement, requiring physical on-site visits to data centres. The paper argues that is an increasingly archaic approach: Microsoft, for instance, is experimenting with storing servers at the bottom of the Pacific to help cool them because of their energy-intensive processing power.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Caroline Binham","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-21","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/5a9d757e-5836-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F71dbb254-5864-11e8-806a-808d194ffb75?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"MBA view: will bitcoin regulation undermine its value?","INTRO":"Business school students discuss the future of cryptocurrencies","DETAILED_CONTENT":"HSBC this week completed the world’s first commercially viable trade-finance transaction using blockchain, the shared ledger technology. Blockchain also powers cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are coming under increasing scrutiny, with calls for them to be regulated. Bitcoin is the biggest of them. Some people claim regulation will lead to greater transparency and safer investments. Others argue it will undermine its value and decentralised character. We asked MBA students from some of the world’s top business schools for their views. Join in the discussion in the comments below. Regulation might have a “decoupling effect” on bitcoin and blockchain. Bitcoin could initially suffer from restrictions, but such rules may also be seen as an inevitable requirement for entering the real economy. Developments which create negative sentiment around cryptocurrency should be expected to have an adverse price impact On the other hand, regulation could implicitly legitimise and push applications of blockchain in other sectors, mainly commercial and industrial, as the recent HSBC first trade-finance deal seems to show. The future appears promising for an enabling technology like blockchain. Bitcoin’s success, meanwhile, will depend more on the framework, if any, that lawmakers decide to put in place. The lack of regulation is a large part of the appeal of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This appeal derives from a mistrust of central banks and governments. But many people are suspicious of bitcoin because of this lack of regulation. Bitcoin is being used in a wide spectrum of criminal activities, such as money laundering and tax evasion. Regulation would provide a veil of legitimacy and respectability to bitcoin, but the real impact on bitcoin’s value will depend on the breadth and depth of any new rules. The clarity offered by regulation would probably increase the perceived legitimacy of virtual currencies. My vote is for regulation [acting like a] speed-bump in the short term, but an incentive in the longer term, boosting value and offering protection for investors. Speculation around regulation will probably cause greater volatility in the bitcoin price than actual implementation. When investors are unsure about the legitimacy of their cryptocurrency and how they are going to be taxed when they sell it, they will probably avoid or at least hold it until clarification is given. Regulation could come in a number of forms, from reducing anonymity through demanding real names on bitcoin holdings and transactions, to outright bans (as in India). The trends in South Korea, with an initial plunge followed by a levelling out as the effects were clarified, is likely to offer a framework for other regions. The UK could do worse than following Japan’s lead, developing regulations that support the healthy growth of the technology. Bitcoin’s price is driven by speculation from investors that either have a deep belief in blockchain technology or are seeking short-term capital gains. Any developments that create negative sentiment around cryptocurrency should be expected to have an adverse price impact, including regulation. Recommended Ultimately the value of bitcoin will not be determined by regulation, but its utility in real world applications, including as a payment system or as a store of value. In the long term, regulation could be positive for cryptocurrencies as it will help to legitimise them as an asset class and provide protection for investors, accelerating their adoption. Just because the underlying blockchain technology has value, it does not necessarily mean that bitcoin has value. Factors such as volatility, regulatory pressures and lack of an intrinsic value prevent bitcoin from being a credible currency. The value of bitcoin is derived from an idea of decentralisation, so the inclusion of counterparties or regulatory bodies that force regulation and control defeats its purpose. But amid growing concerns over manipulation of value through questionable practices and companies’ increasingly leveraging initial coin offerings to raise funds, regulation seems unavoidable. However, bitcoin represents a very minuscule portion of the potential of blockchain technology. The shared ledger technology is already being adopted by a number of industries and could proliferate through financial services, the public sector, retail and manufacturing.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nassia Matsa","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-16","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/39c91b6a-57cc-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fe2073ade-5793-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"A match made in Silicon Valley: can blockchain reinvent dating?","INTRO":"‘Researchers would take the anonymised data and design algorithms to match couples’","DETAILED_CONTENT":"I rolled my eyes when I first heard about Luna, described as “blockchain for dating”. In Silicon Valley, “blockchain for x” is the new “Uber for y” as start-ups embrace the idea of digital ledgers. On Wall Street, the Securities and Exchange Commission has warned companies to stop “pivoting to blockchain” to boost their stock. So Luna sounded like a gimmick. But when Facebook announced its plan to enter the online dating market, I took a closer look. More and more people now meet online, but singles on dating apps are increasingly frustrated by a system that encourages a “swipe culture”. Many swipe through photographs, almost like sport. The process can be dispiriting, with people failing to reply to messages from matches and frequently failing to show up “in real life”. New dating apps are trying different tactics to create more lasting connections. Facebook will ask people to choose events they want to go to before selecting dates from among a group of other participants. Waving has scrapped the photo altogether, replacing it with voice messages, in an effort to avoid fake profiles and inspire a more imaginative approach. Sweatt encourages the fitness-obsessed to make dates for workouts, with a profile that includes how often you work out and when. Luna turns out to be the most intriguing, despite the fact it hasn’t even launched yet. It does, however, have a “white paper”. This starts with a discussion of the development of rituals around exogamy (the custom of marrying outside your tribe). It argues that humans used to devote huge time and energy to finding the right partner. Now, we want it to be as easy as possible — yet this convenience does not seem to be making people happy. Ultimately, Luna wants to “remake dating culture”. Using our online interactions, it would like to dive deep into the data to understand what makes a successful match. “Luna is not a service or a place, like Tinder or a bar. Luna is a method, and a method which can be continually improved using techniques like A/B testing, until it is genuinely producing better lives for people,” the white paper says. By using blockchain technology, it hopes to make anonymised data open to researchers, who will be able to design algorithms to match couples. Andre Ornish, Luna’s founder, says he is already speaking to social psychologists about how they could use the data to spot patterns that could lead to “higher-fidelity matches”. Maybe the “time of omnipresent big data” can help us know ourselves better, he suggests. “Dating requires a great amount of introspective ability, to know who you are, what you want and how to communicate that to someone.” Men significantly outnumber women on most dating sites and attractive women receive far more messages than anyone else. According to Luna’s white paper, if Tinder were an economy, with the proportion of right swipes (indicating you like someone) instead of money, it would have a higher Gini coefficient, the economists’ favoured measure of inequality, than 95 per cent of countries in the world. To try to solve the imbalance in dating-app messaging, Luna has created the Star, a token that users will be able to purchase on cryptocurrency exchanges or earn by actions taken within the app, such as replying to messages within 36 hours. A user can limit the number of messages he or she receives a day, but a wooer who is really keen on reaching them can add more stars to a message to bump him or herself to the top of the recipient’s queue. The stars can either be pocketed as cash or donated to charity within the app. If Luna’s algorithm thinks a pair are a great match, they get a discount to encourage them to message each other. Stars should discourage people from spamming each other with “copy and paste” messages. It’s certainly a lot more complicated than Tinder. But by using data and algorithms to better understand lifelong compatibility, Luna’s heart seems to be in the right place.

The Facebook founder was lamenting how, with the rise of a small number of big tech companies — not least his own — many people believe technology only centralises power, rather than decentralises it. The remarks were largely read at the time as a riff on the political controversies engulfing his social network, but Mr Zuckerberg also vowed to explore “counter-trends” to centralisation, such as encryption and cryptocurrency. A few months later, that exploration appears to have stepped up a gear. Mr Zuckerberg last week appointed one of his most senior lieutenants, David Marcus, to head a team to experiment with blockchain, the decentralised digital ledger technology that is exciting everyone from start-ups to big banks. Blockchain promises a new way to record transactions, including the transfer of cryptocurrency and other digital assets, without having to go through a central authority, such as Facebook’s own servers. What the company has not done is say anything, in public at least, about what Mr Marcus and his team will be doing — leaving others in the blockchain world to speculate, and poring over Mr Marcus’s CV for clues. The 45-year-old executive has been given his new assignment after a stint in charge of Facebook Messenger. Before Facebook, he was president of PayPal, the online payments company, and he also sits on the board of Coinbase, a US cryptocurrency exchange. Facebook could use the technology for payments on the social network, by creating its own cryptocurrency, blockchain experts say. It could use it to try to improve privacy, by giving users a new way to own and control their personal data. Or it might think blockchain will help it fight fake accounts and provide more services by giving users a way to prove their identities. One particular threat of blockchain to Facebook could come from people building a decentralised alternative that rewards users with a new cryptocurrency for posting on their platform. “You’ll learn a lot about what Facebook is by what they think they are going to do with some of these technologies,” said Brewster Kahle, a digital librarian and activist trying to help build a decentralised web. Facebook first dabbled in blockchain research led by Morgan Beller, a corporate development executive, last year. The exploration of blockchain is about more than satisfying Mr Zuckerberg’s curiosity, or returning to his youthful dreams of giving power to the people. Facebook has long been focused on potential competitive threats, even very long-term ones, and has often moved quickly to squash them. In the case of Instagram and WhatsApp, it bought the competition. It copied hashtags and public posts from Twitter and the “Stories” photo collection format from Snap. Blockchain cannot be bought but it can be harnessed, and Facebook may be investing in research in case a competitor uses the technology to become a threat. Spencer Bogart, a partner at Blockchain Capital, which invests in blockchain companies and cryptocurrencies, predicted Mr Zuckerberg will want to make sure he is prepared for competition even if “there might not be an obvious and immediate slam dunk for Facebook in the space”. And competitors do seem to be moving. Telegram, the encrypted messaging app with 170m users — a rival to Facebook’s WhatsApp — recently raised $1.7bn through the sale of its own cryptocurrency. Telegram says it is planning to build its own blockchain. Mr Bogart said the sale “clearly stirred waves” at Facebook, pushing them to invest more heavily. There are other social apps exploring blockchain, too, including Kik, an ad-free messaging app. It launched its own digital token and said it started work on a blockchain-based payments system last year. Steemit, a social media platform, pays users in a cryptocurrency called Steem to produce content. It remains unclear if any of these blockchain or cryptocurrency projects will bear fruit, but Sheila Warren, head of blockchain at the World Economic Forum, said she thought starting a lab to investigate blockchain was a “really smart move” for Facebook. She said the company could look at creating a coin that would allow “micropayments” on the site, which could lead to an “explosion of applications”. Some publishers who feel that Facebook profits unfairly from their stories might welcome a way to charge readers. In the wake of revelations that Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained the personal data of up to 87m Facebook users, the social network could also consider blockchain as a way to give uneasy users more control over their data. A different social network that is able to help people control their data may grow into a significant threat to Facebook, Ms Warren said. “One of the things blockchain is good at doing is creating trust where trust doesn’t exist.” Blockchain could be used to create smart contracts around who can receive personal information over the Facebook platform. “You set the permissions in such a way that if you say for cat videos, you can take all my data, but for music videos, you can only take my screen name, it is self-executed automatically,” Ms Warren explained. Facebook could also zero in on how to prove your identity online, using blockchain for a public key to match your private information. This is a function that would be useful for today’s social network where people are still able to spread hate speech and engage in terrorist recruitment. Detractors point out that Facebook has so far been the opposite of a decentralised network implied by blockchain.

He was referencing Sir Mix-A-Lot\u0027s early 90s classic Baby Got Back (NSFW music video here). Thing is though, unlike Sir Mix-A-Lot and his pals, Nguyen and the rest of the BCH army aren\u0027t doing so well on getting their hands on the big stuff they so lust after. Bitcoin cash\u0027s blocks -- the bundles of transactions that are processed, hashed and then stored on the blockchain -- aren\u0027t actually very big at all. Although their maximum size is 8MB, they are currently on average only using one 160th of that capacity: around 50 kilobytes, according to industry data provider BitInfoCharts. Thats because people aren\u0027t really using bitcoin cash. It therefore seems a little odd that its developers have said they will implement a fourfold increase in the maximum block size later today to 32MB, or around 640 times its current average. Samson Mow, chief strategy officer at Blockstream -- a company that\u0027s funding bitcoin cash arch-enemy bitcoin core -- summed up the strategy rather nicely with this tweet last week: “Guys, no one\u0027s using our 8 lane highway.” “We need 32 lanes.” “You’re a genius.” #Overheard #TransactionSuperhighway #Bcash pic.twitter.com/RriMsWlz33 Bitcoin cash\u0027s insistence on block-size expansion despite the lack of demand necessitating one is just the latest example of the sheer absence of reason in the crypto space, and also highlights the ideological and politicised nature of much of the decisionmaking. As financial blogger Frances Coppola pointed out in a post on Friday, the debate between the two bitcoin factions has become something more akin to a religious war than any kind of serious conversation over how best to develop the technology. Bitcoin cash split away from the original bitcoin -- which the BCH army calls “bitcoin core” so as to distinguish itself as the true “bitcoin” -- in August last year, after a bitter row over how best to scale up the bitcoin blockchain so as to allow for more transactions. Both sides believe their version is the true fulfilment of pseudonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto\u0027s original vision. Although bitcoin cash was not adopted by the majority of the bitcoin network -- and is therefore effectively an “altcoin” like dogecoin or litecoin -- it does have some heavy-hitting backers, who believe in BCH with a zealous fervour. Those backers include the man once dubbed “Bitcoin Jesus”, Roger Ver, and Craig Wright, the man who said in 2016 he was able to prove he was Satoshi and then said he wasn\u0027t, who also happens to be chief scientist at nChain. But bitcoin cash\u0027s main problem is the opposite of the one it is providing a solution to. It\u0027s not suffering from too many transactions, which might necessitate a block size increase; it\u0027s suffering from too few. There are more daily transactons in Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency based on a dog meme that was created as a joke, than bitcoin cash. Here\u0027s how the daily transaction numbers stack up for bitcoin cash versus dogecoin and bitcoin core, from data provider BitInfoCharts. (That\u0027s bitcoin cash in red at the bottom, with about ten times fewer transactions than bitcoin, which has a maximum block size of 1MB, and which as we have written many times before, is itself also very rarely used as anything more than a means of speculation because of its multiple deficiencies as a means of payment.) So little is bitcoin cash transacted, that one major exchange called OKEX decided to close trading in it last month, citing “inadequate liquidity”. So why are bitcoin cash\u0027s developers expanding its size? Tim Swanson, founder of tech consultancy Post Oak Labs, told us the following: By convincing us that bitcoin cash is the internet currency of the future, its backers hope that its price will rise. As we have pointed out before, this is one of crypto\u0027s most problematic contradictions -- if you want it to be used as a currency to buy goods and services online with (totally legitimate ones of course), you can\u0027t simultaneously treat is as an asset to HODL. The crypto world still doesn\u0027t seem to have grasped this. Shortly after making his Sir Mix-A-Lot reference, Mr Nguyen sought to reassure the attendees of the Exeter panel that the price of bitcoin cash would “stabilise” over time as it became more “usable”: Confused? Us too.

The UK-based bank said the blockchain trade, which processed a letter of credit for US food and agricultural group Cargill, had shown the platform was ready to be commercially adopted across the industry. The introduction of blockchain, which underlies cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, is expected to shake up the centuries-old trade-finance industry, reducing the numerous documents and several days of processing needed for a single transaction to a paperless task that can be completed in hours. The distributed ledger technology behind blockchain has the potential to be used for encrypted and unhackable record-keeping across a range of industries, from property registration to medical records and insurance claims. “The next stage is actually encouraging as many participants as possible to sign up to the utility,” said Vivek Ramachandran, head of innovation and growth for commercial banking at HSBC, noting that banks, shipping companies, ports and customs operations would have to take up the same technology before it could gain widespread usage. “We don’t envisage the platform as anything other than a utility.” In trading hubs around the world, banks such as HSBC still operate trade-finance floors filled with stacks of paper documentation for trade. Blockchain transactions will greatly reduce these operations in the coming years, Mr Ramachandran said. HSBC took in $2.52bn in trade-finance revenue last year, making it one of the world’s largest banks in the industry. The transaction for Cargill was for a shipment of soyabeans from Argentina to Malaysia last week. HSBC used the Corda blockchain platform, which was developed by technology consortium R3. Dutch bank ING, which has also adopted the technology, was a counterparty on the deal. Unlike previous test transactions, the one for Cargill could be replicated if the same counterparties were involved, Mr Ramachandran said, showing that the technology is ready for commercial use. He likened the advent of blockchain trade finance to the usage of standardised shipping containers, which were slowly adopted by ships, ports, railways and trade companies over several decades to eventually become the primary mode for global shipping. In much the same respect, counterparties to trade finance — such as banks, ports and traders — must all adopt common platforms and standards for blockchain trade finance, something that Mr Ramachandran says will play out over the next five years. A number of banks and companies over the past year have experimented with platforms for fully digital processing of trade documents, and some have launched pilots for live trade transactions. But widespread adoption of the technology will still face challenges as companies and banks attempt to make their pilot projects fit in with the bustling world of global trade, said Gadi Ruschin, chief executive at Wave, an Israel-based start-up developing bill-of-lading products using blockchain. Many of the products currently under development around the would fail, he predicted. “The blockchain is only an enabling technology for different products and each product should be evaluated in many aspects before evaluating the chances for adoption — technology, regulations, cost of the service, security but the most important one is the product market fit,” Mr Ruschin said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Don Weinland","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-13","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/bf6b87ef-7efa-3483-90fa-4dd26ba8e5c7","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcct-images.ft.com%2Fproduction%2Fa545b19e-d9c2-4940-83f3-7f61f88e2703_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Stop getting The Flintstones wrong","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"There\u0027s a lot of sense in Nouriel Roubini\u0027s column for Project Syndicate on ICO flimflam and it\u0027s all undone by one big mistake: No. This is wrong.

Clam shells are subdivisory units of the sand dollar (1), which commonly trades for goods and services either in the form of a flower-like token (2) or a paper bill that closely resembles the US dollar (3). The Flintstones franchise gives a clear and consistent representation of a fiat monetary system where shells and sand dollars themselves have no intrinsic or representative value (4), but exist within a sophisticated economy that includes a banking system (6), a shadow banking system (7) and an insurance system (8). Clams function as the system\u0027s standardised, centralised, universally accepted, frictionless, low latency and fully fungible stores of value (5).

Now enthusiasts think blockchain could have a similar effect. On Monday HSBC trumpeted the world’s first commercially viable trade finance transaction using the technology. This could boost trade by hundreds of billions of dollars by slashing costs, thinks HSBC. Such breathless talk invites scepticism. Crypto-phobes note that several blockchain projects adopted by big financial institutions have already been shelved. They can also point to reputational risks. Blockchains are pieces of software originally built to handle transactions of controversial virtual currencies like bitcoin. The reality is both more prosaic and more promising. The distributed ledger technology used in the HSBC transaction was not, strictly speaking, blockchain. True, it uses independent computers to record, share and synchronise transactions. But there are some important differences. It uses less computer power and can be more easily scaled up than blockchain. It is not truly open. Users are required to authenticate themselves. Perhaps the technology’s biggest benefit is that everyone with access to a ledger can see the same, up-to-date version. It took 24 hours for HSBC to process documents needed for a shipment of soyabeans. The process normally takes at least five days. As well as being speedier, the digital system will cut costs. For blockchain to realise its potential, banks, companies and regulators have to embrace common platforms and standards. While that could take years, it should not be a deterrent. In the case of the shipping container, the main breakthrough was overcoming social obstacles to adoption. Those modernising finance can also expect barriers. But the promised benefits make it worthwhile. HSBC has provided a small proof point for another thesis. A boundary has inched forward.

The plan will be trialled this month with a digital token sale backed by Siberian diamonds. Investors can buy a share in a diamond for as little as $10. Advertised as a secure means for people to buy into commodities in affordable and easily tradeable units, the deals have been described by experts both as the future of investment and a major risk to investors. In the coming months, experimental transactions such as these are set to test the limits of cryptocurrency innovation, as well as regulatory tolerance for them. “We think we have several trillion dollars’ worth of valuables in Russia’s far east” that could someday be tokenised, said Alexei Chekunkov, chief executive of the Far East Development Fund, an investment arm of Russian state development bank Vnesheconombank. Tokenised assets are traded via digital tokens on online exchanges. Instead of receiving physical assets, investors receive a digital receipt that represents their holdings. The price and ownership of the asset are recorded on a ledger that cannot be tampered with, making the transactions secure. The technology, often called blockchain, is the same that underlies the $150bn cryptocurrency market for bitcoin and the latest surge in initial coin offerings. Mr Chekunkov said the same principles would eventually allow Siberia to sell everything from natural gas to fish. “Asset-backed tokens, for diamonds or Venezuela’s petroleum, are exploring the conceptual space of what’s possible with blockchain,” said Lex Sokolin, global director of fintech strategy for London-based Autonomous Research. “They are a rudimentary first step.” The diamond sale joins a handful of similar test projects around the world, including a gold-backed token in Malaysia called HelloGold, and one launched by the Venezuelan government in February that tokenised some of its petroleum reserves into $5bn of so-called “petro” coins, later banned by the US. The early iterations of asset-backed tokens have been criticised in some quarters as risky bets, mainly because they require third parties, such as auditors, to make the crucial link between the digital asset and the real one. A number of outside parties must “verify that the digital token is, in fact, backed by the same value of assets or currency as is purported”, law firm Jones Day said in a white paper, something that allows room for fraud. The diamond token, called D1, has tried to address those concerns. The company issuing the token, Singapore-based diamond group Diamundi, said the value of its diamond stock would be audited monthly by a Big Four accounting firm and held in the vaults of Israeli custodial group Malca-Amit, steps that would ensure the safety of the asset and accurate valuation of the coin. The Russian fund will source the diamonds from Siberia but is not involved in the issuance of the token. “The key for these tokens will be to find a good custodian,” said Rocky Mui, a consultant at the Clifford Chance law firm in Hong Kong, adding that several traditional custodial companies were looking at the cryptocurrency industry. “It’s still in an early stage but tokenisation could be the future,” Mr Mui said, adding that a perfected model would open a vast range of asset classes to ordinary investors around the world. He acknowledged, however, that “there are big regulatory questions”. Robin Lee, chief executive of HelloGold, which issued gold-backed tokens last year, said the Kuala Lumpur-based company was not affected by local Malaysian regulation other than those concerned with the import and export of gold. But digital tokens are traded globally and HelloGold could attract attention from other regulators. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, for example, has classified asset-backed tokens as securities that will be regulated. “If regulators go down this path, they will end up regulating Patek Philippe and jewellery stores,” Mr Lee said. HelloGold, which says it is compliant with Islamic law, already claims 18,000 investors in Malaysia. Investors can buy in for just RM1 ($0.25). Recognition of such products by traditional institutional investors is still far off. “I think the backing of tokens by other asset classes brings to surface several issues,” said Marc Geary, managing director at Hong Kong-based family office Major Domus. “First, if we want to invest in diamonds or gold, we’ll go and get diamonds or gold, without an intermediary.” The operational risk associated both with the token issuer and the structure of the investment present other challenges that many professional investors will still be reluctant to take on at this early stage, Mr Geary said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Don Weinland Krithika Varagur","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/8c5a44e8-4878-11e8-8ae9-4b5ddcca99b3","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F05eea2aa-48aa-11e8-8ee8-cae73aab7ccb?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BBVA issues corporate loan using blockchain","INTRO":"Spanish lender becomes first global bank to use the technology for corporate loans","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Spain’s BBVA has become the first global bank to issue a loan using the distributed ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies and has the potential to revolutionise banking processes. BBVA said it carried out the entire process for a €75m corporate loan — from negotiating terms to signing the loan — on a mutually distributed ledger that kept both the bank and borrower up to date on the loan’s progress. The process cut the negotiation time for the loan from “days to hours” and BBVA hailed it as a “significant advance in the exploitation of [distributed ledger] technology” not just in banking but in the way private and public blockchains can interact. “Blockchain can offer clear advantages for all sides in the corporate loan market in terms of efficiency, transparency, security,” said Carlos Torres Vila, BBVA chief executive. “It’s another strong example of how disruptive technology can be used to add value to financial services, something that is central to our strategy.” Recommended He added that the bank had “several more transactions in the immediate pipeline”, in addition to the pilot completed with Spanish telecoms company Indra, which describes itself as “at the vanguard” for blockchain applications. Borja Ochoa, Indra’s director of financial services, said blockchain was “destined to become one of the technologies that will change the way we interact with products and financial services” and that the pilot “strengthens the position of BBVA and Indra as leaders in the practical application of blockchain technologies.” Blockchain is regarded as one of the most promising fintech themes for banks and has a broad range of applications across payments, clearing and settlement, trade finance, identity and lending. The main advantage of blockchain over existing processes is its ability to speed up and simplify complex transactions by making changes and updates immediately visible to all parties. A single blockchain-based system is also cheaper to maintain than the myriad of systems banks use for transactions now. In the lending market, blockchain has more potential in corporate and syndicated loans than in consumer loans, because corporate and syndicated lending is more complex and records need to be accessed by a broader range of people than the single borrower typically involved in consumer loans. For its pilot project, BBVA used a private blockchain for the negotiation and completion process, and then registered the completed contract on Ethereum’s public blockchain. “BBVA is involving its clients in project processes such as requirements definition, development and implementation,” said Ricardo Laiseca, BBVA’s head of global finance for corporate and investment banking. “In this way, BBVA provides its customers with not only the best financial solutions, but also the most advanced technical and innovative capabilities.” BBVA, which reports first-quarter earnings on Friday, is also working on blockchain initiatives for international payments, international trade and foreign exchange. The bank, and its septuagenarian executive chairman Francisco González, has been a zealous adopter of new technology and business models, and has invested in a number of new ventures including the UK’s Atom Bank and German fintech solarisBank.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Laura Noonan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-04-25","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/e7e6effc-d071-3898-9d12-06439fe2bb92","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcct-images.ft.com%2F4566528f-6a61-4377-bebd-e40cc1e9a1b7.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain insiders tell us why we don\u0027t need blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"We\u0027ve written before about how blockchain is a belief system, complete with prophets, disciples, traitors, rituals and schisms. But recently, faith in the technology appears to be ebbing. Normally, we would have to make our own arguments - or at least turn to other cynics - to explain why this might be happening. This time, we find ourselves able to turn to blockchain insiders themselves to undermine the technology. Yesterday, a panel of blockchain experts gave evidence on the technology to the British Parliament\u0027s Treasury Select Committee. The panel included Ryan Zagone, director of regulatory relations (yes, that\u0027s apparently really a job title) at Ripple, the company behind the ultimate leap-of-faith-demanding centralised digital currency, XRP. Mr Zagone gave the committee the usual spiel about the need for a bridging currency for cross-border payments (which we\u0027ve previously debunked). He also told us that 120 financial institutions had signed up to “the Ripple network”. And then he said: That\u0027s right! No bank is using the digital currency designed for banks. That doesn\u0027t stop it currently being assigned a market value of $32.5bn (more than Twitter\u0027s market capitalisation). Also on the panel was Chris Taylor, chief operating officer at Everledger, a company that is trying to use the blockchain to track (and miraculously “protect”) diamonds and other assets. Here\u0027s an excerpt from his contribution: He said it, not us. A blockchain is the same as any system. If you feed garbage into it, it will feed garbage back out to you. And if you accidentally feed garbage into it, you can\u0027t change it, because immutability! Mr Taylor continued: Compelling stuff, no? And then there was was Dr Grammateia Kotsialou, a blockchain researcher at King\u0027s College London, whose current work is focused on “designing voting systems with good properties applicable to the new emerging technology of distributed ledgers (blockchain)”. She said: And poof! Just like that, she has eviscerated the entire argument for using blockchain to combat voter fraud. (Keeping a permanent record of the final result is not only possible without blockchain, but also doesn\u0027t really strike us as the key issue here.) The final person on the panel was a little different: Martin Walker, director of think tank the Center for Evidence-Based Management, who believes there is “little to nothing” in terms of demonstrable benefits from the technology. Mr Walker has spent most of his career working in IT in banking and formerly worked at R3, a “blockchain for business” consortium that most of the major banks are members of. But R3 now appears to also be losing the faith; the chief technology officer has called blockchains “inappropriate for many banking scenarios”. Mr Walker was full of corkers, like: It sounds like the pixie dust is starting to wear off. (Full disclosure: FT Alphaville participated in this inquiry and gave written evidence, jointly with Walker, to the committee.)

The company is one of a new generation of start-ups trying to cater to increased concerns about cyber attacks on industrial equipment connected to the internet. The Department of Homeland Security and FBI warned earlier this year that the Russian government has compromised networks in critical infrastructure, while the rise of ransomware enables cyber criminals to profit from interrupting industrial equipment. Xage is unusual in using blockchain, the technology first used by cryptocurrencies, to create a distributed network of devices that can authenticate the digital fingerprint of each machine. The start-up is valued at about $35m before the new funds raised, according to a person familiar with the matter. Duncan Greatwood, Xage chief executive, who joined the company from Apple, said the need for distributed security was becoming “more urgent”. The energy industry wants to take advantage of technologies that give it remote access to far away oilfields or wind farms but needs to make them secure from hackers. “Even two years ago most of these facilities were just disconnected from the outside world and the risk was kind of contained,” he said. Now, as they want to move data from devices to the cloud to analyse it, there is a “level of exposure that never existed before. If they get compromised in a particular place, it affects not just two or three drills but 20,000 of them.” Xage uses blockchain so that anomalies on just one device will be detected by the distributed system, preventing a hacker from spreading through a centralised network. Securing industrial control systems can be difficult because they were often made long before the latest threats, and overlaying security can be a struggle when machines come from different manufacturers. Other new companies are also working on the challenge, including Claroty, which recently raised $60m from investors including equipment manufacturers Rockwell, Siemens and Schneider-Electric. Xage’s customers include NTT Communications, GE Renewables and GlobaLogix, which supplies oil and gas companies.

They are marks left by the coders who use this place as a hide-out. The troupe of five or so developers, clad in hoodies and jeans, have an air of Peter Pan’s lost boys. They may be young — in their early to mid-twenties — but these programmers are the heart of the most extraordinary financial story of recent months: cryptocurrencies, digital tokens with no intrinsic value, suddenly worth billions. I’m here to meet the coders’ leader, Vitalik Buterin, the Russian-Canadian creator of Ethereum, arguably the most successful of the hundreds of copycat cryptocurrencies to have emerged in the seven years since bitcoin rose to prominence. On the damp, overcast morning earlier this year when I take a Lyft car (an Uber equivalent) to his San Francisco headquarters, Ethereum’s market value was some $125bn — second only to bitcoin. Once I’ve squeezed past his earnest acolytes, the angular young man I recognise from tech conference stages shakes my hand gingerly, his fingers flattened. With hollow cheeks and downy brown hair, he is more mathematics prodigy than tech magnate. We had booked a fancy Mexican restaurant in San Francisco’s Latin-inflected Mission district, but at the last minute I was told he would prefer a quiet takeaway here at Ethereum’s San Francisco home-from-home. He’s dressed in a loose canary yellow T-shirt featuring a cartoon character, black tracksuit trousers and a watch with a pink plastic strap. Its face is a cat, whose transparent Cheshire grin exposes the mechanism. I ask for his precise age. He answers without hesitation: “23.96”. It was his father Dmitry, also a computer scientist, who first introduced his son to the idea of blockchain and cryptocurrency. He had encouraged his son to build video games from the age of 10. Then in 2011 he told him about bitcoin. Created two years earlier as the world reeled from the failures of the banking system, bitcoin lets people exchange cash online without a bank mediating the transaction. Bitcoin’s enigmatic creator remains unidentified, but among its godfathers were cypherpunks: hackers dedicated to privacy, determined to undermine authorities who led us to the financial crisis. There’s projects that never had a soul, that are just like, ra-ra, price go up. Lambo[rghini], vrromm, buybuybuy now! The then 17-year-old Vitalik initially dismissed the idea, but then did his own research into virtual money. Soon he was writing articles — paid for in bitcoins — while studying computer science at Canada’s University of Waterloo, eventually leading him to co-found Bitcoin Magazine. Back in 2011, bitcoin was considered so radical many believed governments would ban it, pointing to the dark market it supported. Yet it survived, trading at highs of $19,000 at Christmas, although a crash followed. A blockchain is “an interesting and new kind of organism” Buterin says after we have slid across floorboards through the open-plan living room to a wooden dining table. That is something of an understatement, I think. Simply put, a blockchain is a ledger stored across thousands of computers. Spreading the record out this way, and securing it with Byzantine mathematics called cryptography, makes it harder to tamper with than traditional information hoards. Centralised data troves, such as your brain, are liable to lose things — and, as Equifax found via the hacking of its customer data files, are vulnerable to attack. By contrast, blockchain ledgers are open for all to read and not controlled by a single entity. Buterin’s particular genius was to see the potential to create a blockchain of his own, Ethereum, that other services could build on, from payments to games. It quickly grew a life of its own, with everyone from scientists to banks and entrepreneurs clamouring to build on it. Aged just 19, Buterin quit university to guide it. We both make for a bench; after some awkward hovering, he folds his bony frame into a chair. We dither about food. I suggest tacos or pizza. His collaborator, Thomas Greco, a developer who says he has worked with Buterin for years, suggests Thai. Before I have time to find a menu on my phone, Greco has whizzed through options for nearby Chaiya Thai Restaurant and is ordering with his thumb. Buterin is the first to admit he had a weird 2017. Entrepreneurs building on Ethereum started using it to mint fresh coins to crowdfund virtual money for their ventures, a novel funding mechanism called initial coin offerings. Bitcoin and ether prices rocketed and ICOs exploded — but fuelled fears of tulip-style mania. “We’ve created a culture where some totally random project raising something like $8m is like, oh yeah that’s peanuts,” he says. “You know you’re in a bubble!” The rising ether price has made him a multi-millionaire but unlike bitcoin believers who have tended stubbornly to hold the asset, he was never confident cryptocurrencies would catch on. When prices looked right, he’d cash in — and he has “financially paid dearly for it”, he remarks, cheerfully, estimating his paper wealth would be three to four times higher had he sold less cryptocurrency. After years at $1 to $100, bitcoin jumped from under $1,000 in January 2017 to over $19,000 by December (the ebullience leaked out of the market, however — it’s now about $8,000). Buterin is under pressure to translate breathless blockchain excitement into results. He rapidly explains his efforts to improve Ethereum, which recently jammed under the strain of people swapping virtual cats in a game called CryptoKitties, where players breed and swap digital felines. The scaling initiatives have names such as “sharding”, “state channels” and “plasma”. I’m relieved when we switch to simpler stuff — such as his desire for immortality. Buterin has pondered eternal life since he was a child. Not long after his family emigrated from Russia when he was six, he stumbled on a book by Aubrey de Grey, a controversial British scientist with radical ideas to defeat ageing. Why does he want to live forever, I ask as we sip green tea made by Greco, while waiting for our food. Buterin is “kind of puzzle[d] as to why this is even a question”. If you could live forever, he reasons, choosing not to is “the equivalent of jumping off a cliff”. He later reassures me that while life extension solutions have been slow coming they could be ready by 2060, which is “probably enough for you”. (I’m 25.) 272 Claremont Blvd, San Francisco, CA, 94127 Tamarind prawns $14 Pad pak with tofu $10 Green curry $10 Brown rice x2 $6 Green tea x2 No charge Total (inc tax and delivery) $50.56 So what would he do with eternal life, I ask, imagining he might yearn to crack unsolved mathematics proofs. Not quite. “The most important thing is to enjoy it,” he replies. During flights, he practises the languages he’s not yet fluent in by watching French, German or Chinese films. As we talk, cryptocurrency is having something of a cultural shift. The idealistic early coders, who wanted blockchain to transfer power from corporations and governments to individuals, last year started getting overtaken by get-rich-quick schemers. Some ICOs were scams. Buterin watched in dismay as his blockchain was flooded by mercenaries making a fast buck. “There’s projects that never had a soul, that are just like, ra-ra, price go up,” he flaps his long hands, “Lambo[rghini], vrromm, buybuybuy now!” Then he blurts out a critique of the digital token, Tron, breaking the tension by laughing uproariously. Tron’s market valuation hit $17bn without any discernible product. The outlandish valuations are, he says, “far ahead of what this space has actually accomplished for the world”. Even as we wait for delivery, the crypto markets are tanking. By the end of the day, ether will have crashed 30 per cent. This volatility would have traders sweating, but it’s nothing to crypto-veterans such as Buterin — he doesn’t even check his phone. The boom may disillusion Buterin, but he has welcomed mainstream investment in blockchain. The Ethereum Enterprise Alliance was founded in 2016 to test enterprise uses for the blockchain — members range from BP to JPMorgan. The EEA reflects Buterin’s changing mindset. As a teenager, he shared the rebellious crypto-community’s common attitude: “the system”, ie governments, banks and major corporations, “is basically evil, and we needs [sic] to outright resist it and build a new thing” (Buterin has a childlike tic, incorrectly adding “s” to some verbs). But he came to realise these people “aren’t that different from people anywhere else”. Purists might call this betraying blockchain’s roots; Buterin paints it as pragmatism, coloured with anxiety about governments with “hundreds of billions of dollars of physical weaponry, plenty of prisons . . . increasing amounts of internet surveillance”. [E]ven if your goal is to overthrow parts of the establishment, you want to have and present an image of why this is driving human progress Buterin has cause to fret: he watched early bitcoiners who used bitcoin for drug trafficking get caught. He cites Ross Ulbricht, the impossibly young American libertarian who ran dark web market Silk Road, an illegal online marketplace for illicit substances and goods, largely on bitcoin. Ulbricht’s infamous decision to hire hit men rewrote the narrative of bitcoin, argues Buterin, turning a story about “possibly a civil disobedient martyr” to “actual criminal and a public enemy”. Now in his early thirties, Ulbricht last year lost a five-year court battle and faces life in prison. “[E]ven if your goal is to overthrow parts of the establishment, you want to have and present an image of why this is driving human progress,” he explains. “[The] Lord of the Rings and Star Wars could give people a very, very misleading impression of social conflict”. His reference to hobbits and jedis invoke a child’s morality, righteousness versus evil; Buterin has adjusted to a world without clear-cut villains and heroes. So who’s the most significant person in his life? For once he’s silenced. “Hmmm.” Pause. “It’s hard to think of one single person. Yeah.” We’re saved by the delivery’s arrival. Two women on sofas are tapping at sticker-covered laptops. The atmosphere is student house, pre-finals exams. Buterin fetches plates and forks (but not knives). We unwrap spiced prawns and vegetable pad pak for him; absinthe green vegetable curry with brown rice for me. I ask what he remembers about Russia, which he left aged six. Peeling the prawn shells with long, nail-bitten fingers, he recites facts about his hometown, Kolomna: population 140,000; 115km from Moscow. He visited Moscow and St Petersburg last year, meeting Vladimir Putin, and is talking to Russian officials about a cryptorouble project. He has explained he’s establishment-friendly these days, but I have trouble understanding why he’d help an authoritarian government. He paraphrases Frederick Douglass, who was criticised for engaging with slaveholders but said: “I would unite with anyone to do right; and with nobody to do wrong”. He later confides he’s encouraging the Kremlin to deliver “crypto-y benefits for the people”, but adds, despondently, that he’s “not sure how much of that is actually getting through”. Willingness to talk has propelled Buterin on a seemingly open-ended diplomacy tour. In the past month, he’s visited four countries, Thailand, Singapore, China, the US. He has no fixed address. “Right now I’m basically just floating everywhere,” he says. So, where does he leave his stuff while he’s travelling? He races from the room. Baffled, I fork at some aubergine. He returns with a bright pink duffel bag, overflowing with T-shirts. Doesn’t he own books? He gestures to his Android phone. When his fortune grew from $1m to over $10m-$20m (for once he fudges the numbers), he didn’t feel “yay I get more stuff; it’s more certainty that I won’t have to worry about money for a long time”. He donates to the Gates Foundation, GiveDirectly, and De Grey’s anti-ageing SENS Research Foundation. His most important influence, he says, is the internet, and last June it killed him off: a viral rumour that he was dead knocked $4bn in market cap off ether, revealing how integral cryptocurrency traders see Buterin to Ethereum. “It’s like OK, wow, that’s weird,” he recalls. “My family members were sending me WeChat messages saying, are you OK?” I notice shadows under his piercing blue eyes. For all his public appearances, his celebrity does not sit easily. “Last year it got to the point where [the fame] got more annoying than good,” he says. He recalls a man trailing him around an aeroplane and through an airport, trying to talk to him. Was this something he wanted, this leadership position? He doesn’t miss a beat. “No.” So how did it happen? “Mmmm. Ethereum got big.” He hangs his head, like I’d scolded him. “[It] just so happened that Ethereum evolved without, I guess, other figures quite as large as myself.” Buterin seems downcast. Attempting to lighten the mood, I ask where he’d like to be in five years’ time. “I have no idea,” he sighs. “I generally don’t plan more than three months ahead, let alone five years.” It’s clear that Ethereum started as a project, not a career plan. He ridicules the bitcoin millionaires who’ve ridden the crypto-tsunami to riches, flaunting it as investment prowess. “It’s the luck of the draw, where everyone who won the draw seems to feel like they deserved it for being smarter,” rants Buterin. He impersonates a bitcoin bull: “I was loyal and I was virtuous and I held through and therefore I deserve to have my five mansions and 23 lambos!” We laugh. Having polished off the prawns, he picks up food granules with his index finger and describes walking through a rundown district in China recently. He fixates on the “scrappy grocery stores, with five-year-old kids helping mommy and daddy rearrange the water bottles.” They reminded him that “these are the people you’re actually serving”. I can sense Buterin itching to get back online. He removes the plates and thanks me for coming. I step into the grey day, a good distance from anywhere and without having called a car. Since the tradition is that the FT pays, I left $45 in notes for Greco, but discovered belatedly I was $5 short. Don’t worry, Greco tells me later over email. I can pay him the difference in ether.

Using his home computer, the young Indian computer scientist mined a small number of the virtual coins — then worth less than a dollar apiece — before losing interest. But last year, Mr Shetty — now a successful social media entrepreneur — was drawn back to cryptocurrencies, amid a surge in global activity that would send the bitcoin price above $19,700 by December. As excitement grew in India, he built WazirX, a local cryptocurrency exchange that finally went live on March 8. “I knew this was the right time,” he said. Others might question that assessment. Four weeks after WazirX’s launch, the Reserve Bank of India made a draconian move to halt the flow of funds into this burgeoning sector. All regulated financial companies, it said this month, must within 90 days end services to individuals or businesses dealing with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies using blockchain technology — barring traders from using the bank system to buy or sell virtual currencies for rupees online. Even as Indian authorities pledge to foster financial technology to accelerate national development, the fierce clampdown on cryptocurrencies is prompting protests that India could be left behind in a crucial area of innovation. “Time and again we\u0027ve seen this,” said Raj Chowdhury, managing director of HashCash Consultants, a California-based company whose blockchain technology is used by customers in 26 countries, including India. “The approach to new industries has left the country playing catch-up.” From the start, India’s cryptocurrency market was shaped by the country’s tough regulations — notably its system of capital controls, which effectively blocked Indians from using local bank accounts to trade in cryptocurrencies on international exchanges. This meant a chronic squeeze on the onshore supply of cryptocurrency. Some were brought in by traders who managed to sidestep the capital controls — for example, dual nationals with bank accounts in India and overseas. There was also bitcoin on the market that had been mined by local residents — typically in the early days of the technology, before mining became dominated by huge, energy-intensive computer farms. With the Indian cryptocurrency market largely cut off from those abroad, the bitcoin price on Indian exchanges was consistently about 10 per cent higher than that seen on large global peers. Similar premiums have been seen in other countries with strict capital controls, such as South Africa and Brazil. But while India’s capital controls succeeded in pushing up the price of bitcoin, the authorities grew increasingly concerned that cryptocurrencies could still provide a means of illicitly moving capital offshore. While banks are required to enforce an annual limit on international financial transfers of more than $250,000 per person, there were no safeguards to prevent Indian traders from moving any amount of bitcoin overseas. KV Karthik, a financial crime specialist at Deloitte, said the RBI’s latest action is in line with a broader push — including the shock “demonetisation” of high-value banknotes in November 2016 — to crack down on money laundering and other illicit financial flows. “These are all dots getting connected to a common objective,” he said. India is not alone in taking action against virtual currencies. Nations from Algeria to Bangladesh have prohibited their use, while China moved to shut down cryptocurrency exchanges last September. But the tactic pursued by New Delhi — cutting off bitcoin exchanges from the formal financial system, even while they are not deemed to have breached any laws — may violate constitutional guarantees of the right to do business, said Vaibhav Parikh, a partner at Indian law firm Nishith Desai Associates. “There is definitely inconsistency,” he said. This argument is being tested by the virtual currency exchange CoinRecoil, which has gone to court to fight the RBI’s decision. Other exchanges are racing to repurpose their businesses in the weeks before banks cut off services. WazirX may repurpose itself as an exchange for trading between different cryptocurrencies, Mr Shetty said. Unocoin, another exchange, is considering moving to a different country and trying to woo foreign customers, said its founder, Sathvik Vishwanath. “If this decision is not reversed, Indian exchanges won’t continue to exist in the format they do today,” said Rahul Raj, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Koinex. “Digital assets will become a dead asset in India — there’s just no mechanism to get in or out.” Even as it announced its action against bitcoin and its peers, the RBI said it was exploring the potential to create a digital currency of its own. This follows government efforts to show a supportive approach towards other applications of the blockchain technology underpinning bitcoin, with data stored in an encrypted series of “blocks” that is stored and updated in many digital locations simultaneously. Indian state entities have shown interest in using this technology to tackle challenges ranging from land registration to healthcare records, said Kavita Gupta, managing partner of US-based Consensys Ventures, which invests in blockchain-focused start-ups. But the attack on cryptocurrencies will have a chilling effect on the broader environment for blockchain technology development in India, said Mr Chowdhury. Although the bulk of its business is not focused on cryptocurrencies, HashCash plans to “deprioritise” India as a target market, he said. Recommended Amid all the discontent in technology circles, however, Indian bitcoin investors have stayed sanguine in the face of the RBI’s move. Having fallen 22 per cent on the day of the announcement, the traded price on Koinex has more than regained all those losses — although on Thursday it showed a 2 per cent discount to the price on US-based Coinbase, rather than the premium that it had once enjoyed. The willingness of many Indian traders to retain bitcoin reflects a widespread hope that the central bank’s harsh measures will prove temporary, said Ajeet Khurana, chief executive of Zebpay, one of the largest Indian cryptocurrency exchanges. Zebpay would be “very happy” to eliminate the anonymity enjoyed by its users if asked to do so by regulators, he said, adding that bitcoin should be seen as a store of value similar to gold, rather than as a potential replacement for state-issued fiat currency. “Cryptocurrency is an idea whose time has come, and not a threat to the current system,” Mr Khurana said. “What we want is coexistence.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Simon Mundy","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-04-19","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/43ae0e68-857e-3f0e-af53-6ea78b9fd13c","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F43ae0e68-857e-3f0e-af53-6ea78b9fd13c.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Sell all crypto and abandon all blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain hype is an essential part of the crypto-craze, and its fading is cause to expect the eventual crash. The reason is a relationship between a beguiling, but wrong, idea about technology, and the value it has injected back into crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Break that cycle, and you unspool the loop that\u0027s spun itself into a boom. It goes something like this: Crypto-currency prices attracted attention. Serious people recognised a fad, seeing the inherent and fatal contradiction of something trying to be both a speculative asset and a currency useful for buying wheelbarrows, lattes or running shoes. No-one uses gold bars from the safe for petty cash. The underlying technology was neat, however. The distributed ledger which underpins Bitcoin has some cool features we’ll get into below, which led many to a default intelligent-sounding position: “Bitcoin is the perfect bubble, but blockchain is a remarkable solution”. Banks, companies and investors threw real money at developing blockchain products. Doing so was entirely rational. The world’s biggest fortunes were made from exciting new technologies! Then came the key development, a rush of initial coin offerings known as ICOs, which further inflated the crypto-currency and blockchain bubbles. In an ICO, tokens connected to a technology project are sold online, typically in exchange for Bitcoin or Ethereum. Big valuations for the tokens created a gold rush, creating demand for the cryptocurrency needed to get in on the ICOs. Inflating values for everything prompts the launch of more token offerings, and so on, with the overall market capitalisation for crypto related “assets” taken as validation. We\u0027ve previously picked apart various token offerings, as well as taken on some of the larger issues applying blockchain technology to anything other than a crypto-currency. They include data regulation, competition, and that existing tech can already do the job. What\u0027s encouraging is those critiques are starting to spread, with people who really understand the technology explaining why the blockchain-for-everything fad makes no sense. For instance, here\u0027s a recent Medium post from Kai Stinchcombe, who argued that “Blockchain is not only crappy technology but a bad vision for the future”. We\u0027ll let him give the explanation of the technology promised above: Indeed, and this is what made Bitcoin and its copycats fascinating. But, as he goes on to explain, this is not what is being sold or hyped. The integrity of public blockchains for crypto-currency has made it a “futuristic integrity wand” to be waved at every problem. Except blockchain doesn\u0027t even solve most problems of trust. The integrity of data on a public blockchain can be trusted not to change, but that says nothing about whether the data is right in the first place. For votes, tuna, shipping containers or mango supply chains, a blockchain registry would only be as good or as trustworthy as the people contributing to it. What tends to be forgotten is that Bitcoin\u0027s unique selling point is that absence of a need for trust, which arrived at a moment just after a financial crisis when trust in monetary systems was low. What, though, are the other markets or modes of human interaction where a total absence of trusted gatekeepers is possible or desirable? Not for nothing do so many blockchain start-up pitches focus on the technology, as if it were inherently better to bring blockchain to x, rather than leading with the solution to a real-world problem. They are tokens in search of users as an end in itself. Here\u0027s Mr Stinchcombe again: So public, trustless blockchains are not going to catch on. There may be some uses for private blockchain technology in banks, who would love to cut costs by sharing technology -- but only with entities they trust. Improvements to back-office database software meant to manage data integrity and permissions tend not to be the stuff of bubble valuations, however. An honest perspective on blockchain is not one which demands a bubble valuation, or even really the attention of executives whose job isn\u0027t to think about the sort of technology infrastructure they might be buying in a decade. Try for instance a report written by Martin Walker and published by R3, a blockchain company, on the many challenges involved in bridging the gap from existing bank systems to a nirvana of distributed ledger technology. As it explains, trade processing is about taking a small number of inputs to generate a very large number of outputs. Don\u0027t forget the different outputs also demanded by regulators, clients, and auditors as well. As the report says: Then there is the problem of timing. Distributed ledger tech is “inherently slower” than that used in all the fast paced liquid markets like FX, equities, government bonds. But the legal mechanism where settlement happens at the same time as the trade is too fast for markets used to settling trades on a time delay. Overcoming these barriers to reach “ledger nirvana” is the work of many years. Here\u0027s some of the R3 conclusion on the challenge: At some point the usefulness of trust, and the slow and complicated reality of interacting with existing human practices, is going to deflate the blockchain bubble.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Dan McCrum","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-04-13","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/03726c48-fb71-3a13-91cf-c0f952adb477","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcct-images.ft.com%2Fproduction%2F5b77fd2b-fd80-42be-88d8-a7d48f757b18_FINAL.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"So the crypto, where we at?","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"You\u0027d be forgiven for thinking that all has gone a quiet on the crypto front. Since December\u0027s giddy highs, Bitcoin and Ether, the leading lights of the cryptocurrency revolution, have shed more than half their respective values as the world tries to figure out, well, what the point of it all is. (And not just in an existential sense). In a note out Friday, Morgan Stanley, through some rather lovely charts, tried to help us come to some conclusions about the future of blockchain and crypto. First off, shock-horror, trading volume has declined for both Bitcoin and Ether. In technical analysis this is apparently referred to as “the Eiffel Tower” formation: Liquidity is a serious concern if you are major Bitcoin or Ethereum holder like the Winkleveii, Jack Dorsey or North Korea. Because volume has precipitously collapsed, any attempts to sell large chunks of either coin will move the market downwards, triggering more selling in a reverse-FOMO feedback loop. Of course, this assumes the 1,000 or so accounts who own 40 per cent of Bitcoin would want to sell. However, given the current make up of currencies traded against Bitcoin, the HODLing elite may want to at least consider shifting some of their riches: Yes, that\u0027s correct, 40 per cent of this liquidity isn\u0027t from a fiat currency at all. So capturing gains in dollars, yen or sterling is even trickier than even the thin volume of the first chart suggests. Hawk-eyed readers may spot one cryptocurrency that has grown in importance to Bitcoin\u0027s volume: tether. More to come from our colleague Jemima Kelly on that particular story. Speaking of other cryptocurrencies outside of the duopoly, what\u0027s going with ICOs? Well, there have been a few painful lessons for “investors” so far: Not exactly pocket change, that $630m sum. Despite these failures -- Morgan Stanley calculates that 32 per cent of 2017 ICOs collapsed -- raising cash through the still-unregulated offerings has been popular in the past 18 months. In particular for companies with a focus on universe-dismantling technology the blockchain: To recap: Venture-capital-backed blockchain deals outnumbered ICO-backed deals in the past 18 months, with VC backing 68 per cent of deals and ICOs behind 32 per cent. But the sheer volume of funding raised in ICOs was much larger than funding raised in VC-backed deals. (ICOs raised 78 per cent of all blockchain related funding, with VC investment making up the balance of 22 per cent.) No doubt large offerings like Tezos or Filecoin, which collected $257m from its ICO last August, were a significant chunk of this flow. It is also worth mentioning the jaw-dropping $4.15bn block.one finished raising last week, which was not included in Morgan Stanley\u0027s data. For perspective, the market value of ether raised in the latter offering was double the amount Amazon has raised in capital markets during its entire time as a public company. It is debatable whether ICOs are the new capital raising paradigm for blockchain businesses -- 25 per cent of start ups currently fail within the first year, but 64 per cent of ICOs either didn\u0027t meet their funding target or failed in 2017. This suggests blockchain companies funded by ICOs may not have quite the same quality of business plan as their VC-funded sisters. Matt Levine has a long-running joke that cryptocurrency markets are in the arduous process of discovering the basic mechanisms of finance and proclaiming them as innovative. For instance, smart contracts could become swap contracts. It also turns out, according to Morgan Stanley, that actual financiers may also be the most adroit at using blockchain for real-life purposes: Morgan Stanley notes that several banks, including troubled Deutsche and a selection of the big five US banks - including JP Morgan and Wells Fargo - are experimenting with blockchain technology across verticals such as trade finance and equity-swap trading. Whether their laboratory games will end up creating any value is another matter. While it is easy to sneer at the blockchain revolution -- Lord knows this blog has had fun doing so -- it is probably still too early to know what applications it will really have. After all, as historian A. J. Field has shown, it did take fifty-odd years for electricity to transform American manufacturing in the 1930s, after many cycles of booms and busts. Perhaps we should be glad then banks are taking the reins because, after all, they can (theoretically) suffer losses which would bankrupt a small town\u0027s population. The block.one ICO, however, doesn\u0027t fill us with confidence that such losses will continue to be limited to those who can bear them. More in the usual place.

The “One Pay FX” service will become available for the bank’s customers in Spain, the UK, Brazil and Poland on Friday, but Santander executive chairman Ana Botín told the FT the group aims to eventually make it available as a standalone app that could be used by customers at other banks. Ms Botín said she was particularly keen to encourage the project - which took two years to develop - after seeing her son using a rival service to more quickly transfer money into Spain. The four launch countries will cover around half of the annual FX transfers made by individual Santander customers, and the bank said it plans to expand the services to more countries and types of customer such as small businesses in the coming months. One Pay uses distributed ledger technology developed by California-based Ripple, allowing users to see the exact amount of money that will be arrive in the destination before they make a transfer, and shortening the length of time taken from several days to the same day or next day. Ms Botín added that the bank is aiming to make transfers instant in several markets by the summer. “Blockchain technology offers tremendous opportunities to improve the services we offer our customers, and the launch of Santander One Pay FX is the first of many potential applications”, she said. Santander is one of many banks and financial institutions have been experimenting with blockchain - the ledger technology that also underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin - in the face of rising competition from new tech-focused rivals. Ms Botín said that “innovation is going to continue and you have to be ahead of the pack”. Santander’s InnoVentures venture capital fund invested in Ripple in 2015, and has also taken stakes in other blockchain specialists such Blythe Masters’ Digital Asset Holdings. However, despite growing interest in the technology, some groups remain sceptical about the potential to use blockchain at scale. Swift, the bank-owned messaging system that currently handles more than half of all high-value international payments, said last month that “further progress is needed” before distributed ledgers can become more mainstream.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nicholas Megaw","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-04-12","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/c755210f-5ba5-395e-9089-214daf29dc7c","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fc755210f-5ba5-395e-9089-214daf29dc7c.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Wot, no blockchain?","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The latest press release from HM Land Registry, spelling out details of the first digital mortgage deed entered into Britain\u0027s official Land Register, reads much like a standard blockchain pronouncement. It features puffy enthusiastic quotes from the companies involved, like this one, from Enact Conveyancing managing director Ben Carroll: It also talks about “making transactions instantaneous”, as well as “building for a future without the need for a witness to watch”. All hail the mighty distributed ledger, amirite?! In fact, the first digitally signed mortgage, for a house in south-east London, didn\u0027t use blockchain technology at all. Instead, the process works as follows: the conveyancer creates a digital version of a mortgage deed, the borrower signs that online after verifying his or her identity with the UK government\u0027s “Verify” service and, on completion of the transaction, the conveyancer makes the deed effective. No sign of pre-programmeable “smart contracts”, which supposedly cut out the middleman (though as has been pointed out before, human adjudicators would still be needed for those). Blockchain technology has frequently been touted as a way of reducing property fraud, particularly in developing countries where land rights can be a life-or-death matter. And HM Land Registry had itself previously indicated it would explore the use of blockchain in testing “new digital registers”. So maybe that hasn\u0027t worked out so well, or maybe they\u0027re still exploring. Either way, it turns out you can get rid of pen-and-paper transactions with the good old-fashioned internet.

This time it\u0027s the turn of - wait for it - the “ GDPR Cash token”, which promises access to “a community of GDPR experts” who can help businesses find their way around all 11 chapters and 99 articles of the EU\u0027s General Data Protection Regulation, due to come into force on May 25. It seems pretty easy to become one of these “experts” - the white paper makes no mention of any prior qualifications, simply saying: Here\u0027s a screenshot from their website: (By the way, “GDPR tokens are not securities”! “GDPR tokens are non-refundable and are not intended for speculative investment”, you got that, SEC?) It\u0027s not clear whether the GDPR Cash token will actually itself be compliant with the GDPR - the white paper does not detail how it will make sure it is obeying the new rules. But what is clear is that there are some big questions around how blockchains, the “immutable” distributable ledgers underpinning decentralised currencies like bitcoin, and GDPR, which aims to protect EU citizens\u0027 data and codifies the right they already have to be forgotten, can co-exist. As Michèle Finck, Oxford EU law lecturer and senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute, told us: One of blockchain\u0027s key selling points is that once data - either transaction data or otherwise - are stored and confirmed across its distributed network of nodes, they are then locked into the ledger for time immemorial. The process works as follows: groups of data are bundled up into blocks that are then processed and chronologically chained on top of each other through a hashing process that makes it almost impossible to change any of the data without altering all other blocks - hence the famous “tamper-proof” distributed ledger that, we are told, ensures its reliability. But GDPR is designed to give people the right to request their data back, which would not be compatible with a public blockchain as described above. The apparent conflict between open blockchains and the new data privacy laws inspired Jerry Brito, director of DC-based bitcoin advocacy group Coin Center, to write a Medium post last week in which he argued GDPR was “incompatible with open blockchain networks” and that Europe was “closing itself off from the future of the Internet to its detriment” in bringing in the new regulation. Brito\u0027s comments were followed up by a report in The Verge (that Brito himself tweeted a link to) that said he was seeking an exemption from GDPR for blockchains, which caused a bit of a stir online. Although Brito told us that report was a misrepresentation of what he believed, he stuck by what he had said in the report, which included the following: Who needs the law when you have disintermediated trust to keep data secure and safe? He continues: That does sound lovely. But how are we meant to control data when it is forever stored on an amazing technicolour dreamledger? Sure, with a transaction, you can reverse a transaction by sending one back in the opposite direction. But what happens if some revenge porn gets onto the ledger? How would you go about reversing that? (The bitcoin blockchain already contains links to illegal pornography, according to a report published earlier this year.) Crypto security firms like Chainalysis and Elliptic have also shown the fact that open blockchain networks like bitcoin\u0027s and Ethereum\u0027s are merely pseudonymous - as opposed to anonymous - means that these networks are not so private after all. Cryptocurrency addresses can be linked back to real-world identities by tracking transactions and online activity. Here\u0027s Finck: So what about companies that run private, so called “permissioned”, centralised blockchains, like Ripple, or the ones being built by banks? As we\u0027ve pointed out here before, there\u0027s really not much difference between those private blockchains and any other centralised database systems, so there\u0027s no reason they shouldn\u0027t be compatible with it. What\u0027s important, therefore, is that running a blockchain doesn\u0027t suddenly become a golden ticket for a company to get past data privacy laws just because it\u0027s difficult to apply a legal framework to it. Distributed ledgers sound great. But we\u0027ll stick to the rule of law - flawed as it may be - to protect our data privacy for now, thanks.

But if you\u0027d been at the Consensus crypto and blockchain summit in New York for the past few days, you would not have known it. This evening, two brand new Aston Martins will be given away on the Cornucopia Majesty as it cruises down the River Hudson. The host of this floating shindig is a company whose “mission is to become the interface to the blockchain world”, which was founded by one of the co-founders of Ethereum, the thinkers\u0027 cryptocurrency. One Aston Martin will feature “very subtle bitcoin decoration” (though perhaps not as subtle as Tim Draper\u0027s tie) and the other will have Ethereum branding. Partygoers will be given “glow bracelets”, and all stop glowing except for two. The lucky people wearing them will receive a luxury British sports car that starts at just over $160,000. Decentral, the company giving away the free cars, seems to feel it has more money to throw around than BitMex, a US crypto exchange whose CEO decided to go on television and assign bitcoin a “ price target”, and made that price target $50,000. BitMex resorted to hiring three Lamborghinis -- or Lambos, to use the correct crypto parlance -- to be parked outside the Hilton Midtown hotel in which the conference is being held for five hours on Monday for its vehicular publicity. The company that rents them out reportedly charges $1,000 per day. The proverbial bitcoin lambos parked outside the Consensus conference. Future of finance looks a lot like old finance (but possibly with even less gender diversity). pic.twitter.com/7QTbvqjk3W There was plenty more 2007 2017-style excess to be found after hours. Rapper Snoop Dogg, though normally known to be more of a Cadillac man, made an appearance on Tuesday night at a party for bankercoin Ripple XRP. Here is Bloomberg\u0027s description of the party, which featured four names on the byline and was published with the headline “Snoop Dogg Helps Ripple\u0027s Crypto Community Get High at XRP Event”: Snoop wasn\u0027t the only US rapper getting down at Consensus: Ahh -- even better -- I just realized that Snoop Dogg\u0027s first concert last night, at the Ripple event, was in competition with a Busta Rhymes concert at a private crypto house party last night. While some bankers seem to love Ripple, a naive observer might have been briefly confused about the relationship between cryptocurrency and the banking industry on Monday. Specifically, a group of young men and women caused a bit of a fuss outside the conference, shouting nasty things about bitcoin and carrying signs with the website “bankersagainstbitcoin.org”. As it turns out, the “protest” was a PR stunt from a cryptocurrency mining company. Visitors to its site are told that “Industries like the lucrative $15 billion overdraft industry that enrich banks will soon disappear”, because there is no room for subtlety in HODLand. Over on Reddit, other HODLers were hoping the conference would bring the kind of crypto gains that other years had brought: 2018: ?? So far, not so good: At pixel time, bitcoin was down about 5 per cent since Monday, when the conference started. ( XRP was down around 6 per cent, despite Snoop.) The conference also featured diamond-encrusted crypto jewellery, terrible WiFi, Jack Dorsey, and people publicly calling themselves “crypto-celebrities”.

BlackRock funds alone have suffered losses of about $8m after the world’s largest asset manager rapidly bought close to half of the freely available shares in LongFin, before selling its holding after FTSE Russell reversed course and ejected LongFin from the indices. A range of other index tracking funds, including those managed by Vanguard and Charles Schwab, have also incurred losses. LongFin’s valuation surged in December, when days after its shares were listed at $5 they rose more than 10-fold on news the company had acquired a blockchain business called Ziddu.com, valuing the business at more than $5bn. The company is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is reviewing LongFin’s IPO and the Ziddu.com deal to determine whether “any violations of the federal securities laws” occurred. The SEC declined to comment further. On February 14, FTSE Russell decided it would include LongFin in its Russell 2000 and 3000 indices, groupings of small and medium-sized companies used as benchmarks for passive investment products, including exchange traded funds. LongFin was officially added to both indices on March 22. That inclusion compelled index tracker funds, including the $43bn iShares Russell 2000, to buy up all available LongFin stock, pushing the shares up from their February low of $32 to above $71. The shares traded at a little over $14 on Tuesday. FTSE Russell failed to note that LongFin did not meet a requirement that stocks on those indices meet a minium 5 per cent free float requirement. LongFin’s freefloat was less than 2 per cent. London Stock Exchange Group, which owns FTSE Russell, declined to comment on its error. It pointed to a March 26 notice where it said: “FTSE Russell has determined that LongFin failed to meet the minimum 5% free float requirement as at the 14 February rank date. In accordance with the FTSE Russell Recalculation Policy and Guidelines, LongFin will therefore be removed from the Russell Indexes on 28 March 2018 (after the close).” BlackRock said it had noted that LongFin had now been deleted from various benchmarks. “Accordingly, we have been deleting the stock from our ETFs and index funds tracking these benchmarks. As the benchmark weight of LongFin was de minimis, we expect the deletion will have no material impact on the operations or performance of our funds.” Vanguard declined to comment on the extent of its losses, but said “the impact is not material to the funds. To put in context, the funds are highly diversified with over 2,000 securities so the exposure will be very small compared to the total size of the fund.” LongFin and Ziddu.com are both controlled by Venkat Meenavalli, described in LongFin’s IPO document as “a global techno entrepreneur”, “a financial wizard” and “a true believer in disruptive technologies [who] believes that every piece of information is worth millions”. When announcing the related-party deal, LongFin said Ziddu.com uses blockchain to document and offer microloans in Ziddu coins, a digital currency of its own making which is “loosely pegged to Ethereum and bitcoin”.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Peter Smith","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-04-04","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/14c8cc4c-32c8-3c28-8273-069e90229e77","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcct-images.ft.com%2Fproduction%2Fd130849a-ccd3-48ec-91c9-6343915aeedd_FINAL.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Buy SEC tokens!

Data collated by Thomson Reuters from the World Intellectual Property Organisation (Wipo) database showed that in 2017, more than half of the 406 blockchain related patent applications were from China. Patent applications for blockchain, whose uses span everything from the distribution of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to the tracking of Chinese chickens, trebled last year, while patents specific to cryptocurrencies — which are not included the blockchain patent category — rose 16 per cent to 602 in 2017. “Companies are moving fast in order to protect their ideas in new areas of technological development — long before the technology actually goes to market,” said Alex Batteson, editor at Thomson Reuters’ Practical Law. China filed 225 of the blockchain patents last year and 59 in 2016, followed by the US (91 in 2017 and 21 in 2016) and Australia (13 last year and 19 in 2016). Of the top nine filer of blockchain patents between 2012 and 2017, six were Chinese, led by Beijing Technology Development. US headquartered payments giant MasterCard was the most active filer in the same period, filing 25 while Lichtenstein’s nChain Holdings, which describes itself as the “global leader in research and development of blockchain technologies” filed 18 applications. Thomson Reuters said recent blockchain applications include Bank of America applying to patent a technology that facilitates “person-to-person alias-based payments”, BT Group seeking a patent for a way to detect attacks on blockchain, and MasterCard International asking for one to cover a blockchain-based method for tracking payments and uploading data on to the blockchain at the point of sale. Not every company patents its discoveries, and not all patents lead to viable products or use case, but Thomson Reuters said the patent data were meaningful because they indicated activity in a space and could create barriers to entry. “Patents are also important for companies to attract all-important investment,” Mr Batteson added. “Investors need to know that a business owns and can capitalise on the intellectual property and will not face interference from other parties claiming ownership.” China has been less dominant in bitcoin and cryptocurrency applications, where the top filers over the past five years were dominated by US and European companies including IBM (54), the Netherland’s Gemalto (35), Intel (34), Thomson Licensing (31) and Amazon Technologies (27).","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Laura Noonan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-25","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/2ae9154c-1d56-11e8-aaca-4574d7dabfb6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F77e45342-079f-11e8-9e12-af73e8db3c71?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Law firms look to capitalise on initial coin offering boom","INTRO":"Experts advise on small launches to be in line to benefit when system goes mainstream","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Some of the world’s top law firms are looking to cash in on the mania for blockchain and cryptocurrencies by advising on initial coin offerings and investments in the new technology, as well as helping to deal with sceptical regulators. UK, US and European firms including Clifford Chance, Allen \u0026 Overy, Latham \u0026 Watkins and Cooley are among those advising on ICOs, which involve a start-up company issuing “digital tokens” to investors in exchange for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Tokens can be then used to access services produced by the issuer or can be sold on. The popularity of ICOs as an alternative tool for fundraising has rocketed in the past year, coinciding with surging cryptocurrency prices. More than 200 coins were launched in 2017, raising about $3.9bn for early stage companies globally, according to tracking website CoinSchedule. Already in 2018, more than $4.7bn has been raised from about 150 new tokens. They have also begun to creep into the mainstream, with several large companies — including messaging app Telegram and camera pioneer Eastman Kodak — announcing their own ICOs in recent months. The minute that someone breaks cover and starts to use this on a wholesale basis, then there will be a rush [of demand] But some regulators remain nervous about what has been dubbed the “digital wild west”. Numerous investors have lost money on ICO scams, while other launches have been linked to illicit activity such as money laundering or simply failed to produce the promised services. According to the website bitcoin.com, 46 per cent of businesses that held ICOs last year have already been unsuccessful. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, this month made clear that he intended to clamp down on the exchanges that facilitate cryptocurrency and token trading. Meanwhile, in January the US Securities and Exchange Commission warned “gatekeepers” such as lawyers and accountants to “act responsibly” when working on ICOs, citing “disturbing” behaviour from some advisers. Despite this, many big law firms are now advising companies on relatively small-scale ICOs — when compared with big initial public offerings — with a view to being first in line if and when they go mainstream. “The minute that someone breaks cover and starts to use this on a wholesale basis, then there will be a rush [of demand],” says Phil Smith, debt capital markets partner at Allen \u0026 Overy, which is acting on 15 ICO mandates. Still, the firm was treading carefully and had turned down many more ICO requests, he says. “It might be an issue of jurisdiction, the individuals involved, or we don’t see the commercial rationale for the ICO.” Switzerland, which wants to be a “crypto-nation”, according to its economics minister — says: “As with all booming sectors there’s a lot of noise, and you have to be careful. You need to understand the project — is it trying to jump on the hype of blockchain, or do you see there really could be some benefit in using an ICO?” At present, legal fees for ICOs are usually well below those for a standard flotation. That is in part because many digital tokens represent future access to a service or product rather than a security, and so businesses require less advice on regulatory matters. It is also because many start-ups by their very nature do not have the money to pay big legal fees up front. But law firms, sensing a burgeoning market, are also advising regular clients from banks to private funds looking to invest in cryptocurrency or in companies building applications based on blockchain technology. “More traditional corporates are looking at ICOs and more institutional clients are moving in,” says Peter Chapman, senior associate in banking and finance at Clifford Chance, which is advising on a number of ICOs. “If we’re not in this space then we will fall behind.” Regulators’ attitudes to blockchain and cryptocurrencies have varied wildly. China and South Korea have banned ICOs altogether, while others — such as France, Switzerland, the Cayman Islands and Gibraltar — are drawing up regimes for formally policing the space in an attempt to attract fintech business. Both EU and US regulators have clarified that in instances where an ICO qualifies as a financial instrument, businesses would need to comply with existing financial regulations. The SEC has gone as far as halting some and issuing subpoenas to people involved in certain others. Lawyers are being drafted in to look at whether a particular ICO falls within the scope of local law or not, and carry out wider legal analysis as to the merits of the new tool. “There is unquestionably a great deal of cryptocurrency wealth available to pay legal fees and a lot of incentive for entrepreneurs and their professional investors to organise ICOs,” says Preston Byrne, an English structured finance lawyer and cryptocurrency expert. “We advise clients on whether they are regulated or not, but also if the rules change in the future we would advise them on that,” says Sam Robinson, a partner in CMS’s financial services regulatory practice, which is advising on about 10 ICOs. Recommended Away from the cryptocurrency hype, lawyers are also exploring the future legal applications of the underlying technology. A group of ten law firms has recently banded together with R3, a software company that runs a distributed ledger platform, to exchange research and ideas on the legal aspects of blockchain. The hope is that blockchain can be used for a wide range of legal processes, from automating contracts and reducing documentation to cutting out intermediaries involved in the clearing and settlement of securities. “[Blockchain] potentially has the ability to change major aspects of the financial system if done properly,” says Paul Lewis, a capital markets and derivatives partner at Linklaters.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hannah Murphy Barney Thompson","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-26","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/1243bcb6-2b05-3f84-bf1e-58caa3501e1c","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2F1243bcb6-2b05-3f84-bf1e-58caa3501e1c.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"FTSE Russell gets in a tangle","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Last December, during the heady days of crypto-mania, NASDAQ listed trade-finance company LongFin announced it was buying a blockchain business called Ziddu.com. The news came just two days after LongFin\u0027s initial public offering. Cue a tenfold share price explosion and, as is tradition for story stocks, an awkward CNBC interview where Venkat Meenavalli, chief executive officer, struggled to defend the acquisition. By March LongFin had become one of the largest companies by market capitalisation outside of the traditional American stock indexes, valued at $2.8bn. FTSE Russell, who manage a range of global and US-based indexes, took notice. On February 14th, they decided to include LongFin in both the Russell 2000 and 3000 indexes, a list of small and medium sized companies which serves as benchmarks for a range of passive investment products, including exchange traded funds or Exchange Traded Funds. Among the long list of requirements for a business to be included in a FTSE Russell index is the following provision: So a business with a small free float of shares available to trade, for a range of reasons including liquidity, cannot be included in any of FTSE Russell\u0027s indexes. Unfortunately, FTSE Russell had miscalculated Longfin\u0027s float. Only 1.14m of the Class A shares had been placed in the IPO, out of an outstanding 46.5m shares, or roughly 2.5 per cent. See this screenshot from a video of the first day of trading in December: Apparently unaware, FTSE Russell added LongFin to both their Russell 2000 and 3000 indexes last Thursday, 22nd March. The passive products, including the $43bn iShares Russell 2000 ETF (ticker IWM), swiftly took note and started to buying up LongFin\u0027s available float to match their sizing in the FTSE Russell indexes. Due to only 2.5 per cent of the shares being available for purchase, Blackrock, who run iShares, and the other investment product providers such as Vanguard and Schwab, accumulated a position of 511,244 shares, or 45 per cent of the entire free float, according to Bloomberg. See if you can spot the moment when the buying began: As of Friday Blackrock owned 28 per cent of Longfin\u0027s free float. FTSE Russell released a statement on Monday: Expect a mad scramble for the door, given the relatively thin liquidity. Only 1.1m shares were traded Monday in a volatile session where the price dropped 16 per cent. At pixel, LongFin\u0027s shares were already down a further 25 per cent in pre-market trading on Tuesday.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jamie Powell","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-27","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/4ca72d20-2e10-11e8-9b4b-bc4b9f08f381","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F2c7340f8-2e19-11e8-97ec-4bd3494d5f14?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"JPMorgan weighs spin-off for blockchain project","INTRO":"Bank thinks ambitions for Quorum arm more readily achieved as standalone","DETAILED_CONTENT":"JPMorgan Chase is working on a potential spin-off of its main blockchain technology project after the biggest US bank by assets decided it was more likely to achieve widespread adoption as an independent operation. The US bank developed Quorum as its own customised version of blockchain technology over two years ago, in an effort to make many of its operations — such as clearing and settlement of derivatives and cross-border payments — more efficient. The expected spin-off of Quorum underlines how banks have grappled with how to harness blockchain technology, which uses a distributed ledger system to share information across a network of computers protected by cryptography. The change in approach by JPMorgan is particularly sensitive because chief executive Jamie Dimon has been one of the most outspoken critics of bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that is based on blockchain technology. JPMorgan’s goal for Quorum was “to become the standard of Wall Street”, said Caitlin Long, the Morgan Stanley veteran now prominent in the blockchain community. But the lack of traction outside the bank may have forced its hand, she said, adding: “Blockchains only work if there are network effects; it doesn’t make sense if banks are using it only internally.” Recommended People familiar with the situation said some rival banks may have been reluctant to use Quorum because it was so closely associated with JPMorgan, leading the US bank to conclude that its chances of becoming the industry standard were greater as a standalone entity. JPMorgan said in an emailed statement: “We continue to believe distributed ledger technology will play a transformative role in business which is why we are actively building multiple blockchain solutions.” “We’re not going to comment on speculation, but Quorum has become an extremely successful enterprise platform even beyond financial services and we’re excited about its potential,” it added. JPMorgan is expected to keep a minority stake in Quorum after the spin-out, which is likely to happen this year. Amber Baldet, the blockchain programme lead at JPMorgan, could leave the bank if it goes ahead with a spin-off, potentially for a project of her own. Last year, Mr Dimon dismissed bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, as “a fraud” that was “worse than tulip bulbs” and warned that he would “fire in two seconds” anyone caught trading it. But this year, he said he regretted the comments because blockchain was “real”. Many banks have been investing heavily in experimenting with blockchain. Several have taken stakes in R3, a consortium of banks that has developed its own Corda blockchain system. JPMorgan pulled out of R3 last year. Quorum, which is based on the Ethereum smart contract system, is being trialled by JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Canada and Australia’s ANZ to create a new blockchain-based messaging system that speeds up cross-border payments. Elsewhere, ING, ABN Amro, Société Générale and Louis Dreyfus Company are testing it to digitise the documents needed for agricultural commodities trading. The central banks of France, Brazil, Singapore and South Africa are also testing Quorum for their payment systems.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold Ben McLannahan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-22","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/reports/blockchain","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F7ce01678-68b2-11e8-8cf3-0c230fa67aec?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain","INTRO":"Though best known for underpinning cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, digital ledger technology is also changing sectors like food, healthcare, insurance — as well as the art market","DETAILED_CONTENT":"","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/bf791ec0-2d62-11e8-9b4b-bc4b9f08f381","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fd2e889e4-2d6e-11e8-97ec-4bd3494d5f14?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Economists’ cryptocurrency aims to avoid pitfalls of bitcoin","INTRO":"Reserve-backed Saga designed to win approval of financial and political establishment","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Some of the world’s best-known economists on Thursday announced plans to create what could be described as the thinking person’s cryptocurrency. Saga aims to address many of the criticisms frequently thrown at bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, to position itself as an alternative digital currency that is more acceptable to the financial and political establishment. It is being launched by a Swiss foundation with an advisory board featuring Jacob Frenkel, chairman of JPMorgan Chase International and former governor of the Bank of Israel; Myron Scholes, the Nobel Prize-winning economist; and Dan Galai, co-creator of the Vix volatility index. The Saga token aims to avoid the wild price swings of many cryptocurrencies by tethering itself to reserves deposited in a basket of fiat currencies at commercial banks. Holders of Saga will be able to claim their money back by cashing in the cryptocurrency. The currency also aims to avoid the anonymity afforded by bitcoin, which has raised financial crime concerns with regulators and bankers. Saga will require owners to pass anti-money laundering checks and allow national authorities to check the identity of a holder when required. “While blockchain technologies have gained growing acceptance, encryptic currencies have raised public policy concerns, since they are anonymous, unbacked and are highly volatile,” said Mr Frenkel. “I share these concerns and see great value in Saga’s vision to address them properly.” Deposits will be made in the IMF’s special drawing basket of currencies, which is heavily weighted in US dollars. The Saga foundation has raised $30m from investors, including Mangrove Capital Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, The Singulariteam Technology Group and Initial Capital. Instead of opting for a standard initial coin offering, the foundation is creating a different class of token that will to begin with be worth nothing but entitles its investors to a rising number of Saga as usage of the cryptocurrency grows. “We didn’t want to do an ICO,” said Ido Sadeh Man, founder and president of Saga. “It didn’t look reasonable to start a low-speculation and low-volatility vehicle by launching a high-speculation and high-volatility process.” Recommended Mr Sadeh Man said the Saga foundation had its development centre in Israel and expected to increase its staff from about 25 people to 70 by the end of this year. “We are not aiming for Saga to replace any national fiat currencies but to be a complementary global currency,” he said. “We are targeting people who are holding digital currencies and looking for safe harbours from the raging volatility.” Saga will be operated on a variable fractional reserve system. This means its price will be able to rise and the amount held on deposit will fall in proportion to the amount of usage achieved by Saga. Smart contracts will automatically increase the difference between the sale price and the reserve value on a sliding scale in response to demand. The Saga token will be available for purchase from the fourth quarter. Some cryptocurrencies have been tied to cash deposits before, such as Tether, which is linked to US dollar deposits but has faced scepticism about the opaqueness of those reserves. Several leading financial regulators have warned about the pitfalls of cryptocurrencies, including Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, and Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank.

He added: “We are staring into a firmament of which many people of my generation have very little comprehension.” His comments underline how legal experts and regulators are grappling with the rapid growth of fintech businesses, particularly those that are largely unregulated, such as cryptocurrencies. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said this month that it was time to regulate cryptocurrencies and their ecosystem. The G20 heads of state are set to discuss a global framework for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at their summit in Buenos Aires this week. Sir Geoffrey called for a global approach to regulating blockchain, the shared ledger technology that is the foundation for bitcoin but which is also being tested by many companies to improve their operations. “The regulatory approach to blockchain simply cannot be different in different countries because the technology is by definition borderless,” he said. “The risk of fraud will increase [with] use of the public blockchain for financial transactions,” he said. “Some start-ups will reduce the risk of fraud, but others will create new opportunities for fraud.” Recommended He cited a recent survey of more than 36,000 British bank employees published last week by the Banking Standards Board, a self-regulatory body, which found that 9 per cent did not agree that their colleagues were trustworthy. “That is a very large percentage of people,” said Sir Geoffrey. “A lack of integrity in financial services surfaces in every generation.” However, the judge also argued that Britain’s departure from the EU presented a big opportunity to establish English common law as the global legal standard for fintech businesses, such as blockchain technologies. “English law is certainly going to be well placed after we leave the EU to provide the legal framework for digital financial services,” he said, adding that London faced competition from Paris and Berlin to remain Europe’s fintech hub. He gave the example of smart contracts — the self-executing pieces of software code embedded into a blockchain system that can, for instance, automatically pay out on an insurance claim. “The law needs to be embedded in the code of the instruments we are seeking to regulate,” he said. There was a “symbiotic relationship” between the financial and legal systems, he said, adding that both needed “careful monitoring” to protect their integrity while embracing the changes delivered by the “digital revolution”. The British legal system would also need to adapt, he said, citing a McKinsey forecast that artificial intelligence could automate as much as 79 per cent of the judiciary. “We need a far speedier and less ponderous justice system to retain the confidence of the millennial generation,” he said, waving a smartphone to underline how people expect instant fulfilment in many areas of life and would demand the same of the legal system.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-21","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/b9b17762-2c0e-11e8-9b4b-bc4b9f08f381","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F0e376394-2789-11e8-9274-2b13fccdc744?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"HKEX working with ASX on blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Hong Kong’s stock exchange is working with its Australian counterpart to share information on blockchain, as global exchanges accelerate plans for the technology in an attempt to compete and cut costs. Charles Li, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, told the FT on Tuesday that the venue is “developing a much closer dialogue to understand what they’re doing, and sharing information…for sharing vendor relationships.” Speaking at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference, Mr Li said the exchange is looking to use blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin, in areas such as stock borrowing and lending, and for a number of trades that are transacted over-the-counter. He said HKEX is seeking to implement blockchain “where nobody wants to spend the money to do anything, but where the exchange can come out and say let’s use this cheap technology to do something that doesn’t affect the central order book.” He added that the “huge driver” prompting exchanges globally to consider blockchain is the pressure to cut costs. Blockchain, also called distributed ledger, is an electronic record of transactions which is continuously updated and verified in “blocks” of records. The ledger is shared on computer servers, guarded by cryptography. The Australian Securities Exchange became one of the first trading venues globally to commit to blockchain when it said at the end of last year that it would use the technology to clear and settle equities. ASX is working with Digital Asset Holdings, the company run by former JP Morgan Chase executive Blythe Masters, which has designed the software. Mr Li said that although HKEX started to build a blockchain-based private market for smaller firms to obtain financing two years ago, developments have been impacted by the state of software vendors in the sector. “Unfortunately this space changes so much that the vendors we chose… eventually evolved such that they’re not really useful to us, and we’re not interested in doing it ourselves.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Emma Dunkley","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-20","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/bea458ba-25fc-11e8-b27e-cc62a39d57a0","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F2b11b4be-2c30-11e8-97ec-4bd3494d5f14?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Swiss authorities tread wary path through ‘Crypto Valley’","INTRO":"Officials seek balance between encouraging new technologies and risking reputation","DETAILED_CONTENT":"“Bitcoin accepted here,” reads the sign at House of Wines in Zug. For Albert Osmani, the shop’s owner, allowing payment in the cryptocurrency was a smart move. He pulled off a public relations coup in the tiny Swiss Alpine town — and found a new profit source. In the time taken to convert payments into Swiss francs, the value of bitcoin often jumps, netting a gain. “I have had only positive experiences,” says Mr Osmani. Whether Zug has been so smart is less clear. The town has become a global hub for cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technologies they use, creating headlines two years ago by agreeing to accept bitcoin for small payments for some council services. The area has earned a reputation as “Crypto Valley”, with almost 200 blockchain companies. It hosts the foundation behind Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency after bitcoin. Johann Schneider-Ammann, economics minister, this year hailed Zug as a model for Switzerland to become the “crypto nation”, stealing a march on global rivals as technology spurs more developments. Thanks to Zug, Switzerland last year ranked second after the US in funds generated from “initial coin offerings” — when start-ups sell tokens or coins — to investors. The strategy has obvious risks, however. Cryptocurrencies have seen wild price swings, threatening big losses for investors. Worldwide, regulators warn that ICOs and crypto ventures may prove frauds, flops, fronts for criminal organisations or threats to the financial system. Zug must show its cryptocurrency credentials can outlast local marketing tricks and stave off regulatory threats. “My big worry is that the whole intransparency will lower Zug’s standing worldwide,” says Andreas Hürlimann, a local Green party councillor. “You don’t know from where to where the money is flowing, whether it is drug money for instance.” One Swiss finance specialist says: “I’m just waiting for Washington to call Bern and ask ‘what are you doing down there in Zug?’.” Zug’s modest size and tranquil setting beneath snow-covered peaks belie a buccaneering business spirit. For decades, low tax rates have attracted entrepreneurs, hedge funds and bankers. International companies in the canton of 124,000 people include Glencore, the global commodities trader. One of the first into the cryptocurrency wave was Johann Gevers, a South African technology entrepreneur who launched Monetas, a digital payment system, in 2013. At the time cryptocurrency and blockchain pioneers feared raids by legal authorities, he recalls. In the US, bitcoin pioneer Charlie Shrem was jailed in 2014 for his involvement with Silk Road, a black market website. A month after the Monetas launch, Danish computer entrepreneur Niklas Nikolajsen set up bitcoin Suisse, a cryptocurrency brokerage that last year carried out SFr3bn of transactions. Ethereum was launched by 20-year-old Russia-born Vitalik Buterin in 2014. Switzerland’s reputation for stability and its highly devolved political system — as well as strong libertarian streak — were attractive for the nascent industry. “Back then, you had to really fear you might be persecuted and shut down, and imprisoned by various governments,” says Mr Gevers. At a recent rally in Zurich, Steve Bannon, the firebrand former adviser to US president Donald Trump, argued that cryptocurrencies were part of the global populist anti-establishment movement and a reaction against central banks “that debase your currency”. One local insider is more cynical: “They say they are different to banks, that they are Robin Hoods — but we have Robin Hoods driving around in Lamborghinis.” Nevertheless, cryptocurrency pioneers see an affinity between revolutionary decentralised blockchain technologies and the Swiss tradition of local decision-making. “Nobody is here because they can get away from governments. They are here because there are gentle, helpful government structures,” says Marcelo Garcia, co-founder of CryptoExplorers.org, a global community of Blockchain experts who hold conferences in Zug. “If your payback is going to be only in 10 years, you don’t want things changing haphazardly.” The country’s historic neutrality also helps. “If someone says I have lost my [crypto] key, you need a mechanism for resolving the problem — maybe it is not such a bad idea to have the back-up keys held safely in Switzerland,” says Luzius Meisser, founder of the bitcoin Association Switzerland. In addition, Switzerland’s mountain bunkers are ideal for the “cold storage” — cut off from the internet for security — of cryptocurrency assets, says Arthur Vayloyan, chief executive of Bitcoin Suisse. Zug is not yet a crypto idyll. One problem is how to transact with local banks that mistrust wealth earned in the crypto world. Instead crypto pioneers have turned to banks in Liechtenstein or smaller private banks prepared to break ranks. “If they [the Swiss] don’t get that solved within the next six months, they risk the success of the [crypto] eco-system,” warns Mr Gevers. More crucially, Crypto Valley’s fortunes also depend on keeping investors happy. Many coin offerings are in effect donations; if promises were made to investors, strict securities market rules would probably apply. “These ICOs require blind trust in the founders. You can’t do much if the raised funds are misappropriated,” says Mr Meisser. Last year Tezos, which is developing a new blockchain technology, raised $232m in one of the largest ICOs to date, with proceeds managed by a Swiss not-for-profit foundation under the direction of Mr Gevers. The project became embroiled in rows between Tezos’s founders and Mr Gevers, who stepped down as the foundation’s president. Mr Gevers says he cannot comment given legal action started by those who put money into the project and have been angry at delays. [Cryptocurrency pioneers] say they are different to banks, that they are Robin Hoods — but we have Robin Hoods driving around in Lamborghinis Then there is the risk of politicians tightening the rules — perhaps in response to foreign pressure, such as the US-led action a decade ago against Swiss banks that helped overseas clients evade taxes. Local industry experts dismiss the possibility of foreign governments forcing a crackdown. “I don’t really see that coming. Crypto is a different beast — and the money would just go to offshore havens or somewhere,” says Mr Garcia. Nevertheless Swiss authorities have had to strike a balance between encouraging new technologies and risking the country’s reputation. “Switzerland remains under pressure to follow a ‘clean money’ strategy. It was hard work to get Switzerland off the blacklists — and there is of course no appetite for it to be back on them,” says Jan Seffinga, blockchain expert at Deloitte, the consultancy. Heinz Tännler, Zug canton’s finance director, says: “The risk is when you have ‘black sheep’. We have our eyes open. But there is never an opportunity without risks.” Finma, the Swiss financial regulator, last month issued new guidelines on ICOs, setting out how entrepreneurs would have to apply anti-money laundering and securities laws. Recommended While that has provided more clarity, and supported Switzerland’s “crypto nation” ambition, Zug authorities are wary about being too ambitious about their blockchain projects. Accepting bitcoin for council payments was “clearly a marketing gag,” says Mr Hürlimann. Dolfi Müller, Zug town council president, says: “We play the background music . . . We don’t have great plans — we don’t want to be a ‘smart city’ like Dubai. It’s step by step. It’s Asterix against Rome.” For some local crypto pioneers and analysts, that wariness is a concern when other cities are also promoting their credentials as crypto hubs. “Hong Kong and Singapore have also done a lot of the right things — and have big marketplaces on their doorsteps, lots of entrepreneurs and smart regulators,” says Daniel Diemers, Zurich partner at PwC Strategy\u0026, the consultant. Richard Olsen, founder and chief executive of Lykke, a Zug-based blockchain financial exchange, says the town — and the country — needs to seize the moment to follow through on its leadership while it can. “People come to Zug to see Crypto Valley and they just see letter boxes,” he says. “With every project there is on the federal, canton or city level, they should ask: what could we do with blockchain?”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ralph Atkins","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-20","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/2fb50f4e-2842-11e8-9274-2b13fccdc744","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F509b243e-2aa2-11e8-97ec-4bd3494d5f14?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Central banks are right to consider the merits of digital cash","INTRO":"The tenacity of bitcoin reflects dissatisfaction with current payment systems","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The refusal of bitcoin to just deflate and die, even after the supposed bursting of the crypto bubble, might reflect the extraordinary power of popular delusion. But it may also say something about our dissatisfaction with the current payment system — physical cash and credit cards — and the desire for a faster, cheaper and safer alternative. Fortunately, when not preoccupied by crypto bubbles or fraud, central bankers have been thinking about this problem. One solution under consideration, most prominently in Sweden but elsewhere too, is to introduce a digital version of physical cash. The most straightforward way of doing so would be to let the public open digital checking accounts at the central bank. Not only would such accounts displace most cash transactions, they would also give bank cards a run for their money, to the benefit of consumers. Funds can be transferred instantly within a central bank, without intermediaries or hidden fees. There are several concerns, but two give central bankers cold feet. First, an exodus of deposits could disrupt banks’ business models. Second, if it becomes too easy to convert bank deposits into central bank deposits, a run could overwhelm a bank in minutes. Both concerns are overblown. Moving payments to the central bank need not be destabilising. Only checking accounts are likely to move, not other deposits offering higher interest rates; that is hardly the end of banking as we know it. Bank fees from payments services would fall, as they already are doing, due to competition from the likes of PayPal. But the loss for banks is a gain for consumers. A system where a central bank provides payment services while banks focus on credit is more stable Although banks might push up lending rates to compensate, that is not necessarily a bad thing — certainly not in Europe, where a shift from bank to capital market funding is a policy goal. Above all, a system where a central bank provides payment services while banks focus on credit is more stable. It removes banks’ capacity to fund loans simply by issuing deposits and relying on borrowing to cover unexpected outflows. This should reduce the incidence of bank crises and taxpayer-funded bailouts in the name of rescuing the payments system. As for digital bank runs, it is true that in a crisis even non-checking deposits may want to fly to the safety of the central bank, and the capacity to do so with the click of a button would indeed make life difficult for crisis managers. But there is nothing about digital currency per se that prevents a central bank from slowing the process. The authorities could arguably manage the process in a more orderly way, without queues outside banks and without disrupting the broader payments system of transfers between central bank checking accounts. There is a more ambitious variant of the above: a “central bank coin” that resides on a blockchain, an electronic database of transactions. The central bank would issue coins against cash and banks’ reserves at the central bank. If it then stood ready to freely exchange coin, cash and reserves at par, the main problem plaguing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as money — extreme price volatility — would be resolved. A key advantage of a blockchain-based currency over central bank checking accounts, or indeed the current system, is security. A unitary ledger residing on a network is harder to tamper with than one in a single location. In an age where everything from elections to email is hackable, protecting the payments system from shocks to the liability side of banks should be high on the policy agenda. Certainly, there are issues with blockchain, including processing speed, energy use and safeguards against money laundering and terrorist financing. But these are problems of practice, not principle, and there are already solutions within reach.

Swift, which handles more than half of all high-value cross-border payments, said on Thursday that it had completed a “proof of concept” test of blockchain technology to reconcile international payments between the accounts of 34 banks. The test underlines how much of the world’s most established financial institutions are experimenting with blockchain technology to improve their performance under pressure from more technology-savvy challengers. Swift’s finding that the technology is still not ready for mainstream use echoes similar conclusions of many other top banks and regulators. While Swift said the test “went extremely well” it concluded that “further progress is needed” on the blockchain — or distributed ledger technology (DLT) — “before it will be ready to support production-grade applications in large-scale, mission-critical global infrastructures”. The Brussels-based messaging system, which is owned by about 11,000 banks, also said that many lenders would have to significantly overhaul their operations and systems before they could switch to a blockchain-based system to handle their cross-border payments. Swift said it had tested a “private confidential ledger” to record transactions related to the so-called Nostro accounts that banks use to fund their cross-border payments. It said the 28 banks that carried out live tests on the system found it could make the costly and slow process of reconciling their accounts more efficient and reduce the amount of money they needed to hold in various Nostro accounts around the world. “Although the proof of concept demonstrated DLT could improve Nostro liquidity management and reconciliation processes, it also revealed that the prerequisites will have to be met before banks can enjoy the full benefits of switching to a DLT process,” said Damien Vanderveken, head of research and development at Swift. Mr Vanderveken told the Financial Times that the test had showed there would be significant “operational challenges” to using blockchain technology for all of its 11,000 members. This is not least because the 28 banks that ran tests on the system required the creation of 528 sub-ledgers to avoid confidential information being seen by rival banks. To roll it out to all of Swift’s members, Mr Vanderveken estimated it would require 100,000 sub-ledgers to be created, making them extremely unwieldy to maintain, upgrade or configure. However, he said: “I am convinced that these obstacles will be overcome,” adding that Swift was determined to be “ready to roll it out when the technology is ready,” though he declined to predict how soon that would be. Swift has faced concerns about its security since cyber criminals stole almost $100m from the Bangladesh central bank two years ago by hacking into its systems to access its Swift codes. With several start-ups, such as Ripple, seeking to use blockchain technology to speed up and cut the cost of cross-border payments between banks, Swift has also been investing heavily to improve its own efficiency. The non-profit co-operative said recently that it had cut the time taken for money to move across borders to below 30 minutes for half the payments it handles.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-08","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/d75f9cca-2052-11e8-a895-1ba1f72c2c11","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fa33ba850-207d-11e8-8d6c-a1920d9e946f?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Trustworthy data will transform the world","INTRO":"The information revolution enables us to observe behaviour at mass scale as it happens","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The internet’s original sin was identified as early as 1993 in a New Yorker cartoon. “On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog,” the caption ran beneath an illustration of a pooch at a keyboard. That anonymity has brought some benefits. But it has also created myriad problems, injecting distrust into the digital world. If you do not know the provenance and integrity of information and data, how can you trust their veracity? That has led to many of the scourges of our times, such as cyber crime, identity theft and fake news. In his Alan Turing Institute lecture in London last week, the American computer scientist Sandy Pentland outlined the massive gains that could result from trusted data. The MIT professor argued that the explosion of such information would give us the capability to understand our world in far more detail than ever before. Most of what we know in the fields of sociology, psychology, political science and medicine is derived from tiny experiments in controlled environments. But the data revolution enables us to observe behaviour as it happens at mass scale in the real world. That feedback could provide invaluable evidence about which theories are most valid and which policies and products work best. The promise is that we make soft social science harder and more predictive. That, in turn, could lead to better organisations, fairer government, and more effective monitoring of our progress towards achieving collective ambitions, such as the UN’s sustainable development goals. To take one small example, Mr Pentland illustrated the strong correlation between connectivity and wealth. By studying the telephone records of 100,000 users in south-east Asia, researchers have plotted social connectivity against income. The conclusion: “The more diverse your connections, the more money you have.” This is not necessarily a causal relationship but it does have a strong causal element, he suggested. Similar studies of European cities have shown an almost total segregation between groups of different socio-economic status. That lack of connectivity has to be addressed if our politics is not to descend further into a meaningless dialogue. Data give us a new way to measure progress. For years, the Open Data movement has been working to create public data sets that can better inform decision making. This worldwide movement is prising open anonymised public data sets, such as transport records, so that they can be used by academics, entrepreneurs and civil society groups. However, much of the most valuable data is held by private entities, notably the consumer tech companies, telecoms operators, retailers and banks. “The big win would be to include private data as a public good,” Mr Pentland said. That goal has led some data scientists to push for the creation of independent data trusts that could pool such private information. But others argue it is always a bad idea to decrypt and centralise data no matter how good the intent. A better way to go, Mr Pentland argued, was to build on techniques such as secure multi-party computation, which allows the interrogation of decentralised, encrypted databases. MIT is helping to run these types of experiments with public and private sector partners in several countries, including France, Senegal and Colombia. This kind of technology enables public institutions to study aggregated private data sets without accessing sensitive commercial or personal details. For example, financial regulators could tot up the portfolios of collateralised debt obligations held by banks, or health providers could assess the success rates of medical procedures. Naturally, the evangelical wing of the blockchain movement argues that distributed ledger technology is the answer to almost every question. In a more balanced report published last week, the London-based software platform named Blockchain, after the technology, extolled its virtues but also highlighted its limitations. Perhaps the biggest is computational scalability. Nicolas Cary, one of Blockchain’s co-founders, says we are going through a “shake out” to determine the best technologies. “The promise is there, but a lot of hard work still needs to be done.” Blockchain may well be part of the answer, but it is clearly not all of it. Whoever designs the optimal architecture that facilitates data sharing without compromising security or privacy will help us to improve our society in extraordinary ways. It may also count as one of the biggest business opportunities of the 21st century. john.thornhill@ft.com","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Thornhill","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-05","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f8d1c624-2068-11e8-8d6c-a1920d9e946f","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fbc7374b6-241e-11e8-add1-0e8958b189ea?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"‘Anarchist-capitalists’ in São Paulo shake the money box","INTRO":"Led by city youth, old-school investors are turning to digital alternatives","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Tucked away on a winding avenue that drips with tropical foliage, a three-storey building has a new set of tenants. Instead of local rap artists and music producers who used to record albums from this studio in São Paulo’s bohemian neighbourhood of Vila Madalena, financial entrepreneurs are settling in. Dubbed “cryptocurrency house”, the contemporary space is home to Atomic Fund, a cryptocurrency hedge fund, one of a growing number of disrupter technology start-ups in Latin America’s biggest financial centre. There are signs that bitcoin, the world’s most widely traded virtual currency, is booming in Brazil. In December, it was reported that the number of bitcoin investors in the country had surpassed investors registered on the São Paulo stock exchange. Brazil now has more than 1.4m bitcoin investors (of 20m bitcoin accounts worldwide), compared with 619,000 in the stock market. Brazilian investors are putting money into start-ups working with blockchain, the digital infrastructure behind cryptocurrencies. Leading Brazilian private banks, such as Itaú and Bradesco, are dedicating more staff to blockchain research and expertise. Brazil had a head start in the digital stakes. When they had to deal with hyperinflation in the 1980s and 1990s, Brazilian banks looked to technology and most now have sophisticated online offerings for corporate and retail clients. São Paulo is at the forefront of blockchain initiatives and hosts Brazil’s three biggest bitcoin exchanges, Mercado bitcoin, Foxbit and Bitcambio. The volume of cryptocurrencies traded on them is modest, at less than 1 per cent of the global total, but the pace at which the Brazilian market is growing is attracting attention. About R$120m ($38m) in bitcoin was traded daily in February, says Fernando Ulrich, a cryptocurrency specialist at investment advisers XP Investimentos. “That’s more than the entire year’s worth of bitcoin trades in 2016 in Brazil [about R$115m]. There’s been a tremendous influx of new users.” From the vast wall of windows on the top floor of Atomic Fund’s new office, São Paulo’s skyscrapers appear small in the distance. “Brazilians do not trust their government and have a tendency to adopt technology trends quickly,” says Kenzo Tominaga, the hedge fund’s founder. “Cryptocurrencies are rebelling against the established [financial] system and are born out of the internet — that’s why they’re really catching on here.” Mr Tominaga and his three colleagues in charge of Atomic grew up in the city and describe themselves as “anarchist-capitalists”. All have experience in fintech, banking or asset management and say that to survive relentless bureaucracy, Brazilians have learnt to be creative — and that creativity is being applied to the digital payment sector. A cripplingly slow recovery from the recent years of recession — high unemployment rates have hit Brazil’s millennial generation particularly hard — makes any escape from government control and paperwork “super” attractive, says colleague Piero Gancia. At a co-working space across town, staff at Foxbit, Brazil’s second-largest bitcoin exchange, are celebrating. They have secured a new office to accommodate 80 employees. Guto Schiavon, the company’s chief operating officer, says only a year ago he was one of six. The exchange has 400,000 clients and traded R$3bn in bitcoin in 2017, just under half the R$7bn exchanged nationally. Mercado bitcoin, the largest exchange in Latin America, trades other cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin from its São Paulo base. Chief economist Luiz Roberto Calado says he expected 400,000 new clients to sign up in February, bringing Mercado Bitcoin’s total number to 1m. “Interest rates are falling in Brazil and there are scandals across well-known companies listed on the local stock exchange, so there is huge potential for our market if it is regulated,” Mr Calado says. “Lawmakers know that,” he adds, indicating that regulation is a becoming a key debating point. “I’m sure that blockchain technology will be applied here in Brazil,” says André Perfeito, chief economist at Gradual Investimentos, a fund manager in the city. “What I’m more sceptical about is bitcoin itself.” There is evidence of resistance among traditional banks to the trend for digital currencies, says Mr Perfeito. “Cryptos are not regulated in Brazil,” he adds. In January, Brazil’s securities regulator banned local investment funds from investing directly in cryptocurrencies, as opposed to investing in the technology around them. But the central bank’s decision not to prohibit them altogether, argues Mr Perfeito, shows it acknowledges the importance of the technology behind virtual currencies and that the trend is here to stay. For Mr Ulrich at XP, this year may be a “game changer” for legislation. “There are a lot of people interested and invested, and we are supposedly only at the embryonic stage,” he says. The central bank is “watchful”, he adds. Back in Vila Madalena, Mr Tominaga looks at his phone and logs in to Atomic’s platform, which allows investors to deposit virtual currencies in a “digital wallet”. They have access to a personal financial dashboard that tracks their portfolio in real time. There are no management fees and many clients receive the information via their Apple Watches. This March, the fund was the only Brazilian start-up selected to join eight others in Silicon Valley in the Boost VC Blockchain accelerator programme, funded by US venture capitalist Tim Draper. He made headlines by buying 30,000 bitcoin in 2014 and will invest up to $50,000 in the early-stage project. With such support and for all the millennial trappings, digital currencies in Brazil appear to be moving well beyond tech-savvy youth. “It’s the laymen, lawyers and old-money guys who are on it now,” Mr Tominaga says.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Lucinda Elliott","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-13","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f8bb2fce-1deb-11e8-aaca-4574d7dabfb6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F00ab6764-1e3a-11e8-956a-43db76e69936?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain groups adapt to changing regulatory environment","INTRO":"Small UK companies look to take advantage of popular and unconventional field","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Many of the companies working on blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies have chosen to raise funds by unconventional means. These include so-called “initial coin offerings”, whereby companies sell digital tokens to investors to fund projects without offering equity. Publicly listed companies that have announced forays into crypto-assets or distributed ledger technology have come under considerable scrutiny from regulators. Jay Clayton, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, launched a blistering attack in January on “public companies with no meaningful track record” in blockchain technology. The SEC, he added, was “looking closely at the disclosures of public companies that shift their business models to capitalise on the perceived promise of distributed ledger technology”. Most recently, it launched a review of Overstock.com, the US online retail group that launched its own digital coin — prompting a 10 per cent fall in the company’s shares. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, on Friday called for more rigorous oversight of cryptocurrencies, warning that banning them would be a less effective way of protecting consumers than regulating them. Big US companies, such as photography pioneer Eastman Kodak and former drinks business Long Island Iced Tea — rebranded as Long Blockchain — have grabbed headlines for their moves into the new technology. Smaller UK companies are also piling in. Some well-known businesses, such as Applied Blockchain, which announced earlier this year that the oil group Shell and private equity investor Calibrate had taken undisclosed minority stakes, have stayed private. Others have seen being public as their chosen route. Until late last year, Online Blockchain was an Aim-listed company called On-line, whose main asset was a stake in markets data site ADVFN. After formally changing its name in December, it completed a £1m share placing in January to raise working capital “to invest further in the development of blockchain projects as and when they arise”. Since its strategy shift, Online Blockchain has developed the PlusOneCoin as part of a joint project with ADVFN. The company says the cryptocurrency will allow social media users to interact with and rate their peers’ content, through the PlusOneCoin cryptocurrency. Online Blockchain says the digital wallet it has created along with ADVFN to hold its token “facilitates and introduces its large mature user base to cryptocurrency, blockchain mining and other aspects of this emergent sector”. It also “provides ADVFN users an educational platform to learn about cryptocurrencies, increased functionality on the ADVFN site as well as the potential of new products”. Shares in Online Blockchain almost tripled in value from 17p a share to 47p in October, when the company announced its move away from incubating internet and information businesses and towards the cryptocurrency sector. Although trading is fairly thin — as is typical for most Aim-listed stocks — the company has held most of its gains: it now sits at about 83p a share, giving it a market value of £7.1m, according to FactSet data. The company formerly known as Stapleton Capital, an investor in the telecoms sector, announced it January it was becoming Blockchain Worldwide and would look to invest in businesses that use the distributed ledger technology instead. Shares more than doubled on the morning after the name change was announced, with the board changing the scope of its investment criteria to focus on the blockchain technology industry. Despite saying it had identified opportunities, no transaction has yet been announced. Blockchain Worldwide’s shares climbed from just shy of 6p a share ahead of the announcement to a high of 10p a share shortly before the end of January. They have since fallen back to 7.5p a share, giving the company a market valuation of about £2.7m, according to Reuters. When Coinsilium started trading on the ISDX Growth Market — now the Nex Exchange Growth Market — on Christmas Eve in 2015, it claimed the mantle of the first initial public offering of a blockchain investment company on a recognised exchange. Although shares on the market are technically unlisted, they can be bought and sold through brokers, and Coinsilium raised about £1m. Set up in 2014, the company backs early-stage blockchain technology and digital token businesses, investing in some and providing advice to the founders of others to help them raise their first round of major funding. Companies in its portfolio include CoinDash, an Israel-based company which managed to overcome a hack of its token sale last year to launch a crypto-asset portfolio tracker called Blox this week. It also advises Gimli, a company apparently named after a dwarf from the Lord of the Rings, which is trying to capitalise on the burgeoning esports community. It offers “live stream crypto betting for gamers” using “smart contracts” on the Ethereum blockchain — essentially computer code that is automatically enforced when certain conditions are met.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Cat Rutter Pooley","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-02","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/9f92329e-1ad0-11e8-aaca-4574d7dabfb6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F5955fb98-1ad1-11e8-aaca-4574d7dabfb6?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Lucara Diamond replaces CEO, invests in blockchain platform","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Canada’s Lucara Diamond has appointed Eira Thomas, a founder of the company, to chief executive as it looks to modernise the diamond industry through the acquisition of a blockchain platform.

Clara applies algorithms to match rough diamond production with polished manufacturing demand. It also uses blockchain, the technology behind digital currency bitcoin, to track diamonds as they move through the supply chain. Diamond producers are increasingly looking at blockchain as a solution to improving traceability of diamonds.

Technology company Calastone said blockchain, which is a giant online ledger, could revolutionise the processes involved in buying and selling funds, generating large savings for investors in the process. It estimated that based on daily trade volumes of funds in the UK, Ireland, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Australia, £1.9bn — or $2.7bn — in savings was possible. Ken Tregidgo, deputy chief executive of Calastone, said significant cost savings could be made by using distributed market infrastructure. For each transaction, different companies, ranging from transfer agents to asset managers, often have to input the same information, which is time-consuming and can be prone to errors. “That is a cost that is being paid and is ultimately being paid by the end investor, by you and me,” he said. Andrew Tomlinson, chief marketing officer at Calastone, added: “There is £1.9bn that is being burnt in the cost of buying the fund rather than accruing and adding value to the investor.” Calastone calculated the potential cost savings of moving to distributed and mutualised market infrastructure by using data from a Deloitte study on fund expenses. By stripping out those costs that are traditionally incurred during the buying and selling process, but could be moved to blockchain, it calculated potential savings. Last year, Calastone said it had successfully used blockchain to buy and sell mutual funds under test conditions. It said the technology proved capable of processing transactions equivalent to a full day’s trades sourced from across its client base, which spans more than 1,400 fund distribution and asset manager clients in 35 countries. The company plans to move its network on to blockchain technology in 2019 in a move Olivia Vinden, principal at Alpha FMC, the asset and wealth management consultancy, said could be revolutionary. “It is quite an exciting step for the industry.” She added that there was a “lot of duplication” when it comes to processes involved in buying and selling funds. “There is definitely room to cut costs.” There are several initiatives investigating how blockchain can be used in the fund industry, ranging from settling transactions to trading securities. Earlier this year, BNP Paribas Asset Management said it had successfully completed a full end-to-end fund transaction test using blockchain technology. The project involved a tie-up between BNP Paribas Securities Services’ blockchain programme, Fund Link, and FundsDLT, a blockchain-based decentralised platform for fund transaction processing. The UK government recently set out an ambition to create a blockchain-enabled digital fund that would use distributed ledger technology to streamline back-office fund administration functions in a bid to increase speed and reduce cost.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Attracta Mooney","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-02-22","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/fcc7d27a-186e-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F235a9b62-18af-11e8-9c33-02f893d608c2?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Switzerland’s stock exchange chairman calls for ‘e-franc’","INTRO":"Romeo Lacher says a crypto version of currency would give country a digital lead","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Switzerland should launch a cryptocurrency version of the Swiss franc as part of the Alpine country’s attempt to steal a competitive lead in digital technologies, its stock exchange chairman has urged. Romeo Lacher told Financial Times that an “e-franc” backed by the Swiss central bank would boost the local economy as well as electronic payment systems which were increasingly replacing cash. “I believe there would be a lot of upsides, we would be strongly supportive,” he said. Cryptocurrencies are controversial among central bankers, many of whom are sceptical about volatile currencies such as bitcoin becoming widely used. There is also uncertainty about whether monetary authorities should introduce digital versions of their own currencies. Sweden’s Riksbank, one of the most advanced in its thinking, has hinted strongly it will introduce an e-krona but the more conservative Swiss National Bank has not indicated it was considering such a move, saying there was “no need” for a crypto franc in response to Mr Lacher’s comments. Cash-based and cashless payment transactions in Switzerland were working smoothly, it added. Mr Lacher is chairman of SIX Group, which is owned by Swiss banks and provides financial infrastructure services, including cashless payment systems, as well as share trading. “An e-franc under the control of the central bank would create a lot of synergies — so it would be good for the economy,” he said. “I don’t like cash.” Earlier this year, Johann Schneider-Ammann, economics minister, said Switzerland wanted “to be the crypto-nation”. The country has become a hub for initial coin offerings, whereby start-ups sell digital tokens to investors, and a Swiss foundation is behind Ethereum, the second-biggest digital currency. Mr Lacher welcomed the government’s ambitions despite the potential risks. “I think the strategic direction is good,” he said. “But it’s like going into fog. You don’t know what you will see on the other side. Many mistakes will be made, but we will also learn a lot and I am sure, we will be successful.” He added: “My worry is that until recently, the value of cryptocurrencies has only been in one direction — up. After the first ICO to collapse, there will be burnt fingers.” My worry is that until recently, the value of cryptocurrencies has only been in one direction — up. After the first ICO to collapse, there will be burnt fingers The risk for central banks if they do not launch digital versions of their currencies is that they hand control of payment systems to a “wild west” private sector. In a report last year, the Riksbank said payment facilities could become concentrated among fewer operators, making them more vulnerable to disruption. An e-krona would give consumers access to “risk-free” central bank money. Axel Weber, chairman of UBS, said last year central banks should be more open to creating digital versions of their currencies, which he said could offer significant benefits to society. As in other countries, Switzerland’s biggest financial institutions hope to develop applications using the blockchain distributed ledger technology behind bitcoin, but have steered clear of facilitating new cryptocurrencies or ICOs. Mr Lacher confirmed that SIX Group would maintain that trend. “We have actually no plans to admit trading of cryptocurrencies or ICOs. But we see a lot of advantages for blockchain across our businesses,” he said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ralph Atkins","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-02-25","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/5a7b09bc-17a9-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F7bf116da-17aa-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Platts deploys blockchain to track oil storage data in UAE","INTRO":"Move is one of the first commercial uses of the technology in the energy business","DETAILED_CONTENT":"S\u0026P Global Platts has deployed a blockchain network for reporting oil storage data in the UAE, in one of the first real-world commercial applications of the technology to go live in the energy industry.

The Platts and Fujairah storage reporting system is the first known application to go live and the companies said they hoped it paved the way for broader adoption of the technology. “The new technology improves the manual and unstructured process by which the terminal operators communicate their weekly inventory numbers to FEDCom,” Platts said in a statement. “The new solution also alleviates the need for FEDCom to undertake manual validation and aggregation of each terminal operator’s numbers, reducing the scope for human error.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"David Sheppard","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-02-22","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/52820f90-1307-11e8-940e-08320fc2a277","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F188209dc-004a-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Switzerland sets out guidelines to support initial coin offerings","INTRO":"Regulator makes clear when anti-money laundering and securities laws apply","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Switzerland’s financial supervisor has bucked the trend of global regulators cracking down on cryptocurrencies by announcing guidelines that should help local initial coin offerings, where start-up companies sell digital tokens to investors. The Finma financial authority hopes to support the ICO market and boost blockchain technologies by clarifying when entrepreneurs will have to apply anti-money laundering and securities laws. Regulators around the world have taken an increasingly sceptical view of cryptocurrencies and China and South Korea have banned ICOs. But the Swiss government believes they could offer an economic opportunity. Johann Schneider-Ammann, economics minister, said last month that Switzerland wanted “to be the crypto nation”. Of the 10 biggest proposed initial coin offerings, four have used Switzerland as a base, according to PwC. More than 100 requests for guidance have been received by Finma. Digital pioneers have been attracted to the affluent Alpine country because it offers a cluster of rich investors and technology specialists, as well as tax and regulatory advantages. Mark Branson, Finma’s chief executive, said on Friday that the regulator’s “balanced approach“ to ICO projects would allow “legitimate innovators to navigate the regulatory landscape and so launch their projects in a way consistent with our laws protecting investors and the integrity of the financial system.” Finma’s guidelines would increase the number of Swiss ICOs, predicted Oliver Bussmann, president of the Crypto Valley Association in the canton of Zug. “It’s about establishing a sustainable business in Switzerland - and not just about raising capital and moving on,” he said. “If you remove uncertainty, it attracts more business.” Arnaud Masset, market analyst at Swissquote bank, said the new rule book “definitely sets up Switzerland as a crypto-friendly country and will encourage new crypto-start-ups” Finma’s move is intended to help the fast-growing cryptocurrency industry ahead of a broader review launched last month by the Swiss government, which will also consider possible legislative changes. The department for international finance has said its intention is to make Switzerland an “attractive location” for ICOs. The government ICO working group is expected to report by the end of the year. ICOs build on the blockchain distributed ledger technology behind bitcoin. As well as encouraging speculative investors, they threaten to disrupt the venture capital industry by slashing the cost of fundraising — and opening up the possibility of investing in start-ups to anyone with a smartphone. Recommended Globally, regulators worry about cryptocurrencies being used by criminals and for money laundering, as well as the risks to investors, and traditional banks have sought to prevent them from infiltrating the conventional financial system. The UK and US have been among those countries advising caution. Finma’s guidelines identify three categories of ICOs. The first are “payment ICOs”, which are transferable and can function as means of payment. The regulator said these would have to comply with anti-money laundering regulations but would not be treated like financial securities. Second are “utility ICOs”, which will not qualify as securities if their only purpose is to confer digital access rights to an application or service. Third are “asset ICOs,” which will be treated like equities or bonds if, for example, they pay dividends or interest, or give rights to earnings streams. These will be subject to strict securities law requirements. Carlos Domingo, founder and managing partner at SPiCE VC, a venture capital firm which invests in ICOs, called Finma’s guidance “the most positive thing I’ve seen from anyone”, meaning other regulators. “I think people will be looking at Switzerland more now because the guidance is very clear,” said Mr Domingo, who is based in Dubai.

However, technologists and executives warn that blockchain technology is still developing and the high-profile name changes and often giddy reaction in the stock market are far removed from the real-world experiments. It is an electronic database of transactions, whereby new deals are added to the chain and then stamped and protected with a mathematical equation. The database is shared among hundreds of other computers, or “nodes” on the network, to make it virtually impossible for one agent to change it. These nodes use their computing power and compete to verify and decode the latest transaction. This is then appended as a “block” to the chain. Its ability to offer a verifiable, immutable and public record is what attracts many advocates. “It can do for the nearly free and frictionless transfer of assets what the internet did for the nearly free and frictionless transfer of information,” says Jonathan Johnson, an executive at Overstock.com, an online retailer that accepts payment in virtual currencies. Its chief use is as the system behind most of the hundreds upon hundreds of virtual coins that are being created, stored and traded online — of which bitcoin is the best-known. Estonia uses distributed ledgers for the public to follow court, legal and democratic procedures. But interest in its potential is far greater, generating great discussion at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos. Some countries, such as Russia and China, are interested in creating their own virtual currencies. Sectors from pharmaceuticals to shipping and agriculture are looking at it as a way to streamline record-keeping and improve inventory management through tracking systems. Financial markets are among the most enthusiastic adopters. Equity funding into companies building on blockchain technology hit $1bn last year, across 215 deals, according to data from CB Insights, a research group. Ventures such as the bank-backed R3 consortium have raised more than $100m. Crédit Agricole, the French lender, on Thursday took a small equity stake in Setl, the UK blockchain technology developer. Many institutions — including bulge bracket banks and fund managers — hope that a real-time ledger could automate their creaky and expensive back office systems, saving them millions. Several test cases are planned, such as the effort by Australia’s stock exchange to replace its system for clearing and settling trades with blockchain. CLS, the world’s largest currency settlement service, is drawing up plans. Setl has more than 20 institutions on its Iznes record-keeping platform for European funds. “People who are working with us trust us. We’re seen as a really specialist market,” says Peter Randall, chief executive of Setl. Development is slow while institutions become accustomed to blockchain technology’s biggest features — that the records are public but the owner of the digital currency is anonymous and therefore untraceable. Many are creating their own “permissioned” distributed ledgers, where only those with authorisation can access the network. Some are exploring ways to build privacy options into the technology — for example, the ability to mask certain parts of the data such as trade or customer information. “Right now any kind of corporate blockchain initiative is using multiple platforms and coins and building their own proprietary technology on top of it,” says Jalak Jobanputra, founder of New-York based venture capital fund Future/Perfect Ventures. “There isn’t anything off the shelf right now that works for these consortia.” It has also been held back by the troubled reputation of its associated asset, bitcoin. The anonymity afforded to bitcoin users means it has been used to enable money laundering and organised crime. Some experts have questioned whether the technology can be scaled to process thousands of deals and payments per second that other electronic systems routinely handle. As the market develops watchdogs are also weighing up new specific regulations targeting the technology. “There is a lot of focus on the potential conflict between blockchain and data protection laws,” says Sue McLean, a partner in Baker McKenzie’s IT and commercial practice division. The current hype around blockchain is partly because of its link to the mania in cryptocurrencies. More than 1,500 have been launched, eight times the number of recognised government-backed currencies, according to CoinMarketcap.com. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) — in which blockchain-based start-ups issue their own digital “coins” — have created more incentives for the public to get involved in a nascent market. CB Insights estimates blockchain start-ups using ICO funding pulled in five times as much as equity funding last year, across 800 deals. But critics say none of the future uses of blockchain technology would make the cryptocurrencies more valuable. Steven Wieting, global chief investment strategist at Citi Private Bank, says the interest is a further indication of a “bull market psychology” in broader global markets. “This is evident in the very mild impact that negative events have had in market pricing. The willingness of so many to speculate in cryptocurrencies, an unproven financial innovation separate from the underlying blockchain technology, may be a symptom,” he says.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hannah Murphy Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-02-02","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/7010982c-0800-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fb0573f4e-083c-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"‘Crypto crazy’ Japanese mystified by virtual heist","INTRO":"The $500m theft of XEM coins by an anonymous hacker is threatening the country’s faith in cryptocurrencies","DETAILED_CONTENT":"As she sat in her office last Friday Komugi Yamazaki, director at a celebrity news website, former “idol” girl band member and voracious cryptocurrency investor, received an unusual email. Her favourite virtual currency exchange, Coincheck — advertised on prime time television by one of Japan’s most famous comedians and trusted with millions of her yen — was no longer allowing withdrawals of a coin called XEM. Ms Yamazaki, in common with armies of young Japanese entranced by the crypto boom, had been building stocks of XEM for months, ritually re-investing as the price grew ever higher. She was about to dismiss the email as a bit of software maintenance. Then came the worried tweets from prominent Japanese social media figures circulating rumours and news snippets, followed by full-blown panic. Her precious XEM, she soon realised, had been stolen by a hacker in one of history’s biggest heists. “I totally believed in Coincheck. I trusted it,” says Ms Yamazaki, who holds trading accounts at four other exchanges and has become an expert in exploiting price gaps between them. “They always talked about security. But that was just talk.” The theft of 523m XEM — worth roughly $500m — has brought back memories of Mt Gox, another Tokyo-based exchange, which collapsed after a similar hack in 2014, leaving investors ruined and bringing the first bitcoin boom to an ugly end. For young crypto-traders such as Ms Yamazaki, “to Gox” has entered the vocabulary as the verb for an exchange’s collapse. But for the Japanese authorities, which have led the world in legitimising cryptocurrencies through regulation, it is a horrifying reminder of what financial innovation can cost. A third of the world’s bitcoin exchanges were hacked between 2009 and 2015, say US authorities. Technical and legal advisers to the Japanese government are even blunter about the vulnerabilities. As the Coincheck debacle unfolds, the credibility of the Financial Services Agency hangs in the balance. Unidentified hacker sends 10 XEM, worth about $10, from Coincheck to their own traceable wallet Having penetrated the company’s security and found a fortune in XEM sitting in a “hot wallet”, the hacker then executes six separate transactions over an eight-minute period and steals 520m XEM, worth roughly $500m The hacker starts sending the coins on to other digital wallets Another 1.5m coins are taken A further 1m XEMs are taken from the Coincheck vaults The final 800,000 XEMs are removed Coincheck discovers the theft and raises the alarm The Coincheck robbery comes amid a wider wobble in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and others are on the slide after an astounding boom that in some cases propelled prices a hundred-fold higher in the final few months of 2017. Japanese investors fuelled that run, their often leveraged trading running at 40 per cent of the global total. As China and South Korea attempt to ban virtual currencies, while questions build over the Taiwanese-based exchange Bitfinex and the cryptocurrency Tether, the future of the boom may depend on whether Ms Yamazaki gets her XEM back. Yusuke Otsuka, Coincheck’s chief operating officer , enjoyed the cryptocurrency boom as much as anybody. At 5pm on Thursday January 25, just hours before the robbery, he was bragging about it. “It’s a modern-day gold rush,” he told a reporter from the Nikkei business daily. “Cryptocurrency exchanges are already down to 1.5 players. We’re top and bitFlyer are about half our size.” Coincheck had a reputation as the simplest, most user-friendly exchange in Japan and the country was going crypto-crazy. Its managers, led by 27-year-old chief executive Koichiro Wada, were becoming very, very rich. In the early hours of January 26 a different kind of user found Coincheck all too friendly. Like a cat burglar in the dead of night, a hacker penetrated the company’s security and found a fortune in XEM sitting in a “hot wallet”, a computer connected to the internet. Best practice is to keep cryptocurrency in a “cold wallet”, isolated from the network. There is still no information on the location of the hacker, their identity or how the theft was carried out. But some details are visible in the XEM blockchain. At two minutes past midnight, as if doubting the treasure before their eyes, the hacker sent just 10 XEM, worth about $10, from Coincheck to their own traceable wallet. Then they plunged in and rifled the digital vault. Recommended Over the next eight minutes, in six separate transactions, the hacker stole 520m XEM. Valuing the XEM at last week’s market price, around $1 per coin, it was one of the largest thefts in history, on a level with the capers pulled by bank robbers or art thieves. Perhaps shocked by their haul, the hacker did nothing for the next couple of hours; or at least there was no movement on the blockchain. At around 3am, the hacker started to send the coins on to other digital wallets, but Coincheck’s systems were still wide open. At 3.35am, they took another 1.5m coins. At 4.33am, it was 1m more, then at 8.26am, they helped themselves to the last 800,000. Coincheck was cleaned out. The vault was empty, but it took time for the bank manager to realise it. Coincheck staff went to work on Friday as usual. But it was 11.25am before they noticed something wrong, starting a desperate scramble as word dripped out and a crowd of investors and journalists began to gather outside their office in Tokyo’s trendy Shibuya district. Late in the evening, almost 24 hours after the hacker struck, an ashen-faced Mr Wada and Mr Otsuka bowed in apology to the TV cameras. “I deeply apologise to the customers we have troubled,” Mr Otsuka said. XEM, pronounced “Zem”, is the built-in digital currency of a system called NEM, one of a number of second-generation blockchains, such as Ethereum, designed as a platform for companies to build applications. From less than one US cent in January 2017, the price of XEM had risen more than 10,000 per cent by the time of the hack. Coincheck has vowed to repay the 260,000 affected customers at a rate of 80 cents per XEM — a total of $422m. The crucial question for investors such as Ms Yamazaki is whether it has the funds to do so. The company declined to comment on its finances, but based on its trading volumes, rivals estimate that Coincheck may have earned revenues of $2m-$3m a day during the cryptocurrency boom, with customer assets in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as well as XEM of $5bn at the time of the hack. The value of those assets will have fallen in line with the cryptocurrency sell-off. A crucial question is whether Coincheck has large cryptocurrency holdings on its own account. That could give it the reserves needed to pay. It is also common to negotiate with hackers, say rivals, and Coincheck may be able to ransom its coins for a lesser sum in bitcoin or another more usable currency. The NEM Foundation, which issues XEM, cannot recover the coins. But it has tagged them, like banknotes with serial numbers, so exchanges can tell if the hacker tries to upload stolen coins. That highlights the curious nature of the crime. Coincheck and its customers have lost but it is not clear who has gained. “If those XEM are never moved or spent, that decreases the supply and makes the rest of the XEM in the system more scarce and thus more valuable,” says Jeff McDonald, NEM Foundation vice-president. “But if a hacker is able to sell them, he can flood the market and sell for cheap. That’s the opposite example of high supply and low demand. Time will tell which scenario plays out.” As the broader crypto market slides, the price of XEM dropped to 50 cents yesterday. For Japan’s FSA, humiliated by a hack its regulation was supposed to prevent, Coincheck has exposed the agency’s lack of crypto competence, say critics. “They cannot understand what the token is, the real function of the blockchain, what is the hot wallet, what is the cold wallet. At the beginning of last year their knowledge was very limited,” says Ken Kawai, legal adviser to the Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association. The FSA’s instinct now is to crack down. It raided Coincheck yesterday and has warned Japan’s remaining 31 exchanges to improve their security. It has also hired external IT experts to conduct inspections and set information security guidelines. Roughly 100 operators who have applied for licences now face a long wait. Yet the FSA does not want to snuff out an entrepreneurial hotspot. So-called fintech, with cryptocurrencies a prime example, is part of Tokyo’s industrial strategy. The aim is to create growth in the country’s moribund financial sector. “When they [the FSA] were considering this regulation, they thought of the entities involved as start-ups, not as big companies. For that reason, they thought the securities law was not suitable: it was too heavy and would kill innovation,” says Mr Kawai. “Because of what the FSA did, Japan became the first country in the world to define a crypto exchange business. Now it seems they want to regulate crypto but continue to encourage innovation on blockchain.” But even as the regulator plans its next move, Coincheck ponders extinction and the price of bitcoin falls 40 per cent since the start of the year, Ms Yamazaki and other investors are defiant in their support. “We are still crazy for crypto,” she says checking the prices on her phone. “If I’m worried about anything, it’s that Coincheck said they would refund us in yen. That is rude. We want to be paid back in XEM.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Leo Lewis Robin Harding","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-02-02","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/7b0d7660-03ea-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F9b603130-0400-11e8-9e12-af73e8db3c71?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Coincheck promises refund after $500m cryptocurrency heist","INTRO":"Japanese exchange apologises after hacker steals units belonging to 260,000 customers","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck said it would repay customers after falling victim to one of the world’s biggest heists. The company said its systems were penetrated by a hacker in the early hours of Friday morning. The intruder made off with 523m units of the cryptocurrency XEM belonging to 260,000 customers. The $500m hack shows the vast sums being made and lost in the cryptocurrency boom, the vulnerability of decentralised money to theft and the wild west criminality that is possible in the new world of blockchain. “I deeply apologise to the customers we have troubled,” said Yusuke Otsuka, chief operating officer of Coincheck, as the young founders of Japan’s second largest cryptocurrency exchange struggled through a tense press conference. The scale of the theft is comparable to the £292m ($414m) City bonds robbery in 1990, the $500m Gardner art heist the same year or the approximately $500m bitcoin hack that led to the 2014 collapse of cryptocurrency exchange Mt Gox. In a website announcement on Sunday, Coincheck said it would repay holders from company funds at a rate of ¥88.5 per XEM, indicating it would try to stay in business. The valuation is less than the ¥104 price the day before the hack or XEM’s current trading price of ¥112. Coincheck said it was still deciding when and how to repay. The net worth of Coincheck, and hence its ability to cover the debt, is unclear. The exchange’s future may depend on whether other customers demand to withdraw their funds. “They basically lost half a billion dollars worth of XEM,” said Jeff McDonald, vice-president of the NEM Foundation, which issued XEM. “If they had a billion dollars in the bank they’d be able to cover the losses pretty easily. I don’t know how much money they have.” NEM is one of a number of second-generation blockchain systems designed as a platform for companies to build applications. XEM, pronounced “Zem”, is its built-in digital currency. Mr McDonald ruled out a “hard fork” to recover the stolen coins. In a hard fork, developers roll back the state of the blockchain to before the disputed transaction. The old blockchain still exists, but if users adopt the forked version, the theft becomes irrelevant. Recommended “We don’t consider that to be an option at all because the NEM system is working correctly,” said Mr McDonald. The NEM Foundation has instead moved to “tag” the stolen coins, making them similar to banknotes with recorded serial numbers and thus hard for the hackers to use. “We’re currently reaching out to exchanges to try and halt any deposits that are made with those XEMs,” said Mr McDonald. Coincheck said the stolen funds were stored in a so-called “hot wallet”. A hot wallet is a computer connected to the internet and thus accessible to a hacker. Best practice in the industry is to keep most funds in a “cold wallet” held offline. Coincheck said it had reported the theft to the police and Japan’s Financial Services Agency. According to local media, the FSA has ordered all the country’s cryptocurrency exchanges to check their security and may issue a business improvement order to Coincheck. Japanese private investors were at the heart of a tenfold surge in the price of bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, during 2017. Japan is one of the few countries to authorise and regulate cryptocurrency exchanges.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Robin Harding","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-28","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/790d9506-0175-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F1e49bda6-f62c-11e7-a4c9-bbdefa4f210b?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Silicon Valley investors line up to back Telegram ICO","INTRO":"Kleiner Perkins, Benchmark, Sequoia bid to join messaging app’s $1.2bn fundraising","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Some of Silicon Valley’s leading investors are lining up to buy into a much-hyped initial coin offering by Telegram, the encrypted messaging service that is seeking $1.2bn to build a virtual economy within its app. Venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield \u0026 Byers, Benchmark and Sequoia Capital have each told the company they want to invest $20m, according to three people with knowledge of the deals. ICOs are a way for early-stage companies to raise money for blockchain projects, without selling equity, by issuing virtual tokens or coins which can be bought by investors. While some coins have already produced high returns in secondary sales, the ICO market has been largely unregulated, and offers investors next to no protection. Sequoia and Kleiner declined to comment, and Benchmark did not respond to requests for comment. The interest from such well-known Silicon Valley investors, which have backed some of the US’s biggest tech companies including Google and Amazon, highlights growing fears by some of the sector’s biggest financiers that promising start-ups are bypassing traditional capital. Telegram’s outsized ICO is controversial, with some blockchain experts doubtful that it can match its vaulting ambition and sceptical of its motives for raising the cash, at a time when it lacks other revenue streams. Pavel Durov, Telegram’s founder and chief executive, launched Russia’s biggest social network VKontakte, and left the country in 2014 after claiming the government pressured him to censor information posted by opposition activists. Mr Durov has since relocated Telegram’s team to Dubai. Meanwhile, the encrypted messaging app has gained some 170m users. According to documents distributed by Telegram to potential investors and seen by the Financial Times, the company plans to build a virtual economy where its “users can provide the critical mass to push cryptocurrencies towards widespread adoption”. Telegram, whose libertarian stylings and focus on privacy mirrors semi-anonymous bitcoin, is the social medium of choice for online cryptocurrency communities. “It’s the Warren Buffett school of invest in what you know,” said Steven Nerayoff, an entrepreneur and legal architect behind the ICO of Ethereum, a cryptocurrency. Telegram is planning to build a brand new blockchain for its cryptocurrency rather than build on an existing technology such as Ethereum, a popular route for ICO ventures. Its “Telegram Open Network” (TON) will be built across multiple cryptographically secure distributed ledgers and support services from file storage to secure identification. Recommended TON promises to offer entrepreneurs access to Telegram’s large audience by creating, for example, an advertising exchange and virtual storefronts where the TON coin will be used for payments. Telegram’s road map suggests TON can be fully set up by mid-2019. A San Francisco cryptocurrency investor, who passed on the round and declined to be named, called the “hyperbolic claims” a “huge red flag”. Telegram’s ICO is trying to raise $600m by the end of February in a round open only to large investors, who are being given a discount to the pricing in a $600m public round that will follow in March. Mr Durov is burning the $300m fortune he had when he left Russia to run Telegram. According to its website, the company runs on a “generous donation” from Mr Durov, and “making profits will never be an end-goal”. Documents seen by the FT put Telegram’s 2017 budget at $70m.

The fundraising will finance “an infinite sharding paradigm” achieved through “a variant of the Byzantine Fault Tolerant protocol”. ICO marketing documents are famously abstruse. What is different about this cash call is that some serious investors are taking it seriously. The dreamers and schemers who launch ICOs all have big plans. Most do not have a network across which their funny money — and the blockchain technology that drives it — can spread. Telegram, in contrast, operates a messaging app. This is popular among cryptocurrency fans for its high levels of encryption. They could constitute a ready-made network across which Telegram’s digital dough is exchanged. That suggests an association with blockchain applications envisaged by those stiffs from the world of fiat money. Some stock exchanges hope to distribute blockchain technology across their own well-established networks. Accenture estimates that could save the top investment banks $12bn a year in reconciliation costs. There would also be validation for cryptocurrencies in Telegram backing from the likes of Sequoia Capital. Venture capitalists expect a proportion of bets to crash and burn. Even so, cryptos are in danger of becoming respectable. Futures exchanges have begun offering bitcoin contracts. Semi-penitent former tax haven Switzerland wants “to be the crypto-nation”. Sooner or later, steelier states will shield the policy tool of fiat money by squashing unregulated cryptos. Telegram, run from Dubai by Russians, might attract scrutiny if, by then, it had become an system for exchanging value secretly across borders.

Not in Switzerland. The affluent Alpine country wanted “to be the crypto-nation”, Johann Schneider-Ammann, economics minister, told journalists as he arrived for a private crypto finance conference in St Moritz last week. Of the 10 biggest proposed initial coin offerings — by which start-ups raise funds by selling tokens — four have used Switzerland as a base, according to PwC. The burgeoning ICO industry is burnishing Switzerland’s business friendly reputation and sometimes buccaneering spirit — a reputation spoilt by the past decade’s scandals over the help its traditional private banks gave to wealthy clients in evading tax. But it has created a dilemma for Swiss politicians and regulators: just how far should they go in encouraging a digital “wild west”? As Mr Schneider-Ammann spoke in St Moritz, the government in Bern announced an ICO working group to consider possible actions by regulators and lawmakers. Separately, the Finma financial regulator is expected soon to give an update on how it is policing ICOs. “We think there is huge potential — but the market is not as disciplined as we want,” says Jörg Gasser, state secretary at the Swiss finance ministry. “We want it [the ICO market] to prosper but without compromising standards or the integrity of our financial markets.” “They want Switzerland to be the place to make it happen — but they don’t want to be seen as the ‘wild west’. It is Swiss pragmatism,” says Martin Eckert, partner at MME, a Swiss law firm. Digital pioneers say Switzerland emerged as an ICO hub because it has a cluster of rich investors and technology specialists. The small canton of Zug, near Zurich, has unofficially become “Crypto Valley”. The Crypto Valley industry association says it receives five to ten inquiries a day from start-ups around the world interested in how to do a Swiss ICO. ICOs build on the Blockchain distributed ledger technology behind bitcoin. As well as fuelling the fantasies of speculative investors, they threaten to disrupt the venture capital industry by slashing the cost of fundraising — and opening up the possibility of investing in start-ups to anyone with a smartphone. Some practitioners dislike the term ICOs because it suggests they are just get-rich-quick schemes which seek to avoid cumbersome investor protection regulations. Proponents argue that many “tokens” offer access to services or property rights and are not meant as speculative investments. An alternative is to call them “token generating events”. Other EU countries and the US have warned of the dangers of ICOs — and China and Korea have banned them. But another reason for Switzerland’s crypto success, argue proponents, has been its openness to business innovation. Mr Eckert at MME says: “Swiss regulators are among the few that really have a deep understanding of the technology and how it works.” Nevertheless, Finma last September struck a note of caution, warning it was investigating “a number” of ICO cases for possible breaches of regulations, including on preventing money laundering and the financing of terrorism. China, South Korea, Vietnam, Russia US, UK, European Union, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, Singapore Switzerland, Gibraltar, Isle of Man, Cayman Islands, Mauritius Kari Larsen, attorney at Reed Smith in New York, says Switzerland’s approach was pragmatic but also “may be to a certain extent opportunistic”. It could face competition from places such as Gibraltar — leading to damaging competition to attract ICOs. “Just being welcoming, without also looking where consumer and market protection may be appropriate, would be short sighted,” Ms Larsen says. Digital purists argue no action is needed by politicians or regulators. The government “should be incredibly welcoming. It is a huge opportunity for Switzerland,” says Richard Olsen, founder and chief executive of Lykke, a Swiss company building a Blockchain based financial exchange. Mr Olsen argues technology will allow ICOs to become self-policing — just as users of the Airbnb property rental site steer clear of anyone with poor reviews. “It will become an ultra transparent world if people have to pay more to hide . . . It is a huge opportunity to clean up the world.” Switzerland is unlikely to be so liberal. A big worry in Bern is of cyber currencies being used for illicit activities, especially given that Switzerland dominates the market for the cross-border management of private wealth. “They don’t want to fall into the same trap as banks over the past 30 to 40 years — they are extremely sensitive to things like anti-money laundering rules and ‘know your customer’,” says Oliver Bussmann, president of the Crypto Valley association. Recommended Against that, industry practitioners say Swiss ICOs are, in practice, obliged to follow strict anti-money laundering procedures anyway: if they do not, traditional banks will turn away their funds. Bern could also toughen up how different ICOs are categorised, and when they fall under strict financial market or bank rules. It could also strengthen consumer protection. Significantly tougher rules could kill the Swiss ICO business and drive it elsewhere. But Bern’s stated objective is to ensure Switzerland keeps a competitive edge in blockchain technologies. By removing uncertainty about its legal framework, it hopes to encourage ICOs. Mr Bussmann says: “I see a desire by the government to continue to be a leading [ICO] hub, and provide the right balance between innovation, attracting business — and having a stable regulatory environment.” Additional reporting by Martin Arnold in London  Swiss entrepreneur Marc Degen, 40, was initially sceptical about many initial coin offerings. He worried the “tokens” investors acquired often locked them into a single technology, preventing evolution. But he changed his mind when raising funds for his latest venture: Modum, a Zurich start-up that provides blockchain-based services to monitor shipments of medicines. Traditional venture capitalists were reluctant to commit. Many meetings with them “were a waste of time”, he says. So in August last year, Modum launched a token sale, offering token holders the right to vote on future payouts if certain milestones were reached by the new company. Swiss regulators did not create any hurdles. The country has “a libertarian but also accountable environment,” says Mr Degen. “The legal setting and the mindset around it is exactly what creates a tremendous opportunity.” US investors were excluded to avoid any clash with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Modum’s ICO raised $13.5m in one week, and Mr Degen is now a convert. “You can talk eye-to-eye with investors,” he says “You can really focus on your idea and making it fly — you are not just running from funding round to funding round.” As they survey the market, Swiss regulators should do little, Mr Degen argues. Existing laws and regulations are sufficient to prevent fraud and abuse. “ICOs give everyone the possibility of participating in the early stage of a company — including the possibility of losing everything. Why should the only possibility be lotteries or casinos, which have much worse odds?” Ralph Atkins","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ralph Atkins","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-25","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/22b2ac1e-fd1a-11e7-a492-2c9be7f3120a","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F00cab51a-feb4-11e7-9e12-af73e8db3c71?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Commodities trader Louis Dreyfus turns to blockchain","INTRO":"Company completes first agricultural deal using the digital technology","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Louis Dreyfus Co, a leading agricultural commodities trader, and a group of financing banks have completed the first agricultural deal using blockchain in a further sign that the digital technology is set to change the way raw materials are bought and sold. Originally built to process bitcoin deals, blockchain is an electronic ledger which stores records of deals in digital blocks. Commodities traders are among those hoping that the technology will lead to faster, cheaper and more secure ways of settling transactions, with oil trading houses and energy groups now actively trialling platforms based on blockchain. LDC and Shandong Bohi Industry, a Chinese agricultural processor, along with the financing groups ING, Société Générale and ABN Amro trialled the blockchain-based digital platform for the sale of 60,000 tonnes of US soyabeans to China in December. Commodity players have been hoping that technology could ease the cumbersome process of exchanging contracts, letters of credit, inspection and other paperwork by email or fax when one company sells raw materials to another. Robert Serpollet, global head of trade operations at LDC, said: “Our expectations were high but the results were even higher,” noting that processing time for the documents was about a fifth of a paper-based process. Our expectations were high but the results were even higher Other benefits include the ability to monitor the operation’s progress in real time, data verification, and reduced risk of fraud. “The cost benefits are significant,” said ING’s global head of trade commodity finance, Anthony van Vliet, who noted that an earlier test with an oil trader saw savings of 25 to 30 per cent. Both LDC and ING said widespread adoption by leading agricultural traders, financing banks and other players in the supply chain would be crucial for a blockchain digital-trading platform to take off. “For the new platform to work, we will need to design an industry standard which will bring together the main players of the agricultural commodity space,” said Mr Serpollet. The blockchain-based platform in the transaction was used early last year for an oil cargo deal involving Mercuria, the oil-trading house, and ING and Soc Gen banks. Energy groups including BP and Shell, trading houses such as Gunvor and Mercuria, and financing banks later formed a consortium to further develop the blockchain-based platform. Elsewhere, BP has been experimenting on a blockchain-based programme alongside Eni, the Italian oil major, and Wien Energie of Austria; and Cargill is operating a pilot blockchain technology to track the provenance of its turkeys, providing consumers with information on where individual birds were raised. In other sectors, the Australian Securities Exchange is planning to use blockchain technology to clear and settle equity transactions, leading US investment banks have been experimenting with using the technology for equity swaps, while AP Moller-Maersk, the Danish shipping group, is using it in marine insurance contracts. For the soyabean deal, two shipping companies issuing required certificates, as well as the US Department of Agriculture offering insights on how to include phytosanitary certificates, also participated in the latest agricultural digital process.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Emiko Terazono","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-22","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/c0794556-ff50-11e7-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Ff0c791ae-003b-11e8-9e12-af73e8db3c71?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Davos: Blockchain can no longer be ignored","INTRO":"Technology that powers cryptocurrencies has weathered a storm of opposition","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The world’s big financial institutions are wrestling with a cryptocurrency dilemma: whether to stand by and denounce a technology many distrust but also fear — or join those investing in it. After a surge in the combined market value of cryptocurrencies from less than $20bn to more than $540bn, the phenomenon — and the blockchain technology that underpins it — has become impossible for the financial establishment to ignore, despite its denunciations of bitcoin in particular as “a fraud”, “index of money-laundering” and worse. “We are sitting down around this table trying to decide whose lunch we are going to eat,” says Richard Crook, head of emerging technology at Royal Bank of Scotland. “Because blockchain’s benefits come from decentralisation there is little point replacing one technology with another without changing the business model.” Blockchain is a shared ledger technology that powers cryptocurrencies but also allows encrypted data on anything from money to medical records to be shared between companies, people and institutions. This protects data from fraud while instantly updating all parties concerned. The looming threat for today’s financial institutions is that the technology is based on sharing a single version of a database across multiple parties without a controlling entity in the middle. As a result, stock exchanges and clearing houses could be disintermediated, while big global foreign exchange trading houses, such as JPMorgan and Citigroup, could lose out if smaller banks start using blockchain. To date the debate has pitted anti-establishment believers in the technology’s power to sweep away many of the faults they see in today’s financial system against top financial leaders who worry about dirty money and are warning investors of a bubble. But big financial institutions’ concern about losing out has shifted the terms of the discussion, which moves this week to the World Economic Forum in Davos, which is holding its first session on “the crypto-asset bubble.” Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has recently said he regrets calling bitcoin a fraud. The world will include cryptocurrencies in the way we work in the next 10 years. But it needs to be regulated Adam Ludwin, chief executive of Chain, which supplies blockchain systems to financial groups such as Nasdaq, accepts many criticisms thrown at what he calls crypto-assets, not least that they are inefficient, difficult to scale up, overvalued and plagued by misunderstanding and poor governance. Bitcoin’s value has fallen substantially in recent weeks. But Mr Ludwin argues that crypto-assets have one big advantage over other types of application, their “resistance to censorship”. Nothing can stop a payment in bitcoin because it is done between two parties without a central authority between them. Mr Ludwin gives the example of someone paying for a meal on Venmo, the US payments app, and attaching a note to say “thanks for a great Persian meal” — only for the payment to be stopped by a bank’s compliance check stumbling over the word “Persian”. That could not happen with bitcoin. Most banks refuse to touch cryptocurrencies, which raise anti-money laundering concerns because of their anonymity. UK lenders, for instance, have even declined to provide mortgages to people who have funded their purchase deposit by selling cryptocurrencies, which means their money cannot be traced. Recommended However, many big financial institutions are investing plenty of time and money exploring the potential of blockchain technology to improve a range of activities from post-trade settlement in financial markets and cross-border payments to trade finance and syndicated loans. There are already signs of the crypto-asset class permeating Wall Street, such as last month’s creation of bitcoin futures contracts by two big US exchanges — the CME and Cboe. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are clearing these contracts for customers while steering clear of directly trading cryptocurrencies or holding them in custody for clients. Meanwhile, investor interest is surging in cryptocurrencies and the initial coin offerings that finance blockchain-based start-ups. Last year, ICOs raised more than $3.4bn for such start-ups in an almost completely unregulated market that could threaten fundraising via traditional initial public offerings. Telegram, the messaging app, plans to raise $2bn in what would be a record ICO this year. Oliver Bussmann, the former chief information officer at UBS who advises on ICOs, says banks are being sidelined. “Crypto-asset managers are coming up to speed like crazy because the banks are standing still while demand is rising from family offices and other big investors,” he says. Banks are calling on regulators to tackle the new crypto-markets such as ICOs quickly. “We can’t deny that things are changing,” says Benoit Legrand, chief innovation officer at Dutch bank ING. “The world will include cryptocurrencies in the way we work in the next 10 years. But it needs to be regulated. This is absolutely key.” Antony Jenkins, the former Barclays boss who sits on the board of the cryptocurrency wallet provider Blockchain, believes the impact on financial services and even money itself will be “profound”. “If you can imagine a world in which you did have one global digital currency, imagine what the benefit of that would be, imagine all the friction and the cost that would come out of the system,” he said in a recent FT video interview. “These things of course might be far in the future, but I don’t think they are very far in the future.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-24","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/adb5726d-4258-39c3-bffc-cb165c57e25c","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fadb5726d-4258-39c3-bffc-cb165c57e25c.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Now NASDAQ gets in a tangle [Update]","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Last month we published a story on Longfin, a Nasdaq listed trade-finance company with a tenuous link to blockchain technology and hence an excessively high market capitalisation. To recap, FTSE Russell decided to add Longfin to its Russell 2000 and 3000 small-cap indexes. Index funds then bought shares for their various products. There was one problem though. FTSE Russell had calculated the available free float of Longfin at 22 per cent, exceeding the 5 per cent required for its indexes, when in reality the number was closer to a diminutive 2 per cent. Because of this error, BlackRock and fellow passive investment providers had aimed to accumulate roughly 1.1 per cent of Longfin, but ended up holding around 45 per cent of the entire free float. Quick to realise its mistake, FTSE Russell announced Longfin would be removed from its indexes. The stock plummeted, with the error costing investors in FTSE Russell-linked products around $10m, according to Financial Times calculations. It hasn\u0027t got any easier for Longfin since. On April 6th, with its share price settling at $28 after lurching between $73 and $5 in the previous ten trading days, the SEC announced it had: We won\u0027t go into the gory details here, but the SEC accusation involves insiders selling large blocks of restricted, and unregistered, shares to the public, pocketing $27m in the process. Nasdaq, realising this was a bad look, suspended Longfin\u0027s equity from trading: So why are we flogging this dead horse now? During the share price meltup to the mid-$70s, savvy options traders decided to load up on \u0027put\u0027 options listed on Nasdaq and other exchanges in the expectation Longfin\u0027s share price would run into reality, and collapse.* In case you aren\u0027t aware, a put option is a derivative which gives an individual the right, in return for a small premium, to sell a share at a specific price within a certain time. Often used to insure portfolios against the vagaries of markets, put options are essentially a way of betting that a security\u0027s price will fall. Tomorrow, 26,951 of Longfin put options will expire, representing 2, 695,100 shares as each options contract is for 100 shares. In other words, the rights to sell account for 237 per cent of the 1.1m free-float as calculated by FTSE Russell.* Our readers may be wondering why Nasdaq allowed the options to trade on its exchange, given the size of the market relative to the free float that FTSE Russell cited when removing the stock from their indices. The answer is that Nasdaq calculates the public float differently to the index provider\u0027s definition of free float. At the end of 2017, according to Bloomberg data, 85.4 per cent of Longfin\u0027s Class A shares were owned by two beneficial owners, including chief executive officer Venkat Meenavalli and his holding company Stampede Capital Ltd, which is traded on the National Stock Exchange of India. That leaves 6,790,789 shares owned by non-beneficial owners.* Parsing the exchange\u0027s rules for which options are allowed to be listed, we came across this wording in Chapter IV: If this is indeed a hard and fast requirement, it means the float has to be at least seven million shares, not counting beneficial owners, defined by the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act as any shareholder with more than a 10 per cent stake. Longfin\u0027s public float of 6,790,789 figure is a touch below the 7m mark, but above Nasdaq’s requirements for continued listing of options, which stands at 6,300,000 shares. So that perhaps explain why the options were traded up to the day of suspension. What about the bearish traders and their valuable put options? Are they going to get paid when the underlying instrument has no price? According to data from derivatives clearing house the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), there are 4,889 Longfin put options expiring tomorrow which have a strike price of above $30 and are therefore, in trading parlance, \u0027in-the-money\u0027. In usual circumstances, if you have a profitable option trade and you forget to exercise it on the day of expiration, the OCC will kindly do the work for you. However, there is a slight catch with options whose underlying shares have been suspended -- one has now to request to the OCC that the option get exercised. Let\u0027s hope Longfin bears got the memo. *Update: We\u0027ve updated the post with the correct figure for the share ownership of Mr Meenavalli and his holding company, and for the number of shares represented by the outstanding options. Apologies for the errors. We have also added the difference between Nasdaq and FTSE Russell\u0027s basis for calculation, and to clarify that Nasdaq is not the only exchange listing the options.

No scenario, in the tech-y view, can’t be improved by use of the blockchain, the system of distributed ledgers which underpin crypto-currencies. As if to prove that point, Legal Things, a Dutch software startup, on Friday became the latest company with an untested, wacky idea for distributed ledgers: to develop a smartphone-based sexual consent app “secured in the blockchain”. The app, called LegalFling, would assist by removing ambiguity from interpersonal encounters and replacing it with a simple system of contracts. Swipe for consent. Swipe to change your mind. Swipe to allow (or disallow) any number of private recreational activities. It seems fitting that the launch was shortly followed by much of the internet obsessing over the unpleasant details of a date between a pseudonymous 23-year old and a famous comedian, published by Babe.net. Columnists and social media are still feuding over the ethics of his actions and the ambiguity of her “clear non-verbal cues”. It has sparked a debate about the differences (and similarities) between bad sex and sexual assault, as well as what constitutes consent. We asked Rick Schmitz, Legal Things co-founder, how the company’s app would work in Grace’s case: The guy in this case is probably going to ask for consent and she would need to say ‘I am in for this’ – or not. And he would think twice. He needs to ask her, instead of saying ‘oh come on’… he’d need to go a little step further and ask for permission. What the company hopes to do is remedy a failure of courts to convict rapists, just as KodakCoin hopes to remedy the difficulty of enforcing intellectual-property rights on the internet. (In fact, the idea was inspired by the Swedish government’s indication it would change rape laws to require active consent, the company says.) Victims unhappy with the response of the criminal justice system could, in theory, resort to breaches of contract clauses, triggered and guaranteed by the immutable transparency of the public blockchain. The thing is, this idea is not new. More than a year ago it was mooted in an online forum and triggered a Reddit discussion about whether consent IRL can be sought and revoked using cryptocurrencies. The possibility of contractual consent is also explored in an episode of the most recent Black Mirror series and played out in a gag on South Park. In most people it provokes either hilarity or fear – hilarity at the bureaucratisation of sex, and fear that sexual predators could force consent, making it more difficult for rape victims to convict them. Then there is the fact that sexual assault often takes place in relationships or marriages as well as in flings. Here is what Mr Schmitz says: We’re talking to a lot of experts in the field to get feedback on our announcement and proof of concept and change stuff… We are tech guys, we know how to digitise things, but what is the right thing is what should be in there… and what women would like to have in there. (Note: Out of around 30 employees at Legal Things six or seven are women, according to Mr Schmitz, in line with the industry norm in Europe.) It’s not a free pass to rape if you’re aiming for that. Of course in the legal system we still have laws. If I put your finger on the ID scanner and pass through it, then again it will be your word against mine. It’ll be interviews with the police officer…and then it will just go to court like it would now. Lisa Benjamin, who works for a rape and sexual abuse support network in Somerset and Avon, is in the fear camp. She says the app could be harmful because it would not record whether a person had been drinking or taking drugs or been coerced into consent. She quotes Grace almost word-for-word: “A more healthy approach is to emphasise the importance of people communicating with their sexual partners: observing, acknowledging and responding to verbal and non-verbal cues.” In the high-stakes intergenerational battle that is still raging online over the Babe Net piece, Mr Schmitz’s reply deserves some attention: I agree that that is the case but we are talking about a new generation that are more on their phones than in the bar. They don’t really ask questions anymore, they don’t communicate anymore. Millennials and their phones; complex human interaction; consent. Is there anything a certain type of technologist doesn’t see as a blockchain-shaped hole in the world?","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Aliya Ram","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-17","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f739f48e-f62a-11e7-8715-e94187b3017e","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F122d8330-fc4a-11e7-9bfc-052cbba03425?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin rival’s rise unnerves banking sector","INTRO":"Volatility of payment settlement group’s cryptocurrency poses questions","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In October, a five-year-old company called Ripple boasted that it was one of America’s “most valuable start-ups . . . after Uber, Airbnb, Palantir and WeWork”. Although its core finance technology business has not done much disrupting yet, cryptocurrency mania was growing the value of XRP, the digital coin created by Ripple’s founders and whose supply the company still controlled. XRP’s price rose 36,000 per cent during 2017, challenging bitcoin’s market value, giving Ripple an XRP hoard worth $200bn by Christmas. XRP is a cryptocurrency outlier. Unlike decentralised, rebellious bitcoin, created post-financial crisis amid distrust of banks, XRP is supposed to grease creaking banking infrastructure, part of the back-office finance technology offered by San Francisco-based Ripple. Brad Garlinghouse, its chief executive, called XRP “the global liquidity solution for payment providers and banks”. But Ripple’s golden goose cryptocurrency, whose price has now sagged, raises awkward questions. While its separate technology solutions for fast payment settlement impresses some financiers, XRP’s volatility, and Ripple’s ownership of more than half the 100bn XRP ever created, has unnerved banks that evangelists hoped would adopt the asset as a bridge currency. Ripple wants to supplant the international Swift network, which is owned by and connects about 11,000 banks. It promises to accelerate cross-border payments using distributed-ledger, or blockchain, technology that sends messages between banks, while offering XRP as a cheap and universal bridge currency, to short-circuit the expensive nostro and vostro accounts of traditional correspondent banking. Think of XRP “like the oil you put in [a car] engine”, says Greg Kidd, Ripple’s former chief risk officer who runs Synthetic Liquidity, a liquidity provider that is trialling XRP by moving small amounts. Banks “really shouldn’t need that much”, he adds. But some speculators are betting that banks will need a lot of XRP oil as a reserve currency, which, if correct, would see XRP loom large in the global financial system. But if banks are unconvinced that they need to own substantial amounts of XRP — which Ripple’s systems for sending and processing payments do not require — the now $60bn total market value of circulating XRP coins looks highly speculative. The enterprise software start-up says more than 100 financial institutions have adopted at least one Ripple product. Ripple recently announced another pilot project with money transfer group MoneyGram, which will involve XRP. But while it has touted live projects with Santander, a Ripple investor, and American Express, others have hesitated to move beyond tests. The Financial Times spoke to 16 banks and financial services companies publicly linked to Ripple (two more declined to comment). Most had not yet gone beyond testing, but some were using Ripple’s systems for moving real money. For instance, Sweden’s SEB bank says it used Ripple software for fast cross-border payments between accounts held by some of its corporate clients; soon, Santander is expected to launch a cross-border payments app using Ripple’s technology to clients in Europe and America. But none of the banks who spoke to the FT had used XRP. Kansas-based CBW Bank was one of the first partner banks announced by Ripple in 2014. But Suresh Ramamurthi, CBW’s chairman, says it has shelved plans to use Ripple’s systems until regulatory guidance is clearer. Some banks shy away from cryptocurrencies such as XRP for fear of being “the first casualty”, Mr Ramamurthi adds. Hank Uberoi, executive chairman of cross-border payments specialist Earthport, works with Ripple to jointly offer their services to financial institutions. “Banks are hesitant to use XRP because they are unsure of the regulatory aspects of it. If money is in transition and the price of XRP collapses in that time, what happens then?” he says. Ripple’s other problem, Mr Uberoi adds, was signing up enough banks to have the scale to seriously challenge Swift. “It is only of value if everyone is connected to the network — like a fax machine, if others don’t have one, then it is not much use,” he says. Ripple says: “Enabling the internet of Value is not something we can do alone and it’s not something that happens overnight.” A former staffer, who left last year, says Ripple was sometimes hasty to announce that banks were using its technology even if they were testing several blockchain solutions. The former employee describes this as a “survival tactic”. A “vibrant and growing ecosystem of people and businesses . . . are interested in XRP”, says Ripple. It says Mexican bank Cuallix uses XRP. The anxiety of bankers that Ripple might cash in its XRP hoard recently prompted it to lock up 55bn XRP and promise to regulate supply by releasing no more than 1bn XRP every month. Regardless of whether banks use it, Ripple has benefited handsomely from XRP’s rise. Ripple sells XRP to institutions and through exchanges — $52.2m worth in last year’s third quarter, up 67 per cent from $31.3m the previous quarter. It advertises discounts for market makers who adopt early, to increase the pool of institutional buyers and sellers. Recommended Some staff take XRP as part of their salaries, and Ripple’s founders are enjoying a boost. Forbes reported that Chris Larsen, co-founder and former chief executive, personally owns 5.19bn XRP. According to cryptocurrency tracker Coinmarketcap, Mr Larsen’s holding is at present worth more than $8bn. Since Ripple compared itself to Uber and Airbnb, XRP’s price has hit $3.80 highs but also fallen to just above $1 before rebounding this week, the volatility reflecting speculative cryptocurrency markets. When Coinmarketcap removed Korean exchanges from its market capitalisation calculations last Monday, Ripple’s market cap crashed from $124bn to $101bn, revealing South Korea’s upward influence on XRP and triggering a panicked sell-off. XRP’s volatile price responded enthusiastically to dubiously sourced news, climbing in December amid later debunked rumours that XRP would be listed on a key cryptocurrency trading platform, and recently rising 20 per cent after an unsubstantiated, anonymous report suggested that Western Union might adopt Ripple technology. XRP’s speculative price rollercoaster “seems to represent the perfect blend of cryptocurrency hype and optimism”, writes Eric Turner, S\u0026P Global Market Intelligence analyst.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Chloe Cornish Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/1749bb9e-fab1-11e7-9b32-d7d59aace167","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Ff5cf3824-c3e5-11e7-b30e-a7c1c7c13aab?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"AP Moller-Maersk and IBM to use blockchain in global trade","INTRO":"Joint venture aims to create new digital standard for supply chains","DETAILED_CONTENT":"AP Moller-Maersk and IBM are setting up a joint venture to use blockchain technology to try to help make the companies’ supply chains more efficient and safer. General Motors and Procter \u0026 Gamble are among the multinationals to express interest in the new platform, which Maersk and IBM hope can become the new digital standard for global trade. The Danish shipping conglomerate and US software group estimate that businesses spend up to a fifth of the cost to transport goods on processing documents and administration. They want to use the distributed ledger technology behind blockchain to create an unchangeable record of transactions along a supply chain that can be shared in real time with whichever companies are necessary. “We see this as an important stepping stone both for our industry and our strategy. The cost there is in moving data and paper currently is significant. You can get better confidentiality and security as well as better speed from this,” said Vincent Clerc, Maersk’s chief commercial officer and the proposed chairman for the joint venture. Shipping companies such as Maersk are looking to technology to help cut costs as they struggle to adapt to global trade being well below the levels from before the 2007/8 financial crisis. The Danish group teamed up with IBM last year for a pilot, which involved players such as DuPont, Dow Chemical, the ports of Houston and Rotterdam, and the US and Dutch customs authorities. Both Maersk and IBM stressed that the venture would be open to all players in global supply chains and that it would interact with any other systems rivals come up with. But they added that they hoped it could set a standard for the digitalisation of supply chains. “At a certain time, you have to place a bet on one alternative just as you had to with VHS and Betamax before,” said Mr Clerc. What we see is that the thing that is going to help the world is blockchain as a distributed ledger. The significance of that is huge for any transaction that has multiple parties Bridget van Kralingen, head of solutions and blockchain for IBM Global Industries, said the US group believed the technology had applications well beyond the cryptocurrencies it has been until now mostly associated with. “There’s a lot of write-up about blockchain. But what we see is that the thing that is going to help the world is blockchain as a distributed ledger. The significance of that is huge for any transaction that has multiple parties,” she added. Blockchain would allow companies at different stages of the supply chain to see the information they need about each transaction in one flow of information. The joint venture also hopes to automate and digitalise the filing of paperwork. Maersk was one of the biggest victims of NotPetya cyber attack last year, which cost it an estimated $250m-$300m. Mr Clerc said improving the security of its transactions was important. “With these cyber attacks, you will still continue to see the penetration of tech because the business case is so important. For us, it’s important to continue to lead the transformation of this industry,” he added. The collaboration is expected to be up and running within six months as it needs regulatory approval in some countries. It is due to be headed by Michael White, the former president of Maersk Line in North America, and be located in New York.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Richard Milne","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-16","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/db823730-429a-11e8-93cf-67ac3a6482fd","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F3a7e8d7e-42a0-11e8-93cf-67ac3a6482fd?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"IBM: blockchain gang","INTRO":"Group beats earnings estimates but beyond the jargon questions over the cloud remain","DETAILED_CONTENT":"What is IBM? Mainframe maker, Jeopardy champion, cloud rival to Amazon? All of these. But it really distinguishes itself in the fields of disappointment and jargon. Other companies miss earnings estimates with grim regularity. IBM usually beats. It did so on Tuesday evening, as in the previous 13 quarters. Yet, as has happened after first-quarter earnings in each of the past seven years, the shares fell. Too many technology companies get a pass on profits; investors focus on revenues or even user growth. It is hard to put IBM, soon to celebrate its 107th birthday, in that category. But so murky is every earnings release — crammed with one-time items, sales of intellectual property, tax gains and hits, restructuring charges — that revenues offer a better indicator of the underlying health of the business and often a better guide to the market reaction. This quarter revenues grew 5 per cent to $19.1bn, the second successive quarter of growth after nearly six years of contraction. But even the top line has so much noise to exclude. IBM makes more than half its revenues overseas. At constant currencies, revenues were only flat. Positive types can point to the 10 per cent growth (in constant currencies) in IBM’s “strategic imperatives”. These sprightlier areas such as cloud services now account for 47 per cent of overall sales; they have more potential than flogging workhorse mainframes to banks. However, as a Bernstein analyst noted on the conference call, given the IT spending environment is robust, the mainframe cycle is benign, comparisons are relatively easy (thanks to past weak performance), “isn’t this about as good as it gets?” The most responsive part of a lengthy answer from Jim Kavanaugh, chief financial officer, was: “Our backlog trajectory run-out still points to improving trajectory throughout the year.” And that is another part of IBM’s disease: its jargon addiction. Mr Kavanaugh variously described the workforce as subject to “transformation activity”, “actions”, “rebalancing”, “optimisation” and “remixing/revitalisation”. In other words: job cuts. He resorted to the word “blockchain” 10 times on the earnings call. He also inflicted “secular shift” on the audience eight times. It is totally obscure as to what promise the dreaded B-word really holds for IBM. More important, whether the company can ever properly capitalise on the secular shift to the cloud remains maddeningly unproven. The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

But there are many reasons why such talk is misleading and distracts from the key issues at hand. Something else is clearly afoot. What’s crypto fiat issuance got to do with full-reserve banking? What crypto fiat issuance talk really constitutes (and we’re sure central bankers are aware of this) is the popularisation of an agenda to wean the world off fractional reserve banking, albeit without full consideration of the negative externalities that come along with doing so. We operate a fractional reserve banking system for two key reasons: First, because doing so is cost-efficient (it allows for financial economies of scale) and second, because it provides the central bank with control over financial conditions. In a fractional reserve system there is by design never enough “full reserve” capital available to satisfy all the liquidity claims of the system simultaneously. There is logic to this. The financial system is a merry-go-round which has no interest in encouraging capital to stand about stagnant and idle. It is economically inefficient to assume everyone with a liquidity claim on the economy will redeem it at the same time. Redundant or spare capital can be put to better use elsewhere in the interim. Nonetheless, it is true, a fractional reserve system is not a free lunch. The cost efficiencies are to a greater or lesser degree always offset by the risk too many people will try to redeem their liquidity claims against real physical goods and services at the same time. In that context it is the job of the central bank to monitor inflationary conditions and indicators such as consumer demand and industrial purchasing trends to ensure unexpected inflationary runs can be pre-empted by the early adjustment of liquidity supply. It is also the job of the central bank to supervise private banks so that they do not over-extend themselves by issuing too many unbacked liabilities. One way the central bank takes pre-emptive action, as we all know, is via an interest rate mechanism. This has the effect of making liquidity more or less expensive, rationing it or releasing it in response to inflationary conditions. Sometimes, however, it’s not as easy as just raising the cost of bank funding to achieve an inflation target. Often the central bank must intervene in the market directly by borrowing or lending its own liabilities against physical assets (or in the QE world, buying or selling reserves in exchange for financial assets) at a specific discount or premium to ensure its policy aims are fully transmitted to the broader financial system. Either way, the fractional nature of the system is essential for the central bank to influence liquidity conditions in a way that can keep inflation rates stable and trade/commerce functioning smoothly and dependably. Some historical context The modern fractional reserve financial system must be understood in the context of the digital-deposit revolution which occurred over the last couple of decades. This had a profound effect on central-bank liability issuance and liquidity, not least because of how it came to blur central-bank cash liabilities with private-bank liabilities. From the perspective of the public, bank deposits were for the longest time almost indistinguishable from central-bank-issued cash. This confusion greatly decreased the demand for (effectively fully reserved) central-bank cash liabilities, saving costs for the system at large. The global financial crisis, however, changed everything. In one fell swoop, people began to realise digital bank deposits — deposit guarantee or no deposit guarantee — were something very different to cash. As this speech from Simon Potter at the New York Fed highlights, these sudden revelations matter when it comes to the stability of the digital bank deposit system (aka private money-like assets): What has subsequently become clear is that the public would really like to have its cake and eat it in terms of the convenience of privately-issued digital cash-like liabilities but the safety that comes from using publicly-issued liabilities. Indeed, there is an assumption on the public’s part that Joe Public is “entitled” to a digital equivalent of fiat cash. That is rational desire but it ignores one vital thing: the issuance of public cash liabilities is not cost free. As the work of Jeffrey Lacker has long argued, although it is common to think of government money as virtually costless to produce, the real resource costs are substantial whether that’s digital or paper cash. Hence the longstanding arrangement between central banks and the private sector with respect to digital cash-like issuance. Bluntly put, it suits central banks to outsource the cost and operational responsibility of digital liability issuance to the private sector. What central authorities lose in terms of seigniorage revenue by doing so, they gain in cost savings. What’s more, in a fractional reserve system, they still retain control with respect to how far banks can extend themselves on that front. If central banks took on the role unilaterally, it would be they who would have to absorb the costs. It would also be they, in an attempt to reduce costs, who would be tempted to redeploy immobile funds via a lending or risk-bearing investment channel to subsidise some of that cost. This, however, would emulate the mistakes of entirely centralised banking systems past, such as Gosbank, while undermining the full-reserve nature of the liabilities because of how centralised the risk had become. Those advocating expansion of the central bank balance sheet to Joe Public (and de facto full-reservation of the system), of course, might argue that it is the current fractional reserve system which is the anomaly. In the days of It’s a Wonderful Life, cash was king and bank deposits were clearly defined as risky, i.e. not cash. If you wanted the peace of mind of keeping savings in liquid “full reserve” cash mode you had to be your own bank, storing banknotes under your mattress or in secured vaults at personal cost. In reality, the economic cost of doing so was substantial due to the risk of funds being stolen, burnt down or lost. There was thus always an incentive to deposit cash into a professional banking system, even back in the days when deposits were known to be risky. Customers knew the banks would lend money against their deposits but hoped the banks would do this responsibly and pay enough interest in exchange. Depositors understood their assets (the banks’ liabilities) were much less liquid than cash but the terms the banks offered them (which often included the promise of short notice redemption) generally made it worth their while. In this way the fractional reserve system could still be maintained and influenced by a central bank. What’s more, there was a general expectation in society that once cash was deposited in a bank, access to it was never going to be immediate. Withdrawals took time, simply due to the manual way in which they were processed. It was perfectly normal to have to order in cash for redemption days in advance (when it came to large sums). Bank runs only became a problem when even small sums could not be honoured immediately. (These, ironically, are the sort of practices the likes of Coinbase are now reintroducing to slow down bank-run risk). So why couldn’t this work today? When digital banking became commonplace, the system freed itself of many of these constraints. From a consumer’s perspective, as soon as merchants became happy to accept banks’ fractional liabilities or credit in lieu of cash for final settlement of purchases, the liquidity advantage of operating in cash alone was diminished greatly. As far as the consumer was concerned bank deposits really were as good as cash, hence entirely substitutable. The only advantage of holding cash was the ability to (privately) make purchases in the dark, grey, tax-dodging or micro-merchant economies. From the banks’ perspective, the more fractional units were accepted for final settlement, the cheaper their funding costs would be, and the greater the amount of underlying capital they could reinvest elsewhere. In that context — a.k.a one where fractional bank liabilities are already highly substitutable for cash if not considered to be much more liquid due to the instantaneous processes that govern them — what does the issuance of a crypto fiat coin really bring to the table? Only two things: 1) The revival of excessive competition between bank liabilities and public liabilities (cash), to the disadvantage of cheap bank funding costs. (As the relative burdens of cash management are extinguished, banks would be forced to compete ever more aggressively for funding access, leading to spiraling interest rates and/or a dearth of capital provision for the real economy). 2) The unscaling of the economic system as unused liquidity is transferred away from financing global trade, commerce and cross-border investment towards financing public cash deposits. Which is to say, be careful what you wish for. There are many externalities associated with issuing fiat crypto, the most grievous of which is the likely increase in costs for both the public and private sector.

Supermarkets take the lead in battle of the UK high street Results this week laid bare the uncertainty facing UK retailers. While supermarket chains notched up bumper food sales, revenue growth in clothing was sluggish or worse for some but by no means all on high street, writes Mark Vandevelde. Wm Morrison, J Sainsbury and Tesco all reported year-on-year rises in grocery sales, especially in the week before Christmas. And although Tesco posted its best Christmas revenues for eight years, it missed analysts’ expectations. Meanwhile, shoppers shied away from splurging on clothing and general merchandise, with Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike Coupe saying: “Where people can defer their purchases, they do.” This was a trend evident elsewhere. Mothercare on Monday lost more than a quarter of its market value after the children’s goods retailer warned of a sharp drop in profits following 7.2 per cent slide in revenues in the 12 weeks to December 30 year on year. It said stagnant wages and a November interest rate rise had prompted a “sudden shift” in customers’ willingness to spend. 13 weeks to December 30 Declining sales at M\u0026S’s food arm was a far worse result than at other large grocers. Steve Rowe, chief executive, said that unlike cheaper rivals, M\u0026S had been unable to increase food prices in line with rising input costs. “I don’t think I could push my prices in the same direction,” he said. 19 weeks to January 6 Chief executive Dave Lewis said consumer sentiment had turned more nervous: “There is definitely some caution in the way customers are talking about the year ahead.” Customers choosing to spend on luxury food at the expense of gifts was one of the strongest trends Tesco noted. 6 weeks to December 30 The upmarket retailer posted its best ever Black Friday. But Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman, warned: “The pressure on margin . . . has intensified because of our choice to maintain competitive prices . . . This will negatively affect full-year financial results as indicated previously.” In contrast to the big grocers, Marks and Spencer revealed lower same-store sales at its high-end food business. Sales of clothing fell 2.8 per cent on a like-for-like basis, more than double the rate of decline seen in the previous quarter, as a warm October hit sales. “Consumers are behaving in a recessionary way,” said Steve Rowe, chief executive. “Their budget’s under pressure. Inflation in food, petrol — that eats straight into it.” Recommended John Lewis, the upmarket retailer beloved of Britain’s middle classes, increased Christmas sales but warned this came at the expense of margins. House of Fraser became the latest UK department store to report a difficult Christmas trading period with revenues, with even online sales in decline. Suit seller Moss Bros became the third UK retailer to issue a post-Christmas profit warning but the same day, upmarket fashion brand Ted Baker and premium leisurewear retailer Superdry reported robust festive trading. Casualwear chains Fat Face and Joules also posted healthy festive sales. As British consumers continued to shift their spend online, fashion retailer Boohoo upgraded its full-year forecasts for the second time in four months after doubling sales. Meanwhile discount chain B\u0026M bucked the trend among bricks-and-mortar retailers as it posted sharp increase in revenues on the back of store openings. Kodak shares on a roll after blockchain announcement Traditional stocks felt the cryptocurrency mania last week, writes Chloe Cornish. Eastman Kodak, the US photography company, said on Tuesday that it was launching a blockchain ledger and cryptocurrency for photographers, sending its shares rocketing from $3.10 to a high of $10.70. Kodak’s market move followed a familiar pattern — company signals blockchain pivot, share price booms. Following an announcement on Thursday that MoneyGram would be testing the XRP cryptocurrency for cross-border payments, shares in the US money transfer group rose nearly 12 per cent — a fillip for the company just days after the US government sank its plans to sell itself to China’s Ant Financial. Messaging app Telegram also announced plans to join the cryptocurrency payments boom, by introducing a digital coin on its chat platform. The encrypted messaging service hopes to raise $500m by selling the tokens, which will be known as Grams. But the week for bitcoin, the granddaddy of cryptocurrencies, was less favourable. Thursday’s news that the South Korean government was set to rein in virtual currency trading pushed down its price by as much as 14 per cent. That move came days after the Chinese government signalled it would move to quash bitcoin mining — the energy-intensive process of recording transactions on the currency’s digital ledger, an activity concentrated in the country thanks to its cheap electricity. India bans PwC audits after failure to spot $1.7bn fraud India’s securities regulator this week banned PwC from auditing listed companies in the country for two years, after the accountancy firm failed to spot a $1.7bn fraud at the now defunct Satyam Computer Services, writes Simon Mundy. In a 108-page report, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said Price Waterhouse — PwC’s Indian audit unit — had neglected to check “glaring anomalies” in the financial details reported by Satyam, whose downfall followed one of the worst financial scandals in Indian corporate history. For about five years beginning in 2003, Sebi said, Satyam inflated its revenue by accounting for 7,561 fake invoices. The fraud persisted in part because Satyam’s auditor, PwC, “did not independently check the veracity of the monthly bank statements”. It relied upon assurances from Satyam “without any further examination or inquiry into the matter and ignored the balance confirmations received directly from banks which were showing true balances”, the report said. Recommended As well as the auditing suspension, Sebi ordered PwC to disgorge wrongful gains of about Rs130m ($2m). PwC said “there has been no intentional wrongdoing by [PwC] firms in the unprecedented management perpetrated fraud at Satyam”, and that it had strengthened its processes since the scandal broke. It added that it was “disappointed” and would seek a stay on the order before it became effective at the end of March, on the grounds that it was out of line with a prior High Court order. Huawei suffers US setback as AT\u0026T phones deal fails China’s Huawei suffered another setback in the US, where it had planned to sell its Mate 10 series of handsets with the help of Wonder Woman and AT\u0026T, writes Louise Lucas. The superhero stayed but the US carrier walked out, opting — after two years of negotiations — not to sell Huawei’s phones. The Chinese manufacturer, which at one time sought to sell its handset division, is now the world’s third biggest smartphone maker. Its phones are popular in China and parts of western Europe but have yet to conquer the US, where Huawei is viewed with mistrust and carriers are blocked from buying its infrastructure equipment. That has stymied its strategy of selling bundled kits and handsets, key in the US, where 90 per cent of sales are made via carriers — and highlighting the importance of the AT\u0026T deal. Ben Stanton, an analyst at Canalys, described it as “a stunning blow”. Huawei admitted that the US “presents unique challenges”. Richard Yu, who heads the company’s consumer arm, hit back. “We are serving over 70m people worldwide. We’ve proven our quality, we’ve proven our privacy and security protection,” he told technology news outlet The Verge. Employee-owned Huawei has long been a lightning rod for concerns about Chinese snooping in the US, with US telecoms groups blocked from buying its infrastructure equipment. Huawei, which sells kit to several big carriers in the UK and Europe — damaging sales at Ericsson and Nokia — denies the US claims Murdoch looks to add 10 Sinclair stations to Fox Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox is finalising its acquisition of about 10 US television stations from right-leaning media group Sinclair Broadcast Group, according to three people familiar with the sale, in one of the group’s first moves since deciding to sell its entertainment businesses to Walt Disney for $66bn, writes Ravi Mattu. The deal is subject to Sinclair’s $3.9bn purchase of Tribune Media securing regulatory approval, which would make the right-leaning media group the largest owner of local television channels in the US with access to 72 per cent of all households. Mr Murdoch is looking to reframe his company following the blockbuster Disney agreement. Fox is selling its international assets, leaving a group comprising the Fox broadcast network, Fox News Channel, sports cable network and a portfolio of US TV stations. The Sinclair deal would include channels include some key NFL markets, including Denver and Seattle. Critics of the Sinclair-Tribune deal have argued that it would concentrate too much power in the hands of one company and lead to increasingly biased news coverage. “Sinclair forces its local stations to air pro-Trump propaganda,” said Free Press, a non-profit lobby group, which is formally challenging the transaction. Rival companies have also raised concerns over Sinclair’s expanding footprint. Newsmax, a conservative-leaning media company, wrote in a submission to the Federal Communications Commission: “A free and diverse press, a bedrock principle of American democracy, will be crippled by this proposed merger.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-12","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/48265e56-f55d-11e7-8715-e94187b3017e","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F03f84070-f56f-11e7-a4c9-bbdefa4f210b?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"A bitcoin bubble made in millennial heaven","INTRO":"Owning a currency whose value gyrates wildly may reflect youthful rebellion","DETAILED_CONTENT":"There was a pattern to conversations with friends and family over the Christmas holidays. It went something like this: “Are your kids buying bitcoin?” before moving on to: “Have they convinced you to invest?” One relative who graduated from university two years ago and was hoping to work in the restaurant business was now in the “bitcoin business”. A friend heard another tell of the small fortune her 24-year-old had amassed in less than a year of cryptocurrency investing and immediately asked for the young man’s contacts. There were also a few people I met who were still struggling to understand the fundamentals. What is bitcoin in the first place, they asked, and how does it relate to blockchain, the underlying decentralised technology? One person ventured that blockchain was the casino and bitcoin the chips — an apt description since investing in cryptocurrencies is very much like gambling. Young people blame all those advising them against digital currencies for the fact that they are worse off than their parents My holiday conversations anecdotally confirmed a rather worrying trend that digital currency experts have noticed in the past year, as bitcoin swung wildly from $1,000 at the start of 2017 to a $19,000 peak at one point (and all over the place in between): millennials, and particularly male ones, are riding the speculative wave. So there might be many young men right now who can’t believe their bitcoin luck, but parents should brace for tears when the bubble bursts. A few weeks before the holidays, a survey released by Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm, found that while two per cent of Americans have owned bitcoin, four per cent of millennials — generally seen as those born between the early 1980s and the early 1990s — have dabbled or owned the digital currency. Among male millennials that share rises to 6 per cent. More than 50 per cent of millennials polled said bitcoin was a positive technological innovation and more than a quarter considered bitcoin safer than banks. There are of course big investors who are digital currency evangelists, arguing that the ecosystem is the biggest technological breakthrough since the creation of the internet. Some predict that a few of today’s blockchain-related companies could turn out to be massive winners like Google or Amazon. But what attracts millennials in particular to cryptocurrencies? First, there is the lack of memory: If you are in the 18 to 34 age group, you were either a baby or at most a teenager during the dotcom bubble of the 1990s and would not recognise the parallel with bitcoin mania. Just as today businesses have taken to broadcasting their blockchain ambitions, and basked in the resulting investor enthusiasm, so companies back then would add “.com” to their names and see their stock prices soar to extraordinary heights. Second, there is, possibly, a cultural element. Owning a currency that could be worth something or nothing depending on the day may be another reflection of youthful rebellion. For some, the fact that cryptocurrencies are highly risky investments that are not subject to any regulation (and that regulators are warning against) is an attraction, not a deterrent. Young people blame all those advising them against digital currencies for the fact that they are worse off than their parents. In the US, fewer millennials own homes than previous generations, and even fewer are out-earning their parents when they were the same age. As university tuition fees have soared, millennials also enter the job market burdened with massive debt. And yet, as tempting as it is to find logic in young adults’ bitcoin fever, one young man who graduated from a US college last year and now writes a newsletter about cryptocurrencies offers a more mundane explanation. “Young people like myself have little money to invest so they’re more likely to invest in something that has the potential to see massive returns,” says Matteo Leibowitz. “Not having a family to feed or a mortgage to pay, we can take these riskier bets.” Then there is, he adds, that other youth obsession: Fomo, or the fear of missing out, which creates classic bubbles. Blockchain fever spreads very quickly. “As soon as you hear one friend who’s made an amount of money in that space, you’re likely to follow. That is absolutely Fomo.” roula.khalaf@ft.com","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Roula Khalaf","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-10","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f30e7ad6-f5a5-11e7-88f7-5465a6ce1a00","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F0d4369cc-f5a9-11e7-a4c9-bbdefa4f210b?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Kodak/ blockchain: snap back","INTRO":"There are glimmers of a real business but nothing to justify the manic upswing","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Struggling small fry have capitalised on cryptocurrency mania by renaming their businesses. Thus shares in Long Island Iced Tea almost tripled when it changed its name to Long Blockchain at the end of last month. The farce boosted the company’s market capitalisation by $43m, enough to stave off possible ejection from the Nasdaq. Eastman Kodak, however, is a venerable US photographic company. It did not go as far as changing its name but announced on Tuesday that it would launch KODAKCoin, “a photo-centric cryptocurrency”. Professional photographers have suffered as their pictures flit around the internet free of charge. Kodak envisages technology that will secure sales via a distributed ledger and police the internet, collecting licence fees. There is the blurry image of a real business here. Yet the reaction was just as silly as the Long Island gambit. Kodak’s shares more than doubled. And, though small, Kodak is not a micro stock. It added $312m of equity value for a total of about $440m. This puts it high up in the rankings of hyped-up public companies in the US, alongside Overstock, the online retailer whose crypto dalliances helped market worth increase from $400m to $2bn in the past 12 months. In the late nineties, businesses added “dotcom” to their names with similar results. The concern for Kodak is that for all the glitz of cryptocurrencies, the core business, which emerged from bankruptcy restructuring in 2013, is sliding. At results in November the company was forced to focus again on deleveraging and cutting jobs. Kodak may well be making a genuine attempt to tap a promising new technology. But it has risked its credibility in hitching a ride on the coattails of bitcoin. Other businesses experimenting with blockchain should avoid a speculative link that smacks of desperation.

That would be one explanation for Eastman Kodak’s leap into the overheated blockchain and cryptocurrency mania in partnership with Wenn Digital. Another explanation is Kodak’s own. Its chief executive justified the launch on Tuesday of an image rights management platform, and a “photo-centric cryptocurrency” called KodakCoin, like this: “KodakCoin is all about paying photographers fairly and giving them an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a new economy tailored for them, with secure asset rights management built right in.” Blockchain enthusiasts do suggest rights management is one of the more promising applications of digital ledger technology. In this case, snappers’ right to income from an image would be embedded in the blockchain record. They would presumably then be paid automatically whenever the photograph was republished. Kodak’s partner has a colourful, but relevant, pedigree, as part of the same group that includes Wenn Media, a celebrity photo and news agency that started life as the World Rock News Network. Still, Kodak’s move — a few weeks after Long Island Iced Tea, a beverage group, set the benchmark for loony “pivots” towards the blockchain — conveniently coincides with investors’ feverish appetite for all things cryptocurrency-related. Since emerging from bankruptcy protection in 2013, the company that George Eastman founded in the late 19th century, has fought to find a way to turn its famous brand to account. Restyled as a business-to-business imaging technology company, Kodak reported in November a net loss for its third quarter and dwindling cash balances, which it planned to shore up by cutting costs and working capital. On Tuesday, the group duly generated a bounce in its declining share price by merely associating itself with the words cryptocurrency and blockchain. Kodak has been unfairly maligned for missing the first digital wave. In fact, as I wrote a few years ago, it accurately forecast the threat from digital imaging and itself developed early digital camera technology. But the temptation to go on milking rich profits from analogue roll-film — urged on by Wall Street investors and analysts — was too strong. It left that particular pivot too late. Recommended Kodak’s entrepreneurial founder might not necessarily have disapproved of this latest technological twist. Historian Richard Tedlow wrote that Eastman, as he experimented with the messy new chemistry of photography in the 1870s, “did not set out with a clear idea of the direction in which he wanted to move the trade . . . Only step by step did an end clarify itself”. Even so, the “ground floor” of the new blockchain economy looks significantly more crowded and unstable than the one Eastman ultimately revolutionised more than 100 years ago. andrew.hill@ft.com","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Andrew Hill","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-09","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/8c650b4c-f564-11e7-8715-e94187b3017e","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fc779456e-f56d-11e7-a4c9-bbdefa4f210b?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Kodak pivot to blockchain sends shares on a roll","INTRO":"Photography company plans to create cryptocurrency for industry","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Shares in Kodak, the photography company that has struggled to keep pace with changing technology, more than doubled on Tuesday after the 129-year-old group announced it was launching a blockchain business. The New York state-based company announced it was partnering with WENN Digital, part of the London-headquartered WENN media group, to create an encrypted digital ledger of ownership rights for photographers, using blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Kodak’s bet on blockchain technology is the latest in a long line of such moves to fire up investors. When Long Island Iced Tea Corp changed its name to Long Blockchain Corp in late December, its shares rose 289 per cent. The internet has made it difficult for photographers to control their image rights, and many traditional sources of their income — such as payments for stock photography — have shrunk since the 1990s. Kodak and WENN plan to use the technology to create stronger links between images and their creators. They will also create a cryptocurrency, called KODAKCoin, that can be used to pay photographers when an image they have created is used. “For many in the tech industry, ‘blockchain’ and ‘cryptocurrency’ are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who’ve long struggled to assert control over their work and how it’s used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem,” said Jeff Clarke, Kodak chief executive. Recommended Although Kodak was a US corporate giant in the era of celluloid film, it lost ground to Japanese film manufacturers and struggled to adapt to digital photography. Its market capitalisation has slipped to just $132m. Kodak’s share price rocketed from $3 at the start of trading to close at $6.80, up 119 per cent. Penny stock companies that have announced pivots towards the highly touted technology hoping to help solve problems from supply chain management to auditing have experienced similar bumps. Large companies that have been indirectly linked to blockchain, even through rumours, are also receiving some indirect share price benefits. When a questionably sourced report appeared online linking Western Union, the money transfer company, to Ripple, the enterprise blockchain start-up, on Friday, Western Union shares climbed from $19.45 to highs of $22.21 on Monday.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Chloe Cornish","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-09","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/a6b90a8c-f4b7-11e7-8715-e94187b3017e","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F7acc3482-f0a0-11e7-ac08-07c3086a2625?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Growing number of cryptocurrencies spark concerns","INTRO":"Problems over valuing volatile market highlighted as digital currencies proliferate","DETAILED_CONTENT":"At least 39 digital currencies have market capitalisations of more than $1bn, according to three price tracking websites. The growing market highlights the difficulty for cryptocurrency investors of valuing the volatile and often thinly traded assets. It has also prompted concerns about a speculative bubble. Bitcoin remains the granddaddy of digital currencies with roughly a third of the overall cryptocurrency market, which is about $710bn, according to tracker CoinMarketCap.com. However, the number of digital currencies with market caps exceeding $1bn are 39 according to LiveCoinWatch.com, 41 according to CoinMarketCap and 42 according to CoinCap.io. Sheila Warren, head of the World Economic Forum’s blockchain project, said cryptocurrency investors diversifying into alternative coins were boosting prices. “The reason for all this hype is we’re getting more money from [investors] into more types of coin,” she said. Cryptocurrency market caps are based on current trading prices on exchanges, usually multiplied by circulation rather than total supply. But different tracking services sometimes calculate them by different criteria. When CoinMarketCap excluded some Korean exchanges from its calculations because they have far higher prices than other trading venues, the sudden downwards recalibration sparked a brief sell-off on Monday. “Crypto is still a very immature and developing space, where people are working on what standards make sense and what service providers they can rely on,” said Hunter Horsley, co-founder of Bitwise Asset Management, an index fund for major cryptocurrencies. Some alt-coins with sizeable market values are relatively obscure, connected to projects that as yet have no product and have very low trading volumes, which regulators warn could leave investors vulnerable to “pump and dump” schemes. TRON is now the 10th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, at $10bn, with one unit trading at about $0.15. The team behind TRON has not released its working product, a decentralised YouTube-like platform for videos and music which would be based on blockchain, the digital ledger technology that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But after a January 4 tweet from chief executive Justin Sun, claiming the start-up would soon announce a partnership with a “very prestigious public listed [sic] company”, TRON’s price more than doubled within 24 hours, hitting a high of 27 cents. Despite only launching last year, Dentacoin, which claims to be a “blockchain solution for the global dentistry industry”, has a $1.9bn market cap. It is not due to release its testnet, a blockchain used for testing, until the end of 2018. Its development team wants to provide services including a website for reviewing dentists and a database of patients’ medical records And some alt-coins are outright jokes. For Jackson Palmer, creator of Dogecoin, which is based on an internet meme of a Shiba Inu dog, his digital currency’s market cap acts as a “barometer for crypto mania and speculation”. According to CoinMarketCap, Dogecoin has a market value of $1.7bn.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Chloe Cornish","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-09","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/7f7b26e0-a1d4-3842-9a47-0f6f50803c4f","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2F7f7b26e0-a1d4-3842-9a47-0f6f50803c4f.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Co-founder of Linkedin hopes to solve spam, with blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The world today is a place where it\u0027s necessary to breezily tackle the dystopia implied by a technology pitch head on: Indeed we might.

Companies previously not greatly valued by the stock market were finding that the simple addition of a word to their corporate identities could multiply their worth many times over. The word was “blockchain”. Soft drinks companies and obscure software firms alike were being transformed into potential tech juggernauts. Or so their share performances would have us believe. However, the most interesting thing about all this is not that the stock market is easily dazzled by industry hype. That has been true for a while. It is the way a word can be detached from its original or literal meaning and transformed by the sheer power of imagination into meaning almost anything one desires that is really fascinating. As a phrase or concept, blockchain is almost meaningless. We are often told that it is the technology that allows cryptocurrency systems such as bitcoin to operate independent of intermediaries or bank networks. In reality, however, bitcoin is a bunch of pre-existing technologies assembled together to achieve a single objective: the creation of a clearing system which runs independently of the banks, which cannot be corrupted by sinister agents and in which nothing can ever be changed. In terms of achieving that objective the bundle has worked reasonably well, though not perfectly. Glaring flaws have become increasingly obvious over time. These include the huge energy expense of maintaining the system, capacity limitations and spiralling transaction fees. Blockchain aficionados insist that many of these downsides can be avoided if only certain parts of the bundle are borrowed and not others. Yet there are no hard and fast rules about how many parts have to be borrowed for something still to constitute a blockchain. For this reason, most serious blockchain companies dropped the descriptor a long time ago, adapting their identities to reflect the bits of the (pre-existing) technology they were using most. The result is that terms such as “distributed-ledger technology”, “permissioned” ledgers or “shared-database” technology have become synonymous with blockchain, even though the underlying tech can differ greatly. It is hard to understand why the mere mention of blockchain should be capable of sending stock prices soaring. Something else must be going on. Looking back at his novel Brave New World, Aldous Huxley warned that the combined challenges of over-population and resource scarcity would eventually unleash forces pushing society back into a medieval state. This system, he suggested, would be predicated on a hierarchy overseen by an elite of social engineers whose objective would be to tie lesser ranks to specific stations and roles in life, depriving them of their liberty in the process. The system would differ in one significant way from the feudal systems of the past. We, the cogs in the system, would be conditioned to love our servitude to the point that we would never think of challenging it. This would be achieved “under the influence of badly chosen words, applied, without any understanding of their merely symbolic character, to experiences that have been selected and abstracted in the light of a system of erroneous ideas”. Which is to say that if you associate abstract terms with positive connotations often enough, people will eventually interpret them as they see fit and not see them for what they really are. Perhaps that is what is really going on with blockchain. After all, while apologists like to insist it is a liberating technology that can achieve magical solutions in all sorts of fields, it is just as likely to turn out to be a form of social engineering that ends up locking everyone into a highly regimented order that benefits none but a tiny elite. No wonder the stock prices of blockchain companies are up. izabella.kaminska@ft.com","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Izabella Kaminska","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-02","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/48ac6bde-c821-3d74-9555-7ef9da98bb17","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F01%2F09173653%2Fkodadk1_2048x1152.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Kodak makes last desperate bid for relevance with cryptocurrency","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Today Kodak and WENN Digital, in a licensing partnership, announced the launch of the KODAKOne image rights management platform and KODAKCoin, a photo-centric cryptocurrency to empower photographers and agencies to take greater control in image rights management.

With KODAKCoin, participating photographers are invited to take part in a new economy for photography, receive payment for licensing their work immediately upon sale, and for both professional and amateur photographers, sell their work confidently on a secure blockchain platform. KODAKOne platform provides continual web crawling in order to monitor and protect the IP of the images registered in the KODAKOne.

But the whiplash-inducing change of position announced by the Long Island Iced Tea Corporation this week will take some beating. On December 13, the Hicksville-based company said it was “very excited” about a deal to distribute its soft drinks through a European healthy food and beverage group. On Thursday, it unexpectedly renamed itself Long Blockchain Corp, and said it was seeking opportunities in areas such as “digital cryptocurrency technology solutions for global financial markets”. Investors sucked up the new strategy in a way that they never really swallowed the beverages Long Island peddles. The shares surged more than 500 per cent in pre-market trading on Nasdaq. “From Mother Nature’s top shelf,” as Long Island’s staid, tea-centric slogan puts it, straight to new technology’s hype machine. During the first dotcom boom in 2000, I attended an editorial meeting in New York where the Financial Times’s commercial team told us, in all seriousness, that they had toyed with dropping the FT brand from FT.com, because of its old-economy taint One of the “opportunities” identified by the tea brewers of Hicksville is “a new smart contract platform for building decentralised applications that provides scalability beyond currently available options”. The speculative “company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is”, identified by Charles Mackay in his account of the South Sea Bubble, could not have left the growth possibilities more thrillingly open. Shape-shifting and name-changing have a long stock market history. The wily promoters in Anthony Trollope’s classic Victorian satire The Way We Live Now turn their California flour mill into a railway project, to take advantage of a market mania. “What has become of the mill?” asks one of the more innocent backers. “When there is such a thing as this on hand a trumpery mill like that is not worth speaking of,” points out his colleague. More recently, a flirtation with glamour industries such as science, telecommunications or defence has been enough to buoy stocks. Charles Geisst, in his history of Wall Street, points out that after the Russians put Sputnik into orbit in 1957, and President Eisenhower backed new research into weapons systems, “almost any company that made anything resembling rocket fuel . . . advanced in price”. Technology was hot. Hewlett-Packard came to market two years later “without any earnings to speak of”, Geisst writes, while investors piled into “companies known for clever or new ideas”, called “concept stocks”. A closer parallel with the blockchain stock mania — which a few weeks ago saw a biotech company, Bioptix, trade madly after renaming itself Riot Blockchain — is the first dotcom boom. A 1999 academic paper concluded that adding a dotcom suffix led to abnormal returns. “A mere association with the internet seems enough to provide a firm with a large and permanent value increase,” the researchers concluded. A surge in rebrandings and spin-offs affected even the least excitable organisations. At one point in 2000, I attended an editorial meeting in New York where the Financial Times’s commercial team told us, in all seriousness, that they had toyed with dropping the FT brand from FT.com, because of its old-economy taint. Permanent value increases were not, it turned out, on offer to many. The Nasdaq peaked in March 2000 and within six weeks companies were shedding the dotcom suffix as fast as they had acquired it. (One very notable exception: Amazon.com.) FT research at the time suggested that shares in the 102 US internet companies with dotcom or dotnet in their names had fallen by more than 50 per cent by the end of April that year. Long Blockchain Corp may of course avoid this fate. Its chief executive, Philip Thomas, says that having spotted this “once-in-a-generation opportunity”, he and his colleagues are “pursuing [their] new direction in a thoughtful and deliberate manner”. Concept stock or not, Long Blockchain has not given up on the soft drinks business. “I want to assure our beverage industry customers, suppliers, and partners of our continuing support of the Long Island Iced Tea portfolio of beverages,” declared Mr Thomas. Given the intensity of the blockchain frenzy, he may need to tap into its benefits, including the promise that “every sip releases a sense of guilt-free escapism from your fast paced surroundings”. The original Long Island Iced Tea cocktail is supposed to be a blend of gin, tequila, vodka and white rum, as well as lemon juice and Coke. “Most variants do not include any tea,” Wikipedia warns.

Moscow officials say President Vladimir Putin has commissioned work on establishing a cryptocurrency, as state-run Russian institutions rush to embrace blockchain, the shared ledger technology on which bitcoin and other digital currencies are based. Sergei Glazev, an economic adviser to Mr Putin, told a recent government meeting that a cryptorouble would be a useful tool to get around international sanctions. “This instrument suits us very well for sensitive activity on behalf of the state. We can settle accounts with our counterparties all over the world with no regard for sanctions,” Mr Glazev said. He added that the cryptocurrency would be “the same rouble, but its circulation would be restricted in a certain way”, allowing the Kremlin to track its every move. Following a meeting in the summer with Vitalik Buterin, the Russia-born founder of cryptocurrency Ethereum, Mr Putin ordered his cabinet to come up with a framework for regulating them. As with the internet, which the Kremlin has largely learnt to tame in recent years, the interest in cryptocurrencies reveals Russia’s desire to harness a concept originally designed to be free of government influence. Blockchain technology uses cryptography to allow many parties to share and update a single and immutable record of information without relying on a central authority. Several of the world’s biggest central banks have examined the potential of the technology. Some, such as Sweden’s Riksbank, are considering using it to launch their own digital currency. But others have shied away from adopting blockchain technology, which the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan described as too “immature” for use in their payment systems. Other authoritarian states such as North Korea are already reportedly stockpiling cryptocurrencies to make payments on the black market, or, in the case of Venezuela, attempting to create their own. But it is far more difficult to create a state-backed cryptocurrency that would replace existing financing models — such as raising capital for state-run banks or funding the defence sector — which are barred by sanctions. While cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin provide their owners with an element of anonymity — making them a popular way to pay for illicit activities — it is not clear how a cryptorouble would help Russian companies and individuals to escape international sanctions or avoid detection by US authorities. It is also unclear whether the cryptorouble would be issued by the Russian central bank or the country’s commercial banks and who would be able to open an account. “Crypto isn’t the answer in a quick way,” said Alan Waxman, head of corporate business at Gazprombank, the sanctioned state-run Russian lender. The Office of Foreign Assets Control, an arm of the US Treasury that implements sanctions, “can see the means of avoidance,” he added. Recommended A surge in interest in bitcoin led to sometimes frenzied trading in 2017 and drew warnings from regulators around the world of the dangerous volatility of the digital currency market. Bitcoin surged 20-fold over the year to a high of almost $20,000 before falling sharply. In Russia, more than $300m was raised in 2017 in “initial coin offerings” — sales of tokens that fund business projects — including $43m raised for a bitcoin mining farm run by Dmitry Marinichev, Mr Putin’s internet ombudsman. However, Russia’s central bank has said that cryptocurrencies “have all the signs of a financial pyramid”. It wants to restrict access to “qualified investors” to prevent a rerun of Ponzi schemes used to trick Russians unfamiliar with capitalism in the 1990s. Sasha Ivanov, who runs Waves, Russia’s largest blockchain platform, said the cryptocurrency market was “essentially like the unregulated financial market in 19th century America”. Sergei Gorkov, chief executive of VEB, the troubled Russian lender that ran up $18bn in foreign debt obligations and is now trying to reinvent itself as a blockchain leader, said putting government tenders and the bank’s loans on blockchain would make state institutions more transparent. But others disagree. “If you input the wrong data, the chain will still be false,” said an executive at another state-run Russian bank.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Max Seddon Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-02","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/60f838ea-e514-11e7-8b99-0191e45377ec","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fb1311828-e58b-11e7-97e2-916d4fbac0da?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin, blockchain and the fight against poverty","INTRO":"‘An economist believes that the key to fighting extreme poverty is to focus on property rights’","DETAILED_CONTENT":"It is nearly four decades since Sendero Luminoso, the brutal “Shining Path” Communist rebellion movement, started its campaign of bombings, assassinations and other terrorist attacks in Peru that went on until the 1990s. I first heard about it from a close friend who was working on an agricultural development project in the Andes when Shining Path swept into his remote valley, executing aid workers and government officials. My friend fled — and survived; others did not. In subsequent years, there were endless bloody battles between the Peruvian government and Shining Path, with the conflict fuelled by a deep sense of economic inequality and injustice on the side of the insurgents. This might seem like a piece of ancient history; by the late 1990s, the terrorist group was largely crushed. But now the conflict has come to my attention again, due to an unlikely development in cyberspace. This month, Hernando de Soto, an acclaimed development economist from Peru, joined forces with Patrick Byrne, a controversial American luminary of the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem, to launch an unusual project to fight poverty. What they hope to do is to use decentralised digital ledgers — similar to those used for bitcoin — to record the formal and informal property holdings of dispossessed communities, with the idea of giving them more security. This innovation might seem a million miles away from the Shining Path saga, and from our normal concept of philanthropy. After all, at this time of year, we tend to assume that “aid” is about donating money, sponsoring schools and so on. But De Soto is convinced that the key to tackling extreme poverty — and the desperate violence that can accompany it — is to focus on property rights. After all, he argues, when conflict explodes in poor communities, this is usually because people feel insecure and dispossessed. Even if poor people hold property, their ownership is often based on informal rights rather than any official government ledger — and their homes and land can be seized by big companies or government officials. Giving better property rights to the poor would mean more prosperity and security for everyone, De Soto believes. And he argues that one crucial reason why Shining Path was defeated was that the Peruvian government eventually did precisely that, awarding peasants land rights (partly on his advice). So he wants to repeat the trick around the world, using decentralised digital ledgers that will let poor communities record their formal and informal property rights in a permanent manner — without government interference. “When you have property rights, you can get credit, you can advance,” De Soto says. “It’s the key to economic growth — much better than aid.” He believes that blockchain technology, which was set up as a platform for digital currencies such as bitcoin, will let the poor help themselves, as he regards cyber rights as more important than charity. At first, this seemed to me just a crazy Christmas dream. Blockchain technology is distinctly controversial these days, as is Byrne. Although he has become fabulously wealthy in recent years by being one of the first entrepreneurs to jump on to the bitcoin and blockchain technology, he is a maverick and a libertarian. Also, the logistical challenges that could be involved in using cyber technology to record land rights seem formidable to me (as a non-tech expert). In any case, it is far from clear why governments (or anybody else) should recognise digital rights; it is also unclear how future disputes would be resolved. But De Soto is already doing some pilot projects, while Byrne is raising funds to underwrite the project by selling part (or even all) of his stake in one of his digital companies, Overstock (worth a putative $2bn). Indeed, he has already assembled a bunch of whizz-kids in Utah to start the process of creating a special form of blockchain. “I feel a great moral obligation to refocus my life around this,” he told the FT recently. Moreover, De Soto and Byrne are adamant that they can use social media tools such as Facebook to reach poor people and persuade them to record their property rights themselves. So, in the Christmas spirit of embracing miraculous ideas, I want to give a cheer for De Soto and Byrne. Yes, their digital-ledger idea might make my head spin and, yes, future historians might see this as a sign of how crazily exuberant our cyber-tech bubble has become. But maybe not. And, on one point, De Soto and Byrne are absolutely correct: if we want to combat poverty, we must think much harder about the global distribution of real-world property rights. So if this project helps to put this on the agenda, that would be a thoroughly good thing, Welcome to a new world of blockchain-related philanthropy.

In the UK, where productivity has stagnated since the financial crisis — even compared to rich-world peers — such experiments are part of a concerted drive to improve employee output. In recent years, a range of technologies have been proposed as potential silver bullets. Some promise to cut the time employees waste on repetitive jobs, while others aim to automate certain tasks altogether. So far, evidence of success has been mixed. “They haven’t had the impact in the UK that they have had elsewhere,” says Chris Brauer, director of innovation at Goldsmiths, University of London. Wearables, in particular, have proliferated in the US and China. Technology can augment productivity, Mr Brauer says, but despite its increasing use, the UK’s challenge to improve productivity remains “enormous”. Here are three areas that have received a lot of attention and investment from British companies. When Justin Fitzpatrick wants to communicate with colleagues at his London-based start-up, he turns not to email but to messaging app Slack. “By taking a lot of traffic off email, we’ve seen much quicker iteration on topics and quick decisions being made throughout our business,” says Mr Fitzpatrick, the 35-year-old chief executive of DueDil, an online database of company information. Slack has grown at breakneck speed since launching in 2014 and now has corporate customers including Oracle, Airbnb, Nasa and the Financial Times. By using “channels” on particular topics, it allows staff to share and discuss multimedia information quickly and easily, from different locations. Stewart Butterfield, Slack’s co-founder and chief executive, claims his product gave birth to the idea of a world without email and triggered the launch of competing products from tech giants Microsoft and Facebook. “In 10 years from now this internal communications category will be as big as customer relationship management and probably bigger,” he told the FT last September. “We kind of invented it.” However the “business productivity app” sector — a somewhat clumsy designation for such communication and workflow software — has yet to provide any measurable benefits in terms of output per employee. Slack’s introduction to the workplace also comes with drawbacks, says Mr Fitzpatrick. “[It] can create a hidden social space, which can be a distraction.” First came robotic process automation. Providers such as Blue Prism, UIPath and Automation Anywhere brought into the mainstream technology that automates repetitive back-office jobs such as data entry and number-crunching. It\u0027s the second time in my life I’ve seen this level of excitement over the possibility of a technology Now blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underlies cryptocurrencies, is offering companies a new way to experiment with this concept. Peter McBurney, professor of computer science at King\u0027s College London, points to sectors such as insurance and energy that have historically employed armies of workers to reconcile data. With a distributed ledger, for example, a shipping company, insurer, lawyers and brokers would all be able to check each other’s information about a cargo consignment without having to hire people to sit on the telephone. “It’s an area that they’ve been trying to automate but it’s quite difficult because there are so many different groups involved,” he says. “As a computer scientist it\u0027s the second time in my life I’ve seen this level of excitement over the possibility of a technology — and the first time was with the world wide web.” According to one insurance executive, who declined to be named, the technology will free up employees’ time for other work. Automation processes had already shown “tangible” benefits, he says. “There is a real business challenge that we could use blockchain for successfully — it’s a radical piece of innovation that will change the insurance value chain.” Four years have passed since the wearable craze triggered an explosion in the number of smart watches, GPS trackers and other gadgets designed to revolutionise fitness and to boost employee efficiency by monitoring productivity. More than 260m wearables were shipped in 2016, according to Gartner, the data provider, but the proportion designed for use by workers was a fraction of the total. Almost half of the figure were bluetooth headsets, not the chest straps, head-mounted displays and smart watches pitched at employers. Wearable devices have become popular in a handful of areas including logistics warehouses, employee wellbeing programmes and to monitor the alertness of drivers. But there has been less take-up elsewhere due in part to concerns about surveillance. Mr Brauer says: “The onboarding and adoption curve hasn’t played out in the way we might expect at enterprises, primarily because there is such stigma attached to their adoption in the UK.” Amit Patel, director of new ventures at healthcare provider Bupa UK, says this will change as companies gather more data and prove the benefits they can bring. Bupa’s “Boost” app has already been adopted by big employers such as Tesco and integrates with Fitbit’s smart wristbands to collect anonymised data that can be analysed for indicators of productivity. Mr Patel says it will eventually become possible to connect an employee’s activity with their likelihood of getting a promotion. “For things like return on investment metrics, they will be developed over time because they’re based on data. You need more data to say that, for example, companies that have engaged with the app have less absenteeism.” For now, the biggest productivity benefits come when wearables make employees fractionally faster at existing tasks, such as enabling them to move across factory floors more quickly or to identify broken machines. “Trying to do something like catch a potential illness early is a harder thing to quantify,” says Ben Salama, managing director of Industry X.0 at Accenture, a consultancy. “But productivity also comes from your equipment running for longer and breaking down less frequently, or your workers working more efficiently.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Aliya Ram","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-15","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/3fa91346-e670-11e7-8b99-0191e45377ec","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F58e28d84-e679-11e7-97e2-916d4fbac0da?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Iced tea maker soars 500% after pivot to blockchain","INTRO":"Surging stocks prompt US regulator alert over potential cryptocurrency ‘scams’","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A US securities regulator has warned investors against “potential scams” following a surge in stock prices of hitherto obscure companies that announce a sudden switch of strategy into cryptocurrencies. The alert came as shares in Long Island Iced Tea Corp, a maker of soft drinks, leapt as much as 500 per cent on Thursday morning after it announced it was changing its name to Long Blockchain Corp. The Nasdaq-listed company, which has never reported a profit and two weeks ago struck a distribution deal for cold-pressed juice, said it was “shifting its primary corporate focus towards the exploration of an investment in opportunities that leverage the benefits of blockchain technology”. This sudden embrace of blockchain, a type of decentralised ledger technology best known for powering bitcoin, makes the company the latest in a string of small US stocks to more than double their value in a day by adding it to their names, a trend reminiscent of the wildest days of the late 1990s technology bubble. Other companies that have surged in value after refocusing their businesses on blockchain technology include Rich Cigars, a cigar maker that trades on the over the counter market, which jumped by 2,000 per cent on a single day. LongFin, a business specialising in trade finance that went public on Nasdaq this month, announced it had bought a blockchain-related venture, sending its value up by 10 times. This eruption in speculative activity in the more esoteric corners of the US stock market has been inspired by a surge in the value of cryptocurrencies this year that has captured the imagination of retail investors. On Thursday the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority of the US issued an “investor alert” warning the public to “beware of potential stock scams when considering the purchase of shares of companies that tout high returns associated with cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin”. Recommended Earlier this week US regulators stepped in to stop trading in Crypto Company, a penny stock whose value surged more than 2,000 per cent this month to a paper value of $12bn. The jump briefly sent the company into the ranks of one of the 500 largest public companies in America and its largest shareholder become a multibillionaire on paper. Bonnie Barsamian, partner at law firm Drinker Biddle \u0026 Reath, said it was “not surprising” to see companies jumping on the blockchain bandwagon, noting that unknown companies would use it to raise their profiles with retail investors. “Pigs by any other name will still stink,” she said. “There is precedent for it,” she added, pointing to the dotcom boom when companies added the word “online” to their names. US regulators have said they are monitoring developments associated with cryptocurrencies closely, with the chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission urging investors this month to be cautious. Ms Barsamian said publicly traded companies making the decision to enact a sudden shift in strategy towards blockchain or cryptocurrencies run the risk of falling foul of securities laws. These groups needed to disclose changes in direction to shareholders, and they must be approved the board of directors, she said. This week the founder of Litecoin, one of the most traded cryptocurrencies, announced he had sold all of his Litecoin holdings to avoid what he called a “conflict of interest” that arose when he spoke publicly about his creation. He had previously tweeted that the rise in value of Litecoin had become overdone, and that investors should be wary about investing unless they were willing to suffer a drop in price.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Miles Johnson Adam Samson Nicholas Megaw","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-12-21","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/2ef64f85-18b4-3538-b67e-7fe8ccc4e5e5","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Ff2903fe4-d4f9-11e7-ae3e-563c04c5339a?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Shares in soft drink company spike 500% after it adds ‘blockchain’ to name","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Bubble, what bubble?

As an actual payments mechanism, bitcoin sucks. It’s expensive to use and getting ever more so. It can be slow and unpredictable. It’s complicated and very user unfriendly (computer nerds will dispute this, but in doing so show how detached they are from the everyday needs of the average population). It depends on untested third parties for usability even more so than conventional electronic money. It’s prone to hacking. It demands users read Reddit all day every day to keep up with the latest exchange, transaction and wallet updates. It passes way too much responsibility to the average user (even the well-educated lose passwords). It sucks on the energy efficiency front. Its volatility makes it a crappy medium exchange. And finally, if not foremost, the more of a speculative asset it becomes the less useful it becomes as a currency. But that was our opinion. The above was summed up in an even more compelling way by Philip Lowe, governor of the RBA, in a speech this week: One class of technology that has emerged that can be used for payments is the so-called cryptocurrencies, the most prominent of which is Bitcoin. But in reality these currencies are not being commonly used for everyday payments and, as things currently stand, it is hard to see that changing. The value of Bitcoin is very volatile, the number of payments that can currently be handled is very low, there are governance problems, the transaction cost involved in making a payment with Bitcoin is very high and the estimates of the electricity used in the process of mining the coins are staggering. When thought of purely as a payment instrument, it seems more likely to be attractive to those who want to make transactions in the black or illegal economy, rather than everyday transactions. So the current fascination with these currencies feels more like a speculative mania than it has to do with their use as an efficient and convenient form of electronic payment. Another popular opinion, of course, is that central banks should issue their own emonies instead. We were supportive of this view for a while until… well, we sat down and really thought about it. Then we realised it’s not the panacea everyone is making it out to be at all. Opening the central bank balance sheet in electronic form to the everyday user brings forth many potential risks and downsides (especially on the asset-side). Lowe gets to some of these points too: Among the potential downsides, the main one lies in the area of financial stability. If we were to issue electronic banknotes, it is possible that in times of banking system stress, people might seek to exchange their deposits in commercial banks for these banknotes, which are a claim on the central bank. It is likely that the process of switching from commercial bank deposits to digital banknotes would be easier than switching to physical banknotes. In other words, it might be easier to run on the banking system. This could have adverse implications for financial stability. Adding: We do not see a case for the RBA offering every Australian a bank account for the purposes of making payments. Doing so would fundamentally change our banking system in a way that would not promote the public interest. As for the case for “blockchain dollars”, he notes, the verdict is still out: A convincing case for issuing Australian dollars on the blockchain for use with limited private systems has not yet been made. It is certainly possible that this type of system could lead to more efficient, lower-cost business processes and payments. My working hypothesis here is that such a case could develop, although we need to work through a range of complex operational and policy questions. Good on Lowe. All in all, the speech is a nicely balanced summary of the epayments situation. It’s well worth a read in full precisely because of its grown-up perspective, which is refreshing given many a central bank has been getting drunk on the collective cryptocurrency/blockchain Kool-Aid. Most of all, however, we like the fact Lowe advocates consumer choice. In doing so he’s pushing back on the absolutism that’s increasingly being preached across the entire fintech space, whether that’s from blockchain and crypto “thought leaders” or academics who like to claim electronic payments will be a cure all for all the corruption and illicit trade in the system. (They won’t because the more system is made electronic, the more financial fraud explodes.) The question is, will anyone actually take any note?

Almost 40 per cent of exchanges, trading venues and clearing houses anticipate disruption from big tech in the next five years, according to a new report by McKinsey, the consultancy, and World Federation of Exchanges, a trade body. Blockchain, automation and artificial intelligence are among the developments that industries from banking to retail have identified as having the potential to bring benefits as well as upheaval. Just a fifth of the exchanges and trading venues questioned by McKinsey expect start-ups to cause the disruption in their industry. “Is there a Kodak moment and we’re not seeing it?” said Matthias Voelkel, a partner at McKinsey, referring to Eastman Kodak, the photography pioneer often cited as an example of a household name failing to adapt to technological change. “Large tech could do anything,” he added. The anxiety among providers of market infrastructure is also a reflection of the blurring lines between tech companies and exchanges, as both see profits in data that can be used in research, analytics as well as the construction of an index or tradeable financial products. The pace of investment in areas that affect operators of market infrastructure such as exchanges, trading venues and clearing houses has outstripped that in areas like payments and banking since 2015, McKinsey said. Concern over the threat posed by large tech companies is amplified because they are technologically nimble, have ample firepower, access to issuers and consumers, the report found. Some exchanges have even compared themselves to a TV network that requires data, or in the case of a broadcaster, content, to remain relevant. “We want to protect and build and diversify our industry leading content. We might do that through combinations or combining structured and unstructured data. We want to be the network,” Lance Uggla, chief executive of IHS Markit, the $20bn data provider, told the Financial Times. However, the exchanges are unsure whether they may ultimately end up in competition with big tech or it will result in more ventures and collaboration between them and Silicon Valley. The study from McKinsey estimated that investment by fintech in capital markets had nearly quadrupled since 2010, and stood at more than $2bn in 2016. Numbers for 2017 have been swelled by initial coin offerings, in which blockchain-based start-ups issue their own digital “coins”. CB Insights estimates that blockchain start-ups, alone, pulled in $2.8bn using ICO funding last year, five times as much as equity funding. “We don’t know of a member who isn’t looking at fintech, who isn’t looking at this space right now,” said Nandini Sukumar, chief executive of the WFE. The survey also showed a mismatch in perception between the fintech companies and exchanges over where innovation in capital markets is most active. Most fintechs saw more innovation in areas like opening up access to capital, developing analytics and data or execution of trades. By contrast, half of all exchanges saw it in post-trade services like clearing and settlement, via blockchain. Blockchains are electronic databases of transactions, whereby new deals are added to the chain and then stamped and protected with a mathematical equation. “It’s a classic disconnect between industry and start-up,” said Ms Sukumar. “Post-trade is an area that has typically lacked investment.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-01","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/d4a6d698-dfa6-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F92eb2668-dfd9-11e7-a8a4-0a1e63a52f9c?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Overstock chief explores sale to fund blockchain venture","INTRO":"Patrick Byrne plans to help build global property registry using technology","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Patrick Byrne, the controversial entrepreneur who runs Overstock.com, is exploring options to sell the online retailer, whose stock has soared amid cryptocurrency mania, and plans to use the money to create a digital global property registry. Mr Byrne’s family owns 40 per cent of Overstock, which includes an ecommerce arm that accepts bitcoin and a venture fund that invests in blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies. Its shares are up 219 per cent this year giving it a market capitalisation of about $1.4bn. Mr Byrne, best known for his campaign against short selling, is joining forces with Hernando de Soto, a well-known Peruvian economist who argues that formalising land rights is key to alleviating poverty. They plan to use blockchain to gather local informal ownership records into a distributed online ledger system, making the records easier to trace and harder to forge. Their venture called De Soto, Inc expects to start a pilot project in early 2018. “One of the possibilities is I sell the [Overstock] business and we have all the capital we need” to fund the new venture, Mr Byrne told the Financial Times. He said he planned to recruit a dozen Overstock employees to take over to De Soto by late January. To fund the scheme, Mr Byrne has hired Guggenheim Partners to explore options for selling Utah-based Overstock, which has 2,000 employees. Recommended The possibilities include selling the entire company to a private equity firm or an investment firm. Mr Byrne could also sell just the retail business Overstock.com, which offers everything from discount furniture to watches, to a bricks-and-mortar company seeking a strong online presence. That move would capitalise on growing fears of disruption by Amazon. “Really, since this summer there’s a mass freak-out in corporate America,” Mr Byrne observed. That would leave the company with Medici Ventures, which invests in blockchain technology companies. Its most closely watched bet is tZERO, an exchange geared towards initial coin offerings, which has been touted as Wall Street meets blockchain. It will launch its own much-hyped initial coin offering to raise funds next week. Mr Byrne said Overstock had already received an approach from a multibillion-dollar investment fund that does not “want to cede the earth to Amazon”. He would not name the fund, but hinted that interest from Asia was especially strong. Mr de Soto, a recipient of the $500,000 Milton Friedman Prize from the Cato Institute, a conservative think-tank, was linked to a Land Registry blockchain project with the Republic of Georgia in April 2016.

The relentless rise of bitcoin and other digital currencies this year has been much-mocked by many analysts and investors, who see it as an obvious bubble. But advocates continue to shrug off the scepticism, despite bitcoin supporters admitting it is showing signs of a classic investment mania. “I think this is going to become the biggest bubble of our lifetime by a long shot,” Michael Novogratz, a former hedge fund manager turned digital currency proselyte, said at an industry conference. The primary, mainstream way to bet on the bitcoin craze has been to buy the shares of chipmakers such as Nvidia, AMD and Intel, which make products that are used to “mine” the most famous cryptocurrency. Nvidia’s fast graphics cards are particularly popular with bitcoin miners and the Californian group’s shares have rallied more than 79 per cent this year, even after a recent wobble caused by a broader stock market rotation away from tech stocks. Another popular trade is the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust, a vehicle that says it owns more than 171,000 bitcoins and changes hands on the over-the-counter market OTCQX. Grayscale aims to give investors simple exposure to the cryptocurrency without the hassle of buying and storing it. Highlighting the extent of the mania, its shares trade at a marked premium to the value of its holdings. GBTC’s ownership of bitcoin is valued presently at about $2.6bn, while the trust trades at a market value of $3.1bn after a 1,256 per cent climb so far this year. The Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to approve any of the bitcoin-related exchange-traded fund proposals filed in the US but there is a Swedish bitcoin ETF — strictly speaking, an exchange-traded note — called Bitcoin Tracker One. An ETN is a synthetic product that could fail if the sponsor implodes. Moreover, while SKr5bn Bitcoin Tracker One has done a middling job of tracking the digital currency — bitcoin is up 1,552 per cent this year while the ETN is up ‘just’ 1,197 per cent — it charges a 2.5 per cent annual management fee, far higher than most passive products. Some companies have smelt an opportunity in the bubble. For example, Riot Blockchain was originally a struggling tiny biotechnology company called Bioptix. Then this autumn it abruptly announced its name change. The group said it was starting to mine bitcoin and was making an investment in Coinsquare, a Canadian digital currency exchange. If the move seems nakedly opportunistic, it has certainly benefited Riot/Bioptix’s stock. The company’s shares were trading below $4 each midyear but popped to a high of nearly $24 in late November and are at $15.86 presently, valuing it at $132m. Many technologists are more interested in blockchain, the system that underpins digital currencies. Bitcoin’s wild ride higher has in turn boosted the stocks of a bevy of blockchain-related companies. Take Canada-based Hive Blockchain Technologies, which says it is both a bitcoin miner and a distributed ledger company. Earlier this year, the group was a penny stock but its shares are now trading at C$3.24, a gain of over 3,000 per cent in 2017, giving it a market capitalisation of $773m.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Robin Wigglesworth","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-12-08","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/c9b86e8e-dae4-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F7e8cc2c0-dae9-11e7-9504-59efdb70e12f?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"ASX chooses blockchain for equities clearing","INTRO":"Australian bourse becomes first big exchange to commit to the technology","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The Australian Securities Exchange is planning to use blockchain technology to manage the clearing and settlement of equities. The decision to replace its ageing clearing and settlement system, known as Chess, with distributed ledger technology — the engine behind the digital currency bitcoin — makes it one of the world’s first global exchanges to commit to the technology. The ASX on Thursday said Digital Asset Holdings, the company run by former JPMorgan Chase executive Blythe Masters, has built and tested the software. “ASX has been carefully examining distributed ledger technology for almost two and a half years, including the last two years with Digital Asset,” said Dominic Stevens, chief executive of ASX. He said the system would cut trading costs and put Australia “at the forefront of innovation in financial markets”. Blockchain is an electronic ledger of transactions that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records. The ledger is shared among parties on computer servers and protected by cryptography. Some say it is a threat to banks and exchanges because it could disintermediate them by removing the need for a central reconciliation authority. But others just see an opportunity for institutions to save billions of dollars by eliminating inefficiencies and the need for trade insurance. ASX has not decided on the date to launch the blockchain system and said its cost was comparable to the expense of replacing Chess with another platform. ASX will operate the system on a secure private network with known participants. The participants must comply with regulation, according to the ASX, which said its system had nothing to do with blockchain technology deployed by cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Recommended Some analysts have questioned how the technology can be made secure and fast enough to be adopted by large institutions. But Mr Stevens said he saw the introduction of the system as an opportunity for more timely and accurate information. The ASX said it had been testing the new software for equities clearing and settlement over the past two years. “After so much hype surrounding distributed ledger technology, today’s announcement delivers the first meaningful proof that the technology can live up to its potential,” Ms Masters said. ASX was an early investor in DAH, alongside more than a dozen financial and technology groups, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Santander, BNP Paribas, Accenture, IBM and the Depository Trust \u0026 Clearing Corporation (DTCC). Most global exchanges are looking into using blockchain, including Nasdaq, which has already employed the technology for trading private securities in the US and is testing it for the Estonian market. The US-based exchange operator is also selling blockchain-enabled technology to other bourses. DTCC, a US clearing and settlement services provider, introduced blockchain for storing credit default swap trade information. Meanwhile, Euroclear, one of the world’s largest settlement houses, has joined start-up Paxos to develop a settlement system for the London gold market.

Philip Lowe, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said the bank was analysing the benefits and drawbacks of issuing an electronic form of the Australian dollar — the “eAUD” — alongside traditional banknotes. Speaking at the Australian Payment Summit on Wednesday, Mr Lowe said: “It is possible that the RBA might, in time, issue a new form of digital money…perhaps using distributed ledger technology.” He added that although the RBA has “no immediate plans” to issue digital dollars, the central bank is continuing to look at the pros and cons. The central bank also is exploring a new digital dollar settlement system based on the use of distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin. Digital dollars could take the form of a “token” that is issued and stored in consumers’ digital wallets, which can then be used for payments in a similar way to physical bank notes. [Bitcoin] seems more likely to be attractive to those who want to make transactions in the black or illegal economy The development comes as the value of bitcoin has soared over the past several weeks, reaching a record high of $17,428.42 on Tuesday after starting the year at $1,000. The surge has fuelled concerns the cryptocurrency is forming a bubble. Central banks, commercial banks and other financial institutions are exploring how to use private distributed ledgers to make financial transactions cheaper, more transparent, and less vulnerable to fraud. Banks and settlement systems currently use central electronic ledgers to track money transfers. But these systems often rely on manual input and are open to hacking. Distributed ledger records transactions through a network of computers rather than a single central party. Other central banks including the Bank of England already are in the process of trialling blockchain-like systems. The attractions of the technology include the ability to make fast digital money transfers that do not carry the cost of handling cash, tracked securely by the network. However, Mr Lowe said a potential drawback is the lack of a central entity standing behind the liability. “I don’t think anyone is proposing a switchover from physical to digital; there is going to be a long transition period…Over time we will see the gradual digitalisation of the currently cash-enabled economy,” said James Lloyd, Asia-Pacific fintech leader at EY. “I do think there’s an inevitability to it,” he added, noting that developing the technology is a comparatively simple compared to the challenges of regulations, laws and encouraging adoption. The initiatives come as use of cash is on the decline in Australia, echoing trends elsewhere around the world, such as in the Nordics. The RBA cited its 2016 survey, showing cash accounted for 37 per cent of household transactions, down from 70 per cent in 2007. Bitcoin has taken off across Asia, fuelling the recent frenzy for the cryptocurrency as investors in Japan buy in with leverage up to 15 times their cash deposit. Mr Lowe said the current fascination with cryptocurrencies “feels more like a speculative mania than it has to do with their use as an efficient and convenient form of electronic payment”. He added that bitcoin “seems more likely to be attractive to those who want to make transactions in the black or illegal economy”.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Emma Dunkley Alice Woodhouse","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-12-13","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/2d161cf6-c3b1-11e7-b30e-a7c1c7c13aab","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fdd92161c-cf1d-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How business schools teach cryptocurrencies","INTRO":"Students and executives want an education in bitcoin and others","DETAILED_CONTENT":"David Yermack is a man in great demand. In 2014, the professor of finance at the NYU Stern School of Business helped it become the first major university to launch a course in the nascent field of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Since then the course has taken off and as well as teaching it in New York, Prof Yermack now travels the world as a visiting professor to lecture on the fast-moving field of cryptocurrencies at universities in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Basel and Stockholm. “I attended some events in New York and there was huge demand for people trained in the compliance and tax aspects of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, so we set up the course in 2014, the first of its kind,” he says. “Since then it has taken on a life of its own.” Blockchain is a shared ledger technology that powers cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, the value of which recently rose above $10,000, up almost 13 times in the past year. The technology allows encrypted data on anything, from money to medical records, to be shared between many companies, people and institutions. This protects data from fraud while instantly updating all parties concerned. Experts say the demand for expertise is coming from all sectors — from financial services to retail — and it is far outstripping supply. “It is a fast-moving topic with tokenomics and cryptocurrencies changing whole industries,” says Oliver Bussmann, former chief information officer at the Swiss bank UBS who now advises blockchain start-ups. “The more people can learn about it and what potential it has, the more understanding they will have of what financial services will look like in five years.” Big companies have steered clear of bitcoin, fearing its links to fraud and criminality. But now they see vast potential in the underlying technology to improve the efficiency of everything from tracking food products to processing financial transactions. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, summed up the mood of big business last month by describing bitcoin as “a fraud”, while also saying: “Blockchain is a technology that is a good technology. We actually use it. It will be useful in a lot of different things.” Prof Yermack at NYU Stern says blockchain technology “is really changing every industry”. Describing its potential as “probably as important as the introduction of double-entry bookkeeping”, he says there is “enormous student interest for this, for the jobs it offers”. The NYU Stern cryptocurrencies course had a few dozen students when it started out. That has now grown to more than 100 students this year, with a waiting list, and as many as 300 expected next year. “We are moving it to our largest auditorium, with capacity for 350 students,” he says. The subject matter is so fast-moving that it is hard for academics to keep up. Prof Yermack says the advent of “initial coin offerings”, which have allowed blockchain-based companies to raise more than $2bn this year, forced him to rewrite much of the syllabus this year. “Year over year we’ll change well over half the course material,” he says. “It keeps you young to be reading half the night just to keep up with the latest innovations.” NYU Stern, which charges MBA students more than $70,000 a year and undergraduates more than $50,000, is planning to launch an undergraduate course in blockchain and cryptocurrencies. But like many universities it is running into a shortage of teachers. “Our biggest challenge is finding enough people to teach the courses,” says Prof Yermack. Every university will have a blockchain course in five years. More institutions would like to teach it now, but it’s a question of having a professor around to do it Stanford University launched a bitcoin and cryptocurrencies course two years ago, but it stopped this year after losing some key staff. Joseph Bonneau left Stanford to join NYU Courant, where he teaches a blockchain course as part of its computer sciences faculty. “I’m pretty sure that every university will have a blockchain course in five years,” he says. “More institutions would like to teach it now, but it’s a question of having a professor around to do it.” The rapid spread of blockchain courses is being driven by the red-hot jobs market in the sector, with the best engineers in the field commanding a starting salary above $250,000. Jens Martin, programme director at the University of Amsterdam, says that after its new blockchain and cryptocurrencies course became the most popular module on its international finance masters this year it plans to add a second, more practical, course on the subject next year. Chris Knoll left a job as an equity analyst in South Africa to take the course in Amsterdam and soon after graduating this year he got a job at a private equity group in the Dutch city. “I don’t have the computer programming background to make it in fintech, but I’m really interested in it and if ever an opportunity came up in that area I’d take it with both hands,” says the 28-year-old. “Blockchain is going to change the world.” “There is a big demand for computer science students that have a good understanding of blockchain right now,” says Aggelos Kiayias, chair in cyber security and privacy and director of the blockchain technology laboratory at the University of Edinburgh, which launched a cryptocurrency course this year. “It serves as a very nice use case that the students can apply in a lot of other domains, like cyber security.” There are already scores of internet tutorials, many of them available free as massive open online courses (Moocs). Coursera, an education-focused tech company, has joined with Princeton University to offer an 11-week online cryptocurrency technologies course. At the other end of the spectrum is B9lab, a fee-charging institution based in London and Hamburg offering a 40-hour online course in blockchain for technical executives and analysts spread over nine weeks at a cost of €2,350. Elias Haase, co-founder of B9lab, says demand for the course has been steady, if unspectacular, with about 40 people expected to take part this year. But he expects interest to grow, saying: “There is definitely a disconnect between the willingness of companies to invest in talent and the amount of money being raised in the system, which will eventually have to be rectified.” This feature is taken from our European Business Schools special report","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-29","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/df75ff98-8904-11e7-afd2-74b8ecd34d3b","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F64d6d260-ce4d-11e7-9dbb-291a884dd8c6?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Hull launches its own ‘social’ cryptocurrency","INTRO":"Volunteers who earn HullCoins are rewarded with discounts at local shops","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Volunteers and community workers may soon be able to obtain discounts at local retailers and even reductions in their council tax, thanks to technology that puts a value on socially-useful tasks. The scheme, which is being pioneered in Hull, an English port city in east Yorkshire, is an application of the blockchain technology used in digital currencies such as bitcoin, and has won £240,000 in government and charitable funding. If it is successful, the scheme could be rolled out nationally. It is also attracting interest from continental Europe, the US and Africa. A number of places in the UK, including Lewes and Bristol, have experimented with their own currencies to boost local business. Unlike these local coins, however, HullCoins are digital and can only be earned by “good works”, rather than bought or sold with hard cash. A description of the work done is permanently attached to the “coin”. They are like a corporate loyalty card but for community loyalty, says David Shepherdson, co-founder and chief executive of Kaini Industries, a not-for-profit company set up to develop the technology. The idea originated in 2014 when Mr Shepherdson, then financial inclusion officer at Hull county council, was asked by Lisa Bovill, head of welfare rights, to research local currencies. The pair then left to found Kaini Industries. Local businesses offer discounts — usually between 10 and 50 per cent — to holders of HullCoins. Mr Shepherdson says companies like the concept because it attracts customers and boosts corporate social responsibility credentials at the same time. “Businesses love discounts because they create footfall,” he says. “But this is discounting without devaluing the brand. Every discount they give for a HullCoin links them to something supporting the local community.” The coins are given out as QR codes on mobile phones. People can earn them by helping children to read, running youth clubs and arranging activities for pensioners. Even achievements such as giving up smoking count, because they reduce the burden on health services. Community groups, charities, schools, public health bodies, jobcentres and prisons will be able to issue the coins once approved by HullCoin. “Using blockchain technology, we embed time-stamped evidence of the positive social outcome of whatever activity has been undertaken into the coin itself,” says Mr Shepherdson. “This creates a distributed ledger of all the socially good things happening in the community and gives people a social CV they can show to a prospective employer.” Recommended Bob Clark, who is currently unemployed and volunteering in a Hull community centre, says: “Some of my volunteering experience has been quite hard to reference. HullCoin provides an easy way of providing evidence of what I’ve done.” Another advantage, Mr Clark says, is that his unemployment benefit is unaffected by earning HullCoins. “Not being penalised financially is a massive attraction. It provides an incentive to volunteer between jobs.” HullCoins retain their value indefinitely, unlike customer loyalty points. They can be passed between people and reused by businesses. The coins have no specific value — the amount of discount is decided by the retailer. Matt Cunnah, managing director of The Hull Pie, a chain of pie shops, wants to link the value to the action that earned them. “If the good thing was quitting smoking or taking someone’s dog for a walk, I might offer 10 per cent or 15 per cent off,” he says. “Whereas if someone has given blood or pulled a person from a burning car, I might give a 100 per cent discount.” There are rules on what retailers can offer discounts on. HullCoins cannot be used for cigarettes or alcohol. Takeaway food has been a tricky area as it can be seen as bad for health and unhelpful for those on a tight budget. HullCoin has an independent volunteer-run ethics committee to adjudicate on such cases. HullCoin is in beta testing and has 800 volunteer users, 73 issuing organisations and 140 retailers offering discounts. The plan is to launch the currency in January 2018.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jane Bird","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-23","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/a36399fa-a927-11e7-ab66-21cc87a2edde","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Ff5cf3824-c3e5-11e7-b30e-a7c1c7c13aab?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Will blockchain accelerate trade flows?","INTRO":"Technology raises hopes for increased efficiency and security at borders","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Global trade has seen little innovation since the arrival of the shipping container in the 1950s. Goods are still transported over sea or land in much the same way as they were then. But one area most in need of a technological revolution is the paperwork and bureaucracy generated by cross-border trade. From letters of credit to product quality documentation, trade generates stacks of documents. Behind this administrative thicket is the laudable desire to eradicate ills such as human trafficking, counterfeit goods and illegal smuggling. Yet a growing number of companies believe blockchain technology could speed up trade, all the while improving, rather than compromising, security. “International trade demands a faster, more secure and more efficient way to handle the document approval workflows needed to move goods across international borders,” says Ramesh Gopinath, vice-president of blockchain solutions at IBM, which is working on trade-related digital ledger technologies with partners including Maersk and Walmart. “Traditionally, supply chains have relied on the physical movement of large volumes of paper documents, leaving the window open for fraud, human error and inadvertent delays.” He says the administrative costs of processing, moving, verifying and securing this documentation can almost double the cost of simply moving a shipment. Blockchain, a distributed ledger — the underlying technology for virtual currencies such as bitcoin — is a useful ‘middleware’ for slashing such bureaucracy. It records transactions in sequential blocks, creating encrypted data that can be shared between several parties through the supply chain, updating them instantly without risk of fraud. “With roots in financial services, digital ledger technology is making inroads into goods transport through financial instruments, such as letters of credit, and through the digitisation of traditional trade and shipping documents,” says Wolfgang Lehmacher, head of supply chain and transport industries at the World Economic Forum. Recommended To quantify the documentation involved in ‘business as usual’, Danish shipping giant Maersk tracked a shipment of flowers from the Kenyan port of Mombasa to Rotterdam. The process generated dozens of documents and nearly 200 communications involving farmers, freight forwarders, land-based transporters, customs brokers, governments, ports and carriers. Maersk’s blockchain-based approach, developed with IBM, puts all documents into a single, template-based workflow, kicked off when the farmer submits the packing list. As each step is completed, documents are captured and shared so participants can see what has been submitted, when, and by whom. “No one party can modify, delete or even append any record without the consensus from others on the network,” says Mr Gopinath. The ransomware hack that hit AP Moller-Maersk in June, sufficiently severe as to cause the company to cut its profit guidance, has no doubt increased the imperative to develop tamper-proof tools. Maersk and IBM are not alone in deploying blockchain to quicken trade processing times. In August 2016, a consortium of banks, with the Singaporean government, used blockchain to prototype a letter of credit, through which banks guarantee buyers’ payments. A month later, Barclays used blockchain to complete a trade finance deal, and in 2017 a South Korean consortium used blockchain to track reefer containers from Busan to Qingdao, monitoring everything from shipment booking to cargo delivery. Start-ups and small firms are also experimenting. London-based Everledger uses blockchain to ‘track and protect’ valuable assets like diamonds across the life cycle, creating a digital thumbprint used by participants along the supply chain to verify authenticity, while BlockVerify is tackling counterfeiting in industries including pharmaceuticals and electronics. While offering a rare promise — to simultaneously accelerate processing and improve security — blockchain, and digital ledger technologies, pose challenges. The technology might be tamper-proof and collaboration-friendly, but the same is not always true of its users, or of the technologies that move data from blockchain into the real world. “While blockchain technology itself is highly resilient, blockchain applications might be vulnerable,” explains Mr Lehmacher, referring to the hacking of multiple exchanges used for the Ethereum and bitcoin cryptocurrencies. Another challenge, he adds, is that the “technical capabilities to handle very large transaction volumes remains unproven, and the costs of maintaining the protocol are high”. Ordinary companies and individuals need to be trained to use blockchain tools correctly. Such ‘permissioned’ blockchain systems are heavily dependent on collaboration and work only when all the parties want to use the technology, and have the technical wherewithal to do so. It will also be difficult to take blockchain from pilot projects to widespread use, given the risks that come with overhauling decades-old financial processing infrastructures. But in cross-border trade, at least, participants would benefit from the simpler, automated workflows and smart contracts that blockchain can generate. The bribe-taking border officials and illicit traders would lose out.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Adam Green","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-10","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/cd257642-6bed-3721-b1d2-9cbd3e071485","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F7b8fe75c-cee9-11e7-947e-f1ea5435bcc7?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ex-Wall St sheriff Lawsky joins board of blockchain start-up Ripple","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Benjamin Lawsky, former New York superintendent of Financial Services, is joining the board at enterprise blockchain start-up Ripple, a heavy-weight appointment lending regulatory gravitas to the company, which in 2015 was the first virtual currency exchanger to be fined by a US financial watchdog. Mr Lawsky, who garnered a reputation for toughness during his four-year tenure as New York’s top finance regulator, is credited with designing the BitLicense, the state’s regulation for digital asset businesses. Only three companies have received this accreditation, according to the New York Department of Financial Services — including Ripple. The former government official tweeted this morning that he was “[e]xcited and humbled” by the appointment at Ripple — a San Francisco-based start-up, which is building enterprise software for financial services using distributed ledger blockchain technology, touted as making payments and settlements cheaper and more efficient. Ripple proposes to use its own digital currency, XRP, to help banks with liquidity for cross-border payments. The ambitious young blockchain company had a minor skirmish with regulators two years ago, when the US’ Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) fined it $700,000. FinCEN charged Ripple with violating Bank Secrecy Act rules by selling its virtual currency, XRP, without registering with FinCEN, and, said the watchdog, “failing to implement and maintain an adequate anti-money laundering (AML) program”. Mr Lawsky joins an eclectic board, which includes Susan Athey, a Stanford economics professor; Ripple investor and venture capitalist Arjan Schütte; Gene Sperling, an economic adviser to Bill Clinton; and Ken Kurson, former chief editor of Jared Kushner-owned magazine the New York Observer. Ripple has also added a new chief financial officer, Ron Will, who joins from advertising software company TubeMogul. Mr Will previously collaborated with Ripple’s current chief executive, Brad Garlinghouse, when both were working at Yahoo!. “Lawsky and Will will play central roles in Ripple’s mission to achieve frictionless cross-border payments through the increased use of the digital asset XRP by financial institutions around the world,” said Ripple. A spokesperson for Ripple said Mr Will has taking over the top finance job from Cameron Kinloch, who was vice president of finance.

The platform will trace the diamonds’ route through the value chain, from mine to consumer, Bruce Cleaver, chief executive of the Anglo American-owned company, said. “Consumers should be able to know there is an accurate register of a diamond’s journey that provides assurance of its provenance and authenticity,” Mr Cleaver said. The platform will create a more secure register of each transaction involving the diamond, De Beers said. It be an open platform for those in the diamond industry that will allow for further apps to be built on top of it, the company said. Diamonds are mostly sold by De Beers to authorised buyers at a series of so-called “sights” in Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. They are then normally sent to be polished or cut before ending up with retailers. Concern over conflict diamonds led to the establishment of the Kimberley Process in 2003. Diamonds are now sent in sealed containers accompanied by certificates that say they are conflict-free. But critics have said the process does not help prevent money-laundering using diamonds.

The same applies to the vehicles or robots that transport them, which is why new levels of internet of things (IoT) connectivity are encouraging supply chain companies to invest to get products to the right place, faster and in good condition. The US presidential order last week increasing the powers of local government to approve drone tests is likely to give companies such as Amazon and Google parent company Alphabet more leeway to try out their ideas. Until now, federal regulations have forced these companies to seek out test environments further afield, as with Alphabet’s Project Wing, which is testing food delivery via drone in rural Australia, in partnership with Guzman y Gomez, a local Mexican restaurant chain. At present, a select group of testers can download the test app to order and pay for burritos that will be delivered by drone to their backyards. While Project Wing’s unmanned-traffic management platform allows for planning of flight routes, sensors on the drones are responsible for identifying obstacles, such as cars or outdoor furniture left in unexpected spots. “The more test deliveries we do, exposing the sensors on our aircraft to new delivery locations, the smarter our aircraft’s algorithms will one day become at picking a safe spot for deliveries,” James Ryan Burgess, co-lead of Project Wing, said in a recent blog post. Since Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico in September, shipping company Tote Maritime has been delivering thousands of containers of food, water, oxygen, generators and other essential items to the island. It is fortunate that earlier this year, the company invested in 350 new high-tech smart refrigerated containers — or “reefers” — to service the Puerto Rico trade route. While the company has long been able to monitor refrigerated containers holding temperature-sensitive goods while on land using machine-to-machine connectivity, it is now able to monitor them when they are out at sea, too. This is down to the company’s deployment of a system called VesselConnect from IoT specialist Orbcomm, which enables Tote to receive critical data from each container, including its shipping status, temperature and location, through any internet-connected device. If an alert is raised on VesselConnect, indicating that the temperature has dropped in a particular container, for example, an engineer can promptly be sent to check it out. If a container is not performing as it should, shore-based staff will be alerted in advance, allowing them to prepare to make repairs. Employees in logistics company Cainiao’s warehouse in Huiyang, in China’s Guondong province, used to walk an average of 27,924 steps on a 7.5-hour shift and sort 1,500 individual products into deliveries. Today, conditions are very different for those working in the 3,000 sq m facility, one of many operated by the company, which is majority owned by Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba. While they can now sort 3,000 products a day into shipments, they only take an average of 2,563 steps per shift because items are brought to them for packing by an army of more than 100 mobile robots. Slightly larger than domestic robot vacuum cleaners, the robots can travel 1.5m per second and carry up to 600kg at a time. Each machine has sensors to prevent collisions, and when its battery is about to run out, typically after eight hours, the robot automatically finds its way to a socket to recharge itself. Blockchain technology has the potential to transform logistics, says Jody Cleworth, chief executive of Marine Transport International. He has already put that idea to the test. The business, a technology provider to shipping companies, recently completed a pilot programme, called Container Streams, which used blockchain technology to combine data from IoT sensors and shipping systems about suppliers, shippers, ports and customs organisations on a single shared ledger. This detailed the hand-off of goods between different parties to create an audit trail that could be verified by every party involved. The results of the pilot, conducted in partnership with distributed ledger specialist Agility Sciences, were verified by researchers at the University of Copenhagen and at Bloc (Blockchain Lab for Open Collaboration), a Copenhagen-based start-up. Because blockchains are made up of records that are distributed across decentralised networks of computers and cannot be altered, Mr Cleworth suggests they are “highly resilient” to cyber attack. This is bound to play well with shipping companies: June’s NotPetya attack severely disrupted operations at Danish shipping group AP Moller-Maersk, which later revealed the incident may have cost it as much as $300m in lost revenue.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jessica Twentyman","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-01","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/52fbdb80-b999-11e7-9bfb-4a9c83ffa852","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F61f1f054-ba6e-11e7-bff8-f9946607a6ba?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain Man and Woman will have to wait","INTRO":"Companies are not ready for them","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Walmart is using it to track Chinese pork. AP Moller-Maersk is applying it to marine insurance. Banks hope it will simplify cross-border trade finance. BP is experimenting with it to streamline oil and gas trading. As the blockchain expands beyond its original use as a platform for digital currencies such as bitcoin, techno-evangelists are also bigging up its potential to do more than point to the provenance of a pork chop. “Business leaders have another opportunity to rethink how they organise value creation,” Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott wrote in Blockchain Revolution last year. Enthusiasts say the blockchain — a distributed digital ledger — could even bring down traditional management and the organisations that have supported it. Entrepreneur Nick Tomaino, in one recent blog post, forecast “the slow death of the firm”. As the technology cuts transaction costs, he writes, it will erode the rationale of the company, laid out by Ronald Coase in 1937, as a place that can co-ordinate many activities more cheaply than if they were done outside the organisation. Another post, on the Ribbonfarm blog, predicts the replacement of the conformist, corporate drones critiqued by William Whyte in his 1956 book The Organization Man by “Blockchain Man” (or presumably woman), a combination of “lifestyle business owner and free agent”. How will the blockchain achieve this? Information about contracts, past performance and qualifications will be baked into its immutable database. Anyone will be able to find the right contractor instantly. Smart contracts will enshrine terms and conditions, ensuring automatic and accurate payment of royalties to Blockchain Man and Woman. Goodbye headhunters, middle managers and human resources departments; hello a free, frictionless market in workers. Some of this is happening. “There is no firm behind bitcoin,” Mr Tomaino points out, “simply code . . . and incentives”. Inevitably, marketeers, hype merchants and snake-oil salespeople are already baiting their hooks with the latest headline-grabbing technology. Many experiments in decentralisation are raising money through the latest bubbly trend of “initial coin offerings” — digital tokens that can be traded or exchanged for services. I am not going to pretend that I know whether the most grandiose claims for the blockchain’s influence on management are achievable. But those who stake the claims do not really know either. Don Tapscott has long predicted the internet will break down hierarchy, but he concedes that “the architecture of the early 20th-century corporation remains pretty much intact”. There is much to be said for distributing authority. The blockchain is, though, only one tool available. Much progress can be made through simple delegation. In any case, many of the technology’s virtues are shared by boring old databases — and, on closer examination, some of its alleged benefits are handicaps. Garrick Hileman, a research fellow at Cambridge Judge Business School and a thoughtful advocate for distributed ledgers, says “a lot of companies got on the hype cycle, tried proofs of concept and then said, ‘wait a minute: do we really need blockchain [to do this]?’” The old programmer’s mantra “garbage in, garbage out” applies, just as it has done since the first line of code was written. In theory, a blockchain curriculum vitae would stop fraudsters and braggarts exaggerating credentials. In practice, the risk someone could input an error, deliberately or accidentally, will remain — and be harder to reverse if discovered. Even if I did perform woefully at school, would I want my poor grades to haunt my career? Blockchain technology would give me ownership of my record and the power to reveal only parts of it. I could stifle my contribution to the collapse of Enron, while showcasing my role in Google’s success. But that sounds no better, and significantly more cumbersome, than editing my LinkedIn page. In addition, not everything we do at work can be easily or objectively assessed. I am a fan of 360-degree feedback, but it is an arduous way to appraise staff. Getting enough people to verify my performance on all but the most basic projects in a way that would prove useful for all future employers, and unimpeachable enough to be etched permanently into the blockchain, looks an insuperably complex task, for man or machine. Legal and confidentiality issues are the two biggest obstacles to adoption of distributed ledger technology, says a survey by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. In time, innovation and regulation may help break them down. But there are good reasons why Organization Man, and the organisation itself, will continue to survive behind the third obstacle the survey identified: “Reluctance to change established business processes.” andrew.hill@ft.com Twitter: @andrewtghill To receive alerts when Andrew’s articles are published, go to his page here and click “add to myFT”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Andrew Hill","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-10-30","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/3b31cc52-942e-399f-b75e-668c6e4d13e7","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F01%2F11180042%2FJTEBM0.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Why blockchain is a belief system","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In an interview with Fox Business on Tuesday, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon back-pedaled on his September claim that bitcoin is a fraud “worse than tulip bulbs”. He said “he regretted” making the remarks because they dismissed the technology in broad terms, adding “the blockchain is real. You can have crypto yen and dollars and stuff like that.” It’s not clear how much of the U-turn was prompted by the highly personalised hate campaign run against him on social media by crypto promoters. What is worth noting is Dimon’s especially apologetic stance towards “blockchain”, the technology that underpins cryptocurrency and which financial institutions are heavily investing in in a bid to revolutionise settlements. According to Bloomberg, Dimon “believes in blockchain” — a turn of phrase that speaks volumes about the state of the technology being advocated. As argued here, however, “blockchain” as a phrase is entirely meaningless. For the most part it is just a bundle of pre-existing technologies brought together in a cryptocurrency context to solve a problem most of the regulated financial system does not have: a lack of trusted intermediaries. Aside from solving that very specific issue — and doing so extremely expensively — blockchain achieves little beyond the novelty of broadcasting transactions publicly and pseudonymously in a way that achieves ledger immutability. To all other extents and purposes, blockchain in its original bundle is not cheaper to run, not more efficient to operate and certainly not faster than the conventional settlement system. Proof of this comes in bitcoin’s own payment dysfunctionality. Moreover, since banks don’t actually want or need immutable ledgers or trustless systems, that leaves only one aspect of the technology with any potential use: its resilience and security features against hacking. Ironically, this feature (by way of the proof of work function which achieves it) is often the first thing dropped by those adapting the tech for official business due to its expense. Hence when it comes to official blockchain projects, it’s all about the subjective selection of some parts of the cryptocurrency technology bundle (the bits that suit the banking industry) and the rejection of others (the bits they don’t think they need). What blockchain is thus lies entirely in the eye of the developer. And since every developer sees something different, no-one can ever be on the same page when talking about it. Perhaps this is why “belief” is such a vital component in the investment narrative. Belief in blockchain, all things considered, really is as vague a construct as belief in fairies and other mythical creatures. The flood of new, derivative terms populating the field demonstrates the vagueness of “the blockchain” as a concept. From distributed ledger technology and permissioned ledger technology to the shared database, each represents a unique interpretation of the initial blockchain construct and is highly removed from the other. Which gets us to the key point. The presentation of blockchain as a technological fait accompli, especially with regards to its potential issuance of official crypto yens, roubles or dollars, is arguably most disingenuous of all. In a world where nobody can agree on what a blockchain-enabled crypto yen actually constitutes, it becomes an entirely meaningless assertion.

The WhatsApp rival, which says it expects to surpass 200m global users this year, wants to raise money to help create a platform using blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies, that would allow users to make payments through its app, according to plans seen by the Financial Times. The project, dubbed the Telegram Open Network and first reported by TechCrunch, would be the first western messaging service to follow in the wake of China’s wildly successful WeChat Pay, which integrates payment into the texting app. Unlike WeChat Pay, Telegram’s project will not be hosted on centralised servers, or linked to a government-controlled currency such as the renminbi. Several well-known companies, including many with no obvious link to the sector, have expressed interest in raising money through an ICO after skyrocketing interest in cryptocurrencies and the huge price jump in bitcoin trading. Shares in ailing photography company Kodak more than doubled on Tuesday after it said it would create a blockchain ledger to safeguard photographers’ image rights. Telegram’s ICO would potentially outstrip the current record, set last year at $257m by blockchain ledger FileCoin. An ICO allows companies to raise funds by issuing digital tokens, normally in exchange for other cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin or ether. Telegram chief executive Pavel Durov, who did not respond to requests for comment, has a longstanding interest in the topic — as well as 2,000 bitcoins he bought five years ago for $750 each, that are now worth $28m. Mr Durov, 33, left Russia in 2014 over what he said was pressure from the Kremlin to censor and control VK, the Facebook clone he founded which is still Russia’s most popular social network. He recently relocated to Dubai after years moving Telegram’s team around the world. Recommended Telegram is popular among both libertarian types in the blockchain community and people who use its encryption to avoid scrutiny. The ICO proposal is the first time Telegram has expressed interest in raising any funding from external sources. Mr Durov has previously said he funded the app at a loss from the money he raised from selling his shares in VK, which is now owned by Alisher Usmanov, an early Facebook investor. Telegram’s proposal says it will hold a presale of its cryptocurrency tokens, known as Grams, in early 2018 on a sliding scale starting at $0.10. The app is also considering selling the tokens in bulk to institutional investors in exchange for conventional currency. The app plans to spend $400m, or 80 per cent of the funds raised, on maintaining Telegram’s projected spending levels on user growth over the next three years.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Max Seddon","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-10","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f3830680-031f-3c3b-b482-0736863bc08e","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F07%2F17102930%2Ftezos-fundraiser_2048x1152.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Trouble in ICO paradise","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Back in July, we highlighted a little blockchain startup called Tezos, which had raised $230m worth of cryptocurrency in an initial coin offering. If you recall, it had big ideas about persuading “a small nation-state” to accept their Tezos token as its official state currency. Now a dispute has reportedly bubbled up between Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, the startup’s founders, and Johann Gevers, the president of the Swiss foundation set up to take the project forward. Here’s Reuters: Under Swiss law, the foundation is supposed to be independent. It holds all of the funds raised, which have mushroomed to more than $400 million in value because the contributions were made in two cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and ether – that have appreciated sharply. But the Breitmans, who still control the Tezos source code through a Delaware company, are seeking to oust the head of the foundation. It’s worth reading that piece in its entirety — as well as the WSJ’s report — but in the meantime we’ll point you towards one anecdote that highlights the regulatory arbitrage everyone knows is going on, even if they hide behind disclaimers to pretend that ICOs are not in fact securities. Tezos told its investors that their investments were actually a “non-refundable donation”, rather than, y’know, an investment that might be governed by and subject to the various rules and laws associated with investments. The terms and conditions consistently and painstakingly refer to “contributions”, but apparently the message didn’t reach its main venture capital backer, Tim Draper: Draper told Reuters that cryptocurrencies are commodities like pork bellies, and characterized acquiring Tezzies as a purchase rather than a donation.

Demands for at least $25m are likely to increase because technological changes in virtual currencies are making it easier for criminals to move sums anonymously, says MWR InfoSecurity. MWR, which tests cyber defences for banks and governments, has made the risks known to several large City institutions in a report that focuses on the effects of the growing interest in trading cryptocurrencies. The surge in demand is slowly building the depth and liquidity of the market, with prices rising for bitcoin and Ripple and Ethereum, its emerging competitors, the company argues. The growing liquidity makes it easier for buyers and sellers of assets to conduct transactions without dramatically moving the asset’s price, and rising prices enable larger sums to change hands more easily. In recent months bitcoin prices have soared to record levels, above $6,000, although the total market value of cryptocurrencies is just $171bn, according to Coinmarketcap.com. “A single transaction that consumes much of the liquidity of a market is very likely to be noticed, whilst a proportionally smaller transaction on a larger marketplace will generate less attention. As such, increasing liquidity of cryptocurrencies will mean criminals can extract greater values,” the report said. In recent years, some cyber criminals have demanded ransoms for ending their attacks on corporate websites and operations. Many ask for payment in cryptocurrencies, ownership of which is stored anonymously using blockchain ledger technology. A poll in July for Citrix, the US software company, found that UK companies had been stockpiling bitcoins in case of attack. They were prepared to pay on average £136,000 to regain access to critical data and intellectual property, a rise of 361 per cent year-on-year, Citrix found. Collecting real-world cash that could be spent anonymously presented problems for criminals until the summer, the report added, in part because the blockchain, the infrastructure underpinning bitcoin, sometimes took minutes or hours to finalise payments. Until then, ransomware demands were limited to about $40,000, the report argued. But in late July bitcoin split into two currencies, and transaction payment times have been speeded up. The two versions account for about $104bn of the total market. Earlier this year the US justice department shut down AlphaBay, the largest criminal marketplace on the internet. The agency said it used cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, Monero and Ethereum to hide the locations of its underlying servers and the identities of its administrators, moderators and users. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan and Larry Fink of BlackRock, two of the most powerful men on Wall Street, have predicted governments will eventually crush virtual currencies because their main value lies in being a tool for criminals.

Combining shared databases and cryptography, blockchain technology allows multiple parties to have simultaneous access to a constantly updated digital ledger that cannot be altered. The technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, was initially treated with scepticism by banks. However, this has changed dramatically. Blockchain is the hottest buzzword in the sector, even if the recent flurry of cryptocurrency fundraisings via \"initial coin offerings\" is attracting intense regulatory scrutiny. Blockchain firms raised more than $240m of venture capital money in the first six months of 2017, much of it from banks, including $107m raised by R3, the New York firm owned by 40 of the world\u0027s biggest lenders. That follows an almost doubling of venture capital investment in blockchain firms last year to $367m, according to KPMG\u0027s Pulse of Fintech Q2 report. Many of the new ventures by banks involve them setting up a consortium of like-minded companies or carrying out a \"proof of concept\" to test the potential of the new technology. In almost all cases there is little to show in terms of commercial significance. So which the areas of banking stand a serious chance of being transformed by blockchain? The Financial Times has spoken to almost a dozen bankers, consultants and analysts to come up with five areas of the industry most likely to see an effect. It is not the sexiest area of banking, but the tangled web that records loans and securities costs investment banks billions of dollars to run. Accenture has estimated that the biggest investment banks could save $10bn by using blockchain technology to improve the efficiency of clearing and settlement. Richard Lumb, head of financial services at the consultancy, says: \"The first place we will see it have an impact is clearing houses, such as Deutsche Börse, the Australian Stock Exchange and Depository Trust \u0026 Clearing Corporation [DTCC].\" He adds: \"Today it is managed through a myriad of messages and manual reconciliation. There is a big opportunity for blockchain to seriously restructure that industry.\" One of the best-known examples of this restructuring is the Australian Securities Exchange , which aims to shift much of its post-trade clearing and settlement on to a blockchain system. The project is being implemented by Digital Asset Holdings , the company led by Blythe Masters , the former senior executive with JPMorgan Chase. In the US, DTCC is working with IBM, R3 and Axoni to shift post-trade clearing of single-name credit default swaps on to a blockchain system by the end of next year. If this goes well, the plan is to do the same with other derivatives processed by the giant US clearing house. There are many different projects but Stuart Graham, chief executive of financial analysis company Autonomous Research, believes the industry will coalesce around one solution. \"Over the next couple of years, as the winning tool becomes clear you will see the whole industry line up behind up it,\" he says. “It is in none of their interests to keep all the bureaucracy and inefficiencies of the current back-office set-up.” Central banks across the world are exploring the potential for shifting parts of their payments systems on to blockchain technology or even using it to launch digital currencies. This is partly a response to the challenge that standalone cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin could pose to their control of monetary policy. It also underlines how central bankers are waking up to the potential benefits of the technology for the payments system. \"Everyone is looking at it, experimenting and waiting to see who moves first,\" says Simon Whitehouse at Accenture. \"There is a great complexity involved to put in a new payments infrastructure with enough players to make it worthwhile.\" Commercial banks, meanwhile, are growing tired of waiting for central bankers to take the lead and are pressing on with their own projects. Switzerland\u0027s UBS has come up with the \"utility settlement coin \", which aims to create a digital currency for use in financial markets by issuing tokens convertible into cash on deposit at central banks. \"We accept that it will be quite a few years before central banks could be in the position of issuing their own digital currencies, so therefore we would look for them to be issued via an alternative means and yet be able to still retain settlement finality because they are assets backed by funds at a central bank,\" says Lee Braine in the chief technology office of Barclays\u0027 investment bank, which is working with UBS on the project. In the field of cross-border payments there is an increasingly bitter tussle under way. On one side is Swift, the bank-owned messaging system used to send trillions of dollars worth of payments, and on the other a growing number of firms aiming to use blockchain technology to cut costs and time, led by Ripple in San Francisco. Swift is experimenting with blockchain technology but its rivalry with Ripple remains intense. Ripple has arranged a conference in Toronto for October 16-18, with former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke as its keynote speaker, that clashes with Swift\u0027s Sibos event at the same time and in the same city; it is a clear case of an upstart parking its tanks on the incumbent\u0027s lawn. Trade finance is still mostly based on paper, such as bills of lading or letters of credit, being sent by fax or post around the world, and seems to many bankers to be crying out for modernisation. Many believe that blockchain is the obvious solution especially as numerous parties need access to the same information. \"It is literally Dickensian, because it is so paper-based,\" says Mr Whitehouse at Accenture. \"This is a very important element of the supply chain and blockchain can offer a vast amount of elements in this area. For instance, if you are shipping goods from China, as many as 50 people need to access the data.\" Charley Cooper, managing director of R3, says: \"Trade finance is an obvious area for blockchain technology. It is so old it\u0027s done with fax machines and you need a physical stamp on a piece of paper.\" Banks will be unable to achieve blockchain benefits, however, if they act alone, experts say. \"It could take you a day to ship oil from Singapore to Malaysia and a week to deal with a the paperwork,\" says Vivek Ramachandran, head of innovation for commercial banking at HSBC, the world\u0027s largest trade finance provider. \"Digitising trade finance is quite a pointless exercise — you need to digitise trade.\" He says: \"You have to include not only the shipping companies, the agents and the freight providers, but also the ports, the customs and the insurers,\" says Mr Ramachandran. \"The moment you need a physical stamp on a document, it can\u0027t be digital. This has to be ecosystem driven.\" There are several start-ups working to digitise the bill of lading process, such as Wave of Israel, EssDocs of Malta and Bolero of the UK. Mr Ramachandran predicts that it will take five years to digitise entire trade ecosystems, such as sugar or energy, but blockchain technology has the potential to be “genuinely game changing\". Verification of customers and counterparties is a vital for banking. Without it, lenders would quickly lose their roles as trusted guardians of people\u0027s money. Regulators hold banks responsible for checking that customers are not criminals or illicit actors, and fine them if they get it wrong. Banks have been trying for years to set up a shared digital utility to record customers\u0027 identities and keep them updated. They have failed to find the right formula, undone by conflicting demands and the problem of deciding liability. Some believe that blockchain could offer a solution because of its cryptographic protection and its ability to share a constantly updated record with many parties. \"We think identity could be big,\" says Mr Whitehouse at Accenture, which recently worked with the UN and Microsoft on a blockchain identity system for people with no identity papers. \"We can easily see how you could move this to the massive area of ‘know your client’ and anti-money laundering, where the costs are huge for banks and the costs of messing it up are also huge.\" Dozens of start-ups are working on building blockchain systems for customer identification, including Cambridge Blockchain, Tradle, Credits and Blockstack. Identity is also a central part of R3’s efforts to build Corda, its blockchain-based operating system for banks. \"Identity is a core component,\" says Mr Cooper. \"If you haven\u0027t solved identity then the blockchain doesn\u0027t work on any application. Imagine building a ledger and you don\u0027t know who is on the ledger.\" When a US company raises money via a syndicated loan it takes on average 19 days for the transaction to be settled by the banks. When a loan changes hands between banks or a borrower repays a loan early, much of the communication is still done by fax. Emmanuel Aidoo, head of blockchain at Credit Suisse, says: \"This is an area that hasn\u0027t had an awful lot of innovation.\" Credit Suisse is one of 19 financial institutions that have formed a consortium, working with Synaps to start putting syndicated loans on blockchain systems. \"It is the perfect vehicle for managing the lifecycle of loans,\" says Mr Aidoo, adding that the consortium expects to have put one or two loans on its platform within the next year. He says a key challenge is to find a way for separate blockchains to talk to each other so that changes to a loan\u0027s ownership can be quickly reflected across all systems. The new project would involve the different agent banks each providing a \"golden source record\" of the loans they administer which could then be accessed by other lenders. However, like trade finance, he says blockchain technology alone will not solve all the inefficiencies in the syndicated loan market. \"Blockchain is not a silver bullet, it will not fix it itself, it will take business process changes,\" he says.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-10-16","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/dc809b76-b25e-11e7-a398-73d59db9e399","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F118ab176-b269-11e7-aa26-bb002965bce8?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Digital Asset Holdings raises $40m to help fund expansion","INTRO":"Blockchain start-up run by Blythe Masters also has eye on possible acquisitions","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Digital Asset Holdings has become one of the best-funded developers of blockchain software for the financial sector after raising $40m from investors led by the family office of Tony James, president and chief operating officer of private equity group Blackstone. The move provides a much-needed boost for DAH, which was created three years ago and is run by former JPMorgan Chase executive Blythe Masters. It comes just weeks before a key decision by the Australian Securities Exchange on whether to use the start-up’s technology to overhaul its post-trade equities clearing and settlement system. Blockchain is a digital distributed ledger system that uses cryptography to create verifiable and shared histories of transactions. It is the basis of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, but is also being heralded by many people in the financial sector for its potential to enhance a range of operations, from upgrading back-office systems to automatic execution of contracts. The latest round of investment in DAH was led by Jefferson River Capital, a family office named after the river that runs through the Montana ranch of Mr James, one of the most powerful figures in the private equity industry. It takes the total raised by DAH to more than $110m. Ms Masters told the Financial Times the extra cash would be used to fund the expansion of the company by “hiring more people, starting more projects and pushing on with existing projects”. She added: “The other possibility would be to finance acquisitions.” DAH said it had hired Clyde Rodriguez from Two Sigma Investments, the hedge fund, to become its chief information officer and chief technology officer of engineering. Ms Masters said: “As we move from the development phase to the production phase, he brings us valuable experience of delivering enterprise-grade solutions to demanding clients around the world.” “We are anticipating a number of product rollouts over the next year,” added Ms Masters, who is based in New York and oversees 130 staff in six locations, including London, Zurich and Sydney. ASX has said it will announce in December whether it is pressing ahead with its plan to switch its Chess post-trade equities clearing and settlement business on to a blockchain system developed by DAH over the past two years. “It is a big undertaking, and I am pleased with our progress and the potential of distributed ledger technology to deliver real efficiency gains for the market,” said Dominic Stevens, ASX chief executive, at last month’s annual meeting. Recommended ASX was an early investor in DAH, alongside more than a dozen big financial and technology groups, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Santander, BNP Paribas, Accenture, IBM and the Depository Trust \u0026 Clearing Corporation. ASX said it “has an option to participate in the [latest] fundraising” after it announces in December whether it will use DAH’s technology. “In the meantime, it’s pleasing that DAH’s growth plans continue to be strongly supported,” the company added. DAH is also working with DTCC, the main US clearing house, to use its technology for speeding up settlement of repurchase agreements, or “repos”, which are used by financial institutions to raise trillions of dollars in short-term financing. Switzerland’s SIX Securities Services has hired DAH to develop a “proof of concept” for using its technology to improve efficiency in “securities lifecycle processing” in the country’s financial markets.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-10-16","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/8dcd3fa4-adbb-11e7-beba-5521c713abf4","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F2de82380-adbe-11e7-aab9-abaa44b1e130?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain company Ripple says it has $15bn war chest","INTRO":"Group behind XRP cryptocurrency says it has signed up more than 100 customers","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The head of Ripple, one of the biggest blockchain companies, has said its $15bn of cryptocurrency reserves could be used to acquire or partner with rivals, as it seeks to dominate its fast-moving sector within financial technology. Brad Garlinghouse, chief executive of Ripple, said the California-based company had “moved out of the sandbox” after signing up more than 100 customers, many of which were now using its blockchain technology to move large sums of money across borders. Blockchain is an electronic record keeping system that uses cryptography to create verifiable histories of transactions. It is a core component of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ripple’s own XRP. “This is not a science experiment, it is about using real money for real customers,” Mr Garlinghouse told the Financial Times. “There are a lot of blockchain tourists out there who are kicking the tyres, but we are well beyond that.” The company on Tuesday announced several new customers had signed up to start using its technology for cross-border payments, including France’s Crédit Agricole, Brazil’s Bexs Banco and Uruguay’s dLocal. It also said that SEB, the Swedish bank, had used Ripple’s system to transfer $180m between Sweden and the US in recent months to help manage the cash balances of one of the bank’s large corporate customers. Ripple’s cross-border payments system is based on using its XRP cryptocurrency, which customers buy and sell almost instantaneously to move money between countries and currencies over the company’s system. It allows cross-border payments to be completed within 10 to 15 seconds, compared with about three days for interbank transactions using the Swift network. The value of XRP has multiplied by 25 in the past five months amid a wider boom in cryptocurrencies. While the market value of XRP has risen close to $10bn, there is a further $15bn of the cryptocurrency that Ripple holds in reserve. “Ripple owns about $15bn of XRP and we will use that to ensure that we continue to advance,” Mr Garlinghouse said. “One of the biggest challenges for investors and the media with blockchain is to decide what is real and what is hype, as frankly some of this stuff can be done with a simple database,” he said. Leading bankers including Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, have dismissed cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as a “fraud” and while central banks around the world have examined blockchain technology many of them have said it is too immature for them to use. But Mr Garlinghouse said blockchain technology offered numerous advantages over the current system for moving money around the world, which he said was plagued by errors and inefficiencies. “For decades the payments industry has been ruled by an oligopoly of large firms like JPMorgan, Citigroup and Visa, for which it is a massive cash cow,” he added. “But now with the internet, people expect payments to be immediate, smooth, reliable and low-cost.” Mr Garlinghouse said Ripple would save big financial institutions money because it would spare them the need to hold an estimated $5tn of funds in pre-funded “nostro” accounts around the world to handle cross-border payments for themselves and their clients.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-10-10","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/ca0b3892-a201-11e7-9e4f-7f5e6a7c98a2","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F967507d4-8da6-11e7-9580-c651950d3672?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Japan’s big banks plan digital currency launch","INTRO":"J Coin designed to wean Japanese off heavy dependency on cash","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Japanese banks plan to introduce a digital currency ready for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics as they respond to the threat from China’s Alibaba, which recently launched its mobile-phone payments service in the country. A consortium of banks, led by Mizuho Financial Group and Japan Post Bank, has won support from the country’s central bank and financial regulator to launch the J Coin, an electronic currency to pay for goods and transfer money using smartphones. The J Coin would be convertible into yen on a one-to-one basis, operating via a smartphone app and using QR codes to be scanned in stores. In return for providing the service for free, the banks would benefit by collecting more data on consumer spending patterns. “I think this electronic money is quite ahead of [credit and debit] cards, because when you use the cards the shops pay a certain fee,” Yasuhiro Sato, president and chief executive officer of Mizuho Financial Group, told the Financial Times. Meanwhile, MUFG has been developing a blockchain-based alternative called the MUFG coin. However, there have been recent discussions between the top banks about the possibility of MUFG joining the J Coin initiative. “We are aware of the issue or concept [of J Coin], however, we would like to refrain from answering,” said MUFG when asked about the talks. “We want MUFG coin’s results and know-how to be used across Japan, including by other banks, but have not decided on what concrete measures to take.” Several big Japanese banks have been lobbying their government and regulators about the danger of Alibaba’s Alipay service being launched recently in several cities including Tokyo, which they argue will allow data on Japanese consumers to be sent to China, according to a presentation seen by the FT. Their plan is to showcase Japan’s fintech capability at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, when hundreds of thousands of tourists are expected to visit Japan. Mr Sato added that it would work best if all banks worked together on the project. “We shouldn’t grab the idea for ourselves, we should have open innovation,” he said. Recommended The J Coin is designed to wean the Japanese off their heavy dependency on cash, which accounts for 70 per cent of all transactions by value. That is higher than any developed country, which have on average reduced cash utilisation to only 30 per cent. “We like cash, because Japan is a very safety-conscious country,” said Mr Sato. “But cash is not so productive so we have to change the structure from cash to electronic money.” The banks have privately estimated that the new system could add an extra ¥10bn to Japan’s economy by reducing the costs of handling cash and cutting settlement fees for retailers and consumers. They plan to unveil their J Coin plan in the next few days. Hironori Kamezawa, chief information officer of MUFG, told last week’s FinSum conference in Tokyo that Japanese banks were getting serious about the threat of digital disruption. “We have a strong sense of urgency and a sense of crisis in the banks of the situation facing us,” said Mr Kamezawa, adding that the MUFG coin was being tested by 1,600 of the bank’s senior staff. “I use it myself to settle the bill when I go out for a drinks party.” Alipay app serves Chinese tourists who travel to Japan / From Douglas Feagin, Ant Financial","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold Leo Lewis","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-26","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/2f595696-ecb4-11e7-bd17-521324c81e23","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F90db1c12-ecbc-11e7-b4d1-b2f78612cc4a?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ripple cryptocurrency surges as Japanese groups agree to use it","INTRO":"Market cap of crossborder payments currency reaches $76bn","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ripple has passed Ethereum to become the world’s second most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalisation after the California-based cross-border payments company enjoyed an end-of-year jump in its market price. While the surging price of bitcoin has attracted the most attention this year, smaller rival Ripple’s XRP currency has started to close the gap in recent weeks after signing up several big financial institutions to use its technology. Last week’s announcement that three of Japan’s big credit card companies have signed up to use Ripple’s technology triggered another bounce in the price of XRP, which is up sixfold in the past month and almost 300-fold in a year. Its market capitalisation climbed to $76bn on Friday, above Ethereum’s $73bn market value, but well behind bitcoin’s $246bn overall value, according to coinmarketcap.com. Ripple’s current market value would put it among the world’s 30 biggest banks, ahead of the UK’s Lloyds Banking Group or Japan’s Mizuho Financial Group. Ripple’s cross-border payments system uses blockchain technology — an electronic record-keeping system — to move money almost instantaneously and at low cost between countries and currencies. Blockchain is a core component of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ripple’s own XRP. “Ripple has done a good job of convincing big institutions to use their currency,” said Eddy Travia, chief executive of Coinsilium, which advises and invests in companies that use blockchain. “The worry is that when the price goes up so much it moves the focus from the technology to just the speculation.” Ripple’s technology allows cross-border payments to be completed within 10 to 15 seconds, compared with about three days for interbank transactions using the Swift network, which was created 44 years ago by a consortium of the world’s biggest lenders. The recent rally in the price of XRP started after a group of Japanese and South Korean banks last week announced the launch of a pilot scheme to use Ripple’s technology for sending money between the two countries. Recommended Ripple has much more XRP in reserve than is publicly traded, giving it a war chest worth about $115bn, which it plans to use to encourage banks and other large financial institutions to use its technology. The US company has signed up more than 100 financial institutions to use its blockchain technology to move large sums of money across borders. Ripple offers various types of cross-border payments. One system allows customers to buy and sell XRP to move money almost instantaneously between countries and currencies. Another uses a blockchain ledger to record and co-ordinate transfers between banks’ own accounts. “2017 has been the year of the digital asset, and XRP has clearly outperformed every other digital asset,” Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s chief executive, told the Financial Times. “The reason for that is that the market has realised that XRP is a highly efficient payments mechanism that is solving real world problems for real world customers with real money.” He said that “people are increasingly realising that bitcoin is not going to be a panacea for all these payments problems that people imagined it would solve”. He added: “Payments with XRP settle in a few seconds, but if you buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin it will be cold by the time the payment has been settled.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-12-29","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/3c203978-2c4a-31a4-9c4b-68b3599d67ab","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F09%2F18093904%2FScreen-Shot-2017-09-18-at-9.38.43-AM.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"What is ‘Utility Settlement Coin’ really?","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"While the BIS report on cryptocurrencies released Sunday offered little in the way of new thinking about the topic, it did provide this intriguing chart: Note the prominent positioning of “Utility Settlement Coin” (USC) within the monetary schematic. It’s intriguing because so little is known about the venture publicly and yet there it is, slap bang in the middle of a BIS monetary schematic. Updates about UBS’ Utility Settlement Coin have been percolating through the media since August. The news dimension, however, has mostly centred on the expanding nature of the network rather than details about what the project is really about. New additions have included Barclays, Credit Suisse, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, HSBC, MUFG and State Street, joining the original network of UBS, BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Icap and Santander. In terms of what’s actually being worked upon, all we know is what was already released in the initial press release in August 2016. USC is an asset-backed digital cash instrument implemented on distributed ledger technology for use within global institutional financial markets. USC is a series of cash assets, with a version for each of the major currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, CHF, etc.) and USC is convertible at parity with a bank deposit in the corresponding currency. USC is fully backed by cash assets held at a central bank. Spending a USC will be spending its paired real-world currency. Again, the BIS note offers little new insight. As it is a private venture, there is no public white paper available for scrutinising. Indeed, USC has been very shy about releasing technical details of any sort. Based solely on the available extracts above, experienced market practitioners we’ve spoken to were curious as to the following: We’ve done some digging on their behalf. According to informed sources, it’s wrong to conflate USC with the wider series of hyped-up blockchain ventures coming to market. USC isn’t really a blockchain project as much as a market infrastructure project — even if it leans on blockchain jargon for the purpose of gaining popular momentum. The architects of USC appreciate blockchain alone is not a solution for what ails market settlement today. What they believe is needed is a profound rethink of how the settlement lifecycle operates. Blockchain helps only inasmuch as it provides an excuse to confidently redistribute settlements between private entities again. Is this new? Not really. Financial market settlement was already highly distributed before everyone freaked out about its capacity to settle properly around 2008. The move towards centralised systems in the years to come came both as a result of regulatory pressure to reduce risk but also as a result of organic market preference. This is what was required for trust to be regained in an uncertain post-financial crisis environment. The problem was… both organic centralising practices and regulatory-imposed ones upped the cost of balance-sheet. Today, the scale of liquid collateral needed to back trading with is almost cost prohibitive (according to the banks). To bring down costs central banks would have to transform even greater volumes of illiquid assets into cash reserves, importing even more risk onto the public sector balance sheet as a result. Hence the appeal of blockchain. On paper, the technology promises to un-encumber cash collateral by creating a much more reliable form of distributed settlement, requiring a fraction of the collateral needed to operate a comparable centralised system. Yet for any of this to work, central banks and lawmakers would have to buy into the theory that blockchain really is a magical panacea to the settlement and squaring problem. Since finding a private workaround is closely connected to the opportunity costs lumbered upon banks by stricter post-crisis regulation (much of which ironically formalised self-imposed practices anyway), it’s clear conflicts of interest can arise. Banks “claiming” blockchain can magically take care of the risk embedded in distributed systems in a way that both justifies collateral reduction and reinstates trust in distributed systems once again is certainly convenient for them. Whether blockchain does what the banks claim it does, doesn’t necessarily matter. What ultimately matters is that regulators believe it does. Hence most blockchain ventures today equate to nothing more than a lobbying effort by banks to get decentralized settlement approved again, ideally without any of the associated collateral headaches. So how does USC aim to achieve this? Fundamentally, the proposition is based around the idea of reinstating a form of narrow banking that can be trusted by all participants. To achieve this, a third party is charged with issuing pseudo fiat cash reserves backed by real cash reserves at the cbank on a perfect parity basis. And yet, for the liabilities to be fully trusted and maximally adopted by the market, that third party must be both neutral and non-profit. It must also be supervised by a central bank, because how else can you guarantee the 1:1 peg is really being observed? That means the USC venture cannot succeed without cbank cooperation from the outset. What, then, is the point of a cbank cash-reserve doppelgänger that doesn’t expand the monetary supply or velocity? Well, according to sources, the real “utility” in USC would be connected to an off-balance sheet accounting trick. Currently, one of the biggest burdens facing banks is having to handle non-operating cash balances for corporates. Regulations dictate these must be fully funded and unleveraged at all times, equating them to a huge opportunity cost for the banking sector. Most banks as a result would rather not have to deal with them at all since there’s almost nothing in it for them but admin cost. Hence, if it was possible to transfer such deposits to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) whose sole responsibility was managing cash without a profitability objective, return on capital employed among banking institutions could theoretically be improved substantially. Think of it like a bad bank for non-operating idle cash reserves, owned and operated on a non-profit basis. The underlying cash, meanwhile, would still be available for the banking sector to tap as and when needed via a “decentralised” market for pre-existing central bank cash pools. The only difference between this setup and the old non-collateralised overnight funds market (which was more of a liquidity cross-insurance system) is that system-wide liquidity shortfalls could conceivable become easier to detect. Banks would know the wholesale market was running short of liquidity as soon as the number of freely available off-balance sheet USCs began to approach zero. At that point, more liquidity could only be created directly by the central bank. USC vs a Central Bank Digital Currency But if that’s the extent of what USC really does*, one has to wonder why the central bank would be inclined to facilitate the venture at all? For the most part, the exact same result could be achieved by the central bank opening its account to non-banks and corporates directly. Arguably, the only reason for a cbank not doing so is if it understands idle balances, whoever they belong to, are always going to be costly for the system in terms of opportunity costs. What’s more, it understands that if such balances became the responsibility of the central bank exclusively, such costs (including the technological infrastructure management costs which manages the system) would eventually have to be borne by the public sector. Indeed, for a central bank to avoid passing such costs to the public, it would either have to unilaterally redeploy funds into more productive ventures directly (thus reintroducing leverage and risk, as well as Gosbank risk) or charge explicit fees for the use of its cash services tantamount to a negative interest rate. Hence, perhaps, the attraction of cooperating with USC? At least the technological infrastructure costs are covered by the private financial sector, even if the public sector remains on the hook for all the other costs and risks? Either way, it is all a question of cost. Who pays for the burden (a.k.a economic losses) associated with an economy that is currently being forced to carry giant idle reserves in the name of risk reduction? Will it be 1) the public sector, as explained above 2) the banking sector, as is already happening or 3) the users directly, an unpopular move from the perspective of both the public sector and the banking sector? While it’s true USC potentially could reduce costs for the private sector (by freeing it of idle capital burdens), it doesn’t necessarily reduce costs for the system as a whole. Equally, some risk remains. For example, the operating costs of the SPV must still be financed by someone. If, for any reason, blockchain turns out to be less efficient than first thought — not an impossibility — the benefits of managing the system this way might soon fail to offset the infrastructure costs. All that in mind, the neatest solution by far is having banks pass the cost of managing unproductive capital over to the corporates directly. This would not only incentivize corps to stop hoarding cash, it might even decrease liquidity demand more generally. After all, if corporates don’t have giant liquid reserve deposits on hand, they don’t have the right to make unexpected liquidity demands either. On the plus side, they’re finally provided with an incentive to invest more concretely in their own operations or in redistributing profits towards consumption-oriented activities. An all-win situation. * To be fair, USC hopes to address netting risk (especially the shadow leverage extended in this way) by encouraging private systems which currently use netting processes to move into real time settlement or into using USC as the final settlement unit. Given the FX market has over $10tn in notional exposure alone, however, it’s hard to see where the liquidity capable of servicing this scale of real-time settlement would come from or why CLS would want to use USC rather than cbank cash for final settlement if the netting was to continue as standard? The contrary view — at least in the case of the FX market — is that up to 70 per cent of CLS settlement goes through a mechanism called the in/out swap rather than pure netting. This, according to our sources, passes much of the risk right back into the correspondent bank network, doing little to alleviate Herstatt risk. Settling real-time through USC on the other hand would, without any of the usual cost constraints of doing so, because… blockchain.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Izabella Kaminska","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/2b0d8926-96d9-11e7-b83c-9588e51488a0","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F608f1418-988f-11e7-8c5c-c8d8fa6961bb?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"To coin a craze: Silicon Valley’s cryptocurrency boom","INTRO":"Flood of initial coin offerings is aimed at bypassing Google and Amazon, but sceptics fear a bubble","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The ambition that gave birth to the InterPlanetary File System is as immodest as the name. The brainchild of a Silicon Valley start-up called Protocol Labs, IPFS aims to give anyone the chance to buy and sell unused computer storage space. There is even a made-up unit of exchange for this proposed market: a digital currency called Filecoin. Speculators do not seem concerned that this spot market for global computing resources is still only a plan embedded in a piece of open source software. Or that, if it catches on, it will be competing with corporate giants such as Amazon, the leading cloud computing provider. Despite these obvious obstacles, Protocol Labs raised more than $250m in an open online sale of its invented currency that ended last week. So-called initial coin offerings, or ICOs, like this have turned into the year’s most striking financial craze. More than $1.8bn has been raised by software developers from the sale of new currencies with names such as Tezzies, Atoms and Basic Attention Tokens. In unofficial online markets where these and other digital tokens are traded, the mania has hit even more bizarre levels. The value of Ripple — at five years, a cryptocurrency veteran — soared this year on a wider boom that was led by bitcoin. Ripple’s notional value, including coins held by the company for later sale, jumped from $500m at the start of the year to more than $35bn, before falling back to $19bn. The boom in cryptocurrency prices has been fed by uncontrolled speculation, leading regulators to act. In recent days, Chinese authorities have banned ICOs and are now reported to be on the brink of shutting down all cryptocurrency exchanges. The Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator, warned anyone thinking of buying coins in an ICO that they should only do so if they are prepared to lose everything. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan, sent bitcoin prices down 10 per cent on Tuesday when he called the currency a “fraud” and threatened to sack anyone at his bank caught trading it. But cryptocurrencies’ promoters argue that beyond the speculative mania, something profound is taking place. It has created a new way for start-ups developing platforms based on blockchain and other technologies to raise money, using online crowdfunding techniques. Networks such as IPFS are based on a vision of decentralised online services where ordinary users interact directly with each other, rather than through internet companies that set themselves up as gatekeepers to the online world. According to the enthusiasts, many of the most popular internet applications could be remade in this way, leaving the control — and the profits — in the hands of the users. “This is much like the internet was early on. It could be bigger than anything we’ve seen,” says Tim Draper, a venture capitalist who was one of Silicon Valley’s first cryptocurrency advocates. For investors like this, the new networks have rekindled the libertarian dream of an internet that operates beyond ossified social institutions. “Society is being transformed by this,” says Mr Draper. “We are going to be a much more affluent and fair world when the dust settles here. ICOs are filling in where governments have failed.” But there is another view that draws on a different aspect of internet investment history. “There’s a tendency to turn the brain off and jump in. It’s like Pets.com [which shut down in 2000],” says Mark Williams, a lecturer in financial risk management at Boston University. The speculation is being fed by a hype that is as insidious as the dotcom craze of the late 1990s, he says: “People are treating it like a lottery ticket.” For the unwary, ICOs represent an even bigger risk, as uncertainty about how they should be regulated means most lack even basic protection of securities laws that governed the dotcom IPOs. As pure digital events, the online fundraisings are also exposed to familiar internet frauds, from phishing scams used to rip off the unwary to the hacking of the underlying software underpinning the new ventures — the fate that befell the first prominent ICO last year, for a company called the DAO. Supporters agree that naked speculation accounts for much of the money that has been pouring into ICOs, as buyers are drawn in by the massive notional profits made by the earliest investors — though how many have been able to cash in at the prices quoted on unofficial online exchanges is an open question. The value of the best-known digital currency, bitcoin, has risen eightfold in the past year. That has led to a hunt for the next untapped markets, lifting the notional value of all cryptocurrencies to more than $130bn. With nothing more needed to launch a coin sale than a “white paper” — the document that coin promoters use to lay out their grand plans — and the promise of some computer code, the steady flow of ICOs in the past year has turned into a flood. The boom, which began in early summer, is already exhibiting many of the characteristics of other speculative crazes. New coins have proliferated: more than 150 token sales have been conducted or announced this year. CoinMarketCap lists prices for about 1,100 coins, with more than 120 ICOs planned before the end of September. Celebrity endorsements have followed. Paris Hilton used Twitter to boost LydianCoin, a currency for a mooted advertising market that its backers hope will raise $100m. Boxer Floyd Mayweather got there before her, using the run-up to his late August bout with Conor McGregor to promote the prediction market Stox.com and content marketplace Hubii Network. Like the dotcom boom, an all-encompassing tech vision has been used to justify valuations that make no sense on any other yardstick. In the case of ICOs, the Big Idea is that the technology on which the cryptocurrencies are based will enable a new generation of online applications and markets that will end up dwarfing today’s internet giants. Like selling spare computer storage, the rules for these networks would be set — and the profits made — by the users, not some huge corporation. Some of these applications will one day be worth “trillions of dollars”, says Olaf Carlson-Wee, whose cryptocurrency hedge fund Polychain Capital is one of the investors leading the charge into ICOs. Given the potential scale of these future markets, he argues, even bets that look like they have a low chance of success make sense. Just as the dotcom craze was stirred up by extravagant hopes for the world wide web, the ICO boom is the product of another supposedly transformative technology: the blockchain. First used as the backbone for processing bitcoin transfers, blockchains are open, distributed ledgers where transactions between any two parties on a network are authenticated and recorded. Underpinning new blockchain-based networks such as IPFS are protocols, or rules, embedded in software that govern how participants interact. At least in theory, many of the interactions that happen online, such as those on social networks, ecommerce sites and search engines, could take place between willing users on decentralised networks. The notional value of all cryptocurrencies; bitcoin alone has risen eightfold in value this year Number of initial coin offerings held or announced already this year, according to CoinMarketCap Fall in the value of bitcoin this week after Jamie Dimon described it in an interview as a ‘fraud’ … “If any of these protocols becomes ubiquitous on the internet, the upside is phenomenal,” says Mr Carlson-Wee. He contrasts it with the opportunity exploited by entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, who created services that ran on top of the platform created by the world wide web. Decentralised social networks or ecommerce would leave ownership in the hands of those who control the underlying protocol, not an application such as Facebook or Amazon. “Users can own their data and own the network,” he adds. Mr Carlson-Wee’s enthusiasm is a sign of the coin mania that has been sweeping Silicon Valley, drawing in the familiar mix of ideologues, entrepreneurs and opportunists. Though only 27, he has raised $250m from four of the best-known venture capitalists, including Sequoia Capital. What supporters see as a profound financial innovation, however, others warn can be an easy route to creating funny money. When buyers have been so willing to purchase currencies issued on nothing more than the promise of a future market, it’s not surprising that so many are trying to mint new ones. “There is this hype that blockchains can change the world,” says Mr Williams. “It’s like the hype of the dotcom bubble, when you had to put a ‘dotcom’ on the end of everything.” Sceptics argue that creating a separate currency for each application is unnecessary and that any digital currency, including bitcoin, could be used. Forcing people to buy app-specific tokens traps them with a holding that has a high chance of ending up worthless. Proponents of the coin boom say this misses the point. If a market succeeds, then its currency will be more in demand. Since their supplies are capped from the outset, anyone holding a currency would benefit from its increasing value. This chance to profit from the growth of a network also provides a built-in incentive, making people who own tokens more likely to make use of the new networks. It would be like a social network where early adopters make much of the profit if the business takes off, says one venture capital investor, who refuses to speak publicly for fear of being seen to add to the hype. “I’m getting Facebook bucks that grow with the network,” the person says. Selling coins has another advantage that the ICOs are less keen to highlight: it exploits a regulatory loophole. By selling a currency rather than shares they stay outside the scope of securities regulation, removing any constraints on how they market their offerings. This is one reason given by FunFair, a blockchain casino based in London, for creating its own Fun tokens. In a rare admission of the regulatory attractions of coin sales, it admitted at the end of August that it “could’ve been easier” to let people use cash and then pay them a dividend based on the company’s profits, but added: “Our lawyers rightly warned us not to do this as it would’ve risked us being classed as an unregistered security.” Regulators are working on closing this loophole. The US Securities and Exchange Commission said in July that it had determined that many coins were in fact a type of security, and would look at the underlying nature of each ICO to determine whether they should be regulated as securities. Recommended For their creators, ICOs have another obvious attraction. They have made it possible to raise far larger amounts than start-ups can usually tap, at least as long as enough investors can be persuaded to suspend their disbelief. An early-stage open source company like Protocol Labs, for instance, might normally expect to raise an initial round of $10m from traditional start-up investors. But through the sale of Filecoin, it has already raised more than 25-times that. Based on prices buyers paid in the ICO, extra coins the company has retained for sale are notionally worth more than $350m. The history of tech bubbles suggests that throwing such large amounts of cash at unproven new businesses often ends in tears. Of the Filecoin sale, the largest ICO to date, one investor says: “They got a bit carried away because the demand was there.” The ICO bulls take a different view. The huge amounts flowing into coin start-ups, says Mr Carlson-Wee, are an indication that the old barriers to capital formation have collapsed: with anyone free to invest, the coin start-ups can look forward to unconstrained growth. “I actually take this to be an inflection point,” he says. “The genie is out of the bottle and the pace of innovation has changed permanently.” In one echo of the earlier internet bubble, the ease of launching an initial coin offering has already led to a splurge of “me-too” projects. The idea of creating a decentralised real estate market, for instance, has led to more than 10 rival projects, among them Smartre, REAL, Estate Coin and Recoin. And more than a dozen online betting networks have been proposed or already funded, with names such as BetMaster, FunFair, QuickBetCoin and Wagerr. Much of this reflects an attempt to turn ICOs into a form of “general start-up equity financing”, says Naval Ravikant, head of AngelList, a San Francisco-based network for connecting early-stage investors. The idea would be better if it was restricted to “a small but important category of venture investments — tokens powering distributed protocols with strong community support”, he says. That belief has led to a hunt among investors for the projects with the potential to become the Facebooks, Googles and Amazons of the blockchain world. The best uses in the short term will be ones where interactions can be fully automated, and where a blockchain can capture the totality of a transaction, says Matt Huang of Sequoia Capital. “If you need humans involved, it doesn’t work so well.” Trading storage space might be one such market, he adds. Polychain Capital’s Olaf Carlson-Wee goes further, arguing a new computing infrastructure, based on blockchain-intermediated markets, will be the first big opportunity of the coin boom, and that more complex applications are likely to take longer to develop. “The general idea of a sharing economy for computational resources is a rich vein. It doesn’t have room for human misbehaviour,” says Mr Huang.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Richard Waters","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-13","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f5cf21f6-935a-11e7-a9e6-11d2f0ebb7f0","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fcde3bc82-8f41-11e7-9084-d0c17942ba93?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain could clean up messy shareholder registers","INTRO":"Technology would eliminate middlemen and ownership confusion","DETAILED_CONTENT":"For Patrick Byrne, the iconoclastic chief executive of internet retailer Overstock.com, a financial system reliant on intermediaries coming between buyers and sellers has persisted for far too long. “For 6,000 years we have been using third party institutions because we trust these institutions. But these institutions have ways of getting corrupted over time,” says the libertarian and Wall Street sceptic. Overstock is among the first companies incorporated in Delaware to consider cutting out the middleman in corporate record-keeping. On August 1, the state, where most US businesses are incorporated, enacted legislation that allows companies to use distributed ledgers, also known as blockchain technology, to store their share registers. The current hype around blockchain is largely focused on the prospect of getting rich by speculating on bitcoin and other coin offerings that are based on it. But those who have been sounding the alarm on the financial system’s creaky plumbing should be equally enthusiastic. That is because the current low-tech share bookkeeping system is indirect and esoteric. It often struggles because assigning company shares to their underlying owners is not straightforward, as several recent high profile Delaware lawsuits, including one involving the mutual fund T Rowe Price, have starkly demonstrated. T Rowe had been a critic of the 2014 buyout of technology company Dell. It was aggrieved enough about the deal price that it brought an “appraisal” lawsuit, asking a Delaware judge to award investors a higher “fair value” for their shares. But the law around appraisal is very specific: shareholders who want to pursue the process must both hold their shares through the closing and vote against the transaction. Because of the vagaries of the current share register system T Rowe failed on both counts, through no real fault of its own. When stock trading exploded in the 1970s, moving around paper stock certificates became impractical. Banks and brokerages set up depositories and stocked them with jumbo certificates that represented bulk shares. Today, just one depository remains, DTC, and almost all US stock certificates are issued in the name of DTC’s nominee, Cede \u0026 Co. Shares are fungible across institutions which have customer accounts. But that means that individuals and funds are not quite official share owners. Recommended For technical reasons that arise from the certificate system, T Rowe’s shares inadvertently left Cede’s possession for another nominee when T Rowe exercised its appraisal rights. This disqualified the fund group from seeking appraisal even though it never sold its shares. In another blunder, T Rowe’s instructions to vote against the Dell deal failed to make it through the layers of its custodian bank, the DTC to the firm that executed voting instructions. Another recent Delaware lawsuit over the buyout of Dole Food led to the owners of 49m shares claiming they were owed part of the settlement proceeds even though only 37m shares were outstanding. The discrepancy came because DTC takes three days to settle trades and both buyers and sellers claimed to own the shares. Results in tight shareholder votes have also been questioned for similar reasons, according to a speech by Delaware vice-chancellor Travis Laster advocating for a blockchain system. In a blockchain ledger, the DTC layer is eliminated. Ownership rosters are updated transparently and in real time. Many companies chose to domicile in Delaware because its corporate law is the most advanced of any US state. Its quick acceptance of blockchain signals that it does not want to lose its pre-eminence to other states. What the internet did to traditional publishers, blockchain will do for a hundred activities Overstock, which accepts bitcoin as payment, is a natural candidate for blockchain shares. Its venture capital subsidiary, Medici Ventures, has invested in Symbiont, a company developing the smart contract foundation of the Delaware blockchain. According to Matthew O’Toole, an attorney who studied blockchain for the Delaware State Bar Association, start-ups which are creating share ledgers from scratch have expressed the most interest in blockchain bookkeeping. Existing companies would have to go through a process of unwinding existing stock certificates. “What the internet did to traditional publishers, blockchain will do for a hundred activities,” Mr Byrne predicts. Should companies be slow to adopt this far superior shareholding system, investors, who are bearing the cost of the current inefficiencies, should demand it. sujeet.indap@ft.com","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Sujeet Indap","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-11","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/40ec964a-e429-11e7-8b99-0191e45377ec","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F34ff745a-b01d-11e7-8076-0a4bdda92ca2?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain fervour evokes memories of dotcom bubble","INTRO":"LongFin is latest small-cap to surge in value after flirtation with digital currencies","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When shares in a company led by a self-styled “global techno entrepreneur” and “financial wizard” increase 10-fold on news that it has acquired a digital currency business, the echoes of the dotcom bubble are too loud to ignore. Analysts and investors said the excitement around bitcoin and blockchain technology was now reminiscent of the period almost two decades ago, when adding dotcom to a company name could drive a buying frenzy. The latest example was the surging share price of LongFin, a business specialising in trade finance that went public on Nasdaq last Wednesday. When it announced, just two days later, that it was buying a blockchain-related venture called Ziddu.com, LongFin shares jumped more than 1,000 per cent — in a move that even its own founder called “unwarranted”. Listed at $5 apiece last week, LongFin shares closed above $22 on Friday and then at $72.38 on Monday. That gave LongFin, which reported a net profit of $1.8m for the first six months of this year, a market value of more than $6bn and made founder and chairman Venkat Meenavalli a billionaire on paper. LongFin and Ziddu.com are both controlled by Mr Meenavalli, described in LongFin’s initial public offering document as “a global techno entrepreneur”, “a financial wizard” and “a true believer in disruptive technologies [who] believes that every piece of information is worth millions”. It really feels like 1999 all over again Announcing the related-party deal, LongFin said Ziddu.com uses blockchain to document and offer microloans in Ziddu coins, a digital currency of its own making which is “loosely pegged to ethereum and bitcoin”. Mr Meenavalli attributed the share price gain to its small float: he owned about 55 per cent of LongFin after the IPO and Stampede Capital of India held 38 per cent. “This stock move is unwarranted,” he told the Financial Times, adding that the company did not expect to make revenue from Ziddu.com this year but hoped to next year. Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations, said: “It really feels like 1999 all over again.” “It is fear of missing out. [The move] is absent any fundamental reasons in a company that uses technology that few people understand.” Recommended LongFin’s share price move is not unique. Rich Cigars, a cigar maker that trades on the over the counter market, jumped more than 2,000 per cent on a single day last week after changing its name to Intercontinental Technology and announcing an intention to enter the business of cryptocurrency mining. A tiny biotechnology company called Bioptix enjoyed a similarly parabolic stock market gain after rebranding itself Riot Blockchain this autumn and announcing it would invest in a Canadian digital currency exchange and start mining bitcoin. “The level of speculative mania has reached a point where stock prices have been boosted by companies simply inserting ‘blockchain’ on to the end of their names,” Jordan Rochester, a Nomura analyst, said in a note on Monday. The broadening speculative activity has been driven by an ongoing rise of various cryptocurrencies, led by bitcoin. The price of a bitcoin hit fresh highs above $19,500 on Monday after having started 2017 at just over $1,000. “This is the next phase of cryptocurrency mania,” Mr Underhill said. “Retail investors trying to make a quick buck in penny stocks around the technology.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nicole Bullock Robin Wigglesworth","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-12-19","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/d8160ea6-df5c-11e7-a8a4-0a1e63a52f9c","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F0d856274-e027-11e7-a8a4-0a1e63a52f9c?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Best of FT Money 2017: Bitcoin for investors — what the experts think","INTRO":"This year’s stellar gains mask wild swings along the way","DETAILED_CONTENT":"As the bitcoin price began to nosedive — just a day after the cryptocurrency smashed through a $10,000 milestone — Alfred Churchill was frantic. Despite desperate attempts to withdraw thousands of dollars’ worth of bitcoin from his account with online exchange Coinbase, red error messages were filling his computer screen. The Coinbase website was down and he was losing money, fast. “I was just refreshing my laptop again and again,” the New York-based software sales manager says. “It wasn’t pleasant. It was panic.” With new-found bitcoin enthusiasts such as Mr Churchill latching on to soaring prices in recent weeks, the infrastructure underpinning the young digital currency has begun to creak under the sheer volume and high volatility of trading. Bitcoin’s price of around $17,000 — correct at the time of publication — represents a jump of more than 1,500 per cent since January, making it one of the most hotly discussed investments of the year. Previously inhabiting the geeky fringes of finance, it is now gaining broader acceptance as Wall Street seeks to cash in on the hype. But overall gains mask wild swings along the way. Many of the dealing platforms, Coinbase among them, have suffered outages and sluggish trade execution when investors have attempted to sell in large numbers. Forays into bitcoin by more established institutions have also hit snags: Cboe Global Markets Global Markets, a US derivatives exchange, was forced to halt trading twice on Monday after it launched the first bitcoin futures contracts. For bitcoin proponents convinced of its potential to transform global finance, these are merely the growing pains of a new asset class. Mr Churchill, who estimates that he lost about $2,000 from the Coinbase outages but has made $20,000 trading cryptocurrencies in six months of trading, remains undaunted after his bad experience. Despite having his “fingers burnt”, the 31-year-old plans to invest another $50,000 in future. “I’m living and breathing this,” he says. But critics warn the bitcoin craze has all the signs of a bubble that is getting out of control. “Anyone with even a passing familiarity of the history of financial markets will be happy to tell you how such trends usually end,” says Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at foreign exchange broker Monex Europe. “If you see a hockey stick chart on a security price, you’re either looking at the birth of a new paradigm [such as] Apple, or a speculative bubble that will one day go the way of the tulip,” in a reference to the 17th century Dutch financial bubble in tulip bulbs, which ended in the market’s collapse. A crash could not only harm “get rich quick” punters, but also send ripples through the wider financial sector. Tales abound of people using credit cards, mortgages and loans to buy crypto products. What would happen to them and their lenders if the price went to zero? FT Money looks at the risks and opportunities for those considering an investment in the cryptocurrency of the moment.   Born in 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis, bitcoin’s roots lie in a libertarian quest for a means of exchange that is unshackled from the central banking system. In its early phase, it gained adherents among computer experts, political activists and other groups who had lost faith in established institutions. This unease with the status quo appears to be shared by bitcoin’s more recent fans. A recent survey of 10,000 millennials by cryptocurrency news aggregator CoinSpectator found that 61 per cent had bought bitcoin in the past year, while 65 per cent said they felt it was safer to store their savings in bitcoin than in a bank account. “People think their money is safer with a borderless, decentralised system . . . and are willing to spend their dollars on it,” says Matthew Buck, a computer systems engineer and co-founder of crypto hedge fund Blockchain Capital. Mr Buck spent six months researching bitcoin before first investing a year ago. To date, he has turned £14,000 into £1m. While he took out a small profit six months ago, he has no immediate plans to cash out because he is convinced that one day the virtual currency and the technology behind it will become universally accepted as a way of making real-time payments. “It’s not subject to Fed oversight, government policy, interest rates or quantitative easing,” he says. “Instead, you’re putting your faith in thousands of computers.” Of the 16.7m bitcoins in circulation, more than 35 per cent have been spent or traded in the past year, according to data from Chainalysis, while about a fifth are held by “strategic investors”. Many of the rest have been lost or unused for many years. A lack of liquidity and big price swings may currently set severe constraints on bitcoin’s use as a currency for transactions. Nevertheless, a network of more than 400 unregulated exchanges has sprung up across the globe to cater for crypto capital markets. Speculators share information and tips via online forums, Twitter and YouTube videos. Over the past week, about $80bn worth of bitcoin have been traded across those exchanges, according to data from CoinMarketCap. More conventional institutions are now looking to get some skin in the game. As well as Cboe, rival exchange operator CME Group launches its bitcoin future contract next week. Nasdaq plans to do the same early next year. Investment banks such as JPMorgan Chase are sizing up whether to enable trading of those futures, while Goldman Sachs said it is exploring a similar market-making role in response to client demand. Spreadbetting platforms have also rushed to offer ways for punters to both buy and sell the market using so-called “contracts-for-difference”. CFDs track the price of an underlying asset and allow investors to leverage their bets, magnifying gains or losses. Some platforms currently allow customers to borrow as much as 20 times the amount they have on deposit when trading bitcoin in this way, though others have recently curbed the levels of leverage they allow to protect investors from its gyrating price. Meanwhile, the number of hedge funds investing in cryptocurrencies has tripled from 55 at the end of August to 170 today, according to research firm Autonomous NEXT. The growth of institutional interest has lent legitimacy to the currency. But investment experts warn there are still numerous risks involved with an asset of this kind. John McAfee, the cyber security expert, has predicted the price of bitcoin will reach $1m by the end of 2020. At the opposite end of the spectrum, other experts say it will plunge to zero. Somewhere between those extremes, many people anticipate some form of price correction. “Anything that goes up 900 per cent without the fundamentals [supporting it] is bound to reverse back to the mean at some point,” says Andreas Antonopoulos, author of Mastering Bitcoin and The Internet of Money. Gauging bitcoin’s true value, however, is hampered by a lack of data. “You have to take a long-term view . . . If you keep watching the ticker, you can end up trying to trade based on timing and emotions,” says Mr Antonopoulos, who is also an independent member of the oversight committee for the CME’s bitcoin reference rate. “People who try to do that do not generally make money.” Sara Feenan, business development manager at blockchain technology company Clearmatics, says a sudden knock in prices could come from a “risk of confidence loss”, such as the hack of a big exchange or large trades by so-called bitcoin whales. Institutional investors tend to be more opportunistic than the crypto evangelists, she say. “[Institutions] may take the money out for short-term gains. Large trades could swing the market.” Still, few market watchers see imminent signs of a turn in the tide. “The fear of short sellers attacking the bitcoin didn’t arise [when Cboe launched its futures], indicating that the cryptocurrency isn’t seen yet as the big short,” Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at broker FXTM, said in an analyst note. Another risk — that hackers might target the digital vaults in which bitcoin investors store their cryptocurrency — is not entirely fanciful. MtGox, once the world’s most popular venue for trading and storing bitcoin, lost 850,000 coins (then worth about $500m) before falling into bankruptcy in 2014. “There is no protection for investors against scams, fraud and hacks,” says Lilian Chovin, investment strategist at private bank Coutts, which has no current plans to introduce bitcoin to its investment strategy. “It’s very much a frontier environment and this adds a high level of systemic risk on top of the usual risks associated with investing in highly speculative assets.” The ability to invest safely and take at least some measures to guard against hacking is in itself a “barrier to entry” to the market, says Blockchain Capital’s Mr Buck. “You’ve got to be savvy with the processes. There’s a technical aspect to it.” The anonymity afforded to bitcoin users means it has long been linked to criminal activities, such as drug dealing and money laundering. National watchdogs are determining how best to give greater protection to investors, but bitcoin’s borderless nature could complicate their efforts. There are already divergences in approach. China has struggled to ban crypto exchanges, while Japan has regulated bitcoin as a means of payment. The US Securities and Exchange Commission this week warned of the risks of trading cryptocurrencies, but stopped short of taking any action. “The technology on which cryptocurrencies and [initial coin offerings] are based may prove to be disruptive, transformative and efficiency enhancing,” Jay Clayton, the SEC’s chairman said. “I encourage Main Street investors to be open to these opportunities, but to ask good questions, demand clear answers and apply good common sense when doing so.” Cedric Jeanson, chief executive of crypto hedge fund BitSpread and a former banker at Nomura, sees regulation as key in paving the way for bitcoin to be used more widely, for example in e-commerce. “A lot of value can be added by regulating the entry point to the technology — the exchanges,” he says. Think of it [bitcoin] as cayenne pepper in your soup. A pinch can go a long way but if you dump a teaspoon in you’ll ruin it Others warn that regulation could take the shine off bitcoin’s future. “Once you start hammering not just the bitcoin exchanges with anti-money laundering, ‘know your customer’ and all the other regulation, but also every investor and user, the appeal of cryptos as an off-grid currency is destroyed,” Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, said in a note. “In this sense, mainstreaming bitcoin makes it less valuable, not more.” To survive in the long run, bitcoin will have to fend off the challenge from other, potentially more efficient, cryptocurrencies. Competing “alt-coins” such as ethereum, ripple, litecoin and dash have also seen their value rise dramatically this year. Meanwhile, countries such as India, Russia and China are flirting with the idea of introducing their own cryptocurrencies. While bitcoin enjoys a first-mover advantage, there is a limit to number of transactions the bitcoin network can process at one time. This has caused bottlenecks and delays in transactions. If it were to become the cryptocurrency of choice, bitcoin’s workings would need to be improved to allow for higher frequency, smaller payments such as retail transactions. This lack of scalability has already prompted some rebel users to create upgraded versions of the currency, leading to “bitcoin cash”, “bitcoin gold” and “bitcoin diamond” — each of which has its own price. Mr Antonopoulos recommends investing only “to the extent you understand the technology”. But expunging it entirely from your investments is unnecessary, he adds, in spite of its many risks. “It can spice up a portfolio,” he says. “Think of it as cayenne pepper in your soup. A pinch can go a long way but if you dump a teaspoon in you’ll ruin it.” In essence, bitcoin is a string of computer code. A bitcoin is a generated by computers solving, or “mining” a complex mathematical problem that unlocks its security. The puzzle requires extensive computing power and miners compete to be the first one to solve it, earning themselves a reward. Only a finite number of bitcoin — 21m — can be created. Bitcoin is decentralised — meaning it is not guaranteed by a central bank and therefore falls outside the purview of regulators. All of its transactions are recorded and verified in a kind of database called the blockchain. This ledger is immutable, while the identity of those behind the transactions is hidden. Bitcoin can be stored by users and exchanges online, in what is known as a “hot wallet”, or held offline for example on a USB stick. Cold storage, as the latter is known, is less vulnerable to hacking than online wallets. You can buy bitcoin with conventional currencies and later change it back — as you would an asset such as gold — using one of numerous online exchanges or even a number of bitcoin ATMs. Derided by some as a vehicle for speculation, it can nonetheless be used as a currency — albeit a stateless one — to buy things directly. BitPay, one of the largest global bitcoin payment service providers, says that it processes more than $110m in merchant transactions each month. Spreadbetting platforms have also rushed to offer new bitcoin derivatives that allow investors to bet on the price movement of bitcoin without owning the underlying asset, using leverage. Many are also embracing so-called initial coin offerings, as an innovative fundraising mechanism. ICOs involve a start-up issuing digital tokens or “coins” in exchange for software, services or cryptocurrencies. As the trend towards more “sustainable” investing gathers pace, bitcoin stands out for the wrong reasons. According to Digiconomist, the mining of bitcoins has this year consumed 32.7 terawatt hours of energy — more than the electricity consumed annually by 159 individual nations, including Ireland and most of Africa. If bitcoin miners made up a single country, it would rank 62nd in the world by energy consumption. Huge mining farms — warehouses of whirring computing machinery — have been set up in countries such as China and Iceland, havens for low-cost electricity and low-temperature environments that help to cool equipment. Estimates also put bitcoin’s annual carbon footprint at more than 16,000 kilotons of carbon dioxide, as mining in China is mostly powered by coal-fired power plants.

Deutsche Bank chief executive John Cryan has likened some employees to abacuses and warned technology will replace many of them. He has spoken too soon if he expects blockchain to achieve this revolution. Financial groups pouring money into this much-hyped technology will find it is a digital dead end. The aim is to eliminate duplication. At present, each bank, broker or fund manager has their own system to record trades, settle transactions with counterparties, and clear securities. If they shared a database they could save a lot of money. Hence the appeal of the blockchain system which underpins so-called cryptocurrencies. This consists of a distributed list of who owns what. Deals are validated cryptographically and participants who provide computer power are rewarded with cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin The problem comes when applying this process to anything less ephemeral than a token. Six new banks last week unveiled plans to participate in a “utility settlement coin” project to make instant payments to each other. To be useful, securities would also have to be transferred to a blockchain system. That is a lot harder. Believers in a system which is instant, trustless, secure, transparent and widely used, are embracing multiple contradictions. A private blockchain network run by a group of banks is just a database. Good luck persuading others to join and help cover costs. Try a public blockchain instead, and imagine all trades in a stock are instantaneous and transparent. Who wants the whole market to see what they are doing? Then consider what happens when accidents happen. A two-day settlement period gives those derided human abacuses in the back office time to fix mistakes. Equally, exchanges can step in and cancel trades after a “flash crash”. To undo trades in a distributed public ledger requires unanimous agreement from participants. That would be akin to the market-wide reset imagined as solution to Japanese cyber attack in Tom Clancy’s techno-thriller Debt of Honour. These obstacles are why blockchain systems are said to be years away. Executives seem to believe better software is somehow the answer. Bitcoin-obsessed technologists are happy to take their old-world money. That will probably be the only significant transfer of value the blockchain revolution achieves.

AP Moller-Maersk, the Danish conglomerate that includes the world’s largest container shipping business, and the insurers MS Amlin and XL Catlin are among the companies involved in a new blockchain platform that will go live in 2018. The scheme, also backed by the consultants EY, technology group Microsoft and data security provider Guardtime, aims to reduce delays, paperwork and disputes in the $30bn global marine insurance market. It has already undergone a 20-week “proof of concept” exercise this year. Blockchain — the technology behind bitcoin, the virtual currency — is a shared, encrypted database that allows users to securely record details of transactions or contracts in several places at once. The new marine insurance system will be used for contracts relating to a limited number of ships and journeys in 2018, before being rolled out more widely. “There is an enormous amount of trust and respect in the London [insurance] market . . . but the challenge is that it is very admin-based, very paper-based and there has not been a lot of innovation to reduce costs,” said Shaun Crawford, global insurance leader at EY. “Everyone is sending bits of paper around and contracts are often not signed until after the ship has arrived at the final port.” Lars Henneberg, head of risk and insurance at AP Moller-Maersk, said: “Insurance transactions are currently far too tedious and frictional . . . Blockchain technology has the potential to facilitate the desired development that is long overdue.” Mr Crawford said the project would enable Maersk’s own pool of data, on topics from temperatures to ship flag changes, to be seamlessly incorporated into contracts in real time so that “one version of the truth” prevails throughout, while the data itself remains in Maersk’s possession. The companies hope the system will speed up billing and collection of payments, and bring more clarity on claims histories that are used to inform pricing decisions. Ultimately, Mr Crawford said, it may help insurers to reduce their capital requirements under the European Solvency II regulations by enabling them to assess risk more quickly and accurately. If underwriters and others choose to support the scheme, it might cut expense ratios, which measure costs in relation to premiums earned, by up to 70 per cent, he added. Guardtime has also worked with the Estonian government on its digital government initiatives and with the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Darpa, on military blockchain technology. Other insurance groups are also experimenting with the use of blockchain, although so far the industry has been slower to take up the technology than banking, where a large number of pilot projects are under way. A group of Europe’s largest insurers, including Aegon, Zurich, Allianz, Munich Re and Swiss Re, are exploring its use in the reinsurance sector, while the US insurer AIG this year sold what it says is the first blockchain-based multinational insurance policy to UK-based bank Standard Chartered.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Judith Evans","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f66da020-1dec-3716-8053-6851bf59f98f","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F11%2F22153932%2FScreen-Shot-2017-11-22-at-15.38.58.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Taking the block out of blockchain…","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain. It was supposed to change everything. And yet… Two years of dabbling and experimentation and it’s mostly just been changing itself (so as to become even barely usable in capital markets). On that note, some observations from Axel Pierron at Opimas in his latest update on capital market blockchain projects (our emphasis): From distributed to shared ledger To answer the concerns around scalability and information leakage, a number of blockchain technology providers such as Digital Asset Holdings and R3 have implemented a shared ledger model, rather than a distributed ledger. In this infrastructure, market participants’ nodes only keep a record of the transactions to which they are a counterparty, and that they upload from a central ledger that keeps a record of all transactions. With this approach, participants cannot query data for which they are not a stakeholder. This is quite an evolution from the initial blockchain model, as the infrastructure becomes a semi-distributed environment in which a partial ledger co-exists with a central ledger. With this development, the infrastructure is becoming closer to a traditional utility model that holds a golden copy of information. Plus, somewhat ironically, there’s not all that much focus on blocks anymore: In Bitcoin, transactions must be pooled into blocks for economic reasons. The system was used for retail payments, hence the processing cost of validating individual transactions might have surpassed its notional value. Aggregating the transactions into blocks to be validated was a clever method to lower the cost of validation for each individual transaction. However, in the context of capital market operations, aggregating transactions into blocks is less relevant. Hence, most initiatives today have more to do with a chain of transactions than a blockchain. Pierron adds: The adaptation of blockchain technology to the needs and requirements of capital markets has pared down a number of attributes from its original solution. Now, the technology has evolved into a chain without blocks, operating in a permissioned environment without “proof of work” and, while the distributed nature can remain, it can also be implemented in a shared ledger environment with a centralized golden copy of data. Therefore, apart from a small set of initiatives launched by new entrants like Nivaura, the vast majority of initiatives that are being implemented in capital markets bear very little resemblance to the original blockchain. Bloomberg’s Matt Levine, of course, likes to stress that the best thing about blockchain FOMO is how it has encouraged banks and capital market institutions to take a cold hard look at the state of their digital systems. This is no bad thing. If systems end up being updated, better maintained or improved, we should all be happy with results. The question then becomes: will it have been worth it economically? With so much of the “change” being a form of revisionism back to older ways of doing things, or in the best-case scenario, the creation of eat-cake-and-have-it-too centralised/decentralised hybrid solutions, it will be interesting to see to what degree these changes really affect the bottom line from 2018 onwards. To that end, says Pierron, the biggest returns are likely to be observed in industries and sectors that have thus far failed to harmonise or digitise their systems due to ongoing dependency on bilateral communications and relations. Though even here, we’d argue, there may be good reason why such industries have proven tardy in digitising themselves in an overly standardised way. For example, when it comes to commodities or physical supply chains, it’s often not the paper work that’s the problem, but the unpredictability of the real world. Digitisation may help smooth some transaction processes, but by and large the chaos of the real world can’t be avoided. These markets have to routinely deal with missing shipments, weather-related events, corruption-related anomalies and/or basic input mistakes. Whether blockchain — a notoriously rigid system — is flexible able to cope with such unexpected gremlins in the system is the key question at hand. In the crypto world, for example, it’s done very little to eliminate the scourge of hacking or problems emanating form human error and gullibility. Which is why, according to Pierron, “it has become apparent that in capital markets, the further away you are from the original Blockchain DNA, the more likely you are to succeed.” Even in markets where “blockchain” hype may help to implement standardised operating systems, such as FX, it’s worth asking just how disruptive it will be in the long term, especially on the cost savings front. If it’s more update than paradigm shift, the blockchain investor market could be disappointed. To wit, Pierron believes predictions that blockchain will reduce IT and infrastructure spending by up to 30 per cent may be overdone. For the most part, these estimates assume blockchain will see current back-office systems replaced with ledger-based alternatives. Whether this actually reduces costs, however, will depend on the interoperability of the systems at large. It’s worth remembering interoperability has never been a blockchain-exclusive challenge. Getting everyone on the same page as a whole has always been really difficult because competitive entities can’t help but disagree over how things should work or be designed. Note in that regard the recent exit of JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley from the R3 consortium as an example, not to mention the significant legal disputes brewing across the blockchain and ICO space – even among founders. If interoperability can’t be guaranteed, the risk remains market players will still have to reconcile and aggregate information from disparate systems back into their own back office, says Pierron. This would reduce savings significantly. In short, the conclusion seems to be that while blockchain hype has spawned many intriguing projects over the last two years, whether the promise of their claims actually delivers is yet to be determined. As a result, 2018 may prove a pivotal year for all in this space.

Banks hope to do so by using the blockchain technology that underpins bitcoin to cut transaction costs. Cryptocurrency markets themselves remain a Klondike where dreamers mingle with arbitrageurs and crooks. This week, China’s state-controlled National Internet Finance Association followed regulators in the US and Singapore in warning of the perils of initial coin offerings. Watchdogs fear investors may be defrauded via some ICOs, which typically raise funds for new ventures. Hedge funds that invest in a spread of cryptocurrencies and ICOs promise diversification. Research group Autonomous counted 55 such funds at the end of August. While hedge funds at least extract a dependable income from management fees, they, too, would chalk up big losses if the sector collapsed. If you fear cryptocurrencies are a bubble, then a better opportunity may be exploited by the businesses that use computers to generate — or “mine” — crypto coins on a large scale. To do so, the miners buy high performance processors, store them and incessantly execute computer code. Electricity, which is cheap in China, is their main variable cost. In June, RBC estimated electricity costs equated to just 10 per cent of revenues at a bitcoin price of $2,700. Returns should be even better at a recent bitcoin price of $4,700. However, miners also need to cover overheads such as chip purchases and to swap bitcoins for goods or other currencies, sharply cutting margins. They lose if exchange rates drop sharply. If the price of bitcoin rises, the arbitrage becomes more profitable and the demand for processors increases. AMD, a Nasdaq-listed chip company, pointed to miners as a factor in its sales growth when it reported its first operating earnings for some time.

Barclays, Credit Suisse, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, HSBC, MUFG and State Street have teamed up to work on the “utility settlement coin” which was created by Switzerland’s UBS to make financial markets more efficient. The move comes as the project shifts into a new phase of development, in which its members aim to deepen discussions with central banks and to work on tightening up its data privacy and cyber security protections. Hyder Jaffrey, head of strategic investment and fintech innovation at UBS, said: “We have been in discussions with central banks and regulators and we will continue that over the next 12 months with the aim of a limited ‘go live’ at the back end of 2018.” Blockchain technology is a complex set of algorithms that allows so-called cryptocurrencies — including bitcoin — to be traded and verified electronically over a network of computers without a central ledger. Having initially been sceptical about it because of worries over fraud, banks are now exploring how they can exploit the technology to speed up back-office settlement systems and free billions in capital tied up supporting trades on global markets. “The distributed ledger is one of the most innovative technologies out there,” said Lee Braine from the chief technology office of Barclays’ investment bank. “From reducing risk to improving capital efficiency in financial markets we see several benefits of this project.” The utility settlement coin, based on a product developed by Clearmatics Technologies, aims to let financial groups pay each other or to buy securities, such as bonds and equities, without waiting for traditional money transfers to be completed. Instead they would use digital coins that are directly convertible into cash at central banks, cutting the time, cost and capital required in post-trade settlement and clearing. The coins, each convertible into different currencies, would be stored using blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, allowing them to be swapped quickly for the financial securities being traded. Existing members of the project are Deutsche Bank, Banco Santander, BNY Mellon and NEX. Mr Jaffrey said: “This isn’t going to come in with a big bang, it is going to come in with a series of developments over time.” He said that in the first instance, from the end of next year, he expected the utility settlement coin to be used for banks to pay each other in different currencies. For instance, if one bank owed $100m to a rival with a £50m debt in the other direction, the two institutions could transfer the money almost instantly using the new coins. Before the coins could be used for settling securities trades, he said the securities themselves will need to be transferred to blockchain systems, otherwise the benefits of speed and reduced capital requirements will be lost. Peter Randall, founder of the UK-based rival Setl, said there were still questions over whether payments using a quasi-central bank currency would be considered certain and risk-free enough to achieve “settlement finality” — reducing the capital and liquid assets that need to be held against them. But Mr Jaffrey said that “following legal, regulatory and accounting viewpoints, we now feel we have a structure that gives us a basis to move on to phase three with a workable structure” for achieving “settlement finality”. He admitted the utility settlement coin could be rendered obsolete if enough central banks issued their own blockchain-based digital currencies, yet he added that was likely to take “many years”, especially given the “public policy questions” involved.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-08-31","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/91797423-97ec-3dcf-b010-0a962cec2525","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2F29130332%2FDIF0_9HXUAAd_wG.0_2048x1152.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"WhopperCoin","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Big news out of Russia today.

As the industry faces a barrage of criticism over its treatment of clients, with regulators and campaigners accusing fund houses of prioritising profits while ignoring investor needs, the president of RBC Global Asset Management is determined to show a different side. During an hour-long meeting in the company’s London offices on the banks of the Thames, the head of the $323bn asset manager owned by Royal Bank of Canada uses the word “client” or its plural an impressive 73 times. The 47-year-old seems acutely aware of the reputational problem the industry faces, after concerns about bad performance and high fees dented trust. A survey by PwC, the consultancy, in 2014 found that only 12 per cent of consumers polled said they trusted asset managers, compared with 32 per cent who trust retail banks and 76 per cent who trust medical doctors. Mr Williams is reluctant to comment on the practices of the wider industry, which oversees the savings of hundreds of millions of people. But throughout the conversation he talks about the need to deliver “very good value” for clients, how asset managers should develop products that clients need rather than ones that generate the most money for fund houses, and the challenges facing clients in the low interest-rate environment. “If we don’t deliver investment performance to our clients, ultimately, our right to exist as a business disappears,” he adds. Born in the UK, Mr Williams has lived in Canada since he was four. He was named co-chief executive of RBC GAM, which includes Bluebay, the alternative fund manager, and Phillips, Hager \u0026 North, the Canadian retail asset manager, in 2015 and has since become the sole chief executive.

The industry has grown rapidly in the wake of the financial crisis, with PwC predicting assets under management could hit $145tn by 2025. But swift growth has prompted much soul searching. In the boardrooms of investment houses around the world, executives are grappling with difficult questions about the future of their businesses. Many fund chiefs worry whether their companies are big enough to survive in a sector that is increasingly dominated by global houses that oversee hundreds of billions and sometimes trillions of dollars. The rapid rise of passive funds has also sparked questions about the role of active managers. “There are pressures on the asset management industry. Technology is causing pressure on fees. New competitors are causing pressure on fees. I think it gets harder [in the future], particularly for smaller asset managers,” says Mr Williams. Some asset managers, such as Janus and Henderson, and Aberdeen and Standard Life, have responded to the changing business landscape by merging, hoping their increased scale will allow them to compete better. Mr Williams, in contrast, is on the hunt for companies to buy. “We’re opportunistic when it comes to acquisitions,” he says. “We are very interested in continuing to build out our array of capabilities to continue to meet client needs.” He declines to comment on whether RBC GAM is currently in talks to buy a company, but admits there have been many discussions. Its last big acquisition was Bluebay, which it bought in 2010 for £963m. “Through RBC, we have the financial capacity to make very large acquisitions. RBC is Canada’s largest and most profitable firm. Asset management and wealth management are core to RBC’s business. So we have the ability and the financial capacity to look at both large and small, and over the years we have done both,” he says. The asset manager is also looking at how technology is disrupting the industry. Last year, it set up a so-called innovation lab, to investigate topics such as blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin, the cryptocurrency. Mr Williams believes blockchain, which is a giant, online public ledger, has the “potential to radically change the whole concept of asset management”. This includes near-term changes predominantly focused on cutting costs by making the industry more efficient. But the potential longer-term impact of blockchain is the most exciting, he suggests. He thinks blockchain could allow for the “tokenisation”, or slicing up, of assets. This would allow investors easier access to a far greater range of asset classes than just listed equities and bonds. “We’re working on exploring that and trying different things in that market to make sure we’re learning with the market, we are able to bring our clients with us, and we don’t, one day, wind up realising that we are the taxi company that’s just been Uberised, too late to do anything about it,” he says. RBC Global Asset Management Founded 1933 Assets under management Approximately $323bn Employees About 1,400 Headquarters Toronto Ownership Royal Bank of Canada The conversation turns to Europe. Mr Williams is visiting London partially because of his love of sports: he lists mountain biking, road cycling, running and boxing among his favourite activities. The weekend before we met, he took part in a relay marathon in the Channel Islands, completing his 10km leg in less than 40 minutes. In Europe, one of the big topics is whether the UK’s departure from the EU will result in upheaval for the continent’s asset management industry. Many asset managers base their staff in London, while their funds are domiciled in countries such as Luxembourg or Ireland. Brexit has put this model under threat. RBC GAM has already put plans in place to deal with potential problems. It is in the process of increasing the number of staff it has in Luxembourg from eight to 20. Mr Williams says: “We’ve done a lot of work on thinking about various Brexit scenarios and how we might accommodate it. “One of the things that comforts me on Brexit is that RBC has some very substantive operations across Europe, so if we need to shift people as a result of hard Brexit or something like that, we can and we will.

Because we can get stuff with it. Any stuff. That in fact is the beauty of cash or fiat currency. It’s accepted everywhere. And because it is accepted everywhere this means from a user’s perspective if offers maximum optionality. There’s no “your money’s not good here” risk (unless you’re a drug dealer or a money launderer, but that’s a different story). It’s guaranteed that if you have the money your trade will be done. What does the future hold for us if the crypto blockheads get hold of finance? The opposite of multi-purpose multi-functional currency. Limited single-purpose currency. Case in point, the latest absurdist proposal from the blockchain/cryptocurrency space which arrived in the collective FT email inbox on Friday, with accompanying note stating: Please find attached a short information about Dentacoin – a New Digital Coin, designed specifically for the global dental industry. Dentacoin is already used by over 6 000 people globally and is also accepted as means of payment at two dental clinics in Europe. This is truelly [SIC] revolutionary concept, which has great potential to become one of the global currencies. From the game-changing info pack attached: Dentacoin, after its pre-sale of DCN tokens that ended on July 31, 2017, is on its way to improvise the dental industry globally by creating a unique, blockchain based Dentacoin ecosystem. DCN tokens provide token holders a share in Dentacoin Foundation. Dentists can exchange DCN tokens with patients for their reviews, while patients can utilize DCN tokens on various dental services or reserve tokens as an investment tool. In future, the company plans to launch blockchain-based insurance platform and healthcare database. At this point, we feel a bespoke newsflash for the creators of Dentacoin is in order. No, creators of Dentacoin, your token isn’t a truly revolutionary concept with the great potential to become one of the global currencies. It’s at best — and that’s us being generous — a gift voucher. A reward point card. Or a trading stamp. And those have been around in some shape or form for centuries, if not longer. What’s more, even in digital form, these vouchers have never required a blockchain to operate. See our Greenshield stamp post for more background on that. At worst, Dentacoin creators, your token is a security with all the legal risk that comes with it. Ultimately there’s a reason why the world doesn’t universally accept Tesco Club card points or Amazon vouchers as tender (and let’s face it, Tesco Club card points and Amazon vouchers are probably infinitely more useful than dental vouchers). Despite their relative usefulness they’re still a limited option on stuff compared to cash, which (as we’ve noted already) is accepted everywhere without any need for complex exchange across multiple currencies, tokens, coins or coupons. It can also — almost all of the time — be used without fear of sudden fluctuation in value or liquidity risk. It’s just accepted. And that’s what makes it beautiful, useful and dependable. Furthermore, thanks to its universality, it’s the price of stuff in cash which via this process changes to help supply and demand clear effectively. This constitutes an easy-to-understand system wherein all consumers can compare and contrast the value of almost anything in constant terms, empowering their purchasing decisions accordingly. In blockchain single-purpose currency land, however, it won’t just be the price of goods consumers will have to constantly monitor to understand value, it will also have to be the multitudes of coupons trading vis-a-vis to each other. All this across a multitude of fragmented marketplaces, many of which won’t even have the liquidity to hand when needed. Which begs the question, why would anyone with any intelligence want to add complexity of this scale to a tried and tested system which works so perfectly and intuitively already? Does it really make anything more efficient? No. Does it increase the amount of intermediaries across the board? Yes. Perhaps that’s the point?

Tuesday’s salvo, from the Securities and Exchange Commission, follows a surge in sales of digital tokens that has turned a backwater favoured by techno libertarians into one of the year’s most prominent speculative booms. Backers claim many of the tokens act like virtual currencies, giving the holders the right to buy services in some future digital market. However, rapid price rises of digital tokens issued in the past year has brought a surge of speculative interest. The SEC warned that ICO promoters had skirted securities laws by issuing digital tokens on behalf of “virtual” companies, rather than selling traditional securities. Transfers of tokens are recorded in distributed ledgers called blockchains, and buyers pay for the instruments with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether. This ruling will likely have a chilling effect on future ICOs While arrangements like these turn ICOs into completely virtual exercises, the SEC said it would look at the underlying nature of the transactions. That could force issuers to register their tokens with the SEC, while also drawing exchanges that trade them into the agency’s remit. Prices of existing digital assets quoted by online marketplaces where they are traded immediately fell by 10-20 per cent on the news. “This ruling will likely have a chilling effect on future ICOs,” said Emin Gün Sirer, an expert in cryptocurrencies and adviser to Tezos, a virtual organisation whose own ICO raised $230m earlier this month. However, he and others involved in the field said that the SEC appeared only to be attacking tokens that were designed to get around securities laws, and predicted that this would not affect those that act purely as currencies for their own markets.  Tim Draper, a venture capitalist who has been one of Silicon Valley’s biggest backers of bitcoin and the new wave of ICOs, said most digital tokens were commodities rather than securities, putting them outside the SEC’s reach. He also warned that trying to regulate the new market in digital tokens before it is established would risk killing it or driving it offshore. “Society is being transformed by this — we’re going to have a more affluent and fairer world when the dust settles here,” he said. The SEC’s warning followed an investigation into the DAO, a virtual company that raised $170m last year in one of the first big token sales, only to see $50m siphoned off after hackers took advantage of a loophole in the system.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Richard Waters","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-07-26","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/34d2acd8-ac9c-3b5c-8abb-37e3c0b76fd8","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F07%2F25155844%2FScreen-Shot-2017-07-25-at-15.58.19.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"In ICO utopia, there is no division of labour","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and the judgment with which it is anywhere directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour… So wrote Adam Smith in 1776, before concluding that the nature and causes of the wealth of nations do not include cryptocurrencies. Bear this in mind when analysing the current crypto obsession with decentralising everything, which in effect dismisses this most fundamental of economic insights and presumes it no longer relevant to productive enterprise. Needless to say, this is a huge error that could be costly to all of us if it takes serious shape or form in conventional investment circles. Case in point, the nutty notion of decentralised autonomous organisations as brought to market in the current ICOmedy. Within these structures executive and management layers are replaced with non-specialist token holders, who take all investing, allocation and managing decisions through an endless succession of active votes. Conventional equity holders will of course be familiar with the concept of voting — they too get to express their discontent or approval with day-to-day management decisions by way of the annual ritual which is the Annual General Meeting (AGM). The difference here is that an AGM takes place only once a year, and is focused on investors either endorsing or disapproving of the decisions of specialist managers and executives. Despite these votes only occurring once a year, active participation in such meetings is actually pretty rare. Most of the time, only a small proportion of voting shareholders bother to turn up to AGMs, and if and when they do, are usually most effective at overturning management policies when concentrated into professionalised active investor classes, whose ultimate aim is using voting power to generate shareholder value through decisive actions like asset stripping, M\u0026A, outsourcing, executive ousting et cetera et cetera. Why does this state of affairs emerge? Because, by and large, small-scale shareholders don’t want to be activist investors. They’re passive entities whose primary business or occupation, which generates the wealth that can later be reinvested into the stock market in the first place, is something else entirely. They don’t want to have to think about managing yet more companies or voting on stuff. They just want to be able to put their money to work, receive dividends and protect themselves with the safeguard of a voting option if and when things do go wrong. Hence why the money and wealth management industry exists at all. This is division of labour in action. If all of us had to actively manage our own wealth to the degree of showing up at the AGMs of every single stock we owned through indices — and being knowledgeable about the decisions we were taking — chances are we wouldn’t be all that competent at generating wealth via our primary profession. The decentralised dream, however, neglects this. In the decentralised world everyone is supposed to be their own bank, their own investment manager and their own respective corporate manager. Accordingly, the returns from division of labour stagnate because everyone is so busy managing their own payments systems, investments and keeping abreast of the latest hacking threats, they haven’t got time to do anything else half competently. Specialism and trust in others in effect dies. Generalism and amateurism increases. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out this eventually undermines economies of scale and makes the economy as a whole poorer, not richer. But now imagine a world where you aren’t just charged with having to attend annual general meetings in a knowledgeable way once a year (in an environment where company accounts and activities are reported in a standardised and ritualised way, and where corps aren’t allowed to withhold material news from investors). No, you’re charged with having to formally vote on every management and allocation decision the corporation ever undertakes (and all that in an environment where no requirement exists for material information to be exposed in a timely and equal manner to all investors). Again, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that this sort of thing can end up doubling down on the “dumbness and madness of crowds” as much as the “wisdom of crowds”. Moreover, it’s fairly obvious what has to happen next. For anything like this to succeed in the long term “decentralised token holders” (in the pattern of decentralised miners turning into professional miners) will eventually have to become proxy professionals in everything but name. And what do you end up with then? Pretty much the same corporate structures as we have now, albeit with more intensified executive conflicts and self-renumeration agendas than anything seen today. Plus, less clarity and transparency on who the decision makers are or why they’re making the decisions they’re making. The enterprises are also much more likely to be geared towards old fashioned rent-seeking models (by way of continuous investment in successive DAOs and ICOs) than any actual productive enterprise. Sadly, the original DAO disaster wasn’t enough of a spectacle to put people off these structures. We understand a spate of new DAOs are coming to market via the ICO pipeline in the next few weeks, one of which describes its unique features as follows: This is where [name redacted*] DAO comes in, it is the only ICO that will use logic underpinned by smart tokens alongside a decentralised decision mechanism to invest in future ICOs. What this means is that the holders of [name redacted] tokens will gain voting rights with the cryptocurrency. These voting rights, similar to any other democratic system, allow holders of [name redacted] to vote on future investments in other tokens, including new and upcoming ICOs. Profits from investments will be distributed quarterly in the form of a dividend. To decide upon which ICOs to invest in, a democratic vote will take place amongst the holders of the tokens. This vote will use a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO), which allows decisions to take place without a central organising body. The benefit will be that the wisdom of the crowd will pick the best investments and protect [name redacted] holders against the bad judgement of any single participant. This is particularly pertinent given the number of ICOs currently taking place. It does make us wonder, though. If the USP is not being exposed to the “bad judgement of any single participant” why operate through a DAO at all? Why not take advantage of the middleman’s demise and invest unilaterally through your own portfolio directly? Or is it that the bad judgement of the single participant you’re most concerned about is that of your own? We guess the logic here is that while trusting transparent, regulated and accountable professionals to make investment decisions on your behalf is bad, but trusting anonymous crowds, whose agendas and identities are unknown, must be markedly better. Why? Nobody knows. * Name is redacted in the hope of reducing PR spam.

Weirdly the rate accelerated after we launched our ICOmedy series (presumably because any PR is good PR in this space). A not uncommon structure of said unsolicited solicitations takes the form of: We’re giving you this exclusively. Please respect our unsolicited embargo, you lucky journalists you, and please don’t share until the day we’ve designated for maximum PR offensive impact arrives. P.S. interviews with all the key people are available at your request. Since we won’t be engaging in those sorts of opaque PR relationships, here are a few excerpts for your reading pleasure from some of the battier solicitations received this week. Beggars belief really. Exhibit A: The ICO is really unique. It will be the first time you can buy a cryptocurrency through a number of different payment options (bitcoin, either [SIC], credit card, wire transfer, etc). The process of buying cryptocurrency has also been streamlined. (So nice to know blockchain-based ICOs, in keeping with the decentralised payment revolution they represent, will now be accepting traditional bank transfers and credit cards to widen their appeal.) Exhibit B: We created an algorithm to ingest chat rooms, github projects, and forums. For nine months the algorithm has traveled a long road sifting through 19 million messages/commits/chats, 1.17M people, and hundreds of terabytes of data to assemble something truly special. A list of 63,310 people, representing the top 4.5% of relative to each crypto currency. The reason you received this email is because we believe you are a member of this group. Continues… We have decided to restrict participation in this ICO (until it is tradable) to only members of this list. We do this because of the enormous responsibility of an Emblem holder in the event our assumption is correct. Concludes… PS: If you thought this was big, for our next stunt we preloaded every credit card in Visa with a micro-fraction of our currency. PSS: The founder of Doge coin, in haz-wow Doge fashion leaked his invitation on Twitter. Please don’t do that. We don’t want to come off like the Bilderberg Group (the only private investors in Ethereum). Exhibit C (coin RELAUNCHES are now a thing!): Moeda, an innovative banking-as-a-service cooperative network that aims to empower underbanked entrepreneurs through blockchain technology, is pleased to announce plans to relaunch its Moeda (MDA) digital token. And naturally… Previous buyers of Moeda tokens will receive a loyalty bonus on their initial outlay to compensate for realignment of the token peg. Exhibit D (we’re now funding aquariums): PAquarium offers any individual sacrifice $ 3.00 per month for 3 years to build the largest aquarium in the world. Project is easily perceived and goes to mass with an innocent story about Plankton which has no home. Everyone can donate to the aquarium construction. If the project succeeds, PAquarium will grant a lifetime entrance ticket to every user who has donated 108 or more dollars over the period of these 3 years. This means that, the PAquarium users will have the right to visit the PAquarium as often, and for as long as they want. And every ticket owners name will be depicted on the wall of honour in the constructed aquarium. In case the construction of the aquarium has not begun by February 20, 2020, the collected donations from PAquarium fond will be directed towards charity. ——– At the same time PAquarium is using ICO as mechanism for attracting investments for crowdfunded project. Using opportunities of ICO, PAquarium is involving investors by selling 20% of PAquarium operational profit. When PAquarium will be ready, 20% of profit will be split between token holders annually. Investment will be covered by real estate and physical amusement park project. ——- ICO has never been used for crowdfunded project. Today, ICO enjoyed the company of information technologies, start-ups and association of enthusiasts who, using ICO strive to attract investment and public interest in new product or idea. Therefore, it seems that such type of project as PAquarium is the “new breath” for ICO, to dilute the blockchain segment. Perhaps there’s a reason why ICOs have never been used to raise money for material real-world real-estate projects that promise a 20 per cent profit share?","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Izabella Kaminska","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-07-19","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/fffde587-77ad-39a7-b5ac-cebca75fa3ae","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F07%2F17153604%2FEOS_2048x1152.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"In the crypto world, you can get something for nothing","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In the old economy, people used money to buy goods and services. I have some cash, you have a delicious burrito, and when we exchange the two, you end up with something you want, and so do I. Something for something. That’s not how things work in the new cryptoconomy. Instead, it goes something like this: you have some cash, and I have a “token”. The token is worthless. It has no purpose or function. There’s a big label on the token that says, “this token cannot be used for anything”. And we exchange the two, and so I end up with your cash, and you end up with nothing, and for some reason you’re happy with the transaction. Unfortunately, this is not a hypothetical situation. This is a pretty accurate description of an “initial coin offering” (ICO) that has raised $200m worth of cryptocurrency. The company behind it is called block.one and the money raised is meant to fund the development of EOS, which is a new piece of software that can be used to build better, more scaleable blockchains. (Blockchains are a type of decentralised database.) In an earlier post, we likened an initial coin offering to a Kickstarter campaign. Investors hand over their money, and in return get some sort of access to the product when it’s finished. The access is granted by a token that can be used with the software being developed. Block.one’s initial coin offering is different. There’s a token, but it can’t actually be used for anything. This is from the FAQs: The EOS Tokens do not have any rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features, express or implied, including, without limitation, any uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features on the EOS Platform. You might want to read that over a couple of times, keeping in mind that investors have spent over $200m buying these “EOS Tokens”. The idea behind EOS is that bandwidth, computational power and storage on a blockchain network built with the software is allocated in proportion to the amount of tokens any particular user holds. So if you own 50 per cent of the tokens that exist on the blockchain, then you get 50 per cent of the storage capacity, for example. Investors may have snapped up the “EOS Tokens” for this reason, but even then they’re on shaky ground. Block.one is developing the EOS software, but it isn’t going to actually launch any blockchain network with it. What’s more, the EOS software is going to be released “under an open source software license”, which will allow third parties to modify it however they wish whenever they launch their own networks. Presumably that means they could exclude all of the generous souls who funded the software’s development, which is what the technical documentation hints at: Cryptographic tokens referred to in this white paper refer to cryptographic tokens on a launched blockchain that adopts the eos.io software. They do not refer to the ERC-20 compatible tokens being distributed on the Ethereum blockchain in connection with the EOS token distribution Block.one is a Cayman Islands company, which means there will be next to no public oversight of what happens to the money raised from the ongoing sale of the EOS Tokens. The eos.io website helpfully refers to the proceeds as “the revenue” of block.one, which will have “sole discretion” to do with the money what it likes. Some of it will go towards building “a blockchain consulting business,” which is pretty much the only real blockchain business model that exists to-date. The block.one team includes Brendan Blumer, chief executive; Daniel Larimer, chief technology officer; Brock Pierce, chief strategy officer (and former child actor); and Ian Grigg, advisor. They may not have finished developing the EOS software, but they’ve already achieved a remarkable feat of salesmanship: telling everyone something’s worthless, and getting them to buy it anyway.

The money is usually raised in about 30 minutes and investors are not given any stake in the company or voting rights. The report said some specialists were now calling ICOs “token launches” to avoid attracting scrutiny from securities regulators. Autonomous said: “Imagine there are plans to open a new casino, and for funding, the casino sells its own plastic chips before opening, in anticipation of customers using these chips and creating economic value. “Further, the buyers start trading these chips based on the expected value of the casino, how well attended it will be, and whether other chip holders are trading.” Some of these (ICOs) will replace some VCs, and some will replace some [initial public offerings] While early ICOs mostly raised money for cryptocurrencies, cloud computing systems or core technology platforms, more recent ones have also been focused on social media, gaming and financial services applications of blockchain technology. The report compared the tokens issued in ICOs to the virtual currencies used in video games such as Second Life and World of Warcraft, which can be spent inside a game or traded for real-world money outside of it. But it warned that some investors were pouring millions of dollars into companies that had at best partially formed business plans. “Unfortunately, many ICOs are fraudulent and intended to take advantage of excitement in the ecosystem by leveraging social media for promotion and a lack of enforceable consumer protection, raising legitimate regulatory concerns and attempts by select market participants to self-regulate,” it said. Autonomous calculated that $26m was raised from ICOs in 2014, $14m in 2015 and $222m last year. It found that by the second week of July there had been 56 token sales this year, raising $1.27bn in total. More than half of this year’s proceeds have been raised since the start of June, as the price of leading cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether surged to record highs. In the past few weeks, their value has fallen sharply, which is expected to put a damper on activity. To put ICO funding in context, this year’s total is still a tiny fraction of the $34bn raised via crowdfunding platforms in 2015 and an even smaller sliver of the $127bn of venture capital investments made last year. Neil Rimer, co-founder of Index Ventures, one of Europe’s biggest VC investors, said: “Some of these [ICOs] will replace some VCs, and some will replace some [initial public offerings]. But we don’t just allow people to raise money as quickly as possible — we bring a lot of other help and advice, and I think there will continue to be demand for that.” Yet two start-ups — Tezos and EOS — have raised more than $200m each in the past few weeks from ICOs, a record amount for a single company. Investors will be hoping they fare better than the previous record holder: the DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation) raised more than $120m in 2016 to fund a community-managed venture capital fund with no employees. However, it lost more than $59m after a hacker took advantage of a software flaw and was closed last year. Lex Sokolin, author of the Autonomous report, compares the ICO phenomenon to the rush to float dotcom companies in 1999-2000. He points out that while 86 per cent of those tech companies had failed within a decade, those that survived included big winners, such as Amazon and Netflix. “We have heard how many unscrupulous actors are out there and how much fraud there is — particularly in China where some ICOs are being marketed to retail investors online,” said Mr Sokolin. “But as an asset class as a whole I think it will create a ton of economic value.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-07-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/17e2c138-ba4f-11e7-9bfb-4a9c83ffa852","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F84b409b4-bb3c-11e7-bff8-f9946607a6ba?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Global assets forecast to swell to $145tn by 2025","INTRO":"Surge in pension savings as people age, and rising emerging market wealth spur growth","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Money run by investment managers is forecast to surge by more than 70 per cent to $145tn by 2025 if interest rates globally stay relatively low and economic growth is sustained, according to a new report that underlines the phenomenal growth in the asset management sector since the financial crisis. Growth in assets from $85tn currently will be driven by significant increases in pension savings as populations age, and rising personal wealth in emerging markets, according to PwC, the professional services firm that wrote the report. “Workers need to invest much more to achieve good retirement incomes, so predictions of significant growth for the asset management industry are credible,” said Joe Linhares, head of Russell Investments in Europe. “The amount of cash currently sitting on the sidelines and earning nothing is huge.” BlackRock and Vanguard, the industry giants, already manage nearly $10.7tn. But Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard and pioneer of the index-based investing that has upended the fund industry, last week expressed concerns about the pace of growth. “We are now closing in on $5tn and I worry about that,” he said. “Running a large company is a very difficult thing . . . It gets harder and harder as you get bigger and bigger.” PwC found that further cuts in fund fees, tougher regulation and technology will vastly intensify competitive pressures, creating new winners and losers among traditional asset managers, hedge funds and private equity groups. “The industry will be substantially reinvented over the next 10 years. There will be major changes to fees, products, distribution, regulation, technology and people skills,” said Olwyn Alexander, global asset and wealth management leader at PwC. “Fewer companies will manage far more assets significantly more cheaply.” Managers of low-cost index-tracking strategies are set to be the biggest winners, with their assets predicted to more than double from $14.2tn to $36.6tn by 2025 as awareness of the impact of fees on long-term returns increases. “Scale is becoming increasingly important as downward pressures on fees spread from institutional clients to retail investors more widely,” said Mr Linhares. BlackRock and Vanguard have established a commanding lead over their rivals as the two largest passive managers. Pennsylvania-based Vanguard has attracted at least $1.3tn in new business since the start of 2012, while BlackRock has registered net inflows of around $858bn over the same period. Assets under management for BlackRock and Vanguard could reach more than $9tn and $7tn respectively by 2025, if growth for both slows to match the industry-wide annual average of 6.2 per cent expected by PwC. This would fuel debate over whether both companies should be classified as systemically important and be subjected to tighter regulation by global supervisors. However, growth for traditional stockpickers that attempt to identify winning stocks is expected to remain robust, with assets forecast to increase from $60.6tn to $87.6tn over the next nine years. “It could still feel like trying to push water uphill for some active managers, as there will be intense pressures on revenues due to the continued growth in passive funds,” said Justin Bates, an analyst at Liberum, the investment bank. Profit margins will be more sustainable over the longer term by automating middle and back offices Asset managers have struggled to control rising costs over the past decade due to multiple demands from regulators for improvements in business practices and the need to invest in technology. This has led to pressure on profit margins in spite of healthy growth in new business inflows since the 2007-08 financial crisis, when global assets were $59tn. “The heydays of 30 per cent-plus profit margins will not be sustainable in the new world order,” said Ms Alexander Technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning offer active managers the chance to generate market-beating returns. “These technology developments offer real scope for active managers to improve alpha and to maintain their profit margins,” said Mr Bates. Growing numbers of asset managers are investigating the possibilities offered by blockchain, a giant, online public ledger. Blockchain could eradicate established clearing and settlement process when ownership of a security is moved from one investor to another. Some managers are also looking into employing blockchain to trade directly with each other, cutting out traditional middlemen such as brokers and bringing down trading costs. Asset managers would require fewer staff if blockchain is widely adopted. “Profit margins will be more sustainable over the longer term by automating middle and back offices. Cost savings in the front office are also achievable, which should aid overall profitability,” said Will Riley, co-manager of the Guinness Global Money Managers fund.

The test did not involve real money, nor any of the BoE’s core systems, or even use blockchain technology itself. However, the proof of concept announced on Monday evening marks an important moment for the blockchain community. “This is really about connectivity between central bank systems rather than replacing the central bank systems with the blockchain,” Daniel Aranda, head of Europe at Ripple, told the Financial Times. “It allows money to move between countries near-instantaneously and without settlement risk.” The BoE tested whether it could synchronise a multimillion-pound wholesale payment passing from its own settlement system, known as the Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), to another central bank’s core system. The central bank said it set up two simulated RTGS systems on a cloud computing platform, using the Ripple interledger to simultaneously process “a successful cross-border payment”. “We also demonstrated that an attempted cross-border payment that failed validation on the receiving side would not be honoured,” it said. The 21-year-old RTGS system handles about £500bn of payments between banks every day, facilitating a huge range of transactions — from settling company invoices to house purchases. Mark Carney, governor of the BoE, has said that changes are needed to help RTGS handle new demands as the financial industry evolves. He launched the overhaul three years ago after parts of the payments system suffered an embarrassing nine-hour outage that forced the BoE to start processing important transactions manually. The central bank has already concluded that distributed ledger technology, the shared database and cryptographic system that underpins virtual currencies such as bitcoin, is “not sufficiently mature” to support the core RTGS system. But it said the test of Ripple’s software had reinforced its intention to ensure the new payments settlement system was fully compatible with the new technology and “highlighted areas where we would like to conduct more exploratory work”. One question it flagged as needing more work was how to handle issues around the availability of liquidity when processing wholesale cross-border payments. Mr Aranda at Ripple said the test showed that the interledger, which uses cryptographic algorithms to securely co-ordinate money transfers, could reduce the time it takes to settle a large cross-border payment from between two and four days to “only a few seconds”. “Instead of having to rely on a series of counterparties, it is central bank to central bank, which is lower risk and therefore lower cost,” he said. In May, the Bank of Canada officially abandoned its experiment with blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, citing “a fundamental inconsistency or tension” between the country’s centralised wholesale interbank payment system and the decentralised principle of blockchain. That provided plenty of ammunition to blockchain sceptics. But it contrasts with the more upbeat tone from the BoE, itself run by a former Bank of Canada governor, about its progress on harnessing new technologies to make its core payments system ready for the future.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-07-11","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/8daafc72-28e9-3ff9-a64c-39be77618cb8","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F07%2F10184604%2FCroppedgavel_2048x1152.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Guest post: Smart contracts will need human juries","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"This is a post by Abraham Othman, a visiting scholar in the Operations, Information and Decisions Department of the Wharton School (University of Pennsylvania) and an advisor to the blockchain project Augur, wherein he argues human juries will be necessary to put the smart into smart contracts. Smart contracts are a promising feature of Ethereum, the decentralized application blockchain which recently passed a 20 billion dollar market cap. Smart contracts are digital contracts, written in code, whose clauses are enforced automatically. Through ventures like the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, the financial industry is intensively exploring applications of this “scripting language for money”. But smart contracts have a lurking problem. To see why, consider Puerto Rico’s beleaguered municipal bonds. The US territory is in a liminal state of insolvency. A “circular firing squad” of differently secured creditors and government officials are fighting over a pool of money large enough to pay some, but not all, of those with interests. It would be impossible to write a smart contract that, say, triggers to accurately make whole the holders of Puerto Rico’s sales-tax-linked bonds, since the fate of those bonds will be the results of a complex and unpredictable interaction between creditors, the legislature, and the court system. When Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s creator, points out that accurately capturing intent in a smart contract is a challenge he means that, as in Puerto Rico’s case, the future has a persistent tendency to be more complicated than what can be coded precisely at the present. But when properly incentivized, humans can be intelligent, flexible, fair, and reasonable: exactly the qualities that bad code lacks. This suggests that smart contracts would benefit from a backstop of human adjudication. I advise Augur, a fully decentralized prediction market platform that runs on Ethereum. Augur will be the first economically significant test of human-adjudicated smart contracts when it launches later this summer. A jury for the blockchain age Prediction markets like Augur allow traders to place wagers on the future state of the world. Since Augur is a fully distributed system, people can create markets on anything (including on the losses from Puerto Rico’s municipal bond default). Consequently, Augur needs a way to resolve and adjudicate every market in a fair way. In typical markets, a trusted central arbiter performs these functions. For instance, disputes in the sugar futures market are settled by an ad hoc group of three “disinterested” members of the central Sugar Delivery Committee. In contrast, Augur’s decentralized resolution process leverages the labour of the thousands of holders of its application token. These tokens are entries in the Ethereum ledger that were initially sold in a 2015 crowd sale. A randomly chosen portion of token holders will, for each market, decide which event actually occurred, or if the question is ambiguous or involves an illegal activity (in this case, the market creator loses a deposit that they paid to the platform). For their efforts, token holders are paid a portion of the fees traders are charged on the platform. But, uniquely, token holders can also lose part of their holdings by misreporting or disagreeing with the crowd. Augur’s process has similarities to a jury system, as the adjudicators are chosen randomly from the population of token holders. But there are also notable differences: unlike a jury, token holders report independently, without deliberation. Also unlike juries, there could also be significant financial rewards or punishments for adjudicating, since tokens entitle their holders to a stream of future fee income, and the tokens lost by disagreeing with the crowd are then redistributed to more agreeable adjudicators. Since tokens can be gained or lost, adjudicators have skin in the game. This creates a novel form of jurisprudence; we do not pay judges bonuses for having a low rate of overturned decisions. The largest drawback to Augur’s approach is time — it could take weeks to get enough votes with decentralized, independent adjudication. Consequently, Augur will only use human adjudication as a backstop for contracts whose automatic resolution by market creators is challenged by traders. There is also a risk adjudicators will intentionally manipulate smart contract resolution, but it seems limited. In addition to the strong financial incentives in place for agreeing with the crowd, coordinated manipulation will be difficult since the other adjudicators are drawn from a pool of thousands of global token holders. The problem with “code as law” Without human adjudication, we are left with hoping that code-authors will be able to “get it right” with the code in our smart contracts. But precise, safe, smart-contract coding is a challenge, and its difficulty comes with real consequences. Consider the DAO, a mis-coded Ethereum smart contract mutual fund that resulted in the attempted theft of millions of dollars in 2016. As blockchain technologies mature from mathematical curiosities to practical applications, smart contracts will need to mature as well. It is my hope that Augur’s human adjudication will light the way forward for smart contracts by providing anonymous adjudication, with proper incentives, at scale.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-07-11","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/8eeff9c8-9b23-3720-8de6-5a5eb03d413d","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F07%2F17102930%2Ftezos-fundraiser_2048x1152.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"What does a crypto startup do with $230m?","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"You’ve probably never heard of Tezos before. It’s a “new decentralized blockchain” that’s apparently better than all the other blockchains, and last week, it completed a $230m fundraising. The staggering sum of money was raised through an “initial coin offering”, which is basically like a Kickstarter for crypto-nerds. Investors fund the construction of software by handing over their cash in return for a token, which gives them access to that software. If the software is built, and is as useful as it’s said to be, hopefully those tokens will rise in value as other people clamber to access it. It’s like buying a funfair token in the hope that another punter will want it more. If the sum of money raised was a guarantor of success, then Tezos would now be a sure bet. It’s the biggest ICO to-date. The platform is the brainchild of Kathleen and Arthur Breitman, who previously worked at Accenture and Goldman Sachs respectively. They have been developing it through their venture Dynamic Ledger Solutions since 2014 and if they can get the Tezos blockchain running for three months “substantially as described” in their marketing, they and the other investors in DLS like venture capitalist Tim Draper will make $20m. (According to the terms of the ICO, 8.5 per cent of the money raised will be used to acquire DLS.) From now on, the Breitmans will shepherd this project through the Swiss-based Tezos Foundation. The big question is what will they do with all that money once they’ve converted the $230m worth of cryptocurrency into state-recognised currency? Well, let’s look at some of the “Mars-shot” ideas Tezos has up its sleeve. Those ideas were there in case Tezos raised $20m or above. Now that they’ve surpassed $200m, perhaps they could try to build an actual rocket to Mars.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Kadhim Shubber","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-07-17","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/0e42aaaa-3587-11e7-99bd-13beb0903fa3","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fb3005666-5754-11e7-80b6-9bfa4c1f83d2?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Luxembourg’s politicians pin economic hopes on fintech drive","INTRO":"Prime minister prioritises creation of ‘world-leading smart nation’","DETAILED_CONTENT":"For the past four decades Luxembourg’s financial sector has been the principal driver of the country’s economy. The government now hopes that by encouraging fintech it will be able to insulate the industry from the challenges of the digital age as well as allaying concerns over the grand duchy’s high economic reliance on financial services. That effort has taken on greater urgency over the past decade as banking secrecy has eroded and the government has been forced to rethink the business models of the country’s private banks. Reforms that threaten the country’s competitive advantage as a low-tax haven for multinational groups have also focused attention on how best to defend its status as a corporate hub. Britain’s planned departure from the EU has provided policymakers with an incentive to build a fintech hub in Luxembourg that could attract UK technology companies looking to maintain a foothold in the EU. Prime minister Xavier Bettel has made the country’s digital transformation a priority since succeeding the long-serving Jean-Claude Juncker in December 2013. Mr Bettel launched the Digital Lëtzebuerg [Luxembourg] initiative the following year as a platform for encouraging new technology in the financial industry as well as society as a whole. “Digital Lëtzebuerg is about using digitisation as a lever for transformation and harnessing the huge potential that new technologies can offer,” he says. His aim is to make Luxembourg “a world-leading smart nation”. The initiative includes support for start-ups, and particularly for innovation in fintech.  The flagship project to encourage fintech is the Luxembourg House of Financial Technology, opened with much fanfare in April with backing from the government and business groups. The project will offer incubator facilities including co-working or office space for up to a year for early-stage start-ups, as well as organising events such as masterclasses and hackathons. Its focus is on insurance, banking and fund technology in areas such as digital investment and portfolio management, blockchain applications, payment platforms, data analytics, artificial intelligence, security and authentication. So-called “regtech” is viewed as a particularly promising growth area by regulators and institutions alike. Nasir Zubairi, chief executive of the project, says it is sifting through applications from 50 start-ups, from Luxembourg and abroad, in order to select an initial roster of 10 incubator clients. Mr Zubairi says Luxembourg is high on the list of potential locations for UK fintech ventures, especially those involved in payment technology, which are fearful of losing access to the European market. He says the grand duchy is attractive to the broader financial services sector as an entry point into the EU for companies from Asia and the US. One success was the announcement in February by London’s e-payment services provider PPRO Group that it would launch operations in Luxembourg because of uncertainty about passporting rights for UK companies after Brexit. It joined companies such as Snapswap, a provider of blockchain-based payment services including cross-currency transactions through instant messages. Tech skills are a priority for both government and the private sector One draw for fintech businesses considering a move to Luxembourg is its multilingual workforce that is mostly comfortable in English as well as French and German. Also important is the presence of a large banking and finance sector that is finally rushing to embrace digital transformation, especially the possibilities offered by blockchain. This is not before time, says Pascal Martino, head of Deloitte Digital in the country: “Luxembourg banks do not seem to have implemented tremendous improvements in terms of digital channels over the past two years.” Some institutions, such as local retail bank BGL BNP Paribas, have a better record than others. It set up the Lux Future Lab incubator for entrepreneurs — not exclusively in the financial sector — as long ago as 2012. Infrachain, an organisation backed by the government to speed the adoption of distributed ledger technology, launched in late 2016 and has backing from 11 local partners. This followed the creation last year of Fundchain, supported by another group of fund service providers and technology suppliers. It is also attempting to harness blockchain. Olivier Selis, manager of Lux Future Lab, warns that Luxembourg’s limited workforce could hold back the growth of fintech, although efforts to instil tech skills are a priority for both government and the private sector. Mr Zubairi says it is vital to extend digital expertise: “If we can encourage the next wave of innovators — the youth of Luxembourg — that will be an important success.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-06-23","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/6bb4f678-5a8c-11e7-b553-e2df1b0c3220","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fef9655a2-5abb-11e7-b553-e2df1b0c3220?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"European banks to launch blockchain trade finance platform","INTRO":"Seven lenders hire IBM to build technology for SMEs to finance cross-border orders","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Seven of Europe’s biggest banks are stepping up their attempts to shift trade finance on to blockchain technology by hiring IBM to build a platform for small businesses to finance their cross-border orders in the region. The move highlights how many bankers see trade finance as an area with the greatest potential to benefit from blockchain technology, which was developed to underpin cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and is now being adapted for use in other areas. IBM has been selected to build and host a new blockchain system for providing small and medium sized companies with cross-border trade finance from Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC, Natixis, Rabobank, Société Générale and UniCredit. Blockchains allow encrypted data on anything, from money to medical records, to be shared between many companies, people and institutions. This protects data from fraud while instantly updating all parties concerned. Bankers expect the technology to transform trade finance, which traces its roots back to the 16th century merchants of Venice and remains a cumbersome and largely paper-based process that leaves companies waiting weeks before they are paid for their goods. “We are convinced that blockchain will have a huge impact on banks in the future and that trade finance is one of the biggest areas of potential for the technology,” said Rudi Peeters, chief information officer at KBC. KBC developed the precursor to the new system by trialing it with some of its Belgian small business customers. The plan is for the banks to start offering trade finance to European SMEs over the cloud-based platform by the end of this year. “Trade finance is an obvious way to use blockchain because [at present] it is very paper based, complex and pricey,” said Mr Peeters. “We feel the biggest need is in the SME sector, where there is a clear gap in the market as many of them cannot access trade finance.” Trade finance is an obvious way to use blockchain because [at present] it is very paper based, complex and pricey He said the banks planned to expand the platform to include inter-continental shipping routes at a later date but they had decided it was easier to handle road-based European trade routes in the first instance. The platform, which is expected to add more banks, shippers, freight forwarders and credit agencies after it launches, will also allow SMEs to track orders and use smart contracts that automatically trigger payments on a certain event, such as an invoice being sent or delivery being recorded. SMEs will be vetted by the banks before being added to the platform, which Mr Peeters said would be cheaper than traditional forms of financing for SMEs. This year IBM teamed up with Maersk, the world’s biggest container shipping line, to launch a blockchain platform that is designed to digitise the supply-chain process by tracking shipments around the world. The first trade finance transaction over blockchain technology was claimed by Barclays and Israeli start-up Wave last September when they guaranteed the almost $100,000 of cheese and butter exports from Irish co-operative Ornua to the Seychelles Trading Company. That condensed a process that usually takes seven to 10 days into less than four hours.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-06-26","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/100622d0-a680-11e7-93c5-648314d2c72c","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F9276168c-a764-11e7-ab66-21cc87a2edde?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BP experiments with blockchain for oil and gas trading","INTRO":"Oil major working with Eni and Wien Energie to run test trades alongside live systems","DETAILED_CONTENT":"BP is experimenting with blockchain to make oil and gas trading more efficient in the latest sign of big companies bringing the database technology into mainstream use.

BP has been working with Eni, the Italian oil major, and Wien Energie of Austria on a pilot programme where blockchain trades have been run on an experimental basis, in parallel with live trading systems. The three of them are now working with BTL, an Anglo-Canadian technology company, to commercialise the system. Other energy companies have also been invited to participate. Mr Eyton said oil and gas trading was just one of many potential applications for blockchain across BP — externally and within the organisation — using traditional currencies rather than cryptocurrencies. “In a big company, with lots of different corporate entities, you have to manage financial settlements and reconciliation between different parts of the business,” he told the Financial Times. “A lot of that lends itself to blockchain.” Other examples of “traditional” industries adopting blockchain include AP Moller-Maersk, the Danish shipping group, which is using it in marine insurance contracts and Europe’s biggest banks, including HSBC and Deutsche Bank, in cross-border trade finance. Andrew Woosey, a partner at EY who has worked with BP on its pilot programme, said blockchain could lead to “reduced risk, better protection against cyber threats and ultimately significant cost savings”. But “further engineering and organisational effort” was needed to reach this potential, he said. Blockchain is part of a wave of digital technology being adopted across the oil and gas industry as a sector associated with greasy pumps and valves tries to modernise. BP last month invested $10m in a fuel-supply partnership with Victor, an on-demand marketplace for private jet charters — giving the group a foothold in Uber-style digital technology that has the potential to disrupt all areas of the transport sector. In June, BP invested $20m in a Californian artificial intelligence start-up called Beyond Limits, which is commercialising technology developed by Nasa. Potential uses for artificial intelligence by BP range from analysis of seismic data in oil exploration to detecting safety defects in refineries.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Andrew Ward","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-10-03","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/7dc8738c-a922-11e7-93c5-648314d2c72c","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F194f3d30-a8f2-11e7-ab66-21cc87a2edde?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Banks team up with IBM in trade finance blockchain","INTRO":"System will track goods and release payments as they move around the world","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A group of banks are teaming up with IBM to build a new global system for trade finance using blockchain technology that is designed to track goods and automatically release payments as they move around the world by plane, ship or truck. Bank of Montreal, Caixabank, Erste Bank and Commerzbank are joining the project called Batavia, which was launched by UBS and IBM last year and aims to start testing the technology using real transactions by early next year. Blockchains allow encrypted data on anything, from money to medical records, to be shared between many companies, people and institutions. This protects data from fraud while instantly updating all parties concerned. Bankers say the technology could transform trade finance, which traces its roots back to the 16th century merchants of Venice and remains a cumbersome and largely paper-based process that leaves companies waiting weeks before they are paid for their goods. The consortium said the system was designed to be used by many banks, vendors and regulators to reduce the time and cost of providing trade finance for cross-border transactions. It aims to use smart contracts — a way of encoding a process on to a blockchain system — to automatically transfer money as goods progress around the world. “We will secure the support of the trade community as the project progresses,” said Beat Bannwart, the UBS executive overseeing the venture. “What we want to avoid is a fragmentation of the market, because if that happens clients won’t use it.” Rival bankers have warned that to achieve the benefits that blockchain technology could bring any new system must also include the shipping companies, the shipping agents and the freight providers, as well as the ports, the customs authorities and the insurers, to be successful. Several start-ups are working to digitise the bill of lading process, such as Wave of Israel, EssDocs of Malta and Bolero of the UK. Marie Wieck, general manager of IBM’s blockchain team, said: “You are seeing the momentum behind blockchain increase and there is now a shift from technology projects to more of what I’d call ecosystem projects like this one.” This year IBM teamed up with Maersk, the world’s biggest container shipping line, to launch a blockchain platform that is designed to digitise the supply-chain process by tracking shipments around the world. IBM has also been selected to build and host a new blockchain system for providing small and medium sized companies with cross-border trade finance from Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC, Natixis, Rabobank, Société Générale and UniCredit. The first trade finance transaction over blockchain technology was claimed by Barclays and Israeli start-up Wave last September when they guaranteed the almost $100,000 of cheese and butter exports from Irish co-operative Ornua to the Seychelles Trading Company. That condensed a process that usually takes seven to 10 days into less than four hours.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-10-04","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/b5b1a5f2-5030-11e7-bfb8-997009366969","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fe109bcc6-55b2-11e7-80b6-9bfa4c1f83d2?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Growing scepticism challenges the blockchain hype","INTRO":"Companies recognise that the technology has yet to be adapted for the real world","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain, the shared database technology that powers cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, has over the past three years developed an almost unchallenged reputation as the next big thing in finance and technology. Many prominent financiers, technologists and entrepreneurs have staked their reputations and fortunes on it. Take Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan executive who is attributed with creating the credit default swap. After she joined Digital Asset Holdings, a blockchain start-up, in March 2015, she said that the technology should be treated as seriously as the development of the internet in the early 1990s. And investors did exactly that. Up to $1.74bn has been invested in blockchain ventures to date, $796m of that since the beginning of 2016, according to data tracked by industry media company Coindesk. But as investment increased, so did the hype. Almost everything, from tracking tuna to managing medical records, has been touted as in line to benefit from the technology. Claims about blockchain’s potential range from the outrageous (the end of poverty ) to the more mundane and operational (cost reduction in repo clearing and real-time settlement). Yet executives at blockchain-investing companies have rarely been able to explain what it was that blockchain would be enhancing in their businesses or why. “You’ll have to ask my tech associate,” has been the invariable answer. When asked what makes blockchain so exceptionally useful, the answers ranged in nature from “it’s a compression algorithm, and makes data storage cheaper” to “it enhances security and can’t be hacked”. Neither assertion is strictly accurate. But the confidence demonstrates the scale of mythmaking in the industry. By 2016 the unchallenged claims were so out of whack with reality that even Gartner, the information technology adviser that created the hype cycle curve, had put blockchain near the top of its “peak of inflated expectations” section. Has blockchain hype stood the test of time? Or does the next phase in the Gartner hype cycle — “the trough of disillusionment” — beckon? We are either there already or about to arrive. Exhibit A: the suddenly diminished use of the term “blockchain” in the marketing of many of these ventures. The latest vogue is for distributed ledger technology (DLT) or shared permissioned databases. The linguistic pivot reflects an industry-wide realisation that blockchain has to be adapted for the real world. For the most part, blockchain as used in the crypto currency field cannot square with the demands of regulated industries that value privacy, cost-control, scale, competition, autonomy, legal recourse and compliance. By now almost all blockchain ventures have absolutely nothing to do with blockchain as it was originally described or used in bitcoin.  Exhibit B: the realisation that getting competing companies to co-operate on data sharing and storage is hard. Collaboration comes with oligopoly risk, lack of autonomy and loss of privacy. Small surprise some of the biggest co-operative ventures such as R3 have been losing members this past year. The Bank of Canada, meanwhile, officially abandoned its DLT experiment in May, stating that “at its heart, there exists a fundamental inconsistency or tension between a centralised wholesale interbank payment system, as we have now, and the decentralisation inherent in the DLT”. Nothing is more indicative of a change in sentiment, however, than a sudden rise in scrutiny. Simon Scorer, from the Bank of England’s digital currencies team, noted in a blog post last week that there is scope to make DLT systems more compatible with centralised environments. The problem is “by adapting DLT in this way, you move further away from the principles for which it was originally designed”.

But where can aspiring software coders find training about the intricacies of this technology? There has been a surprising dearth of courses available in this nascent but fast-growing field. Yet the signs are that this is starting to change. Blockchain is a technology that powers cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, the value of which soared to more than $2,500 recently, up almost fivefold in the past year. Blockchains allow encrypted data on anything, from money to medical records, to be shared between many companies, people and institutions. This protects data from fraud while instantly updating all parties concerned. Experts say the demand for expertise is coming from all sectors — from financial services to retail — and it is far outstripping supply. “It is a hot market at the moment because most of the large corporates want to be able to say they have a blockchain team,” says Michael Mainelli, who runs blockchain training courses for senior executives and boards at his consultancy Z/Yen. Having initially kept away from bitcoin, fearing the risks of fraud and criminality, big companies now see huge potential in the underlying technology to improve the efficiency of everything from tracking food products to processing financial transactions. The best blockchain engineers can command a salary above $250,000, according to Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s vice-president of blockchain technologies. “It is on the high side of what a really talented consultant or software engineer can earn,” Mr Cuomo adds. “Demand is exceeding supply, so we are seeing shortages. It is up there with the cloud and artificial intelligence as a really hot area.” Mr Mainelli adds that few established universities offer blockchain courses, reflecting the developing nature of the field, which combines shared database systems with cryptography. “This technology is not that complicated,” he says. “If you are a coder who knows about cryptography then it is pretty simple.” This year the University of Edinburgh plans to become one of the first big European universities to launch a blockchain course. Aggelos Kiayias, chair in cyber security and privacy and director of the blockchain technology laboratory at the university, says: “Blockchain technology is a recent development and there is always a bit of a lag as academia catches up.” He adds that as well as learning the skills needed to build a blockchain, also called a distributed ledger, there are other benefits in studying the technology. “You can learn an incredible amount about cyber security just by studying the blockchain.” US universities have been quicker to join the bandwagon. Stanford University launched a bitcoin and cryptocurrencies course two years ago. A similar course is offered by the University of California, Berkeley, and another is in the works at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There are also scores of internet tutorials, many of them available for free as massive open online courses. Coursera, an education-focused tech company, has joined with Princeton University to offer an 11-week cryptocurrency technologies course. A group of experienced cryptocurrency executives founded the Blockchain University three years ago in California, offering an eight-week course to students who paid a $100 deposit that is refundable on completing the course. At the other end of the spectrum is B9lab, a fee-charging institution based in London and Hamburg offering a 40-hour course in blockchain for technical executives and analysts that is spread over nine weeks and costs €2,350. Underlining how swiftly the technology is becoming mainstream, data requested by the FT from LinkedIn, the career-related social networking platform, showed there over 1,000 blockchain-related job adverts on the site in early June, more than treble the level of a year ago. The number of blockchain ads on LinkedIn is growing at more than 40 per cent a quarter. Almost 10,000 people on the site list blockchain as a skill, half of them in the technology industry and a quarter in the financial services sector. LinkedIn does not include blockchain among its official list of skills, but so many users cite it that the website is considering adding it to the ones it tracks. The majority of the people listing blockchain as a skill on the site are based in the US, followed by the UK, France, India, Germany and the Netherlands. Almost a quarter of them also list bitcoin as a skill, while 16 per cent cite one of their skills as Python, a programming language, and 9 per cent say they are skilled in cryptocurrencies. Josh Graff, UK country manager at LinkedIn, says: “Professionals in related areas such as cryptography and machine learning may want to look at the roles available and the skills they need to develop, as there is certainly a growing demand within the technology, finance and insurance industries for blockchain expertise.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-06-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/03ea1b88-511b-11e7-a1f2-db19572361bb","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F22b5cd4c-511f-11e7-bfb8-997009366969?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"AIG sets up blockchain policy for Standard Chartered","INTRO":"Fans of the technology say it will cut costs and reduce the scope for disputes","DETAILED_CONTENT":"AIG has sold what it says is the first blockchain-based multinational insurance policy to UK-based bank Standard Chartered. Excitement has been building in the insurance world over the potential for the technology, with its fans saying it will cut costs and reduce the scope for disputes. Carol Barton, head of multinational insurance at AIG, said that using blockchain — which allows those involved to see up-to-date, secure details of the policy terms, premium payments and claims — made the process far more efficient than it would have been using traditional methods. The AIG policy for Standard Chartered consists of a “master policy” in the UK, which is linked to local policies in the US, Kenya and Singapore. “Typically, a multinational policy can take a lot of time because of local regulatory requirements. This system provides a lot of certainty more quickly,” said Ms Barton. A process that could have taken months, she adds, was cut down to a few days. “Ultimately, it makes it cheaper. There are a lot of frictional costs in chasing after things, but the system makes the process faster and more cost-effective.” The insurer said that Standard Chartered had chosen not to involve its broker in this trial but gave no details on how much the policy cost nor what it covers. AIG worked with IBM on the Standard Chartered policy. Marie Wieck, general manager of IBM blockchain, said: “By helping solve some of the biggest problems challenging the [insurance] industry, from eliminating silos of information to improving efficiency, blockchain can truly make an enormous impact and even lead to new business models.” Not everyone in the industry is a fan of blockchain. Earlier this year Oxbow, a consultancy, produced a ranking of “hype vs impact” in insurance technology and disruption. Blockchain ranked highly for hype, but was near the bottom of the list for impact. AIG is not the only insurer experimenting with blockchain. An industry consortium involving some of the industry’s top names, including Munich Re, Swiss Re, Zurich, Generali, Zurich and Allianz, was set up last year to explore the potential for the technology. One thing that unites both the AIG policy with Standard Chartered and the B3i consortium is the absence of insurance brokers. Tensions between insurers and brokers are already rising. Insurers have complained that brokers are taking a bigger slice of a pie that is shrinking as insurance prices fall.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Oliver Ralph","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-06-15","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/5927fa2c-4c73-11e7-919a-1e14ce4af89b","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fd9eda952-4d15-11e7-a3f4-c742b9791d43?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain successfully tested in sale of mutual funds","INTRO":"Asset management sector keen to find technology to improve cost saving and efficiency","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Calastone, the technology company, said it had successfully used blockchain to buy and sell mutual funds under test conditions, in a move that could help spur a revolution in the asset management industry by cutting costs and improving efficiency. In the largest-scale test of blockchain in the fund industry to date, Calastone said the technology proved capable of processing transactions equivalent to a full day’s trades sourced from across its client base, which spans more than 1,200 fund distribution and fund manager clients across 34 countries. Ken Tregidgo, deputy chief executive of Calastone, the messaging company, said the company had shown that blockchain — which is a giant online public ledger — could be used to create a one-stop marketplace for trading and settling investment funds. “We believe the introduction of our distributed market infrastructure can be transformational for the fund industry,” he said. “Moving to this model will realise significant benefits to the fund market on a global scale, reducing the frictional cost of trading to the benefit of all players in the market.” By moving processes online, the fund industry would need to employ fewer people, helping to cut costs. Those cost savings could then be passed on to investors. In recent years global financial services companies have rushed to unpick blockchain, which is the technology that underpins bitcoin, the digital currency, in the belief that it could make businesses more efficient. Thousands of blockchain-based start-ups have been created, while the number of blockchain-related jobs has also soared, as banks and other financial services companies scrambled to get to grips with what the technology can do. Calastone, which began testing the technology more than a year ago, replicated trades carried out by its clients. Its next step is to test trades in real life. Olivia Vinden, principal at Alpha FMC, the wealth and asset management consultancy, said a big challenge for companies was getting regulatory sign-off to use blockchain. She also warned that convincing the various businesses involved in buying and selling funds, including asset managers, distributors, custodian banks and exchanges, to use a single system is likely to be a challenge. Fund dealing is a great candidate for blockchain technology. It could cut costs and make things more efficient But she added that the process of buying and selling of funds is hugely inefficient, with many companies still relying on paper and faxes to deal with orders. “Fund dealing is a great candidate for [blockchain technology]. It could cut costs and make things more efficient,” she said. Earlier this year, BNP Paribas Securities Services, part of the French bank, teamed up with Axa Investment Managers, the fund house with $747bn in assets, on a blockchain project. The companies want to make fund distribution easier by using blockchain and so-called smart-contract technology — where a computer program directly controls the transfer of assets between parties. Jean Devambez, head of product and clients solutions at BNP Paribas Securities Services, said he does not expect one blockchain marketplace to dominate the fund market initially. “In the coming years, several fund distribution and blockchain platforms are likely to be launched,” he said. Northern Trust, the US bank, also launched blockchain technology for the private equity market in January. Unigestion, a Switzerland-based asset manager with $20bn in assets under management, is using Northern Trust’s technology to carry out administration functions for one of its private equity funds.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Attracta Mooney","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-06-12","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/ada788f8-2f59-30fe-846e-05c9553df005","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F06%2F07171312%2FGettyImages-531227133_2048x1152.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Building blockchain banks with ICOs (updated)","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Polybius was a second century-BC Greek historian who brought us the theory of cyclical political change known as anacyclosis, loosely based on Plato’s philosopher king narrative. The general thrust of the argument is that political structure is perpetually revolving — moving from monarchy to oligarchy to rule by the people (over and over again) — because humans can always be relied upon to respond the same way to the same challenges. He was also an early-day tinkerer in cryptography. Polybius, the crypto bank initiative, is a proposed blockchain-based digital institution which raised $11m last week via an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) with little more than a 22-page “prospectus” and a promise that “Polybius Bank will become a fully digital bank accessible everywhere at any time. It will have all the functions of a classical bank, but will not host any branches nor physical front-offices and will rely fully on the latest digital technologies.” Helping Polybius, the bank initiative, raise all that money was a marketing effort which leaned heavily on associations with well-established financial and advisory institutions. Case in point, Daniel Haudenschild, partner at EY, whose name and EY connection was well publicised throughout the supporting documentation, despite a lack of clarity as to the real nature of EY’s involvement/endorsement. Crypto podcaster Joshua Unseth spoke with Haudenschild about the ICO and the following are a few nuggets from the conversation, which we thought were worth sharing: JU: You and I both know that tokens don’t provide any fiduciary obligation to investors, these are just tokens so there’s no equity given to investors right, or to these token holders ? DH: Yes, I mean there’s no guarantee…there’s no recourse to the law. JU: Right. So somebody actually does own Polybius? There is an owner of it and that is HashCoin isn’t it? DH: So they do have a legal entity in Estonia, right, they would have to otherwise there would … it would not be very prudent. I think the founders are Anton and a couple of the other guys from… who are actually on Companies House, but to be honest I don’t know who’s the actual owner of the entity… So I think that’s going to get much more transparent when, you know, they apply for the banking license. JU: So here’s my question, Daniel, don’t you think it’s a bit dangerous to have a lack of transparency as for example who owns the actual entity that is ICO-ing, there’s absolutely nothing in the White Paper about it and in addition to that, as we agreed, there’s no fiduciary obligation that’s out set as a result of this token distribution so really token holders have nothing more than the promise to pay dividends, in addition to that they don’t even have a banking license yet do they? DH: They don’t have a banking license and that’s quite clearly stated. The success with the ICO would determine where they go with it. Is it dangerous? Hmm… JU: Well the ownership isn’t out laid in their white paper so they’re doing an ICO without disclosing probably the most important element of this which is that HashCoins actually owns Polybius. DH: Yeah, hmm. I think the way that… so so so.. that probably is not a secret. JU: It’s kinda of a secret, it’s material isn’t it? —— DH: I know they [Hashcoins] are the senior backers behind the project, but I don’t know who owns it, that wasn’t our role in advising them. JU: I understand that, but how much money do you think HashCoins put into this project? Let’s be honest this is a project with absolutely no progress yet. They have no banking licenses, they have nothing yet, they have absolutely nothing in the way of technology yet. They just have promises of this stuff. DH: I’m the first one to say that they have a massively ambitious intention. Look at the assets they had before the ICO went out and what you had was a white paper, a pretty good video, a good story, a government that’s willing to play ball and some bright kids, right. JU: Then you have a token that offers no equity and which only promises dividends and in addition … DH:.. with unlimited tokens as well. JU: Unlimited tokens.. DH:.. without any legal company behind it … JU: Well they have Hashcoins… —– JU: You’re a partner at EY, why is EY’s name on this? DH: Well I mean, so.. so… I mean EY’s a company that would probably not endorse Polybius bank as a banking institution, right. The way the brand was used, there’s still discussions going on, but I think in general, you know, Hashcoins is a prominent brand in cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. —– JU: It sounds to me like Ernst Young has a tacit partnership in that you’re involved kind of, but only in an advisory capacity — isn’t that a dangerous project to put your name on as a company? DH: It is right. It is. I think it has to be seen in relation to the role we played in the project JU: But Ernst \u0026 Young, noone knows what the role Ernst \u0026 Young plays, they’re just looking at this and Ernst \u0026 Young putting their name on the project is what looks to me an endorsement. All of this raises an important point about actual shareholder rights within these structures. Say a legally-incorporated institution with actual shareholders dishes out an uncapped amount of tokens promising a share of revenues or dividends via the ICO process. Do shareholders’ rights to those revenue/dividends trump rights of the token holders? And if so, how does that square with the way risk is distributed through these systems? As Unseth notes, more often than not, it’s the token holders taking the bulk of the early concept risk, yet the inferiority of their ranking relative to shareholders kind of sees the latter receiving a free lunch. When it comes to prospective banks, that’s also a significant bastardisation of the risk/return ethos which is supposed to keep moral hazard in check. Moreover, concepts like return on equity, trust and capital tiering mean everything in banking. On that note, it’s hard to imagine how the Basel framework would apply to a challenger bank which boasts this sort of ambiguous liability. Even Haudenschild acknowledges: “It seems like you could sneeze twice on a piece of paper and launch an ICO and get a couple of million for it the way tokens are going now.” At the same time he suggests the easy-come, easy-go environment possibly justifies this. After all, many investors in this space acquired their wealth through rampant bitcoin speculation, not by actually going out to work for it. In that sense, perhaps there is some poetic justice in their wealth being tapped up opportunistically by even higher-risk ventures? The only problem with that justification is that ICOs are increasingly luring investors from outside of the bitcoin ‘easy-come/easy-go’ wealth pool, prompting them to buy bitcoin or ether with hard-earned money for the sole purpose of making these investments. It should be stressed that Haudenschild believes the group behind Polybius — while potentially inexperienced and overly ambitious — is sincere. Even so, the flawed incentives at the heart of these ICO-funded ventures cannot be ignored, not least because they make the flawed incentives at the heart of minimum viable product ventures look benign in comparison. To wit, one of the historian Polybius’s most important observations about cyclical (political) repetition’s connection to the factors that turn ordered democracy into mob rule and anarchy. In his opinion, these were the corrupt incentives which plagued generations which had come to forget what previous generations had struggled to defend themselves from. From The Histories (our emphasis): … when a new generation arises and the democracy falls into the hands of the grandchildren of its founders, they have become so accustomed to freedom and equality that they no longer value them, and begin to aim at pre-eminence; and it is chiefly those of ample fortune who fall into this error. So when they begin to lust for power and cannot attain it through themselves or their own good qualities, they ruin their estates, tempting and corrupting the people in every possible way. And hence when by their foolish thirst for reputation they have created among the masses an appetite for gifts and the habit of receiving them, democracy in its turn is abolished and changes into a rule of force and violence. For the people, having grown accustomed to feed at the expense of others and to depend for their livelihood on the property of others, as soon as they find a leader who is enterprising but is excluded from the houses of office by his penury, institute the rule of violence; and now uniting their forces massacre, banish, and plunder, until they degenerate again into perfect savages and find once more a master and monarch. Seems appropriate for a market which is continuously regenerating middle men and autocratic leaders.

With 4,700 stores across the US and 90 per cent of Americans living within 10 miles of a Walmart outlet, “it just makes sense”, Marc Lore, who leads Walmart’s ecommerce operation, told reporters on the eve of its annual shareholders’ meeting on Thursday. The retailer, which employs 1.5m “associates” in its US stores, has been testing the system in three stores for about a month and has done “hundreds” of deliveries, with most arriving within a day. Walmart’s cut-throat battle with Amazon in shipping has already prompted it to test drones and other ways to deliver products faster, but the Bentonville-based retailer has focused on integrating its bricks-and-mortar business with Walmart.com and Jet.com, the ecommerce site Mr Lore founded. Amazon Prime customers in more than 5,000 US cities can already receive online orders within a day, and in some locations within a few hours. Walmart has overhauled its shipping system to compete, offering free two-day delivery for orders over $35 and in-store pick-up of groceries and other online orders. Walmart also announced plans on Thursday to ramp up the use of blockchain technology to “digitise food”. The company recently completed a trial with IBM, using the technology to track food across its supply chain to help prevent disease outbreaks and improve shelf life. The technology — an electronic ledger with records stored in “blocks” — allows Walmart to trace a package of sliced mango back to the South African farm it came from in two seconds, compared to a week under current systems, tests showed. Walmart said it was now talking to “big influential” food stakeholders and other large retailers to roll out the technology. “Our intentions are to scale it,” says Frank Yiannis, Walmart’s vice-president of food safety. The announcements, unveiled as thousands of Walmart workers from across the globe descended on its Arkansas headquarters for the company’s glitzy shareholder week, are part of a push by chief executive Doug McMillon to position Walmart for the future. Looking to brand itself as more of a tech group, Walmart has also introduced virtual reality for employee training and linked with car-sharing start-ups Uber and Lyft to deliver groceries. Despite the upbeat tone and characteristically roaring shareholder week crowds, executives warned on the grim state of the industry. “There has never been a more disruptive time in the history of retail. We know there is no going back,” Judith McKenna, chief operating officer for Walmart US, told an employee rally on Wednesday. Retailers across America are struggling to adapt to a massive shift in the way people shop, but Walmart has delivered brighter news in recent months. Its US online sales grew by 63 per cent in its most recent quarter, their fourth straight quarterly rise. While Walmart is the world’s largest retailer and made $486bn in revenues in its past fiscal year compared to Amazon’s $136bn, it is far behind in ecommerce. Amazon takes up a third of all US online purchases, and that figure is expected to grow to half by 2021, according to Needham \u0026 Co. Walmart says that its new delivery programme is voluntary but employees will be paid extra for home deliveries and can choose to make as few as one or two deliveries per day as they drive home from work. Walmart is the largest private employer in the US, and says that its employees earn on average $13.75 an hour. Activists and workers have targeted Walmart, saying it offers low wages and unpredictable hours.  Walmart has been on a buying spree to jolt its online sales and attract younger shoppers, buying Jet.com for $3.3bn last summer and niche websites including ModCloth, a women’s clothing seller, and Moosejaw, an outdoor gear site. Stock awards related to the Jet.com acquisition took Mr Lore’s pay for the latest fiscal year to $244m, compared to $22m for Mr McMillon. Walmart’s push to “digitise food” comes as food-price deflation has squeezed earnings across the industry, hitting rivals such as Kroger, and as new entrants such as Aldi, the German discount grocer, risk accelerating a price war. Walmart, one of America’s largest sellers of groceries, has gone on the offensive, cutting prices to preserve market share. Groceries make up 60 per cent of its sales, a marked change from when it started out as a general merchandise store.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Anna Nicolaou","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-06-01","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/ef1f5c56-aa6b-32be-a5fa-85ced4f0ab85","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F06%2F07003755%2FGLF.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Socialism with trolly characteristics","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Imagine a world where you weren’t allowed to own anything. You could say you owned that watch, or that refrigerator, or that house, or those shares in that mutual fund, but you wouldn’t actually have a claim to any of it. Because in this world, the government would force you to regularly pay tax based on what you think your stuff is worth. If you can’t afford this carrying cost, too bad. You would have to sell. If you tried to low-ball your estimate of what you think your stuff is worth, you would be forced to sell to anyone with a higher estimate. How would regular people expect to live in a world where ownership is impractical for anyone without ultra-high incomes? The whizzes who came up with this plan — the same dynamic duo who believe index funds are a violation of antitrust — think all the problems can be solved with some combination of, we kid you not, “blockchains”, the “Internet of Things”, and “the sharing economy”. In fact, they think “the system we propose is both complementary with and the logical extreme” of those three “trends in digital markets”. A few ultra-high-earners would own everything and rent it out to the rest of us plebs. And it would all be possible thanks to a dystopian alliance between a confiscatory government and pervasive surveillance technology. Yay! This isn’t how Eric Posner and E Glen Weyl think of their idea. According to them, “the existing system of private property interferes with allocative efficiency”. In their view, you shouldn’t be allowed to own anything unless your ownership creates more value than if anyone else in the world owned the same stuff. Their proposal “would change ordinary life in surprising and possibly discomfiting ways”, but the benefits would supposedly be worth these costs: England may have industrialized earlier than France and other countries because English law recognized a type of compulsory purchase, called enclosure. Roughly, enclosure allowed expropriation of large areas of land on the urban periphery for use in manufacturing, while no similar system of compulsory purchase existed in France. In modern times, mergers and takeovers of corporations represent a large share of aggregate economic activity, nearly half a trillion dollars each year—and yet they frequently fail because of bargaining impasses. Real estate development is also hampered because it requires the assembly of multiple plots of land whose owners hold out for high prices. The solution is a form of government expropriation. Comrades, to the barricades! There isn’t enough M\u0026A! So what exactly is it this dynamic duo wants to do? There would be a registry of all assets owned by individuals, which we henceforth refer to as the cadaster and anthropomorphize as the enforcer of all the rules of the system…We choose to view the cadaster itself as an agent because, as we discuss below, our system does not require any discretionary authority and could be implemented using, for example, an algorithm or a distributed/decentralized blockchain to avoid the possibility of the system being abused. As such we prefer to think of the system as either being itself the enforcement agent or as an impersonal agent of the broader community rather than vesting any power in central authorities who might abuse or manipulate it, given that our goal is precisely to circumvent the reliance of past systems on arbitrary centralized judicial discretion. Everyone would be required to list all their assets on this blockchain/cadaster, a practice that would become increasingly easy to enforce as internet-connected sensors get embedded into everything from toasters to “smart” homes. Posner and Weyl would also want to track all “methods of electronic payment, so that her purchases would automatically be added to the cadaster, at which point she would be asked to assign a value to them”. Each year, owners would be required to pay a tax ranging of around 5-10 per cent of the value you attribute to your stuff, although it depends on their judgment of each asset’s liquidity and your willingness to invest in improving it: Someone with the misfortune of owning a $300,000 home — roughly the median value of American houses sold recently — might have to pay as much as $30,000 each year in tax. The median household income in America is under $60,000. The majority of Americans who own homes tend to earn more than the sizable minority who don’t, but even so, this new tax could easily amount to more than a third of gross pay. Of course, the tax would cause property values to crater, so the income burden would be high, but not quite as high: If a tax of 10% reduced asset values by two thirds, the tax would be 10% of one third of the original value. In other words, the fraction of current values the owner would pay each year would only be a little more than 3%. This is higher, but not dramatically higher, than current property taxes, which already may have the effects of driving illiquid owners out of their homes (since the wealth they could otherwise use to pay property taxes are locked up in their houses). It’s unclear from the paper how the tens of millions of Americans who would suddenly be pushed into negative net worth would deal with all this, although defaulting en masse would be one option. Those with positive net worth but insufficient income to afford the tax would sell to those who could, and rent from them: Ownership is shared between the “public” or “society” and the possessor. People are not so much owners of property as “lessees” from society, subject to a special kind of lease that terminates when a higher-value user appears, whereupon the property is automatically transferred to that user. (Generously, Posner and Weyl think “keepsakes and heirlooms” should be taxed at low rates, although still greater than zero.) Prospective buyers of everything from real estate to cars to appliances would simply pull up mapping software, draw an area, and be shown the location and listed price of every item and immediately buy it. Or “a buyer in the proximity of any object could easily determine its value using an IoT connection between the object and the cadaster app on her smartphone, make an electronic payment, and walk away with it”. Of course, no weird utopian/dystopian proposal to abolish private property with the help of technology would be complete without “smart contracts”: The goal is to avoid allowing discretionary power that is potentially subject to abuse to lie with any central authority. Because our proposal operates through simple rules that could be administered in an automated way, with taxes that are collected being automatically redistributed in a pre-specified manner to participants, it opens perhaps for the first time the possibility of truly decentralized “common ownership” that does not require any discretionary state authority to administer. It is because of this possibility that we anthropomorphized the “cadaster” itself throughout this paper; it may in the not too distant future be possible to administer a system like that the one we describe with very little centralized human oversight. Towards the end of their paper, Posner and Weyl dismiss critics who worry about our species’s tendency towards sentimental attachments to physical objects: We do not believe that such attachments are very common, and, more important, we suspect that such attachments will become less common in a world in which most property is not “owned” in the traditional sense. Many people love their cars, but fewer such attachments come into existence when more and more people rely on Uber, Lyft, Zipcar, and public transportation, and this process would be accelerated under Harberger taxation, where a kind of Zipcar model would become the norm rather than exception. People can be train enthusiasts without owning trains. Oh, thanks. Posner and Weyl conclude by speculating how their system could improve torts. In their formulation, we would all place some value on our quality of life and pay an annual tax on that estimated value. If we succeeded in suing someone for harming us, we would get paid damages according that estimate. This system would supposedly be an improvement because it would obviate the need for “juries and benefit-cost analysis based on econometric estimates of the statistical value of life”. Of course, it would also be ripe for abuse, since many people would have a hard time coming up with a fair value of what their life is worth, and even if they did, only those with the highest incomes could afford to sustain that “valuation”. Furthermore, imagine how the system would colour your every interaction. You’d find it hard to disagree with someone richer than you, even over something petty, because you’d know that that person could legally take your belongings just to spite you. The power granted to the rich would be immense. You would have to treat all richer people as if they were your feudal lords — because, in this society, that is effectively what they would be. A purer variant of plutocracy is hard to imagine. We sincerely hope this is highbrow satire of the law and economics literature. If so, it’s excellent. If the proposal is serious, it’s about as sensible as the desire to ban index funds. It would also have a similar effect of transferring wealth from the middle-class to the ultra-rich.

The dispute underlines how growing interest in the potential of blockchain technology, a shared database system that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, has raised the stakes in the race to become the leading player in the nascent industry. The dispute burst into public view on Friday when R3 filed a complaint, alleging that Ripple’s chief executive had tried to terminate the options granted to R3 last year after they surged in value because of a rise in Ripple’s XRP cryptocurrency. R3 said in the complaint that it had been granted an option to purchase 5bn XRP at an exercise price of 0.85 cents in September 2016. At the time, XRP was worth less than the option price. But since then, as the price of many cryptocurrencies has shot up, XRP has surged above 21 cents, valuing the options at more than $1bn. Ripple responded by filing a lawsuit a few hours later against R3, accusing it of “misleading Ripple to enter into multiple contracts, and then breaching those contracts after they were signed”. Its complaint said: “Almost immediately after the agreements were signed, R3 disappeared as a partner.” The California-based company said that the options it granted to R3 were designed to “incentivise” it to work on a “technology partner agreement”. But it added that “R3 failed to take any steps to perform remaining obligations under the TPA, and instead focused all its attention on fundraising”. It added that, after the exit from R3’s consortium of several large banks, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Banco Santander, its “reduced status in the banking world greatly decreased the value proposition of Ripple’s partnering with R3”. R3 said an emailed statement in response to Ripple’s lawsuit that it “does not discuss the details of ongoing litigation” and added: “We are confident in our position and hope for a speedy resolution of this matter.” In its lawsuit, R3 said: “The option contract does not give Ripple the right to unilaterally terminate the option contract. Nevertheless, Ripple has unambiguously and unequivocally declared that it will not fulfil its obligations under the option contract.” R3 said that it believed Ripple held 60bn of the 100bn of XRP that it has stated will be the maximum amount of the cryptocurrency it will issue. Earlier this year, R3 raised $107m from more than 40 of the world’s biggest banks to fund the development of its Corda blockchain, or distributed ledger, system that it hopes will become the industry standard. Ripple is suing R3 in a San Francisco court on five counts: fraudulent misrepresentation; fraudulent concealment; negligent misrepresentation; breach of contract; and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. R3 is suing Ripple and XRP in Delaware for breach of contract and request for specific performance and it is suing Ripple on a separate count of tortious interference with contract.

Speaking on stage on Tuesday morning at Consensus, a bitcoin-themed conference in New York, Ms Johnson noted that Fidelity has made venture investments in a handful of bitcoin-linked businesses, while partnering with various academic initiatives to explore possible usages of blockchain, the electronic ledger originally built to underpin bitcoin markets. “I am in a traditional financial services business — but we at Fidelity can see that the evolution of technology is setting our industry up for disruption,” she said. “What if this technology could do for the transfer of value, what the internet did for the transfer of information?” Ms Johnson noted that Fidelity has also set up a bank of computers built by 21 Inc that can crunch complex algorithms to be rewarded with bitcoin. “My . . . computer has mined over 200,000 satoshis,” she said, using the name for the smallest unit of bitcoin. One satoshi — named after Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of the crypto currency — is equal to one hundred millionth of a bitcoin. “I love this stuff . . . and what the future holds,” said Ms Johnson. “I’d like to think that huge new markets and products will be built on these open platforms.” We at Fidelity can see that the evolution of technology is setting our industry up for disruption The remarks underscore the desire of traditional financial services groups such as Fidelity not to get left behind, as digital currencies begin to affect the way Wall Street does business. Promoters say that adoption of blockchain-style technologies will lead to cheaper, more secure ways of settling all kinds of transactions. Regulators, however, continue to view bitcoin and other alt-currencies with suspicion, fearing that it has become the currency of choice for cyber criminals. In March, the US Securities and Exchange Commission said it would not allow Bats Global Markets to list shares of a bitcoin exchange traded fund due to concerns that “significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated”. Ms Johnson, chief executive of Fidelity since 2014, assumed full control of the company late last year when her 86-year-old father, Edward “Ned” Johnson III, said he would retire after nearly six decades with the company, latterly as chairman.  The 71-year-old company holds about $2.2tn in managed assets, and handles the retirement and savings plans of approximately 26m people and 23,000 companies. The Consensus event, hosted by Coindesk, a publishing group, comes as the price of bitcoin has rocketed to a record high, changing hands on Monday at over $2,110. Bitcoin is up about 135 per cent against the US dollar this year, making it easily the world’s best-performing currency. The nearest rivals are the Icelandic krona (up 16 per cent), the Mexican peso and the Polish zloty (both up 13 per cent). Ms Johnson noted that so far, fewer than 100 Fidelity employees had used the alt-currency option in the cafeteria at headquarters. “I guess we have a lot of hodlers,” she said, using the slang for bitcoin users who avoid selling the currency when it jumps in value.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ben McLannahan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-05-23","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/3084f066-3f9e-11e7-82b6-896b95f30f58","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Ffdf0458a-3fb4-11e7-9d56-25f963e998b2?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain consortium raises record $100m","INTRO":"Seven-month effort marked by tensions among banks assessing which projects to back","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A consortium of banks looking to build blockchains for modern finance has completed the largest fundraising to date for the emerging technology, raising more than $100m from about half its membership as well as technology group Intel. R3, the New York group, said on Tuesday it had secured $107m to develop a blockchain platform from 43 financial institutions, as well as Temasek, the Singaporean state investment company, and Intel Capital, the US tech group’s venture capital arm. The technology — an electronic ledger with records stored in “blocks” — aims to automate the complex networks of trust and verification on which modern finance sits, potentially cutting tens of billions of dollars of costs from the financial sector. But the seven-month fundraising has been marked by tensions among big banks assessing which blockchain projects they should back, as the two-year-old consortium’s membership swelled from an original nine to more than 80. Some early members, such as Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley balked at being asked to invest and are planning to withdraw from the venture. Some have backed rival blockchain projects such as Digital Asset Holdings and Axoni. However, many others, including Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, UBS and HSBC participated in the fundraising. The capital raising took place in three stages, with the first two open to members of the R3 consortium only, plus a dispensation for Intel to participate. A final tranche, also open to non-members, will begin this year. Although R3 did not put a figure on it, a person involved in the financing said it would be around $50m. The R3 capital raising comes as rival operators prepare to test their own blockchains on the critical record keeping in the foreign exchange, equity and credit derivatives markets. Although best known for links with bitcoin assets, banks are exploring blockchain use as a way to cut costly back office systems, unify their disparate data platforms and meet tougher regulatory demands on trade reporting and customers’ portfolio valuations. But many have found the blockchain technology difficult to put into practice and are turning increasingly to independent infrastructure operators, many of which already maintain the plumbing behind billions of dollars of deals. R3 plans to use the funds to hire more software engineers to help develop Corda, its own blockchain platform. “This investment is unprecedented,” said David Rutter, chief executive of R3 and a former executive at ICAP, the interdealer broker. “Many of the world’s largest financial firms have come together not just with capital support, but with a robust commitment to work with R3. We’ve got unparalleled momentum.” R3 has grown to a staff of more than 100 people and describes itself as the “de facto centre of gravity” for blockchain technology in the wholesale financial markets.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-05-23","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/9f2aefd4-3ec2-11e7-82b6-896b95f30f58","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fd098a4d0-3f5d-11e7-82b6-896b95f30f58?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"UK’s Nex Group to unveil overhaul of post-trade unit","INTRO":"Shift to cloud computing aims to boost profitability and spur blockchain take-up","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Nex Group will on Tuesday detail its year-long project to restructure its post-trading division, in a move designed to boost corporate profitability and bolster the use of blockchain technology to record deals. The UK trading and market infrastructure group is using cloud computing to store more of the thousands of digital records it processes for brokers, banks, hedge funds and asset managers. Its switch to putting critical customer data such as trades on remote computer servers highlights a fundamental switch among financial institutions as they face rising IT costs and tougher regulatory requirements. After years of spending to maintain their own records, banks such as JPMorgan as well as regulators like the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority and US’s Finra are now willing to outsource the upkeep of sensitive data. The project’s future will be closely watched by investors because the post-trade unit is one of the pillars of the new Nex Group, formerly part of ICAP. It also incorporates some of the market’s biggest back-office processes: its Traiana unit is a messaging hub for $2tn of forex, fixed income and swaps deals every day. The post-trade unit has a target of 40 per cent operating margins within three years, but last week’s full-year earnings showed margins slipping 7 percentage points to 29 per cent. That was in part down to two small lossmaking data acquisitions, Enso and Abide Financial. Keeping a remote record of trading information, via Amazon, will allow users to begin tests on foreign exchange and equities deals on blockchain technology from July, the group said. The record would serve as a “genesis block” that customers could then use to reconcile and confirm a transaction before sending it to regulators, clearing houses or other financial institutions. The new platform, known as NEX Infinity, was spearheaded by Jenny Knott, head of Nex’s post-trade business, who joined from South Africa’s Standard Bank in 2015. Ms Knott said the goal was to do away with vast amounts of duplication of Nex’s own IT systems. “What matters is the data and turning it into a digital record that could be stored in a distributed ledger, or existing systems,” said Ms Knott. “The people who see this workflow as really important are the buyside,” she said. Foreign exchange would be a natural test case, Ms Knott said, but added that equities “is proving to the clients that this is not just a one-trick pony”. Nex’s overhaul comes as new rivals such as Cobalt are also exploring ways to put more of the foreign exchange market infrastructure on the blockchain. The costs at Nex’s post-trade division crimped group profits and the company expects most of the £25m in cost savings by 2020 it has targeted to come from the unit. Arnaud Giblat, an analyst at Exane, noted that new rules such as trade reporting could boost margins at a time when growth in its main profit drivers has slowed in recent years.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-05-23","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f0c4e076-34c6-11e7-99bd-13beb0903fa3","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F30436858-359e-11e7-99bd-13beb0903fa3?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Cobalt attracts top currency traders to blockchain service","INTRO":"Market makers Citadel Securities and XTX join UK start-up platform","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A UK start-up trying to put the plumbing of the vast foreign exchange market on the blockchain has secured two of the world’s biggest traders, Citadel Securities and XTX Markets, to its fledgling service. The two market makers are the latest of 22 banks and traders in advance testing of a system run by London-based Cobalt, a financial technology company that aims to modernise the base of the global currency market, where $5tn a day of cash and derivatives deals change hands. Their involvement raises the stakes in a race among infrastructure providers to become the dominant force as blockchain technology — an electronic ledger with records stored in “blocks” — moves into the daily operations of global markets. Proponents see blockchain as a way to apply 21st century technology to the complex networks of trust and verification on which modern finance sits. Banks and traders hope a more efficient system can cut IT costs and improve the audit trail in a highly fragmented market. Most of it is also off-exchange, with deals transacted between big banks. Banks can spend about $500m a year on technology for currency trading, and Cobalt, founded by former traders, estimates it can cut costs by about 80 per cent. Citadel Securities is the market-making arm of the US hedge fund while UK-based XTX, with just 74 employees, has elbowed its way into the top 10 biggest currencies traders by market share in the two years since it was founded. “What we are particularly pleased about is that these guys know technology. It’s a big part of their business.” said Adrian Patten, chairman of Cobalt. “They’ve been testing for months and are prepared to support us in improving the market infrastructure. It’s important to them to have cost-effective infrastructure as the cheaper those costs, the more aggressive you can be on your pricing.” Cobalt’s system is expected to go live in the third quarter. It is running on technology developed by Setl, a UK blockchain software developer, and has data from First Derivatives, a Northern Ireland company that is also an investor. Citigroup, with the biggest share of the global FX market, has also invested in the project and will use it. The Cobalt platform will be among the first commercial systems employing blockchain in financial markets. NEX is also developing a blockchain for spot foreign exchange transactions on to a blockchain. It will announce further plans in coming weeks. Cobalt said it could link up with other emerging blockchain developers, such as NEX, Digital Asset Holdings and R3’s Corda. Kevin Kimmel, global head of eFX at Citadel Securities, said Cobalt’s platform was “an important step in enhancing FX market efficiency, particularly around credit and clearing”. Cobalt is headed by Andy Coyne, a former Citi and Deutsche Bank trader, and executive at ICAP. Mr Patten, the Cobalt chairman, founded forex brokerage Mako FX. “We started off with a problem we were looking to solve. We came into this as blockchain sceptics,” he said. Cobalt will also open an office in the US, which will be headed by Devika Darbari, who joins as chief operating officer from JDX Consulting.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-05-11","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/c82acb92-407b-11e7-9d56-25f963e998b2","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F0fcf7cf8-3fb5-11e7-9d56-25f963e998b2?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Initial coin offerings risk damaging your financial health","INTRO":"As the total value of bitcoins soars to $91bn, the hype surrounding ICOs is going into overdrive","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Would you invest in a token that promises you absolutely nothing in return? Not even your money back? If the answer’s no, beware, you may be publicly berated as a fool by one of the most sophisticated hype machines to hit markets in a long time. Shrewd investing, according to the spin, is all about getting early into exotic new bearer instruments being issued in growing volume on public blockchains such as Ethereum or alternatively as independent blockchain tokens in their own right in a process known as an “initial coin offering”. Blockchains are the decentralised settlement technology which powers the issuance of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin — the value of which has soared to over $2,400 this week. The overall coin market has nearly doubled in value in two weeks and now exceeds $91bn, more than the market cap of Goldman Sachs. What the tokens actually constitute, however, is harder to determine. The terms and conditions go to pains to stress the tokens, which are always limited in number, do not “involve the purchase of shares or any equivalent in any existing or future public or private company, corporation or other entity in any jurisdiction.” A simplistic interpretation suggests they’re charitable fundraisings in crypto currency such as bitcoin or ether for ventures which in turn promise to spend the proceeds on digital service development. You the investor allegedly have an interest in investing because you many benefit from the service that’s being brought to market. Many of these services are decentralised solutions for things such as cloud storage, market places or prediction markets. Others seek to issue pre-pay cards which promise to both liquefy your crypto currency holdings and give you access to the Visa or MasterCard network at the same time. In many cases the services facilitate dark market commerce and trade by decentralising it, or giving those who draw value from it in crypto currency easier access to the official settlement network. In some other cases the tokens entitle holders to a share of revenue of the ventures. But really the greatest value of the tokens seems to be in their speculative potential and the opportunity to cash them out at a premium at any of the crypto currency world’s many secondary market exchanges. Traders say the more likely a prominent exchange is to list a coin for conversion, the greater the chances it will do well after issuance. All agree that the rush to get in on the pipeline of new offerings is one of the key drivers propelling the price of bitcoin higher given the ICOs only raise funds in bitcoin or other forms of crypto currency (which themselves can only be purchased with bitcoin). Despite the legal ambiguities and risk factors, the burgeoning market is increasingly catching the attention of more conventional institutional investors such as hedge funds and asset managers. Whether any of these have the capacity to really understand what they’re getting themselves into, however, is the most pressing regulatory question. One potential confusion relates to terminology. Ethereum — the decentralised blockchain upon which many of these ICOs are being issued — is entirely different to the Ethereum protocol which many conventional banks are experimenting with to run their own private blockchains. The latter association, however, may be having a legitimisation effect. The other more striking concern is whether conventional investors have the skill set to review these contracts properly, many of which force investors to waive lawsuit or arbitration rights. Moreover they stress the user must have a deep understanding of the “functionality, usage, storage, transmission mechanisms and intricacies associated with cryptographic tokens and blockchain-backed software systems”. It’s not just that you need to know how to code to understand whether the codebase you’re funding is going to behave as promoted, it’s that you must understand blockchain code in particular. According to my knowledgeable sources there are only a few hundred people in the world with such skills. In the spirit of selling shovels to prospectors in any good gold rush, however, there are already a growing number of outfits promising specialist consulting and advisory services on all aspects of ICOs to both investors and potential issuers. izabellla.kaminska@ft.com No surprise bitcoin boomed at a time of QE / From Mark Boulton, Winkfield, Berks, UK","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Izabella Kaminska","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-05-25","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/26d64830-f691-3abd-98cd-a66700212f24","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F05%2F09114028%2FBitcoin-1.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Who’s banking whom in cryptoland?","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"On Monday, we brought you the story of TokenCard, the Ethereum-based venture set to revolutionise the world of payments by bringing crypto folk the, errr, power of the Visa network. Yes, you’re wondering, what’s so special about that? Doesn’t every above-board payment facilitator offer Visa access? You’re right. They do. And a card processed by Visa is hardly a breakthrough innovation worth shouting about here in the real world. But, you see, while access to the Visa network is taken as a given by us compliant statists, in crypto land it’s a rarity. Here users sit locked into paper profits that are very hard to liquidate in day-to-day convenient “spending” circumstances. The holy grail in cryptoland has thus for a long time been turning these coins into usable currency, the sort that doesn’t suffer the associated headache of exchange fees, liquidity constraints or price variation. Don’t take it from us that that’s the case, take it from TokenCard’s own white paper which ironically spells out everything that’s wrong with the crypto space as it stands today (due mostly to the fact that it’s not a banking system and doesn’t have access to the banking system): 1. Security, storing assets is cumbersome and inevitably people choose to store their assets under a third party’s control, like an exchange. This defeats one of the greatest properties of cryptocurrency, and exposes them to risks that have consistently proven to be catastrophic. A system is needed that can securely store assets without compromise on usability.* 2. Usability, numerous steps are often involved in seeing real use of ones digital assets. A user needs wallets, exchanges and accounts on various services. They are required to withdraw, deposit, do KYC and even become amateur traders. A system is needed that eliminates these steps, and offers a seamless plug-and-play experience for the uninitiated that can be integrated across platforms.** 3. Volatility, forcing people to use a volatile asset like Bitcoin is a no-go. The people have spoken, and it deters more than it attracts leaving only a risk-taking fringe. A stable, more diverse asset class is needed. For some strange reason — who knows why — the regulated sector is reluctant to open its door to this amazing source of (impossible-to-verify from an origination point of view) funds. But cryptoland is full of innovators, as we well know. Their solution to the problem thus far has been the creation of Visa and Mastercard-enabled prepaid cards (the sort usually issued to the unbanked or impossible to credit check). Problem solved, eh? Well, not quite. What’s actively under promoted in the related marketing is that these prepaid cards operate exclusively in fiat currency. They do not magically liquidize crypto holdings or allow you to spend bitcoin. To the contrary, users are first required to exchange their crypto funds for regular currency at prevailing market rates and use this as a source of revenue to top their prepaid balances up. The innovation, if any, is that the cards allow those handling the crypto exchange to transfer the fiat proceeds into something other than a standard bank account, namely a non-bank client account which still has access to the payments networks of the real world. The businesses offering these cards often claim that all this can be achieved in an instant and low-cost manner, equivalent to the real-time processing of crypto payments as and when they’re spent in the real world. That may well be the case. But if it is, it’s only because these businesses themselves are bearing the exchange and liquidity risk on the Crypto/FX component of the trade. Nor does it change the fact that what’s really facilitating the service isn’t the crypto business itself, but rather the third-party agent which has the e-money license and the Visa access relationship. That third party, however, will always be subject to Visa’s own terms of service. In the case of prepaid cards, those terms can be pretty draconian with respect to their limitations — especially from a source of funds perspective. For example, there may be requirements that only proceeds originating from employers to employees qualify for such transfers. Accordingly, the third parties in question will be held accountable if ever such conditions are taken out of context or breached. Indeed, chances are if they want to retain their good relationship with network providers, they will err on the side of caution — and on the side of friction — when doing their checks. * A system commonly known as a regulated banking system per chance? ** Another system commonly known as a regulated banking system per chance?

Mr Guo scanned WeChat groups, attended forums in Shanghai and exchanged ideas with others who shared his interest. He read white papers and other documents from dozens of issuers and eliminated those he thought would be vulnerable to manipulation or whose technology was particularly iffy before he selected a few to invest in. Then earlier this week, after an unexpectedly tough regulatory clampdown in China, Mr Guo received an inquiry from one of the ICOs he had selected. The founder was shutting down on the mainland and was offering him two choices. He could have his money back or hang on until the entrepreneur re-launched the offer from another jurisdiction. “Initial coin offers have a lot of support from tech people who believe it is the future,” Mr Guo said. Well known international investors such as Sequoia Capital China and local private equity firms have invested. At the same time though, he warned, many of the ICOs are “flawed . . . get-rich-quick schemes, not serious projects. Many of the founders collect the money and then invest in other ICOs.” The debate about virtual cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology behind them is, in many ways, the ultimate tug of war. It pits powerful vested interests of the financial world — including governments and the big state-owned banks such as Industrial \u0026 Commercial Bank of China — against those who are seeking to use technology to challenge them. That debate and a continuing cat-and-mouse game between regulators and the financial markets has merged with a more general effort from Beijing to stamp out all kinds of financial risks. These include excess corporate debt, speculative wealth management products and bad loans in the banking system. Regulators have put special emphasis on stemming capital flight at a time when one of the big drivers of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency trading is people seeking ways to move their money out of China. For people who combine a distrust of government with an equal distrust of gold, bitcoin is a preferable alternative to state-backed currencies. It is hardly surprising then that China, where speculation and betting have always been national sports, is embracing ICOs and virtual currencies with ardour, particularly given the country’s tight capital controls on physical currency. More than 100,000 mainland investors spent $385m on virtual currencies through ICOs in first half of this year, a government-backed study found, according to Caixin Global. “The problem here is that people are so extreme,” said the founder of one merchant bank that specialises in technology deals. “There is no pacing. They want to take 100 steps in one go.” China this week halted new ICO offerings — in a statement seven regulatory agencies called them “essentially a form of unapproved illegal public financing behaviour”. Hong Kong followed up with an announcement that ICOs would be treated as a regulated activity. Regulators seem aware of the two faces of financial innovation in China. While they see cryptocurrencies as a problem, the blockchain technology has the potential to make industries from finance to shipping more efficient. That is why even retired mainland regulators are taking part in some of the non-profits that have been established to understand these trends. The growth of bitcoin comes at a time when other technology-based finance — specifically the growth of e-payments from the likes of Alipay and Tenpay — is already posing challenges to the Chinese central bank. It is having a harder time controlling or even understanding money supply these days. That makes it “more challenging for the central bank to predict and stabilise liquidity and leverage,” said a recent report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “The rapid rise of e-payment (with 500m users) requires financial regulatory upgrades to catch up with the cashless trend.” There will be bigger challenges to come. But the lead up to the 19th Party Congress next month is no time to expect tolerance for more financial experimentation in China. henny.sender@ft.com","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Henny Sender","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-05","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/1637ac8b-c310-3172-96ab-72020a05c6f2","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F05%2F08163652%2FScreen-Shot-2017-05-08-at-16.36.16.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Introducing truly outlandish ICO claims, TokenCard edition","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Last week, an initial coin offering (ICO) for something* called TokenCard raised** $16.7m in “mere minutes”, according to the PR spin embedded in the emailed correspondence to this reporter following the event. It was brought to market by an outfit called Monolith Studio, which until recently had offered sparse information about who was behind it, apart from a loose connection to Peter Vessenes, bitcoin investor and founder of something called “New Alchemy” (no less). As is increasingly common in the promotion of these launches, a proposal pitching exclusive details ahead of the offering was made to the press. This, from April 19, being an example from our own inbox (with Monolith calling itself Monolith Ventures): Details revealed over the next few weeks showed the project was the brainchild Mel Gelderman and another chap called David Hoggard. Their respective Linkedin bios were either exceptionally thin on the ground or non-existent. The pitch itself was pretty forthright (please note the emphasis): Tomorrow, Monolith Ventures will open the ICO for TokenCard, the first debit card powered by smart contracts. When the card launches, holders will be able to use it anywhere that accepts VISA. And the promotional blitz disseminated after the launch on May 4 reiterated the key points: Monolith Studio’s TokenCard closed its token launch Tuesday, May 2, 2017, after exceeding its crowdsale goal in mere minutes. TokenCard is the first debit card powered by smart contracts incorporating the VISA payments network with Ethereum. It immediately gained attention in the Ethereum community after its announcement and quickly reached and surpassed contribution goals for this one-of-a-kind project. For the first time, token holders will be able to use Ether as well as other ERC20 tokens to purchase items anywhere that accepts VISA debit cards. Suffice to say, the above made a lot of TokenCard’s access to Visa’s payment networks — if not leveraging Visa’s brand rather explicitly for its own purposes. You’d think Visa — had it truly decided to associate itself with or back a crypto venture this explicitly — would have also communicated the unprecedented cooperation. It didn’t. To the contrary, a spokesman from Visa Europe told us on Friday that: At this point I’m unable to establish any business relationship between Visa and this company. Our lawyers are looking into this and I will come back to you if I have any further insight. The accompanying promotional graphics for TokenCard have since gone from this: …to this: Nor does the TokenCard website any longer make any reference to Visa. Despite, courtesy of Wayback Machine, having said this up until May 4 (note the highlight): Oops! We’ve contacted TokenCard’s representatives for comment and will certainly let you know how they explain the intriguing pivot. * This echoes the spirit of digital autonomous organisations. ** Sums raised are in cryptocurrency — in this case Ether — and marked-to-market for the dollar valuation.

That’s from David Kynaston’s City of London: The History. It refers to the railway mania of the 1840s, an investment bubble that collapsed in 1846 after a corn drought forced the Bank of England to raise rates. The hike put an abrupt end to the preceding period of excessively cheap money, which eventually meant more than a third of the railways the government authorised were never built. According to Wikipedia: …the companies either collapsed due to poor financial planning, were bought out by larger competitors before they could build their line, or turned out to be fraudulent enterprises to channel investors’ money into other businesses. A related factoid from Kynaston is that by the peak of the frenzy hardly any resources were needed to set up a railway firm venture: “A solicitor or two, a civil engineer, a Parliamentary agent, possibly a contractor, a map of England, a pair of compasses, a pencil, and a ruler, were all that were requisite to commence the formation of a railway company.” The lawyers and contractors servicing the needs of the boom were in the end the ones to really profit from the mania. That was then, but what about now? Well, now we have the latest fad that has gripped the cryptocurrency community: the near-exponential rise of the initial coin offering, informally known as the “ICO”. Judging by this reporter’s inbox, ICOs are now propagating at an unprecedented rate, fuelled in part by the cheapness of setting up such systems and in part by the growing abundance of unmaterialised paper profits in the sector. To the casual observer’s eye, all that’s needed to make an ICO investment “a go” is a website, a white paper, a PR agent, and possibly a coder. The reward? Potentially unlimited access to a pool of similarly contrived liquidity already circulating through informal dark economy. The fact much of this funding — due to the growing complexity of cashing it into the official realm — lies trapped within a closed informal network does little to quash the appeal of the investment case. The rhetoric is also uncannily similar. Crypto offerings are not investment schemes based on vapourware: they’re opportunities to invest in the digital rails of the new decentralised financial system. Admittedly there is one notable difference between now and then: the glaring absence of staggers (also known as flippers). For now at least the majority of ICO investors tend to be — or are certainly being encouraged to be — buy-and-hold-forever investors, content with mark-to-market valuations for their riches. Whether the smart money is thinking the same is yet to be determined. What the dynamic undoubtedly does echo is what Keynes reflected upon in his 1919 opus Economic Consequences of the Peace in connection to the sort of investor temperament that drove the foundations of the industrial economy: The new rich of the nineteenth century were not brought up to large expenditures, and preferred the power which investment gave them to the pleasures of immediate consumption. In fact, it was precisely the inequality of the distribution of wealth which made possible those vast accumulations of fixed wealth and of capital improvements which distinguished that age from all others. Herein lay, in fact, the main justification of the Capitalist System. If the rich had spent their new wealth on their own enjoyments, the world would long ago have found such a régime intolerable. But like bees they saved and accumulated, not less to the advantage of the whole community because they themselves held narrower ends in prospect. With regards to railways specifically, his pointed reference to pyramids (ahem) is also worth noting: The immense accumulations of fixed capital which, to the great benefit of mankind, were built up during the half century before the war, could never have come about in a Society where wealth was divided equitably. The railways of the world, which that age built as a monument to posterity, were, not less than the Pyramids of Egypt, the work of labor which was not free to consume in immediate enjoyment the full equivalent of its efforts. Thus this remarkable system depended for its growth on a double bluff or deception. On the one hand the laboring classes accepted from ignorance or powerlessness, or were compelled, persuaded, or cajoled by custom, convention, authority, and the well-established order of Society into accepting, a situation in which they could call their own very little of the cake that they and Nature and the capitalists were co-operating to produce. And on the other hand the capitalist classes were allowed to call the best part of the cake theirs and were theoretically free to consume it, on the tacit underlying condition that they consumed very little of it in practice. The idea industrial progress was built on the pyramidal foundations of the fundamentally frugal certainly gives hope to the notion that the crypto phenomenon is about more than just Ponzi-style profiteering. The more sceptical mind, however, would argue that at least with railways something of a real problem was being resolved. Furthermore, its decentralised ambition was bounded in the physical limitations of centralised practicality. There were, after all, only so many railways that could compete on servicing the same route, and only so long until the efficiency of a centralised approach became self evident. Whether the same realisation will ever penetrate the crypto-blockchain sector, however, is another matter entirely. Decentralisation (not rail building) is the investment fad’s de facto raison d’être. Accordingly, if a centralised or oligopolistic approach to the new virtual system was ever deemed preferable from a cost, efficiency and user experience perspective, we’d only be back at square one. What’s more, unlike the railway investment boom, which at least allowed surviving parties to inherent potentially useful legacy track, what we’ve got here in the best case scenario is the handover of claims, upon claims, upon claims, upon… illegitimate claims — anchored as most of them are in the economic profits of the dark economy, which are not supposed to be recognisable due to their value destroying nature.

The feeling among many critics is that corporations are exploiting the classification simply to save money by not providing the rights and benefits that come with traditional employment. This is contributing to a major power shift in the social contract that was hammered out during decades of strife between labour and capital, they say. But there is another thing possibly being missed in the debate as it stands. It relates to the role cash management plays in the gig economy. Take the taxi market in the UK as an example. Companies such as Uber like to claim they’re busting open an uncompetitive licensed taxi cartel, which operates against the interests of consumers. But in the case of the UK market, this is a slightly disingenuous claim. Black cabs have always been forced to compete with private hire and mini-cab rivals. So, one might ask, why is competition from Uber deemed intolerable from a labour and incumbent perspective but not from the private hire or mini-cab market? Two factors arguably dominate. The first, and most written about, relates to Uber’s scale and capital advantage. Unlike local mini cab firms or even relatively centralised players like Addison Lee, Uber’s well funded status alongside its immense scale means it can undercut incumbent players with below-cost pricing. Small local players simply wouldn’t be able to carry on loss-making operations for years in the same way, and hence can’t compete. The second, and possibly less recognised factor, relates to the power shift associated with using a centralised dispatcher for self-employed operations. That dispatcher (Uber, in this case) also happens to be a cash manager, which is important. Indeed, one of the reasons black cabs have historically been so reluctant to take debit or credit cards (aside from the entirely separate issue of tax evasion) links to the additional cost of processing digital transactions as a small business operator. Cash has no processing charge, thus cash offers a better margin in almost all cases. In the mini cab world, meanwhile, the margins are even thinner meaning the incentive to take cash is even greater. Private hire firms, of course — by linking services to repeat accounts — have historically been able to compete on this front by billing/invoicing customers directly or by running corporate accounts that can be settled on a bundled-payment basis. Why money management matters In that latter situation drivers are, in most cases, still deemed self-employed workers. What differentiates them from Uber contractors, however, is that these centralised cash-managing providers tend to use the cashflow advantage to reduce capital costs for their contractors. They do this by investing in car fleets on a bulk basis (taking the capital and depreciation risk accordingly) and renting the vehicles to drivers on preferable terms to those found in the open market. The drivers also need not pay for the insurance, MOT and PHV checks, repairs or maintenance. When it comes to the self-employed sector that’s prepared to take on the full capital risk of owning a vehicle — namely the Uber and mini-cab sector — the real differentiator thus becomes cash management. The average mini-cab dispatcher, for example, has historically offered drivers two types of dispatching/marketing deals. The first is a fixed monthly fee for dispatching/marketing services, while the second is a percentage of earnings deal. The driver can take his pick based on how much work he thinks he is likely to do. The percentage deal is usually preferable for low frequency drivers. But herein lies the difference. Whatever deal a driver opts for, they retain control over the cash management process. It is the driver who collects the funds from the passenger directly. And it is the driver who is obliged to settle his obligation with the dispatcher on a secondary basis. The nature of the set-up ensures the driver represents a bonafide self-employed entity; one who is arguably purchasing marketing/dispatcher services from the intermediary not vice versa. In the Uber model (and many other gig economy platform models) the platform agencies are the ones who collect the cash first and then distribute it back (less fees) to drivers on a weekly basis. While many might deem this an innocuous difference, it isn’t really. The platforms gain a significant cash-flow advantage over the drivers as a consequence. The arrangement also entirely flips the power and credit risk distributions on their head. It is not the drivers, under the model, who are purchasing services from third-party dispatch platforms, it is by all logical means the platforms who are purchasing services from drivers. It is this structural difference which ensures the platforms have the power to intimidate drivers if and when they want to (by threatening to hold back earnings or by unilaterally imposing bigger fees with little to no notice). It happens also to be a framework which allows car providers/financiers to strike deals with drivers where they have senior claims over driver cashflows from Uber than drivers do. The credit factor From a credit perspective you’re turning a cashflow arrangement which benefits the driver first, then the lender and then the dispatcher, to one which benefits the dispatcher first, the lender (potentially) second and the driver absolutely last. Contrast that with the cash flow prioritisation model in a traditional corporate structure, where — in the event of an insolvency — salaries must be paid before other obligations. To wit, what would happen to the Uber model (and all its many derivatives) if workers demanded to be paid directly rather than on a weekly basis, or more pertinently still, on a gross rather than fee-subtracted basis? In the modern digital payments era, it’s hard to imagine why this cannot be arranged. And yet chances are, this would never happen precisely because the cash-flow and credit advantage provided to the platforms via the deferred payment structure is key to its attraction and sustainability. To that end, the RSA’s latest report on the gig economy is the first we’ve seen that hints of the employer/employee power shifts connected to the cash management structure. Annoyingly, it does so by referencing blockchain as a potential solution to the cash centralisation problem: It enables genuine peer-to-peer exchange by decentralising, or disintermediating, platforms; in other words, it eliminates the middleman, which happens to be the company behind a platform. Through a ‘trusted ledger’, blockchain-based platforms create a public record of transactions and facilitate direct payments between workers and their customers. No commission is taken as the platform is collaboratively managed. Nevertheless, the report should be commended for acknowledging blockchain technology has been suffering setbacks this past year and that there are significant limitations to its application in the gig-economy field. The biggest of these relates to the fact that intermediaries provide more than just payment services. An entirely decentralised solution would lose out on the provision of specialist services from marketing, ICT and administration, to flow-management, promotion, public relations and general trouble-shooting. As the RSA notes: There are lingering questions, for example, about how blockchain-based platforms would develop the wider infrastructure of support for users that other platforms have established thus far. They further warn that many of the network-effect advantages could be lost as well: With all of the examples of alternative models and any to come, it must be stressed that a co-operative model alone will not assure success — simply being co-operative does not mean that the platform is necessarily the most efficient for consumers. Even if workers stand to benefit, platforms must build and sustain a critical mass of users to thrive, which, admittedly, requires making choices about more than the welfare of workers. What the lack of a simple solution implies, of course, is that much of this was never value-creating innovation in the first place.

Blockchain is the electronic ledger originally built to underpin bitcoin markets. Promoters say it will lead to cheaper, more secure ways of settling all kinds of transactions, though it remains on the fringes of finance. Since November, Trafigura and Natixis, the French bank, have run blockchain simulations using the trader’s existing crude oil deals along Texas pipelines, according to Arnaud Stevens, New York head of global energy and commodities at Natixis. The technology could ease the cumbersome process of exchanging contracts, letters of credit, inspection and other paperwork by email or fax when one company sells oil to another. “By using blockchain, the goal is to streamline the workflow,” Mr Stevens said. The use of blockchain could also lessen the working capital traders need to cover the cost of oil in transit by cutting the amount of time it takes to execute deals, Mr Stevens said. The participants said the tests were the first test for blockchain in the US physical oil market. Another trading house, Swiss-based Mercuria, has used blockchain to sell African crude to China, Marco Dunand, chief executive, told Reuters in January. Christophe Salmon, Trafigura’s chief financial officer, said there would need to be widespread adoption by major oil traders and refiners to make blockchain in commodity trading viable in the long term. “We look forward to seeing the potential business benefits which could bring substantial efficiency and productivity gains to our finance operations, while increasing security,” Mr Salmon said.  The head of another leading commodity trader said banks offering trade finance would save substantially on costs by adopting distributed ledgers such as blockchain. It would also give them greater control of risk. But he questioned whether commodity traders would be able to make large savings. IBM hosted the test for Trafigura and Natixis. In commodities trading and financing, “there’s a lot of friction and a lot of manual effort involved. It’s error prone,” said James Wallis, a vice-president at the tech company. Mr Stevens acknowledged that a large network of traders was necessary to make blockchain work in the oil market. Natixis had begun to discuss the use of blockchain with Trafigura’s peers in the US as well as other commodity banks, he said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Gregory Meyer Neil Hume","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-03-27","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/2f6f5ba4-dc97-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fad6d8a5a-dcbd-11e6-86ac-f253db7791c6?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How finance is being taken over by tech","INTRO":"Bank margins to be boosted by labour-saving automation but long term challenges loom","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When the chairman of one of the world’s biggest banks was asked recently how technology would change finance, he pointed to the rise of Ant Financial, the digital payments arm of Alibaba, China’s ecommerce colossus. Ant Financial gained about 100m new clients last year, taking its total above 500m, almost 10 times the level of the world’s biggest banks. The veteran chairman — who was not willing to be quoted by name — noted that the Chinese group thereby acquired a “huge amount of data” and “a great ability to make credit decisions”. The tone of jealousy was hard to miss. Eric Jing, Ant Financial’s chief executive, is due on Thursday to speak alongside other big financial names at the World Economic Forum in Davos, a first-time appearance that illustrates how finance is being upended by digital disruption. It is a transformation, leading professionals attending Davos have told the Financial Times, that is likely to lead to widespread automation, a blur in the dividing line between finance and technology and, ultimately, widespread sectorial consolidation. Many expect hundreds of thousands of jobs to be lost and the likes of Ant Financial to make incursions on banks’ most valuable businesses, as the old financial order battles to survive. “I do think employment in finance will decrease and those people working in the industry will be doing very different kinds of jobs,” says Ralph Hamers, chief executive of ING, who in the last few months has announced plans to shed 7,000 of the Dutch bank’s 54,000 staff. Overall, as many as 1.7m jobs are expected to be lost as banks digitise operations over the next decade, Citigroup predicted recently. This focus on technology’s ability to replace human workers in the finance sector, much as robots have taken the place of factory workers for decades, is part of the backdrop to this year’s Davos, which meets amid a continuing international backlash against globalisation in the name of the left-behind. While last year the official agenda celebrated what the forum dubs “the fourth industrial revolution” — a fusion of technologies “disrupting almost every industry in every country” — this year enthusiasm for such advances is tempered with more discussion at the forum of their social cost. But, for banks dogged by low margins, automation and technology represent a long-desired chance to boost profitabilit, even if in the longer term they pose a near-existential threat to the banks’ old way of business. This is particularly significant for European banks, whose average return on equity is stuck in the low single digits, far below their 10 per cent-plus cost of capital. As a result, many institutions are racing to combine new technologies, including cloud computing, artificial intelligence and voice recognition, to help provide financial services. “Because of the computing power now available, we can have much more useful predictions on default rates than we do now, which will allow us to do pre-scoring of customers and make instant lending decisions, both for existing customers and those we don’t yet know,” says Mr Hamers. Automation should allow financial services groups to cut costs as a proportion of revenues by 15 percentage points, according to a study presented in Davos on Tuesday by Oliver Wyman, the consultants. Bankers predict they will get much better at crunching vast amounts of data to make immediate lending decisions and to provide far more tailored robo-advice to customers. They are also looking for big savings from blockchain, the shared database system that underpins the bitcoin cryptocurrency. Eight of the world’s 10 biggest investment banks are expected to use blockchain to cut 30 per cent of their costs — totalling $8bn-$12bn — according to a study published by Accenture and McLagan on Tuesday But as banking moves into such activities, the distinction between finance and technology will become less and less clear, presenting established financial institutions with formidable new competitors at a time when they are already under strain. “For the time being, the likes of Facebook and Google are on the fringes of banking because they don’t want to be regulated,” says Francisco González, chairman of Spain’s BBVA. “But sooner or later they will jump into our arena. They will try to take some parts of the value chain. That is the real challenge.” Banking in Europe is also expected to be transformed by new EU regulations that will force banks to provide third parties with access to the data of any customers who authorise it. This should make it much easier for banks to poach their rivals’ clients and to offer more products from rivals. But the regulatory change could also unleash competition for banks from fintech start-ups and big Silicon Valley technology groups. Oliver Wyman predicts many banks will be left as “component suppliers” — producing highly regulated financial services such as loans and savings accounts — while the valuable relationships with their customers are controlled by technology-focused groups acting as “platform providers” and “demand aggregators”. “The traditional boundaries of what industry I’m in are fading away,” says Ashok Vaswani, head of Barclays UK. “I’m always telling my team that if you aren’t eating someone else’s lunch, you are doing it wrong. We are technology companies with a balance sheet.” The technological upheaval will require heavy investment, which is why the final big prediction of the bankers is that there will be big consolidation among banks, particularly in the fragmented European sector. “What will the banking system look like in five years\u0027 time? There will be fewer players. Consolidation will be done by those who have mastered technology,” says Mr González. “If you don’t master technology you won’t survive.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-01-17","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/video/99aabc07-5762-386f-9cea-e70b32e0579f","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F93d992d2-7529-4137-bf5e-85f73625af49?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/2045611d-3ae5-3c19-8524-7f38b7d2f3f1","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F01%2FConverted_file_6f8df960.jpg?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain will free you from the tyranny of the global liberal elite","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Notwithstanding the corporate interest, blockchain reflects the spirit of the past year when disgruntled Britons rejected the European Union, Italians brought down their prime minister and Americans elected Trump. “A global and open blockchain … lends itself very well to current anti-establishment sentiment,” said Jon Matonis, an economist and founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation. “The general theme is removing the role of a third-party auditor or enforcement agency.” Just when you thought it wasn’t clear what Brexit actually means, it turns out Brexit means Blockchain.

The DTCC, a US post-trade services group that processes more than $1,500tn of securities a year, will use technology from IBM and US blockchain start-ups R3 and Axoni as the basis for its next-generation trade information warehouse. The unit settles payments in credit default swaps in multiple currencies. Work is expected to begin this month and go live in about a year’s time, the company announced on Monday. The decision marks a further advance into global markets by blockchain, a decentralised electronic ledger with records stored in “blocks”. The move — which the DTCC says will reduce operating costs — represents an acid test for the technology that will be closely watched by a banking sector looking to make cost savings in an era of low interest rates and tougher regulation. Many banks have tried to launch their own blockchain ventures but have struggled to make headway in an industry that has historically kept all information closely guarded to gain an advantage. Seven large banks including Barclays, Citi, JPMorgan, and UBS have provided guidance on the DTCC’s venture, as did IHS Markit and Intercontinental Exchange, the world’s largest credit data provider and CDS clearing house respectively. The widespread industry buy-in comes as financial institutions grapple to move beyond prototyping blockchain’s shared database technology — and apply it with the hope of automating back-office functions. Blockchain advocates say it could save banks billions of dollars, but many have so far struggled with the practicalities of scaling up the technology and wielding it within the norms of the sector. “These are critical tests to see if we can achieve the benefits that everyone believes exists through the digital ledger,” said Michael Bodson, president and chief executive of the DTCC. Introducing blockchain technology to a “fairly self-contained” post-trade market will help determine whether it can be applied “on a grander scale” across the finance sector, he said in an interview. The DTCC’s warehouse electronically captures information about trades — such as who traded what, with whom and at what price — for about 98 per cent of all credit derivative transactions globally, with a notional value of about $11tn. The system is also used for handling default payments on transactions and works in partnership with CLS Bank, the world’s largest FX settlement service. “As one of the largest and most groundbreaking distributed ledger projects to date in the financial services industry, DTCC together with its member banks are reimagining the credit derivatives process,” said Bridget Van Kralingen, senior vice-president at IBM Industry Platforms, the unit that focuses on blockchain technology. Mr Bodson said the new platform would, in time, also result in lower costs for clients. The introduction of blockchain technology to the warehouse follows the success of an initial “proof of concept” for North American single-name CDS last year. In 2016, the DTCC also announced that it was working with Digital Asset Holdings, a start-up led by former JPMorgan executive Blythe Masters, to explore the application of blockchain in the clearing and settlement of some US repo transactions. IBM will lead the initiative while Axoni will provide distributed ledger infrastructure and smart contract applications, with R3 — a consortium of more than 50 banks — acting as a adviser. It will be submitted to the Hyperledger open source platform when it goes live next year. Greg Schvey, chief executive of Axoni, described the venture as “a watershed moment for the industry”.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hannah Murphy","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-01-09","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/7b1d986a-c507-11e6-8f29-9445cac8966f","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F645dafe4-c51f-11e6-9043-7e34c07b46ef?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"ICAP looks to process forex trades on blockchain","INTRO":"Move comes as settlement house Euroclear completes 2-week pilot for 600 test deals","DETAILED_CONTENT":"ICAP is preparing to process thousands of foreign exchange trades on blockchain technology amid signs the emerging standard is encroaching on global markets. The London group, to be renamed NEX Group from January, will supply the code to customers in March so institutional investors can more transparently track and value deals in the spot market, which trades $1.7tn a day. At the same time Euroclear, one of the world’s largest settlement houses, and its partner Paxos, a US financial technology group, have completed a 2-week blockchain pilot for more than 600 test deals in the London bullion market. The projects mark further significant steps in the advance on markets of blockchain technology — an electronic ledger with records stored in “blocks” — which aims to automate the complex networks of trust and verification on which modern finance sits. Banks see the technology as a way to cut costly back office systems, as well as unify their data to meet rising demands on trade reporting and customers’ portfolio valuations. But many have found the blockchain technology difficult to put into practice and are increasingly turning to infrastructure operators, many of whom already maintain the plumbing behind billions of dollars of deals.  ICAP, in conjunction with US technology group Axoni, will utilise its Traiana subsidiary, which acts as a messaging hub for $2tn of forex, fixed income and swaps deals. It is set to become a key part of NEX as it sheds the brokers that built ICAP and focuses on digital market infrastructure. “By the end of March clients will be able to access their own node on the blockchain. We create a digital record in a cloud vault and also on the blockchain,” said Jenny Knott, chief executive of post trade risk and information at ICAP. “We are building the Nex technology platform and licensing to the Traiana legal entity, so that we can run both systems in parallel. Over time we will be able to turn off the old system‎.” Traiana reconciles transaction, reference, market and portfolio data before it is sent out, either to regulators, clearing houses or back to financial institutions themselves. In the blockchain the trading data acts as a “genesis block” and the encrypted details are passed to other parties for deciphering and verification. Ms Knott said enthusiasm had been particularly high among institutional investors such as hedge funds and asset managers. Brussels-based Euroclear, which houses more than €27tn of bonds, equities, funds and derivatives for customers, is exploring with Paxos how to modernise the market for gold. Trading of the precious metal is bilateral and decentralised but banks use large amounts of capital in the settlement process. Société Générale, Citi and Scotiabank all participated in the trial. “It was a success as we were able to get real engagement with real customers to use a real product,” said Charles Cascarilla, chief executive of Paxos, which was formerly known as ItBit.

While banks such as Goldman Sachs have been deploying blockchain for financial applications, new uses are appearing in physical supply chains in Asia, where multinationals’ biggest concerns are over quality control, safety and security. Walmart, the US retailer, is adopting the technology to ensure the provenance and quality of pork in China, a country plagued by food safety scandals. Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Wells Fargo of the US joined hands to track a shipment of cotton travelling from Texas to Qingdao in China. “It’s guaranteeing authenticity,” said Scott Likens, a partner at PwC. “Blockchain brings an indisputable way of looking at what has happened to something; that you can trace the path to origin and along the route in a trusted way.” Thomas Olsen, a partner at consultancy Bain \u0026 Co in Singapore, described blockchain as the catalyst to solve some of these problems through transparency and eliminating tampering. “Large commodities companies are looking at applications for this in their internal supply chains, as well as extended supply chains in China and elsewhere.” Many of these applications layer blockchain together with internet of things sensors and so-called smart contracts. These mean, for example, that insurance payments are automatically triggered if the sensors on a food or commodity shipment show humidity or temperature exceeding a stipulated level.  In the case of the cotton deal, the geographic location of the goods had to be confirmed before payment was released. This gave parties to the transaction “greater certainty compared with traditional . . . trade instruments like letters of credits, which focus on documents and data”, said Commonwealth Bank. The trifecta of technologies also enables tracking of warehouses and collateral, said Mr Olsen, eliminating, for example, the risk of having the same assets back multiple transactions — a ploy engaged at the port of Qingdao in 2014, spurring a flurry of lawsuits at that time. For Walmart, the ability to connect and capture information such as expiry dates and storage temperatures along the pork trail — from farm to factory — means safer meat on the shelves. “Advanced technology has reached into so many aspects of modern life but it has lagged behind in food traceability, and in particular in creating more secure food supply chains,” said Bridget van Kralingen, a senior vice-president at IBM, which collaborated on the Walmart platform. Consultants foresee further uses of these technologies in pharmaceuticals and even music and media to protect property rights. “What it could do, and there are some experiments, is let the artist sell directly to the user and upload to blockchain with a smart contract, which will govern who can use it and how the content can be used,” said Alan Lau, a senior partner in McKinsey’s digital practice.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Louise Lucas","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-12-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/5e48f9ec-b651-11e6-ba85-95d1533d9a62","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F7f9bb980-b652-11e6-ba85-95d1533d9a62?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Has the blockchain hype finally peaked?","INTRO":"Sober reality bites on automating networks of trust on which modern finance rests","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Is the hype around a blockchain for financial markets finally over? The verdict from some of the market’s most active participants at a conference in London this week was definitive. “The breathless coverage last year has been replaced with a more sober examination,” said Michael Bodson, chief executive of DTCC, the US post-trade services group at the DTCC-CSFI event. “We are seeing that when hype meets reality, reality wins. People are much more focused on the ways blockchain will truly be successful now.” It has turned out that Silicon Valley’s breezy idea of combining its peer-to-peer computing ethos with that of the money management practices of Wall Street is hard to do. Automating the networks of trust on which modern finance sits has proven complicated. Money has chased ideas. The World Economic Forum estimated that more than 25 countries are investing in blockchain technology, filing more than 2,500 patents and investing $1.3bn. For some the biggest symbol of this difficulty of turning ideas into reality has been the powerful R3 consortium of 72 of the world’s largest institutions. A recent fundraising has revealed diverging interests among participants. Goldman Sachs, Santander and Morgan Stanley — among the early backers — opted out and R3 scaled back plans to sell 90 per cent of the company to raise $200m. It will now raise $150m by selling 60 per cent, with further tranches of funding to come next year.   Simon Taylor, co-founder and blockchain director of 11FS, said financial technology companies often fill gaps in the market. “It’s all very well to talk a good game about collaboration, but it’s very hard to get it over the line,” he said. Some have taken comfort in the “Hype Cycle” developed by research firm Gartner a decade ago to describe the trajectory of the average technology. Early executive and investor enthusiasm hits a peak of inflated expectations and is brought crashing to earth. Once through a trough of disillusionment does enlightenment arrive, and the technology becomes useful. “The hype cycle began when tech firms that had no practical idea about the real world uses of digital ledger technology over-promised and under-delivered. Some promised to make central bank money irrelevant,” said Charley Cooper, managing director of R3. “The financial services firms themselves, through the R3 consortium and other efforts, are playing a key role in helping set reasonable expectations.”  And others say more realistic expectations does not equate to easing off the accelerator. “At some point hype can’t sustain itself, there has to be something underneath it. But there are signs of a tipping point,” noted Blythe Masters, chief executive of Digital Asset Holdings, a blockchain technology company. “There’s a widespread proliferation of consortia doing more than just talk. The substance and intensity of work, the rate of change…a lot has changed. The original vision behind blockchain has evolved.” R3 will today launch its distributed ledger, known as Corda, for the automation and enforcement of financial contracts. Others are equally further down the path. This month UK-based Setl announced it had put sterling on the blockchain to enable consumer payments. It also has a qualified regulatory backing. Setl is one of the first slate of companies allowed to test their products in the UK markets regulator’s new “sandbox”, which provides a live environment for testing while still protecting consumers But some initiatives remain in their infancy. On Monday the German Bundesbank and Deutsche Börse, which conducts most of the country’s securities settlement, said they had developed a prototype to try to settle securities on the blockchain. It may even enact other corporate actions such as coupon payments. But as the two admitted, it “is purely a conceptual study; it is far from being market-ready”. And while the industry talks about collaboration, others expect established economic incentives to prevail. “Many will offer open source technology, but you are going to have value capture, you are going to end up with multiple oligopolistic systems, many big players,” said Paul Vine, a partner at lawyer Norton Rose Fulbright.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford Hannah Murphy","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-11-30","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/598934e0-b010-11e6-9c37-5787335499a0","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fdf2708bc-9525-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Goldman Sachs quits R3 blockchain consortium","INTRO":"US bank decides against taking part in a $150m funding round","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Goldman Sachs has left the powerful R3 blockchain consortium, in a sign of tensions emerging as the big banks try to place their chips on a technology that could cut tens of billions of dollars of costs from the financial sector. The Wall Street bank had been one of nine original members of R3, which was assembled last year to find ways to eliminate the clunky processes that govern payments and settlements behind the scenes. The group has since swelled to more than 70 fee-paying members, with the recent addition of Synchrony, the credit card company, Dutch bank ABN Amro and Fifth Third Bank of Ohio. Goldman baulked at being asked to chip in for a $150m “Series A” funding round, according to two people familiar with the negotiations. One said that Goldman was unwilling to invest alongside dozens of co-investors, and wanted more operational control. In a statement, R3 said: “As with any project of this scale and scope, we always expected the make-up of the consortium to change over time. Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time.”  Goldman declined to comment on its withdrawal, except to confirm that it was no longer paying dues to R3 as of the end of October. Blockchain works as an electronic ledger of payments that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records. The ledger is shared between parties on computer servers and protected from tampering by cryptography, doing away with the need for a central authority. Its supporters believe the technology could cut hidden expenses in the financial system by eliminating inefficiencies and the need for trade insurance, across areas such as payments, trade finance, syndicated loans and equity clearing. Such cost savings would be welcomed in an era of ultra-low interest rates, heightened capital requirements and tougher regulations. But R3 is not the only group developing blockchain technology. Others include Digital Asset Holdings, run by Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan head of commodities, which is working with the Australian Securities Exchange to move its clearing and settlement system on to blockchain. Goldman joined a funding round for DAH in February 2016 along with IBM, bringing the total raised to $60m among 15 companies. Another blockchain developer is Symbiont, run by Caitlin Long, a former managing director at Morgan Stanley, which is working on a project with the state of Delaware to change corporate law to enable company registrations on blockchain. R3 has grown to a staff of more than 100 people and describes itself as the “de facto centre of gravity” for blockchain technology in the wholesale financial markets. Charley Cooper, managing director at R3, said the group could shrug off the loss of Goldman, as it was just one of 73 companies in the consortium. He stressed that bringing more banks on board was a critical element of R3’s strategy. “How good would a fax machine be if you had no one to communicate with?” he said. “The power of this technology is in the network effect; the multiplier is really profound.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ben McLannahan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-11-21","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/7022f022-8efc-11e6-a72e-b428cb934b78","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F3d0da024-9d8e-11e6-a6e4-8b8e77dd083a?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ones to watch: The rise of online-only money","INTRO":"Although bitcoin remains the biggest, other digital currencies offer extra benefits","DETAILED_CONTENT":"There are hundreds, if not thousands, of digital currencies but only a few have significant support. Most so-called alt coins are likely to remain niche instruments. Many who put cash into them are speculators who hope wider take-up will send their investments soaring. But digital currencies have now caught the attention of financial institutions and central bankers. Here are some of the popular digital coins that are currently available. The first digital currency to gain widespread adoption has the highest market value at about $11bn. Since its creation in 2009, bitcoin has demonstrated that the algorithms driving it are robust. However, it will be forever tainted in the eyes of many because of its use by criminals on dark-net sites and its association with scandals in which customers’ bitcoin were stolen from hacked exchanges. It runs on an open-source protocol that operates across a network of users’ computers. But its flaws are preventing it from being more widely adopted so it can become a means of payment as big as MasterCard or Visa. Market value: $11bn. Price per coin: $687.41 The second-biggest digital currency is ether, an open-source, decentralised currency running on the Ethereum blockchain. The Ethereum project takes virtual currencies further than bitcoin, by developing new applications on the underlying technology. One innovation is exchanging ether using legally binding contracts stored on its blockchain, the distributed ledger infrastructure on which it operates. Companies such as IBM, Microsoft and Samsung have experimented with Ethereum’s protocol. Market value: $1bn. Price per coin: $11.26  This cryptocurrency came into being in 2016, when the creators of Ethereum decided to split Ethereum’s blockchain after a hacker stole millions of dollars in customers’ deposits. But this move outraged many who believed a core principle of blockchain — that it was tamper-proof — had been violated by its founders in an effort to protect depositors’ funds. They stuck with the original chain, however, so although Ethereum and Ethereum Classic were once in fact the same algorithm, the two have since become separate currencies despite sharing a similar name. Market value: $84m. Price per coin: $0.98 Ripple is working with banks including Santander and UBS to develop the infrastructure to allow financial companies to make payments to each other across borders, a core aim of the sector. It aims to be faster and cost less than the infrastructure banks use. It would offer services in competition with existing providers such as Swift, which provides secure financial messaging products. Market value: $298m. Price per coin: $0.008376 Originally named Darkcoin, this currency began to gain popularity in 2015 by vaunting its privacy benefits. Dash’s network operates in much the same way as bitcoin does, but it is designed to add an extra layer to transactions, mixing them up so it is difficult to link the buyer and seller. Market value: $65m. Price per coin: $9.49 If bitcoin is gold, Litecoin is silver. That was the principle stated by its founder, a former software engineer at Google. Although it was inspired by bitcoin, it was designed to offer an edge over its rival in that its network can handle more transactions more quickly. Market value: $193m.

Having watched as bitcoin went from obscure experiment in digital money to a currency with a market value of almost $10bn, they themselves are now experimenting with digital currencies rather than waiting idly to be swept away by the tide of technology. Countries around the world — the UK, Russia, Canada, Australia, China and many more — are examining how they might mint their own digital currencies and put money on the blockchain. Efforts have intensified this year, although research is still at an early stage and many puzzles have yet to be worked out. But most agree on one thing: that the world is moving towards use of digital currencies. Within the Bank of England, a team is already considering what a central bank-issued digital currency could mean. “The technology is moving quickly,” says Victoria Cleland, chief cashier, in her glassed-walled office inside the fortress-like Bank. “A lot of people think central banks are very risk averse, but we are thinking, ‘Are there opportunities to grasp innovation ourselves?’” In assessing the risks and benefits, the central bank is canvassing the views of counterparts in other countries, academics and commercial banks to work out answers to the big questions. It needs to know how turning its cash digital would affect the economy and financial stability, as well as determine whether the technology would be robust enough to stand up to hackers and serve the UK’s 65m people. “This isn’t something we can squirrel away in the central bank because, if we were to do it, it would be completely transformative,” says Ms Cleland. Central bankers began their homework by poring over bitcoin, the digital money launched online by an unknown computer scientist in 2009. Its breakthrough was that it was secured not by any central overarching body, but by cryptography. Its operating system is a blockchain, and each transaction becomes a block that is linked — or “hashed” — by computers to the chain to form a permanent record of every transaction (a blockchain network) which is visible to all.  Bankers are drawn by the idea of fast, efficient, digital money that does not carry the cost of handling cash, and that can be tracked as it moves through the financial system. These advantages promise benefits in cutting risk, fraud and executing monetary policy. Central banks’ interest in deploying a blockchain to do this comes in step with moves by commercial banks and other financial institutions to use the technology to ease cross-border settlement transactions and overhaul antiquated back-office infrastructure. They are less drawn, however, by the idea of digital money they cannot control and that can be used anonymously, the consequence of another aspect of bitcoin’s innovation: its decentralised, peer-to-peer network. Any central bank coin to emerge would have to find a different model. There is an unresolved tension between blockchain libertarians who support open-source, decentralised networks, and those who seek closed, controllable databases. “What is really exciting is cryptocurrency’s ability to have true peer-to-peer cash and transfer of assets. This is the real advance,” says Jerry Brito, executive director of Coin Center, a non-profit research organisation focused on the public policy issues around cryptocurrency technologies.   At the Bank of England, radical options are being discussed. One scenario even involves the blockchain being used to bypass high-street banks, with individuals holding accounts directly with the central bank, cutting out the commercial banks’ role as middleman in the circulation of money. One person familiar with the process says that high street banks have been privately pushing against this model. But the days when bankers worried that bitcoin might be a threat to national currency are fading. “We don’t see private currencies having an edge over fiat currencies [those declared by central banks to be legal tender],” says Dong He, who has led research by the International Monetary Fund into digital currencies. “There have been episodes of private currencies competing with government-issued coins and notes but ultimately they were replaced by fiat currency.”  A bigger issue is regulation of digital currencies. This is a looming challenge that will require cross-border co-operation. Monetary authorities must come together, Mr He says, to start thinking about the necessary regulation of digital money that will be flowing around the world. He says the IMF should provide a platform for discussions to happen. When a move to official digital currencies might occur is hard to estimate, he says, but a switch could happen within the next five to 10 years. For him, it is a question of moving with the times. When large parts of the financial system are using blockchain for financial transaction, so will central banks. Of course, money is already electronically held and processed, but blockchain technology could offer a far more sophisticated operating system, with the prospect of “smart” money. Charles Hoskinson, head of IOHK, a company that makes cryptocurrencies, says being able to “programme” cash held in accounts will benefit ordinary people, corporations and governments. “You can put all kinds of extremely advanced terms and conditions on a digital account for money: where, when and who can spend it, and how much I can spend. That can happen with a bank account on a digital ledger.” Digital currencies will eventually benefit the developing world too, says Tilman Ehrbeck, a partner at the philanthropic investment firm Omidyar Network, set up by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. Kenneth Rogoff warns that central bank-operated digital currencies could be ‘decades away’ Mr Ehrbeck argues that because they are low-cost and easy to use on electronic devices, digital currencies will enable greater access to financial services for the billions of the world’s unbanked. But for now, the research is most concentrated within the financial sector. “It’s inevitable there will be a government digital currency, eventually,” says Kenneth Rogoff, a professor at Harvard who studies the concept of a “less-cash” society. He believes that cash will never disappear, and that there will always be a role for small notes. “Eventually, there will be government digital currencies that ordinary people have access to at very low cost.” But he warns: “A government digital currency could be many decades away, and there are all sorts of security and regulatory issues that have to be navigated first. That said, many central banks are already thinking about it.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jane Wild","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-11-02","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/4982025d-fb91-324d-94c0-876a87a82b87","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F10%2FScreen-Shot-2016-10-27-at-12.50.30_2048x1152.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Introducing ‘Scotex’… (updated)","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"We’re not sure what to say about this, so we’ll just give you the blurb and note the corny tag line: SCOTEX: CLOSER TO THE CAPITAL. Up until 1973 Scotland had its own independent stock exchange, the Scottish Stock Exchange, which was created from the merger of the Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen Stock Exchanges in 1964. It was officially merged with the London Stock Exchange in 1973. In effect it was closed down as a working entity as all operations were moved to London. SCOTEX now has an incredible opportunity to bring a new exchange to Scotland – and as an entirely new exchange we can bring about real innovation to the equity capital market: We can bring profound change to the post-trade landscape through distributed ledgers thereby slashing settlement times and bringing significant cost benefits to all exchange participants. Every exchange in the world is looking at implementing this technology but they all face the intractable problem of switching from legacy systems on to very new and very different post-trade infrastructure. Without that problem to overcome SCOTEX can genuinely be the first in the world at implementing distributed ledger technology with the STARS system. With no existing capital markets infrastructure in Scotland we can take the lead ourselves in bringing new companies to market instead of relying on the old way of banks and brokers carrying that role. We think we can bring companies to market quicker and more efficiently which improves the outcome for both issuers and investors. In future Scottish companies seeking a listing to raise capital for growth expansion will know they can access that service right on their doorstep without needing to engage with a bank or a broker in London or elsewhere. Just 5% of large Scottish companies have a stock market listing in London, and only 10% of London Main Market companies are based in Scotland. So the opportunity for listings growth at SCOTEX is clear. We know Scotland’s asset management firms have enormous sums of money to invest, and we know Scotland’s entrepreneurs and scientists have the talent to make investments in them produce the returns the asset managers are looking for. The link between them has been missing for 43 years and SCOTEX sees an opportunity to put that right. SCOTEX will offer capital markets access for the next generation of scientists, inventors and entrepreneurs of Scotland. It is crucial for Scotland that its wealth creators – now and in the future – have a visible equity capital market that is able to provide them with access to the capital they need to grow their companies. Here’s some extra blockchain guff. The new exchange is looking to raise an unspecified amount of money and plans to launch in a year’s time. AIM-type chancers need not apply. We currently have no idea who is behind this. UPDATE So, further Googling reveals that this is old news. Here’s a story from The Herald back in July, saying the people behind it are a group of unnamed “former Nasdaq traders.” Even deeper research suggests the venture has its roots in something called Big Bang 2, which is probably as daft as it sounds. Actually, it’s worse. It’s blockchain nonsense.

Now imagine a market where the only limit on how much you raise is not the viability of your business venture or its capacity to generate positive cash flows in the future, but the breadth and scope of your vision for decentralisation, code or capital appreciation. That is the state of the $82bn crypto currency market. Here, the latest fad is not investing in bitcoin, the crypto currency pioneer, but in “initial coin offerings” which promise to endow tokens at some unspecified point in the future with a digital raison d\u0027être. At the latest count, more than 900 coins were supposedly active and tradeable in the bilateral crypto currency market, or else bore some sort of implied intrinsic value. Among the latest to be issued is EOS, which raised $200m of crypto currency in July offering tokens that “do not have any rights, uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features, express or implied, including, without limitation, any uses, purpose, attributes, functionalities or features on the EOS platform”. In the pipeline are projects as vague as InsureX, which promises “an insurance solution based on blockchain”, and Pillar, a “next generation, open-source wallet”. These are just among the scores of coins being issued every month. The question is whether this fad represents a legitimate mechanism for helping ventures access funding markets or is just another bubble in the making. For now, opinions are divided. On one side are established players such as the consultants Deloitte and venture capital luminaries like Tim Draper, who have made provisional endorsements. Their hope is to cultivate the market, making it a serious and respected funding destination for digital-savvy start-ups or decentralised ventures. Many others, however, warn that the projects being funded bear all the hallmarks of companies designed for “carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody . . . know[s] what it is”, as depicted in Charles Mackay’s account of historic investor frenzies, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. Yet perhaps a better way of looking at this is as the simple evolution of shadow banking nipped in the bud by global regulatory frameworks introduced in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. As Morgan Ricks, author of The Money Problem , recounts, the US shadow banking system used to exist outside the banking safety net. As with the crypto currency market today, minimal regulatory constraints meant excessive risk taking and high returns. In time, however, the market proved to be exceptionally fragile. The crisis that began in 2007 eventually tore through the entire sector. The vulnerability at the heart of shadow banking, according to Mr Ricks, was not the poor quality of the underlying assets in the system, though this did play a part. The decisive factor was the sector’s capacity to engage in unilateral private US dollar money creation for the purpose of funding exceptionally risky assets, in particular the creation of lookalike dollars that circulated internationally as if they were the bona fide article. When push came to shove, and US dollar funding markets closed up to poor-quality issuers, this left the shadow banking sector’s privately issued dollar liabilities without a source of real dollars with which to honour redemptions. The fragility was thus directly related to the fact that institutions had issued liabilities of a specific value — that of the dollar — when they had no capacity to honour that value during a liquidity crisis, since they did not have access to a lender of last resort. The crypto currency phenomenon can be seen, therefore, as shadow banking moving to the next stage of private money creation and liquidity management. This sees investors taking all the liquidity and value risk on to their own balance sheets, and issuers freeing themselves from having to provide any fixed value guarantee at all. The question is: do investors realise the risks they have taken on in the process? And do they appreciate the extent to which the epic valuations being bandied about are liquidity dependent, and so potentially unrealisable? Most importantly, do they realise that, if and when things go wrong, there will be no justification for the state to bail them out this time? izabella.kaminska@ft.com","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Izabella Kaminska","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-07-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/41fbba0a-9b6b-11e6-8f9b-70e3cabccfae","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fa9bdf37c-9bae-11e6-8f9b-70e3cabccfae?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bank safety and the blockchain revolution","INTRO":"Distributed ledgers might offer savings but caution is in order","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The financial world has spent the past few years trying to decide what to make of blockchain — the automated ledger that supports the bitcoin cryptocurrency. Could it be a gold mine for banks looking to make their back-office systems more efficient, driving costs from the business? Or is it just another techno dead-end, a clever idea but one that lacks sufficient profitable uses to be worth deploying on a large scale? Banks are now coming forward with commercial applications for the technology. In Hong Kong, Bank of China and HSBC have announced plans to use blockchain to speed up mortgage applications by keeping a register of property valuations. This, they think, will allow them to process loans more cheaply. Keeping records of valuations is supposedly only the tip of the iceberg. Some think that blockchain could also revolutionise banks’ core payment and trading systems. Its magic ingredient is that it allows users to bypass the need for middlemen and simplifies clearing and settlement by creating an instantaneous and tamper-resistant public record of transactions. The Oliver Wyman consultancy has estimated that if blockchain was used to streamline unwieldy systems, such as those in cross-border payments and securities trading, it could shave $15-20bn annually from global banks’ costs. With bankers under pressure to cut costs, such efficiencies are attractive. Indeed, 50 of the world’s largest banks have started to look at blockchain and hope to launch their first applications within the next 12 months. Exploring the possibilities of a technology is one thing but deploying it widely is quite another, particularly one with as many unanswered questions as blockchain. First, there is the issue of security. It is a general rule with systems that security is inversely related to the level of access. The more users with permission rights, the easier it is for a corrupt or malicious individual to hack in and cause havoc. The fully distributed system envisaged by visionaries might be very widespread indeed. Then there is the problem of “bloat”. The data storage required to run a fully distributed capital market, for instance, might be so enormous that the system would be too slow. Lastly there is confidentiality. For all the cryptography, distributed ledgers are designed to create visible records. That could allow participants to spy on each other’s deals, unpicking profitable patterns. Of course, there are answers to these worries. The simplest is to move away from full distribution back to a centralised ledger, so instead of sharing data with everyone, you create a hub — or perhaps a small group of hubs — and this holds the data on behalf of the other participants. The snag is that while this bolsters security it would also reduce savings. Rather than contemplate such a massive and costly technical upheaval, many banks might choose to stick with what they have. There may be ways to cut ancillary costs. The initiative by HSBC and Bank of China is one example. Other areas could include compliance procedures, such as anti-money laundering and “know your customer” rules. Banks will have to think hard before embedding blockchain in core activities. Like aeroplanes and suspension bridges — other systems that depend on public confidence — banks should beware of stripping away redundancies, such as human oversight, that act as a check against catastrophic failure. Regulators must ensure that in the interest of saving money, banks do not take new and ill-understood risks.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-10-26","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/8aac3060-9538-11e6-a80e-bcd69f323a8b","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F909876c8-1b7b-11e6-b286-cddde55ca122?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Insurers team up to study benefits of blockchain","INTRO":"Evaluation to look at whether technology can delivery efficiency improvements","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Five of Europe’s biggest insurers have joined forces in an attempt to put blockchain through its paces and evaluate whether the technology can help make the industry more efficient. The group, made up of Aegon, Zurich, Allianz, Munich Re and Swiss Re, are initially planning to experiment with the technology in the reinsurance sector. Blockchain is the technology behind bitcoin, the virtual currency. It is a shared, encrypted database that allows users to securely record details of transactions or contracts in several places at once. While a large number of pilot uses are under way in the banking industry, the technology has been slower to take off in insurance. “We have a number of potential uses in the pipeline,” said Alessandro Spadoni, who is working on the project for Zurich. “The first is for reinsurance. We’re looking at the use of smart contracts to streamline the selling of reinsurance and the processing of claims.” We’re looking at the use of smart contracts to streamline the selling of reinsurance and the processing of claims.” Smart contracts put terms and conditions into code so that they can be put into action automatically when specific trigger points are reached. For example, a smart insurance contract could pay a claim automatically in certain circumstances. “We should be able to provide more efficient and streamlined services to our customers,” added Mr Spadoni. Analysis from Capgemini, published last week, said that financial services companies could generate big savings by using blockchain. In motor policies, for example, insurers could cut almost 13 per cent off operating and claims costs by using smart contracts, according to the IT services group. Much of that could be passed on to customers.  However, the big European insurers will take their time before putting anything into practice. “We’re not yet fully convinced of the benefits that blockchain can deliver,” said Mr Spadoni. “There will be very measured experimentation.” He added that he had not yet seen anyone with a fully productive use of blockchain in insurance. The group is planning to deliver its first results by the middle of next year and hopes that other insurers will eventually join in. “If you want to establish an industry wide blockchain network, you need everyone on it. You need a network effect,” said Mr Spadoni. Although the use of blockchain is at a relatively early stage in insurance, other experiments are under way. Allianz and Nephila Capital have piloted a smart contract in natural catastrophe insurance. Blem, an IT company, has started offering blockchain based contracts for reinsurance. And Safeshare, a UK-based start-up, is using the technology to provide insurance for people who rent out their spare rooms for use as offices.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Oliver Ralph","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-10-19","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/8fc96cbc-8ed9-11e6-a72e-b428cb934b78","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F2ee61bbe-90a2-11e6-a72e-b428cb934b78?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Banks will not adopt blockchain fast","INTRO":"It will take longer than expected for the technology to go mainstream, writes Oliver Bussmann","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Since the blockchain — the technology underpinning the digital currency bitcoin — first emerged, people have recognised its potential to transform financial services.

A third of the banks that participated told us they had serious blockchain proofs of concept in the works. So are we about to see blockchain break into the banking mainstream? As a strong believer in the potential of this technology, I truly wish we were. But as the former group chief information officer of UBS, where we championed blockchain early on, and as an adviser to banks and fintech companies today, I am cautious. My experience tells me it may be a while before we see large-scale adoption in the financial industry. Just consider what is really happening at the moment. Yes, Ripple has made fantastic strides with an excellent, market ready, platform. And its network currently includes 12 of the top 50 banks. That’s a great start — but a long way from Swift’s 8,000 members. IBM says 15 per cent of 200 survey recipients may go live next year. That’s 30 banks — hardly a stampede. Then let’s look at regulation. It has been fantastic to see regulators around the world, from the UK to Singapore, embracing blockchain’s potential. They are engaged in open dialogue and are offering sandbox environments, where banks can test platforms without fear of breaking any rules. But sandboxes are for safe play, not for real work. They exist because regulators want to understand blockchain’s risks as well as its potential. And rightly so. Their primary remit is to protect consumers. Regulators will want to be sure that large-scale platforms are absolutely bullet proof before they are released into the wild. And, if platforms want to reach across borders, they will need regulatory sign-off — and certainty — from all jurisdictions involved. This will not happen overnight. Banks will be keen to ensure that any major new platforms are secureas well. That means extensive internal validation and approval. Since the theft of more than $50m in digital currency from blockchain platform Ethereum DAO, legal, risk and compliance departments — not to mention boards of directors — have become extremely sensitive to blockchain’s reputational risk. We shouldn’t forget that blockchain represents a profound shift from centralised to decentralised business models. An industry like finance, which is so heavily invested in centralised structures, may find it difficult to change its mindset.  This is not to say that blockchain is not coming. The incentives are too large. Numerous research reports put potential efficiency gains to financial services from blockchain at between $15bn and $20bn. Already today, using blockchain-based applications, companies could bring the cost of a cross-border transaction down from $25 to $1 or $2. This will drive adoption. Over the next 12 to 24 months, I expect we will see significant, if still limited, moves to blockchain-based platforms in areas like cross-border payments or trade finance. But financial services as a whole is much broader than just these isolated use cases. I therefore expect widespread blockchain implementation in other industries first — for example supply chain management, healthcare, real estate, or e-governance. No doubt financial services will follow; when it comes to blockchain, I do not think you can escape destiny. But the dream of a fully blockchain-enabled financial system will take some time to fulfil. Oliver Bussmann is the founder and managing partner of Bussmann Advisory.

So far, Bank of China (Hong Kong) has led tests on a property valuation system for home loans based on blockchain technology, according to Duncan Wong, vice-president of financial technologies at Astri, the government-backed research institute working on the system. He said the bank plans to go live with it next month. It will use the secure database capabilities of blockchain to provide quick property valuations for mortgage applicants in Hong Kong. At present, when customers apply for mortgages, the banks hire surveyors to value the property being bought. But as different customers shop around for mortgages, the same survey work is often conducted multiple times on the same property. Now, blockchain can be used to create a decentralised network of banks and surveyors through which the latest valuations can be listed, verified and shared — in a matter of seconds. “To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first production-grade [blockchain] mortgage system to integrate with a bank,” Mr Wong explained.  HSBC and several other banks in the city have also “aligned the data requirements to be posted in blockchain”, according to one person involved in the project, although they are yet to finalise plans for joining the system. BOCHK confirmed it was testing such products. HSBC declined to comment. Adopting blockchain for banking products such as mortgages represents a major step in the use of new technology for traditional banking businesses. Until now, banks have talked up the potential uses of blockchain but have also kept it at arm’s length, fearing repercussions from regulators. Blockchain grabbed global attention in late 2013 when the value of the digital currency bitcoin soared to more than $1,000 per coin. But, while the focus on the digital currency has waned, the underlying ledger technology has been touted as a way to improve banks’ record keeping, land registration, lending and online payments. PwC, the professional services firm, has said that, by providing a decentralised network to verify information, blockchain can produce “transaction records that are infallible and incorruptible”. At present, few banks have tried to integrate a blockchain into their internal banking systems due to regulatory concerns over data leaks and vulnerability to cyber attacks. But Mr Wong said: “The reason we focused on the property valuation is because there is less regulatory concern for this.” He added that there was a plan to eventually build a system including more sensitive legal documents. Trials for the system are being conducted in what is known as Hong Kong’s financial technology “sandbox”, which is overseen by Astri and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. HKMA did not comment on the mortgage system but said it was working on a research study aimed at better understanding blockchain.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Don Weinland","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-10-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/08d54cdc-74e2-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F204f4b18-8d21-11e6-a72e-b428cb934b78?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain starts transition from hype to everyday use in markets","INTRO":"Exchanges and start-ups are making their first moves to implement the technology","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Taking the stage at an industry conference this year, Peter Hiom, deputy chief executive at Australia’s main stock exchange, announced that his remarks would touch on blockchain — “everyone’s favourite topic” or, he joked, “the new black”. The technology behind digital currency bitcoin has been much discussed in finance. But so far a lot of the talk falls into two categories: education — understanding what the technology is and how it might work in different areas of banking and markets — and hype. Some of blockchain’s most zealous supporters and early investors argue it could bring significant change. Now start-ups and established players are starting to test different uses for the technology. The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has made some of the boldest moves to experiment with blockchain yet. It announced this year that it would move Australia’s equities clearing and settlement system on to blockchain, working with Digital Asset Holdings, a start-up led by former JPMorgan executive Blythe Masters. “Today blockchain is not a product or technology, it is more a journey or a process that companies are going through to understand what it can do for them,” says Matt Roszak, co-founder of Bloq, which helps companies build blockchain networks. “It is very similar to what we saw with the internet 20 years ago or with the cloud 10 years ago.” Blockchain is an electronic ledger of transactions that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records. The ledger is shared between parties on computer servers and protected from being tampered with by cryptography. Some say it is a threat to banks and exchanges as it could disintermediate them by removing the need for a central reconciliation authority. But others just see an opportunity for existing financial institutions to save billions of dollars by eliminating inefficiencies and the need for trade insurance. These cost savings would be most welcome to institutions that are struggling to boost their profits, partly due to the drag of heightened regulatory demands to increase capital since the financial crisis. An analysis last year by Santander InnoVentures, Oliver Wyman and Anthemis Group estimated that distributed ledger technology could reduce banks’ infrastructure costs — including cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance charges — by $15-$20bn a year by 2022. It is very similar to what we saw with the internet 20 years ago “Every 10 years or so there are tremendous changes in technology in markets,” Peter Randall, chief executive of Setl, a UK start-up, told a conference in Geneva last month. “It’s now time to do 21st century technology in the post-trade space. Distributed ledger technology is a proper and fitting technology to drop into that.” Another exchange using blockchain is Nasdaq, which has employed the technology for trading private securities in the US and is testing it for the Estonian market. The US-based exchanges operator is also selling blockchain-enabled technology to other exchanges. The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, a US clearing and settlement services provider, has introduced blockchain for storing credit default swap trade information. Meanwhile, Euroclear, one of the world’s largest settlement houses, has joined start-up Paxos to develop a new settlement system for the London gold market. “We will see a lot of different flavours to solve specific problems over the next 12-18 months,” says Mark Smith, chief executive of Symbiont, a blockchain start-up. “We will see some start to take hold and have actual liquidity.” He adds, though, that some of the bitcoin projects that showed early promise will end up being scrapped if the technology does not add enough value.  Last month, R3 — a financial technology company that is leading a consortium of more than 50 of the world’s biggest banks — along with Credit Suisse, Symbiont and others unveiled a project to determine how blockchain could improve the syndicated loan market, which enables group lending by banks to a single borrower. “Whilst I think we have a long road to go before blockchain is everywhere, I do think you are going to start to see the beginnings of real-world application built on blockchain [starting] in the second or third quarter of 2017,” says Emmanuel Aidoo, head of the blockchain initiative at Credit Suisse. One obstacle is convincing companies to adopt the technology. The industry would also have to create standards such as smart contracts — computer code that verifies and enforces terms of a contract — and a regulatory framework, while banks would have to integrate blockchain into their systems. Ray Valdes, research vice-president at IT consultant Gartner, says that based on his analysis of the hype surrounding previous emerging technologies, blockchain is at — or just a bit before — the peak of inflated expectations among market players. He expects this will soon turn to disillusionment. “Starting early next year we will be reading articles in the mainstream press saying that this blockchain stuff isn’t very good at all,” he says. “Then later, as people gain understanding, they will figure out how to make worthwhile use of this technology. That process could take years.” Additional reporting by Philip Stafford","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nicole Bullock","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-10-11","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/48ff547c-53e7-11e6-9664-e0bdc13c3bef","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F2f00483e-8a8c-11e6-8cb7-e7ada1d123b1?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Dubai turns to blockchain for domestic challenges","INTRO":"The emirate is challenging tech developers to solve expensive problems","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In the heart of Dubai’s financial district, there is an office whose form perfectly matches its function. The office, with its smooth curves, is the region’s first to have been built with a 3D printer, and it houses an organisation capitalising on other promising 21st-century technologies. From self-driving cars to blockchain, the government’s Dubai Future Foundation is seeking to wed new technologies to the state bureaucracy and position the emirate as a Petri dish for the future, not just a sun-and-shopping tourism paradise. This is more than encouraging fintech businesses to use Dubai as their base: it is putting technology at the service of the state’s needs. At the nexus of government and business, the city is committed to experimentation to establish an era of public-private partnerships. The DFF’s Dubai Future Accelerators programme, for example, has selected 30 companies and given them three months’ development time and access to millions of dollars of venture capital to test their technologies with local government authorities. The participants include supersonic transportation system Hyperloop and ConsenSys, a company building developer tools and applications for blockchain, the shared database system. Organisers hope that the collaborations will help solve challenges set by various government departments. These include seeking automated transport networks that can cut congestion by 20 per cent; nature-inspired buildings which reduce power usage by two-thirds; and “integrated behavioral, genetic and biological systems” which are 10 times better at identifying and tracking criminals. “They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but a prototype is worth a thousand pictures,” says Saif Al Aleeli, executive director of the Dubai Future Foundation. “There is no better way to get your hands dirty with new technology than by trying it out. Our goal is to turn Dubai into the world’s leading test bed for the application of new technologies that help us achieve our goal as a 21st-century state.” The accelerator programme dovetails with another project founded by the DFF — the Global Blockchain Council, a public-private initiative bringing together government departments, local businesses and international start-ups. The council, set up in Dubai earlier this year, seeks to foster the technology’s development in the real world via test cases for new business models. It has launched seven pilot projects, with the results to be announced this month, when the Dubai government will also seek to expand on plans to integrate blockchain into its operations. The pilots aim to exploit blockchain to reduce paperwork, integrating the technology into processes that include the checking of documents and identities. Dubai Multi Commodities Centre, a government-owned free zone, is working with its GBC partners to use blockchain to authenticate and transfer Kimberley certificates, which are issued to confirm that diamonds are not from conflict areas. Ahmed Sultan bin Sulayem, chairman of the DMCC, is also chairing the 81-country Kimberley Process organisation this year. UAE-based telecoms provider du is working on piloting a health records scheme. The manual process of transferring records between clinics and patients is cumbersome and prone to human error. Using blockchain as a protocol for sharing these sensitive records would protect them against tampering and cut costs for providers, du says. Blockchain, says Osman Sultan, chief executive of du, “has extraordinary potential to improve our lives as witnessed by the electronic health record application that will allow secure and real-time access to patient records, guaranteeing their integrity.” “Blockchain is a major component of our strategy,” says Aisha bin Bishr, director-general of Smart Dubai Office, a government agency committed to expanding the use of technology across the city.  One area of interest to the government is the cryptocurrencies that use blockchain to underwrite their transactions, such as bitcoin. Dubai-based BitOasis, a bitcoin wallet and exchange company, has growth of up to 80 per cent as adoption of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies goes beyond a narrower world of technology “geeks”, says founder Ola Doudin. While more people are taking advantage of the “almost free” cost (in her phrase) of these transfers, banks are also trying to learn about blockchain technology as a means to cut operational costs and simplify complex regulatory demands for much better compliance. Financial institutions are also aware that the emergence of cryptocurrencies for innovative transfer systems threatens to undermine their future profitability. One of the main tasks of start-ups such as BitOasis is to work with regulators and governments to improve education about these technologies. They have sparked resistance from regulators who fear losing oversight of transactions. “Banks are really getting much more aware of the technology, they definitely want to learn more, but we are still in an experimental phase,” Ms Doudin says. Critics say that this latest obsession with futuristic models is a gimmicky distraction from the basics Those joining the experiment hope that the Dubai government’s single-mindedness will speed up the transition from vision to reality. The emirate’s role as the regional commercial, trading and tourism hub has been founded on the government’s ability to move decisively to stretch its business-friendly advantage over competitors. Some domestic critics say that this latest obsession with futuristic models is a gimmicky distraction. They argue the government should be focused on the basics, such as greater competition in telecommunications, educational change, productivity and judicial reform, including decriminalisation of debt. But officials say they will press on with engendering change where they can, focusing on areas of cutting red tape that will enhance the business environment. “Dubai has a culture of figuring out how the world should work and going for it,” says Global Blockchain Council member Vinay Gupta, a London-based venture capitalist. “This adaptive capacity and vision lets it in theory be ahead of places like London, where there is enormous bureaucratic drag. We are worrying about Brexit when Dubai is worrying about blockchain.” Blockchain is a data-recording structure that creates a shared ledger which is distributed among networked computers, allowing users to make and verify transactions immediately without a central authority. New transactions are checked by the network and, when approved as valid, are added to the blockchain. Most widely known as the ledger underpinning the bitcoin digital currency, blockchain technology can be public, allowing anyone to participate in adding new transactions to the blockchain. Companies are also exploring private blockchains shared by known participants.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Simeon Kerr","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-10-06","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/aadc3f1a-6eaf-11e6-a0c9-1365ce54b926","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fac5f615e-86ac-11e6-ad89-ba2f348161fb?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Insurers rush to grab hold of fintech start-ups with potential","INTRO":"Traditional players hope to take advantage of innovators’ tech know-how","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Autumn started with a rush of deals. As August turned to September, a clutch of big insurers announced investments in start-ups. Allianz put funds into MoneyFarm, a digital wealth manager. Munich Re partnered with Trov, which is developing a range of on-demand insurance products. Axa backed Gasolead, which is creating a virtual assistant to help insurance agents generate more digital leads. If this is an industry playing catch-up on tech, it is playing hard. “[Insurers] are working closely with start-ups rather than seeing them as a threat,” says Nigel Walsh, a partner at Deloitte. For others, however, there is a long way to go. Tom Butterworth of Silicon Valley Bank, which finances tech companies, describes the sector as archaic. “It’s seen as the laggard in adopting new technology,” he says. The September deals showed the breadth of technologies in which insurers are dabbling as they look for new ways to help customers — both retail and corporate — manage risk. Telematics is particularly popular. What started as the ability to assess how well young people drive via a black box in the car is quickly expanding into a range of similar ideas. Health insurance linked to fitness devices is one. Home or factory insurance policies linked to various types of sensor are another. Data analysis is a hot topic. “The insurers are probably a bit more mature than the banks in using big data to drive value,” says Roy Jubraj, managing director at Accenture. The idea is that, by analysing data, insurers can assess risk more accurately. This is not always straightforward. UK regulators recently looked at whether insurers’ use of data could harm consumers, although it eventually decided that the issue did not merit a full investigation. Meanwhile, blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, is never far from the discussion. Insurers are investigating how it could make insurance contracts cheaper and more secure. “Blockchain has the opportunity to fundamentally change the way we interact with insurers,” says Mr Walsh. He adds that smart contracts — which pay out automatically if something happens, without the policyholder needing to make a claim — are one way in which the technology could change the industry.  Yet there are limits to how far big, traditional insurers can go when it comes to making the most of new developments. “Legacy systems are holding them back quite a bit,” says Mr Jubraj. “That’s why major players are embarking on new platforms, modernising what they have.” Old technology, says Mr Jubraj, hinders insurers’ ability to create new products quickly. “Today most insurers push digital services based on the products they are [already] selling. Not many are looking at you as a customer and driving a proposition around that, as Amazon has in retail,” he adds. That is where a lot of the start-ups come in. New entrants are selling variations on traditional policies — car insurance by the mile, for example, or cover for specific possessions. By combining with these start-ups, insurers win some underwriting business (very few start-ups are fully licensed insurers) and get an early peek at which sorts of products might work well. “For the foreseeable future, barriers to entry are so huge that you’ll see this layer added to the top of the industry,” says Mr Butterworth. “It is the [insurers] most willing to integrate with the early-stage companies that will come out on top.” Cyber insurance is one exception. Multinationals including AIG, Munich Re, Allianz and Beazley have pushed into cyber. Analysts say it is one of the few areas of commercial and wholesale insurance that offers much growth. Adoption is much higher in the US than Europe, but EU rules coming in 2018 are expected to boost take-up. However, customer demands are changing in cyber. While cyber policies traditionally cover companies for financial and operational problems caused by data loss, industry surveys suggest that policyholders have a wider range of worries, such as what happens if a cyber attack causes physical damage, or the consequences of a hack that affects products. The question for insurers is how quickly they can model and price those risks.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Oliver Ralph","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-10-03","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/6029b686-05c6-31ca-aca9-351ff4108fe2","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F09%2FScreen-Shot-2016-09-27-at-12.12.30_2048x1152.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The diminishing returns of blockchain fetishism","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Economists Robert Gordon and Robert Solow have long warned that digital information systems may not be cultivating the same sort of productivity gains that inventions of the past have done. Where gains have been registered, meanwhile, they’ve usually been associated with the roll-out of spreadsheet technologies which greatly reduced the resources companies had to spend on clerks and administrators.. And yet, as Gordon alluded to in his 2012 paper, even here it’s worth asking how longstanding such gains are likely to be: The first personal computers arrived in the early 1980s with their word processing, word wrap, and spreadsheets. Word processing furthered the elimination of repetitive typing, while spreadsheets allowed the automation of repetitive calculations. Secretaries began to disappear in economics departments, and professors began to type their own papers. “Moore’s Law” proceeded apace and allowed larger document and spreadsheet files to be handled faster. The multiplying power of computer chips was matched by increasing complexity of software, leading to the light-hearted verdict that “What Intel Giveth, Microsoft Taketh Away.” Information gains, essentially, look and feel fairly zero sum. Once everyone is elevated to a more organised and inter-operable information processing system, the relative advantages begin to be lost on society. To the contrary, all we end up with is a need to cultivate faster and faster systems, because –in the style of an arms race — whatever fresh capacity is freed up is immediately exploited in increasingly spammy ways. Arguably, however, it’s even worse than that because every digital innovation tends also to increase complexity, oftentimes undermining the productivity gains achieved when the original compatible and interoperable systems were introduced. In some sense, it’s a tragedy of the commons effect, best expressed by the much trumpeted internet scare story that in the last year alone we used up more data than in the course of all human history. (Or something like that.) Point being, if the cheap capacity is built, we the public will come and abuse it (whether it’s with DDoS attacks, email spam, dog and cat pictures, social media, bad talent videos or cryptocurrency blockchains). And nowhere is this productivity-undermining arms race more acute than in the banking sector. To wit, via the WSJ’s Telis Demos this week, a flavour of the unfolding systems chaos in the banking sector: Besides cost, there is complexity. Christian Nentwich, chief executive of Duco, a technology firm that works with banks to integrate disparate data feeds, said one bank he worked with “had setups where 20 to 30 systems were all touched in the life cycle of a single trade.” And many of those systems produced data in different formats, sometimes resulting in different names for the same trading partner.  Then there are banks like Deutsche Bank (our emphasis): Deutsche Bank’s problems have run deeper. In 2015, the CFTC charged that it had “technology-related issues,” resulting in public data reported to the market and to the CFTC that was “incomplete and inaccurate.” The bank didn’t admit to the CFTC’s conclusions, but agreed to pay $2.5 million and undertake certain corrective measures. This August, the CFTC said in a complaint filed in federal court that when Deutsche Bank tried to update its systems in April, some files were corrupted when the bank switched back and forth from a backup system. The CFTC further argued that in July, when Deutsche Bank staffers tried to update the swaps-reporting system’s link to foreign-exchange data “unbeknownst to relevant management,” the staffers “disconnected an essential computer connection.” When the system started up again and there were fewer trades than usual, the staffers assumed it was a “slow week” and didn’t report the problem, the agency said. Besides fining the bank, the CFTC and Deutsche Bank are asking a court to appoint an outside technology monitor, since this is the second year the bank has been cited for shortcomings related to the reporting of derivatives trades. Consider, meanwhile, that it was only in October 2015 that Deutsche Bank’s co-CEO John Cryan outlined in a 2020 strategy review the following: Imposing standards on our IT infrastructure is a key to improving our controls and reducing our overheads. We also want to recapture owner- ship of our intellectual property. We’ve previously aggressively pursued outsourcing and off-shoring strategies that frankly have not proven successful. Around 80% of our 7,000-or-so applications have been outsourced to thousands of vendors. Design has occurred in silos with the application of little or no common standards so that our systems are disjointed, cumbersome, and far too often just plain incompatible. Around 35% of the estate of hardware in many of our data centers is at or beyond end of life. There’s been little process re-engineering in our operations. Instead, effective or even broken processes have been off-shored or near-shored as is to achieve short-term cost savings. All of these factors, all of these facts present opportunities for improvement. With renewed investment, we can consolidate and protect our data centers. We aim to improve, cleanse and fully populate our data warehouses. We’ll shrink our operating systems down to just four from 45 at present. We’ll upgrade and replace all our end-of-life hardware and software installations by 2020. And we aim to have virtualized virtually all of our technology by then, too. Given all that, should we be surprised the entire banking is falling over itself to introduce “blockchain” — a protocol they believe could align all the varying data systems with a common standard and in so doing impose something akin to a speed and complexity limit on the market? Cue blockchain fetishism: the idea that by restricting data proliferation to an “opt in” rules-based system — a Plaza Accord for data if you will — we can finally create a network-wide productivity boom. There’s only one problem. For such a system to truly reduce the ill-effects of data chaos, it would have to be adopted universally. More challengingly still, it would also have to stay constant. Which is to say, software updates would have to be rolled out on a universal “submit or desist” basis if the system was to remain in check. How changes or updates for such a universal Gosbank system would be decided upon, however, is the critical question. Political risk and uncertainty abounds because no information protocol system is ever free from asymmetric benefits or penalties. Indeed, wherever an information asymmetry exists, an equal and opposite interest in political process and dialogue also exists. And since political process and dialogue is time consuming and cumbersome, chances are day-to-day operational decisions or mission critical ones would as ever be handed over to an increasingly powerful and unelected technocratic elite. (See the Ethereum DAO incident, as a good indicator of what may lie ahead). Scope for totalitarian-style abuse aside, it’s also the case there’s no guarantee at all that a collective “protocol” would ever be fully adhered to or prevent the propagation of rival and non-compatible blockchain systems that choose not to obey. Meanwhile, if a blockchain arms race of its own is ignited, we’d be back to square one in terms of productivity gains very quickly. As an aside, at a recent blockchain conference in London we noted the irony of attendees bemoaning today’s “paperwork crisis” with little to no acknowledgement of the “paperwork crisis” which digital innovation apparently already solved in the 1990s. So here’s a different idea. Rather than pretending resources spent on data systems in information exclusive industries (like banking) can lead to longstanding productivity gains which don’t just buy us time until the next paperwork crisis in five years time, what if we took a different tack this time? Say, for example, we took the money currently being dedicated to blockchain magic, user apps or Pokemon and redirected it towards the expansion of real-economy industrial capacity? Might the associated prosperity gains then reduce the amount of money we need to spend on checking, confirming and supervising how the remaining wealth is distributed through the financial system? A happier, wealthier and more equal society, after all, tends to be more credit worthy society as a whole. Or is that just wishful thinking?

But the technology is overshadowed by questions about how it can be made both secure and fast enough for large financial institutions. The blockchain concept aims to combine the peer-to-peer computing ethos of Silicon Valley with the money management of Wall Street, automating the networks of trust on which modern finance sits. Blockchain works as an electronic ledger of payments that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records. The ledger is shared between parties on computer servers and protected from tampering by cryptography, doing away with the need for a central authority. Its supporters believe blockchain could cut billions of dollars of hidden costs in the financial system by eliminating inefficiencies and the need for trade insurance. Switching to a blockchain system could speed up services such as global payments, trade finance, syndicated loans and equity clearing. The World Economic Forum estimates that more than 25 countries are investing in blockchain technology, filing more than 2,500 patents and investing $1.3bn. In one example last month UBS, Deutsche Bank, Santander, BNY Mellon and interdealer broker ICAP pioneered a blockchain-based digital token, which they hope could form the industry standard to clear and settle trades. To date, the most notable use of blockchain has been as a mechanism to distribute bitcoin, an electronic currency. The credibility of bitcoin has been undermined, however, by a series of scandals, from theft of assets to concerns it could be used to fund criminal activity. The financial services industry says its blockchains will have to be built on very different foundations. Huw van Steenis, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, points out that banks still need to comply with rules about verifying the identity of customers and preventing money laundering. “Not one bank nor policymaker that we have met with on blockchain gives even a second thought to an unpermissioned public network,” he wrote earlier this year. Peter Randall, chief executive of Setl, a UK blockchain start-up, says all systems must include the capacity to handle billions of trades a day, have a mechanism for approving and identifying participants and must interoperate with other chains. Even then, there is an acknowledgment that deals must ultimately be settled in central bank-backed cash. Michael Thomas, financial institutions sector partner at law firm Hogan Lovells, says the UBS-pioneered digital token was a “key step” in the technology’s development. “But clearing is complex,” he warns. “If title to an asset is to be transferred using a blockchain system, it is also important to have a system for the transfer of any corresponding cash payment for that asset — otherwise any benefits in reducing counterparty risk from the blockchain will be imperfectly realised.” Equally, disasters and scandals continue to raise questions about blockchain’s ability to build scale. In July around $70m of assets were removed from Bitfinex, a Hong Kong-based bitcoin trading venue. Details are scarce but experts on internet forums like Reddit have speculated that the flaw lay in the management and storage of the private keys to blockchain — the codes or passwords that prove ownership of digital assets. Tightening procedures and security could add significant extra costs. “Although these solutions can be highly secure, this security comes at the cost of lower efficiency and higher administrative overhead,” says Richard Johnson, a partner at Greenwich Consulting, a capital markets consultancy. “It was shortcuts taken by the Bitfinex exchange that led to the theft and not the technology itself.” Another hack in June funnelled more than $50m of digital cash away from a crowdfunded digital currency project called the Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO), which used a blockchain run by a small start-up called Ethereum. In this case the hacker exploited a vulnerability in the computer code but resolving the problem raised fundamental problems. Ethereum’s response was effectively to reset the blockchain to a pre-hack version. That set off furious debate. A key attraction of blockchains is that records cannot be altered but Ethereum in effect did just that. Furthermore, making changes in blockchain requires a consensus among participants that is at odds with the workings of the financial services industry. At present financial services companies can cancel erroneous or fraudulent transactions. For example, Barclays can cancel a fraudulent transaction it discovers in a customer account, and does not have to ask permission from a network of other banks to do so. Would blockchain cancellation rules operate differently? Mr Johnson points out that the issue will have to be addressed: “Should the industry build functionality to record or impose counteracting transactions that have the same effect as reversal but preserve the benefit of a complete historical transaction record?” That may be one solution. But at that point, critics point out, it begins to resemble existing systems.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-09-26","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/719f4e7e-80e1-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F909876c8-1b7b-11e6-b286-cddde55ca122?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"IBM in blockchain project with China UnionPay","INTRO":"US tech group and Chinese payment settlement network in loyalty scheme partnership","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Another day, another blockchain project unveiled by a bank, technology company, or consultancy. IBM will join the fray this week by announcing a partnership with China UnionPay to let bank customers exchange bonus points in different loyalty schemes. Arguing that such a project would be prohibitively complex and costly using conventional technology, IBM and China UnionPay say that it is only possible because of the blockchain system that underpins bitcoin, the cryptocurrency. The US technology group and the Chinese state-owned payment settlement network aim to eventually include all kinds of loyalty schemes in the exchange, including air miles and supermarket reward cards. Blockchain technology is a complex set of algorithms and cryptography created to allow bitcoins to be traded and verified electronically over a widely distributed network of computers without a central ledger. Having initially been sceptical about it because of worries over fraud, big banks are now exploring how they can exploit the technology to speed up back-office settlement systems and free billions in capital tied up supporting trades on global markets. IBM and China UnionPay say bank customers are often restricted in how they can spend their bonus points in loyalty schemes, so would benefit from a speedy way to exchange them for points in other banks’ schemes. He Shuo, director of China UnionPay’s Electronic Payment Research Institute, said: “Blockchain embeds trust into transactions. This along with similar innovations under way using blockchain will positively change the future of the finance industry.” IBM has developed its own blockchain solution and is working with a number of financial institutions on other projects in this area, including Bank of America and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. However, there remains significant scepticism about the potential for the largely unproven technology to transform large swaths of financial services. “Blockchain is a technology in search of a problem,” said Alexander Ross, investment executive at Illuminate Finance, a venture capital group focused on financial technology. “We are seeing a very large number of new blockchain companies but only seriously look at backing solutions that solve real world business problems.” This week has brought a flurry of announcements about blockchain projects ahead of next week’s Sibos financial conference in Geneva. Technology consultants GFT will on Friday announce a project with Royal Bank of Scotland to test the UK state-controlled bank’s blockchain initiative using a cloud platform from Google. Earlier this week, seven financial institutions, including HSBC, Citigroup and Credit Suisse, announced the launch of a blockchain system developed by Axoni to store and maintain their records of trading data. Meanwhile, Switzerland’s stock exchange announced that it was teaming up with Digital Asset Holdings, the blockchain specialist run by former JPMorgan banker Blythe Masters, to develop a prototype for post-trade securities processing.

A recent World Economic Forum survey found that most experts think blockchain — the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin — will become mainstream by 2025. So is blockchain the future of money, or is it all fantastical hype? Izabella Kaminska of FT Alphaville believes blockchain and bitcoin are a flawed solution to a problem that does not exist. Simon Taylor, co-founder and blockchain director of 11:FS, a london-based fintech company, believes cryptocurrencies will play an important economic and business role within two decades. They discussed the topic on ft.com, aided by questions and comments from FT readers and moderated by Carola Hoyos, editor of Working in Accountancy, in a debate for this report. Read the edited version below, and go to http://blogs.ft.com/tech-blog/liveblogs/2016-09-12/ for the unabridged debate and comments. Dalley Joseph, FT reader: What is blockchain technology and how will it shape the financial industry in the next decade? Simon Taylor: If you ask 10 different people what blockchain is, you get 10 different answers. I view blockchain as a collection of ideas and technology that can help solve problems of provenance and state (where does something come from and do we agree it is true?). Blockchain is not perfect, it has a long way to come. But if you want contract clauses to execute automatically and to know when they execute and who agreed, blockchain is a set of technology ideas you should look at. Blockchain is not bitcoin, which is funny money from the internet. Most regulators would like bitcoin to crawl back into the hole it came from. Izabella Kaminska: There is no proof blockchain has reduced costs at scale so it is all hypothetical at this stage. In financial services, blockchain does nothing but circumvent the rules we have imposed on banks to keep them honest. There are real moral hazards as a result, akin to those that plagued Libor. Meanwhile, the taxonomy created around blockchain is out of control. The term has lost all meaning. It is a propaganda tool, most of all — a marketing gimmick to imply innovation. ST: There is utility behind the marketing hype. Any sector that wants digital certainty can benefit if it looks past the hype. IK: I think this is a great way for banks to appear innovative and distance themselves from their old reputations. They are trying to be hip and cool. ST: It is not just hype — Barclays did a live transaction this month. IK: These trials are a fiction. They are all operating in simulations or sandboxes. It is like clinical trials of pharmaceuticals. Until you test them on actual humans with something at stake, it is a meaningless trial. Call me when Barclays has transferred or committed $100bn of value to the blockchain at its own risk. ST: Those trials will grow. I bet by 2019 we will see real numbers. Doing big numbers takes time. Taking time does not mean it is insignificant. John 9973, FT commenter: The big problem with bitcoin as a currency is that there is no mechanism for lending it. ST: There are some, but they are not profitable because bitcoin has no concept of debt. This is the point if you are a bitcoin fan, or pointless if you are in the rest of the developed world. IK: That is not true. We see bitcoin loans popping up everywhere. In fact, the Bitfinex drama — where the exchange was hacked — showed the degree to which bitcoins were being fractionally reserved. BitcoinByte, FT commenter: Should a currency be decentralised or can a state issue it? ST: That depends on your world view. Both have benefits, both have drawbacks. My view is that bitcoin is a great option for the long tail of currencies that suffer from hyperinflation but that it will not displace major currencies any time soon. IK: I partially agree with Simon on that. ST: I am not one to answer what the right incentives for a design of a system should be, but I do know banks and the economy as a whole suffer from issues in finance, such as not being able to prove the date and time something happened. Solving that has merit. Yes, there is scope for it to be abused, but also for it to be used well. Much like the internet, technology is neither intrinsically good or bad, it just is. IK: I do not think it will help the inflationary currencies all that much. The key thing that will help them is the ability to create prosperity, which is constrained by other more egregious social problems. Many countries already do not use domestic currencies because they do not trust them. That does not solve their socio-economic ills. Much like the internet, technology is neither intrinsically good or bad, it just is ST: I like the idea of a censorship-resistant record such as bitcoin for something like land registry in emerging markets. If I can prove the legal title has not been fraudulently changed, that is a good step. It does not end fraud or crime, but it makes some types of it harder. IK: The problem with that view is that finance is subjective and social. And you cannot strip that out of the system by making it wishfully comply with some sort of idealised protocol. We can prove title already by registering it with a trusted notary or foreign accountant. Carola Hoyos: What will happen to accountants working at the Big Four — Deloitte, PwC, EY and KPMG — and beyond if we move into a world of distributed ledger accounting, blockchain and bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies? ST: I think the Big Four’s tools will change, but practices will be very similar. Blockchain does nothing but circumvent the rules we have imposed on banks to keep them honest IK: My view is that bitcoin is basically a single entry system. It takes us to the world before Luca Pacioli, the 15th century mathematician who is widely seen as the father of accounting. You can track one side of the ledger perfectly, but it gives you no control over the other side. We do not know if there is a delay in the delivery. Also, the real delivery of goods takes time. If I pay on eBay using bitcoin for a pair of shoes and then do not receive them, eBay takes the risk. It has the ability to withhold funds until the shoes arrive. If I was to do the same trade on the open internet using bitcoin, it would be a caveat emptor nightmare for everyone, which would paralyse trade. ST: They will use a new tool to ensure a transaction happened and they can show their working in maths as well as with independence, or in some cases a stamp. In a world where we still frank letters for international trade, and that postage alone costs $40bn, better use of digital signatures and proof of tamper resistance is a good thing. IK: My point is that distributed ledger accounting is a nothing new under the sun situation, and that a lot of these “solutions” are very similar to those we have always come up with to regulate incentive and game theory problems. ST: From a game theory perspective, little is new . . . what is new is the tool we use to implement a given solution.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Izabella Kaminska Simon Taylor Carola Hoyos","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-09-22","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/ee6d8454-7f27-11e6-bc52-0c7211ef3198","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fee0a5718-1b7b-11e6-b286-cddde55ca122?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Asset managers quick to adopt blockchain","INTRO":"Research finds two-thirds of firms will use technology by 2021","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain — the transaction database technology underpinning the bitcoin currency — is being used by hundreds of investment companies and wealth managers around the world, as more businesses see its potential to transform financial services. Research by Roubini ThoughtLab has found that 225 of the 500 asset managers it surveyed had implemented the technology, which allows transactions to be verified electronically over a network of computers, with no central ledger. Overall, two-thirds of the companies questioned said they expected to be using blockchain within five years. For financial services groups, blockchain is attractive as it means there is no intermediary to pay for certain transactions — offering scope to cut costs. A Santander report published in 2015 suggested that global banks could save up to $20bn a year by 2022 by implementing the nascent technology. However, the widespread introduction of blockchain could also drive many ill-prepared asset managers out of business, according to the Wealth and Asset Management 2021 report by Roubini ThoughtLab — a consultancy co-founded by author and economist Nouriel Roubini. “Technology is a tsunami that will radically change the face of financial services,” Prof Roubini said. “The losers will be those companies that are not nimble enough to adopt the new technology — and a lot of them may disappear.” Workers in the sector may also suffer, said Prof Roubini, who when working as a US Treasury official was best known for predicting the US housing crisis of 2007-08. “As you adopt technologies that are capital intensive and offer labour savings, a lot of the workers not in highly skilled positions in financial services will be replaced by software, robots and machines,” he said. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2027, assets equivalent to 10 per cent of global GDP could be held on a blockchain. “We’re moving from the ‘internet of information’ to an ‘internet of value’ where a lot of what financial services firms normally do — namely acting as a trusted intermediary between parties who may not know each other — can be significantly automated and improved,” said Alex Tapscott, co-author of the book Blockchain Revolution, in the Roubini ThoughtLab report. “That has a direct impact on the world of investment services.” But the costs of implementing new technologies — including social media, analytics and mobile apps, as well as blockchain — could prove prohibitively high for some smaller firms. UBS, for example, is investing SFr1bn in new technologies across the spectrum. If blockchain can cut transaction costs, though, it might ultimately give lower-income investors greater — and cheaper — access to markets. “Many more people are interested in both the macro and local markets than ever before,” said Yoni Assia, chief executive of eToro, a social trading site based in Israel. “But very few people actually act on these ideas. Now, with a very low barrier to entry, it means more people have the chance to enter the capital markets world of trading and investing.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hugo Greenhalgh","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-09-21","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f5cd6754-7e83-11e6-8e50-8ec15fb462f4","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fee0a5718-1b7b-11e6-b286-cddde55ca122?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Accenture to unveil blockchain editing technique","INTRO":"Consultancy says prototype, aimed at financial services industry, will amend information stored","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Accenture is courting controversy in the blockchain community by patenting a technique for editing information stored using the nascent technology in a move designed to make it more commercially viable. By allowing a central administrator to amend or delete information stored on a blockchain, the consultancy says that its prototype — to be unveiled on Tuesday — will make the technology more attractive to the financial services industry. However, to many diehard fans of the technology underpinning the cryptocurrency bitcoin, the move threatens one of its founding principles: that a blockchain should be an immutable ledger of events without the need for a central authority. Blockchain technology is a complex set of algorithms and cryptography created to allow bitcoins to be traded and verified electronically over a widely distributed network of computers without a central ledger. Having initially been sceptical about it because of worries over fraud, big banks are now exploring how they can exploit the technology to speed up back-office settlement systems and free billions in capital tied up supporting trades on global markets. Richard Lumb, global head of financial services at Accenture, told the Financial Times that financial institutions and regulators would need a means to quickly correct errors on the blockchain before using it in securities markets. He gave the example of a “fat finger” trading error, or a trade assigned to the wrong counterparty. This prototype allows you expunge a record completely and we think that will be needed by corporates and regulators “What we are talking about is adapting the blockchain to the corporate world and how do we make it pragmatic and useful for the financial services sector,” he said. “This prototype allows you expunge a record completely and we think that will be needed by corporates and regulators.” He drew a distinction between the need for an editing function on the invitation-only, “permissioned” blockchains that most banks are looking at establishing and the open, “permissionless” blockchains, such as bitcoin, where immutability is a key feature. Accenture and Giuseppe Ateniese, a professor at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey, have filed a patent for their technology in the US and Europe. It uses a technique called the “chameleon hash” to add a type of padlock between units in a blockchain that allows an administrator with the key to unlock and edit them.  Mr Lumb said the prototype would have provided a quick solution to the problem of how to recover the more than $50m stolen this year from the DAO, a crowdsourced venture capital fund using the Ether cryptocurrency. Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker running Digital Asset Holdings, a blockchain specialist, has reviewed Accenture’s prototype. “Accenture’s approach is one of several options in the toolbox,” said Ms Masters. “But we think it is innovative and can strike the right balance between preserving blockchain’s key features and adapting it for real-world requirements within some permissioned systems.” After Mr Lumb wrote about the need to edit the blockchain in the New York Times last week, he has been criticised by several bitcoin supporters. Rocky wrote on the Crypto Hustle website: “The narrative of mutable private blockchains may be a symptom of financial institutions trying to use technology that was never built for them. In fact, the entire purpose of a blockchain is to circumvent those very institutions.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-09-19","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/d65ddd3e-ff34-3d57-b91c-578ee84db333","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F06%2F14180157%2FScreen-Shot-2017-06-14-at-18.01.39.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain’s governance paradox","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Distributed ledger technologies “are starting to look an awful lot like some of the more conventional technical solutions that we have,” says Prof. Vili Lehdonvirta, an associate professor and senior research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, at a recent talk he gave at the Alan Turing Institute. At the heart of the issue (as always) is who dictates and enforces the rules of the system if and when things go wrong, according to Lehdonvirta. He echoes a point we’ve long made, namely, that what really matters in these systems is how they deal with exceptions rather than norms. The industry’s continuous shifting of nomenclature hints at the inherent challenges and revisionism at hand. As blockchains become DLTs, shared databases and permissioned consensus networks, what the techies working on these systems fail to publicly highlight is that much of the time, “advance” means returning to tried and tested paradigms, or reintroducing trusted or governance-focused nodes. Albeit, the “back to square one” solution isn’t unique to blockchain. We see the same pattern playing out across the network/platform industry. For example, Airbnb was built on the notion that peers could organise accommodation for each other bilaterally without any dependence on a centralised manager. As time went on, however, trust issues across the platform — everything from fraud, misrepresentation, bad consumer experience, abuse, vandalism or damage — forced the once proudly employee-light company to load up on staff who could troubleshoot many of these problems. In so doing, Airbnb — much like Ebay before it — transformed itself from a tech company into an adjudicator, value custodian and rules-and-standards authority. And by and large, that’s not been an unwelcome transformation, from the consumer’s perspective. Indeed, what libertarian tech anarchists often fail to understand is that the public is not opposed to the idea of putting their trust in institutions, especially when they’re operated by real people who can be held accountable for things going wrong. What they seemingly understand and technologists don’t is this: Trusting other parties to protect, enforce and adjudicate the rules of operation enhances division of labour and thus efficiency. I no longer have to waste hours of time trying to figure out if the counterparty I’ve dealt with on Ebay is trustworthy or not. Ebay governs the platform in such a way that I can be confident failed trades will always be compensated, and that Ebay’s own judgement about compensation entitlement will always be fair. After all, its continuing reputation as an efficient exchange platform depends on it. But back to blockchian. As Lehdonvirta observes, the vision of blockchain is of a system which can enforce contracts, prevent double spending, and cap the money supply pool without ceding power to anyone: No rent-seeking, no abuses of power, no politics — blockchain technologies can be used to create “math-based money” and “unstoppable” contracts that are enforced with the impartiality of a machine instead of the imperfect and capricious human bureaucracy of a state or a bank. This is why so many people are so excited about blockchain: its supposed ability change economic organization in a way that transforms dominant relationships of power. The problem which blockchain claims to have solved, in other words, is a rule-enforcement one, not a technological one. And yet, here’s the rub. From Lehdonvirta: Unfortunately this turns out to be a naive understanding of blockchain, and the reality is inevitably less exciting. Let me explain why. In economic organization, we must distinguish between enforcing rules and making rules. Laws are rules enforced by state bureaucracy and made by a legislature. The SWIFT Protocol is a set of rules enforced by SWIFTNet (a centralized computational system) and made, ultimately, by SWIFT’s Board of Directors. The Bitcoin Protocol is a set of rules enforced by the Bitcoin Network (a distributed network of computers) made by — whom exactly? Who makes the rules matters at least as much as who enforces them. Blockchain technology may provide for completely impartial rule-enforcement, but that is of little comfort if the rules themselves are changed. This rule-making is what we refer to as governance. Unfortunately for blockchain fanatics, there is no formal process for how governance works in bitcoin. Lehdonvirta says this is because for a long time the underlying politics were overlooked. …many people don’t recognize them, preferring instead the idea that Bitcoin is purely “math-based money” and that all the developers are doing is purely apolitical plumbing work. But what has started to make this position untenable and Bitcoin’s politics visible is the so-called “block size debate” — a big disagreement between factions of the Bitcoin community over the future direction of the rules. Whatever model of the blockchain is employed, the fundamental problem of governance remains, says Lehdonvirta. What’s more, if it was somehow resolved… you’d no longer need a blockchain. After all, as Lehdonvirta also observes, in performance terms, existing blockchain technologies are in many ways inferior to more conventional technologies. In other blockchain news, Morgan Stanley has publicly acknowledged that while there are many blockchain proofs of concepts in process globally, there remains no killer app on the market as yet. The bank, however, fails to formerly address the scale of governance paradox even though it does state this: As we have written previously, a killer app is likely to emerge in concentrated markets: a market with concentrated leaders could more easily set up standards and governance protocols and have less issues aligning incentives and sharing costs. The future may be micro blockchains! Or better still, corporate specific blockchains! (Aka corporate databases which only certain people or divisions can amend unilaterally, and which whole teams need to sign off on before things can be permanently deleted or revised.)

Experts say demand for blockchain expertise is far outstripping supply, making it one of the hottest areas for technology recruitment. As thousands of blockchain-based start-ups are being created, established companies in many sectors from financial services to retail are scrambling to get to grips with what the new systems can do. “Is there a talent bubble? Yes. We haven’t even seen it yet,” said Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s vice-president of blockchain technologies. “There is an entirely new way for businesses to interact — it is awesome and as this takes root it will be revolutionary.” The best blockchain engineers can command a salary above $250,000, Mr Cuomo said. “It is on the high side of what a really talented consultant or software engineer can earn,” he added. “Demand is exceeding supply, so we are seeing shortages. It is up there with the cloud and artificial intelligence as a really hot area.” Blockchains are a decentralised settlement technology that powers the issuance of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, the value of which soared to more than $2,500 last week, up almost fivefold in the past year. LinkedIn data requested by the Financial Times show there were more than 1,000 blockchain-related job adverts on the site last week, more than treble the level of a year ago. The number of blockchain ads is growing at more than 40 per cent each quarter. Almost 10,000 people on LinkedIn list blockchain as a skill, half of them in the technology industry and a quarter in the financial services sector. LinkedIn does not include blockchain among its official list of skills, but so many people are citing it as a custom skill that the site is considering adding it to the ones it formally tracks. “Professionals in related areas such as cryptography and machine learning may want to look at the roles available and the skills they need to develop, as there is certainly a growing demand within the technology, finance and insurance industries for blockchain expertise,” said Josh Graff, UK country manager at LinkedIn. Blockchain technology has attracted renewed interest in the past few weeks thanks to virtual tokens being issued by companies to raise money via an “initial coin offering” as an alternative to selling shares. In total, there are more than 850 different cryptocurrencies with a total market capitalisation above $92bn — more than Goldman Sachs, Ford or Nike — according to coinmarketcap.com. “It is a hot market at the moment because most of the large corporates want to be able to say they have a blockchain team,” said Michael Mainelli, who runs blockchain training courses for senior executives and boards at his consultancy Z/Yen. The majority of the people listing blockchain as a skill on LinkedIn are based in the US, followed by the UK, France, India, Germany and the Netherlands.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-06-05","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/0288caea-7382-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Ffeaeb37c-75b0-11e6-bf48-b372cdb1043a?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Banks find blockchain hard to put into practice","INTRO":"Unprecedented transparency of transactions sits uneasily with financiers","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Banks are rushing to adopt blockchain — the database technology that underpins bitcoin — in order to cut costs, but technologists and business people are having to make drastic changes to force the radical technology to adhere to the norms of the banking world. The digital currency bitcoin was invented in 2009 an attempt to build an alternative system of money beyond the control of governments and central banks. Although bankers distrusted the bitcoin concept, the blockchain technology underpinning it was seen as having a number of useful features. Blockchain is shared among a large number of users, which makes it difficult to shut down or hack; transactions can’t be reversed; and it is transparent, allowing trades to be viewed and verified by anyone using the system. These all initially had appeal for financial services companies — but they may prove difficult to put into practice. The unprecedented transparency of transactions sits uneasily with the privacy needs of secretive bankers, whose plans for blockchain diverge from the aims of bitcoin’s advocates. “The problem they were trying to solve is central bank money,” says Simon Taylor, co-founder of fintech consultancy 11:FS and former blockchain lead at Barclays. “But if you’re a bank or central bank that’s not your ideology.” The prevailing “ideology” in banking today is efficiency. Tighter regulation, new competition from technology companies and the low central bank interest rates, which seem likely to persist, have forced the banking sector to look seriously at reducing costs wherever they can. The hope is that using shared database technology like blockchain can help increase the speed and reduce the cost of activities such as settlement and clearing by automating back-office functions with systems that would be shared across the banking sector. “Pre-2008 the industry would not have lifted a finger to do certain shared things, which may save a hundred million dollars, but now a hundred million dollars is a lot of money and people are now prepared to work together to cut costs,” says Richard Lumb, chief executive of the financial services group at Accenture.  There are a problems to overcome, however. A shared system for executing transactions, if built like bitcoin, could allow rival banks to spy on each other’s activities. Additionally, making such a database immutable raises the possibility that fat-finger trades, where an additional zero is accidentally inserted into a transaction, for example, could not be reversed, resulting in the potential for unexpected losses. There are also questions of scalability: if data are replicated across all the banks using a shared settlement system — the bitcoin model — it potentially becomes too cumbersome. “You get something called bloat, and the more bloat you get the slower the system goes,” said Peter Randall, chief executive of Setl, a London-based company building a blockchain and distributed ledger system for financial services.  As a result, the discussions about implementing blockchain-like technologies in financial services involve diluting the pure bitcoin dream. The phrase “blockchain without bitcoin” is a commonly used buzzword, though it suggests a simplicity that belies the differences, according to Mr Taylor of 11:FS. The proper analogy is not of replacing the engine in a car, he said, but of the differences between a car and a boat. “We might still use the idea that there is a driver, and that it moves and it has an engine, but we’d put it on water rather than on the roads,” he says. Instead of sharing data with all participants, ideas being discussed involve ensuring that only counterparties, regulators and other appropriate parties can view the details of a trade. Worries about immutability are perhaps overstated. The answer, says Mr Randall of Setl, is simply “do an equal and opposite transaction to set the record straight”.  Advocates say that the result has been a technology that seems, to the untrained eye, to be less radical than originally envisaged by bitcoin’s proponents. “If you’re a business guy you could look at the current construct versus the new construct and say ‘aren’t you just building a big database?’,” says Charley Cooper, managing director at R3, a consortium of 60 financial services institutions working on blockchain. Indeed, that is the view of some commentators, who have argued that rather than being an innovation, blockchain is just another database with the right amount of “cool” to persuade cost-conscious bankers to work together — an advance in marketing rather than technology. But Mr Taylor disagrees: “We had distributed databases before, we didn’t have distributed databases where the maths proved tamper-resistant among a number of entities.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Kadhim Shubber","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-09-12","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/3a9ef8d8-33d5-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fe431222c-7188-11e6-9ac1-1055824ca907?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain can create financial sector jobs as well as kill them","INTRO":"Some roles will vanish, but new skills will create opportunities","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Some see it as the biggest change in technology since the advent of the internet. Others say claims for what blockchain can do are overblown. But those among the former group are now asking how the blockchain technology that underpins so-called cryptocurrencies, which include bitcoin, will affect jobs, particularly in the financial sector. Banks, clearing houses and exchanges are already eyeing the potential savings. Blockchain technology provides a way to continuously maintain and verify digital records in “blocks” that can be shared between various parties. Also called “distributed ledger technology”, it means ledgers can be updated instantly in any number of locations. The information can never be erased. “In basic terms, the blockchain is a public record of transactions,” says Amy Webb, founder of the Future Today Institute, a US-based forecasting and strategy firm. “This may seem less secure than a private record but as that transaction is made, the transaction itself becomes part of the ledger and all the data around that is encrypted.” Blockchain has the potential to handle a wide range of transactions managed by humans. “If you’re buying a house, there’s a mountain of paperwork and authentication and it requires a person to do it,” says Ms Webb. Blockchain makes it easier and more secure, and reduces the need for real estate brokers. Most applications are in the experimental stages, says Leda Glyptis, a director at Sapient Global Markets, a US-based capital and commodities markets technology consultancy: “It has been able to cope with everything we’ve thrown at it, but we haven’t thrown that much at it outside the laboratory.” However, banks, insurers and other financial institutions are interested in blockchain as a way to increase security and efficiency and to lower costs. Last month, four of the world’s biggest banks, UBS, Deutsche Bank, Santander and BNY Mellon, and broker ICAP, said they had teamed up to develop an industry standard to clear and settle financial trades over blockchain. In June, Allianz Risk Transfer, part of Allianz Group, and Nephila Capital, a specialist investment manager, said they had piloted the use of blockchain for processing and settling transactions in bonds and swaps (financial instruments that transfer risk from insurers to investors or other insurers) for natural catastrophes. Earlier in 2016, the Australian Securities Exchange said it would work with US-based Digital Asset Holdings to create a system based on blockchain for clearing and settling trades in the Australian equity market. The job of anyone who is keeping track of assets is very much at risk “If it could be made to work there, it could be copied within a year or two all around the world,” says David Yermack, professor of finance and business transformation at NYU’s Stern School of Business. Blockchain’s peer-to-peer model of transaction verification has important implications for financial services jobs, he says: “When you think of anyone who is keeping track of assets, I’d say their job is very much at risk, because of this technology.” Jobs potentially in jeopardy include those involving tasks such as processing and reconciling transactions and verifying documentation. Blockchain, says Ms Glyptis, allows transactions to be timestamped and finalised, with a mathematically proven method for confirming a transaction is valid. “The first area that would be hit would be any reconciliation or post-reconciliation activities — you just wouldn’t need to do it.”  Others are more circumspect about potential workplace upheaval. Steve Wilson, principal analyst at Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research, says blockchain technology decentralises only the verification of the order of entries in a ledger, and not its contents. Auditors and agents will still be checking the truth underlying the entries. Nevertheless, the nature of such jobs is likely to evolve. “You’d be hard-pressed to believe it’s not going to dismantle some of the infrastructure in the financial services sector and remove jobs,” says Vaughan Jenkins, a financial services specialist at PA Consulting Group. An example of the new skills blockchain could require is security: Ms Glyptis says that while blockchain creates an immutable record that is resistant to tampering, fraud may still occur at any stage in the process but will be captured in the record and therefore easily detected. This is where she predicts new job opportunities. “I can see a whole class of professions around encryption and identity protection,” she says. “Even though some jobs will disappear, we’re acquiring needs we’ve never had before around things that are more valuable than they ever were before.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Sarah Murray","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-09-07","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/5f1ee3fa-b5df-3747-b373-dcaca7292162","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville-cdn.ft.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F06%2F01161852%2FScreen-Shot-2017-06-01-at-16.18.39.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"It’s not just a Ponzi, it’s a ‘smart’ Ponzi","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Hat tip to Bloomberg’s Matt Levine for drawing our attention to this paper from a bunch of academics at the University of Cagliari in Italy examining the Ethereum blockchain’s tendency to incubate Ponzi schemes. As a whole, they note, Ethereum has managed to generate an unholy amount of Ponzi schemes in its mere 1.5 years of existence. Moreover, the paper doesn’t even account for the recent spell of ICO madness. (Current market cap of the cryptocurrency sector: $85bn, btw.) The uniqueness of the “smart Ponzi” is its capacity to protect the identity of the initiator but also its ability to persist even after being exposed. Since contracts are unmodifiable and thus unstoppable there is no central authority to terminate the execution of the scheme or force the initiator to refund victims. What’s more, the inability to shut it down means victims can be led to believe the scheme will last forever. Fascinatingly, the academics add, not all the smart-contract based Ponzis are even public. Many are “hidden” and run by operators who hide the associated addresses — so what we’re seeing may just be the tip of the iceberg. Here’s the conclusion of the paper, with the most interesting bits highlighted by us: Blockchains and smart contracts might really be the next “disruptive” technology, as many companies, newspapers, and researchers start to believe. However, they can also offer new opportunities to tax-evaders, criminals, and fraudsters, who can take advantage of their anonymity and decentralization. In this survey we have analysed the impact of Ponzi schemes on Ethereum, the most flexible and widespread platform for smart contracts so far, with a market capitalization that has reached $8 billion. Overall, we have observed that, in these first 1.5 years of life of Ethereum, there have been a multitude of experiments to implement Ponzi schemes as smart contracts: indeed, ∼ 10% of the 1384 contracts with verified source code on etherscan.io are Ponzi schemes. However, the impact of these experiments is still limited, as only ∼ 0.05% of the transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are related to Ponzi schemes. Still, it is foreseeable that, as Ethereum consolidates its position as a platform for smart contracts and as a cryptocurrency, criminals will exploit it to host their scams. Besides the growth of traditional Ponzi schemes accepting ether, we expect a second wave of Ponzi schemes, but very likely they will be less recognizable as such than the ones collected in this survey. For instance, they could mix multi-level marketing, token sales, and games, to realize complex smart contracts, which would be very hard to correctly classify as Ponzi schemes or legit investments. Our analysis suggests that there is still time to devise suitable policy interventions, and provides a first understanding of the issues that must be tackled in this direction. And herein lies the issue with ICOs. Currently, they exist in the crevices of the law, exploiting an ambiguous state to the benefit of fraudsters. That may not always be the case, because the law will eventually adapt to limit the ambiguity. But while the academics say blockchains “might really be the next ‘disruptive’ technology”, and consider the fraud to be only a side effect, we are less convinced. For the most part, the question that really needs asking is this: What sort of legitimate organisation really benefits from a decentralised or headless state? Also, what sort of company benefits from decentralised funding options or from providing decentralised services? The answer is almost none. Decentralisation is, in almost all cases, not an efficiency. To the contrary, it’s a cost that adds complexity and creates an unnecessary burden for both users and operators unless centralised layers are added on top of it — defying the whole point. Decentralisation also undermines professional and corporate accountability. If no-one is prepared to take credit for building an organisation which adds value to society, it implies there’s either an unheard scale of altruism at play or the organisation in question is probably not adding value to society because there’s no real credit to claim. At the end of the day, there are only two groups of people prepared to go to costly lengths to decentralise a service which is already available (in what is often a much higher quality form) in a centralised or conventional hierarchal state. One group is criminals and fraudsters. The other is ideologues and cultists. The first sees the additional cost/effort as worthwhile due to the un-censorable utility of these systems. The second consumes it simply as a luxury or cultured good. For the most part, there is no logic to putting something on a blockchain just because “disruptive technology”. Case in point, here’s an ICO that wants to put medical records on the blockchain so that “healthcare entities can secure private health information, rent computing power, servers and data centers and make their unused resources available through a unique private infrastructure”. But why? What is there to secure? It’s not privacy, because a centralised system can be encrypted just as much as a blockchain-based one. It’s not for the benefit of additional robustness or defence from hacking, either — a distributed system is no better at preventing an institution from losing access to those records because of key loss by way of accident or hacking (at least current back-ups are arm’s length and often on different networks). And it’s not for personal empowerment, because who really wants their medical records to be unavailable to doctors when they’re unconscious because only they have the password? Last of all, if healthcare entities were in the business of renting unused computing resources they wouldn’t be healthcare entities. They’d be cloud companies. That’s not to say inefficient products are always undesirable (think artisanal bread, coffee, luxury goods etc), but let’s not kid ourselves that it’s not costly to broader society. Or that incubating a Ponzi machine is a progressive move. On that note, here’s a piece by Chris DeRose, a rare critical mind in this space, on the ICO “token” phenomenon which makes the point, among other things, that: ‘Tokens’ have preexisted blockchain by decades, and are in widespread use in incumbent data systems. The only new ‘development’ that is causing the rise in these platforms, is the lack of SEC action in response to increasingly aggressive fundraiser claims. DeRose also adds this very important point: Members of the ICO promoters and marketers are generally given inventory, alongside insider information in the venture, and use this position to exit their risk onto investors immediately after ‘going public’ (and before building a product). While concluding: For the ICOs that have already run their course, victims will not speak out. They believe that either they themselves are fully responsible for their loss, or that they would not be able to exit their meager positions by doing so. There is no ICO success story. Like all ponzis, ICOs are nearly guaranteed to be profitable until the time at which capital inflow has ceased. The success stories merely exist amongst the lucky, or those with insider information on when to pull out of the schemes. Nicely put. So where’s the SEC?

From established names such as UBS and Santander to new fintech companies Ripple and R3, many in the industry are eager to rip out old systems of moving money and replace them with quicker and cheaper blockchain technology. Developed as a technology to underpinning digital currency bitcoin, blockchain allows transactions to be verified electronically over a network of computers, with no central ledger. However, cyber criminals have targeted companies using blockchain and digital currencies, attacking DAO and Bitfinex in recent months. The DAO was a kind of crowdsourced venture capital fund that allowed people to make investments using Ether, another digital currency. It had raised over $150m in May, only to have more than 50M drained by cyber criminals in June, cutting the value of the currency by a third. Bitfinex, a Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange, lost about $65m in a cyber attack in August. Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase, a San Francisco-based start-up where merchants and traders can buy and sell digital currency, says blockchain will become more secure with time. “I think at the beginning you’ll have people who screw up with it. It is true of any new technology, people have to get used to it,” he says. Even before these attacks, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of US regulators, warned that because these systems, known generically as distributed ledgers, were new, flaws might not become clear until they were “deployed at scale”. “Like most new technologies, distributed ledger systems also pose certain risks and uncertainties which market participant and financial regulators will need to monitor,” the Council said. One of the most serious problems is that some cryptocurrency companies rely on new programming code. It is hard to anticipate what the flaws are in new code or a new programming language, as there has not been a history of specialists examining it for flaws.  Stefan Thomas, chief technology officer of San Francisco-based Ripple, which is creating its own blockchain-like network for banks, says. “There’s no history of how to write secure code,” he says. “It is not surprising that it would be easy to miss typical problems.” Another problem is how to store cryptocurrencies. Some companies keep digital cash like a modern bank — with many accounts’ money mixing in one great pot — and others keep it locked up in individual encrypted packets, much like an old-fashioned security box. The best practice is to avoid using “hot wallets”, connected to the internet, and instead use “cold storage” on servers that are not online and are more difficult to hack without physical access to the server. Following the attack, Bitfinex said it had moved funds to the disconnected servers, as well as taking other security precautions. Coinbase keeps 98 per cent of its bitcoin in “cold storage” and has insurance to cover the value of the rest, Mr Ehrsam says.  Experts are divided over whether the public nature of blockchain helps or hinders security. Mr Thomas argues that a public network, which is constantly tested and examined, is better than the “security by obscurity” that features in the current banking system. Security comes from few people understanding how it works, but if someone does figure it out they can find vulnerabilities, Mr Thomas says, as did the cyber criminals who diverted $81m from the Bangladesh Central Bank in the Swift attack earlier this year. IBM is creating a blockchain where all participants are verified but — as it can scale to millions of people — this gives the added security of more eyes watching each transaction, argues Arvind Krishna, senior vice-president, IBM Research. “Since everybody has to agree to the transaction it is a lot more secure than what we have today, where all you have to do is get in to one computer,” he says.  Ripple and R3, a London-based fintech start-up, are both looking to take the best of blockchain and build it in a private sphere, catering to large financial institutions. This allows them to adapt the security of the network. For example, Ripple adds the ability to freeze funds — a “sort of backstop that allows us to react to attacks”, Mr Thomas says. Richard Gendal Brown, chief technology officer at R3, says the start-up was building a blockchain-style distributed ledger but only for regulated financial institutions, where everyone identifies themselves with keys on the network. Authentication — proving you are who you are — is a struggle for every network, from online banking apps to Facebook, but R3 tries to address it by limiting the spread of information about transactions.  “We took a very different design choice and said, ‘we are not a gossip network where we send data to everyone’. We have a more traditional architecture point-to-point messaging, sending information only to those who need to validate the transaction,” Mr Gendal Brown says. At Coinbase, Mr Ehrsam remains optimistic that, in the long run, blockchain will create a more transparent system in which it is far easier to see if money is being stolen and people can learn from others’ mistakes. At the moment it often takes retailers months to realise that they are all being hit by similar cyber attacks to steal credit card details. A blockchain system would show up such patterns much more quickly. “While it may seem scarier in the earlier days, I think ultimately the blockchain creates a safer world,” he says.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hannah Kuchler","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-09-12","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/483e315e-6fa6-11e6-a0c9-1365ce54b926","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fb0dd2862-6fc1-11e6-a0c9-1365ce54b926?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Visa eyes new link in blockchain payments","INTRO":"Credit card company invites lenders to test interbank transfer system based on bitcoin technology","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Visa will take its first step towards disrupting the market for payments between banks on Thursday by inviting lenders to test a system for sending money over blockchain, the technology underpinning bitcoin. The credit card company, which has been investigating blockchain’s potential for 18 months, has teamed up with BTL Group, a digital payments start-up, to adapt its technology for processing interbank payments. Visa’s move underlines how many of the biggest financial services companies have switched in the past two years from once viewing bitcoin with suspicion to now scrambling to harness the power of the cryptocurrency’s underlying technology. A blockchain is a shared digital database that allows transactions to be recorded and verified electronically over a network of computers without a central ledger. Cryptography is used to protect the data from fraud or hackers. Hendrik Kleinsmiede, co-founder of Visa Europe Collab — the company’s innovation hub — will say in a blog post that Visa’s latest project is designed to “reduce the friction of domestic and cross-border transfers between banks”. “We’re now inviting a small number of European banks to participate in the project alongside us and BTL,” he will say. “Participating banks will be able to connect to the network and send funds to other banks in the network across multiple currencies.” The project is designed to cut costs, speed up settlement time and reduce credit risk in the market for moving money between banks both domestically and across borders. It could represent a challenge to the Swift interbank payment system, the main messaging system used by banks to handle large money transfers. Swift has recognised the potential threat and has itself been examining blockchain’s potential. BTL was founded last year by the brothers Guy and Hugh Halford-Thomson, who previously ran a bitcoin brokerage and operated the UK’s first bitcoin ATM, which was once used by George Osborne, the former chancellor. The project being developed with Visa uses smart contracts — code written on to the blockchain that automatically carries out certain actions — to handle much of the regulatory and compliance requirements of interbank transfers.  The smart contracts could reduce the counterparty risk of cross-border transfers by making them simultaneous, rather than leaving one lender on the hook for a time, Guy Halford-Thomson told the Financial Times. Mr Kleinsmiede said Visa aimed to complete the “proof of concept” within 100 days, by which time he expected to have found banks to send money between each other using the blockchain technology. “Through the use of smart contracts and blockchains I believe we can create a fast, compliant and low-cost interbank payment and settlement service, with embedded regional compliance,” he said. Visa’s innovation lab has already announced other projects involving blockchain technology, including micropayments, machine-to-machine transfers and business-to-business payments. Last week, four of the world’s biggest banks — UBS, Santander, Deutsche Bank and BNY Mellon — announced they had teamed up with broker ICAP and technology developer Clearmatics to develop a form of digital cash that they believe will become an industry standard to clear and settle financial trades over blockchain.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-09-01","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/45851b58-62d1-11e6-8310-ecf0bddad227","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fbef8f600-70ee-11e6-a0c9-1365ce54b926?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"New Australian Securities Exchange chief defends blockchain plans","INTRO":"Dominic Stevens, new chief executive, prepares for radical upgrade of the bourse’s technology","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The new head of Australia’s primary stock exchange has defended the bourse’s radical and controversial plans to upgrade its systems using blockchain technology. Dominic Stevens was appointed chief executive and managing director of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in August after its former chief executive, Elmer Funke Kupper, resigned following allegations of foreign bribery at Tabcorp, a leisure and gaming company he previously headed. He takes over at a time when ASX’s business — which includes listings, market trading, clearing and settlement — is facing intense competition. Rivals are challenging its dominance in the Australian market at a time when the government is ending ASX’s monopoly on equity clearing. “We are going through a transformation in technology,” says Mr Stevens, who became a non-executive director of ASX in December 2013. “The other challenge [is about being] able to engage with our customers better, so they hold ASX’s services in high regard.” In a test case for applying blockchain technology to markets, ASX has partnered with Digital Asset Holdings, a fintech company, to develop a new back office system as part of a broader technology overhaul at the exchange. Proponents of blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrency bitcoin, say it has the potential to slice costs out of the financial sector, chiefly by streamlining the backroom processes of payments and settlements. “We’re working with Digital Asset Holdings on trying to get to a stage where we could contemplate [replacing ASX’s clearing system],” Mr Stevens says. “That’s quite a project.” ASX’s system is 22 years old and is central to its ability to clear and settle trades, as well as being a register for listed company shares. Should ASX manage to replace it with a blockchain system, there may be other opportunities for growing the business, Mr Stevens says. ASX has spent $17.4m on an 8.5 per cent stake in Digital Asset Holdings, which is headed by former JPMorgan Chase executive Blythe Masters. The start-up has attracted big backers, including Deutsche Börse Group and ICAP, the interdealer broker. But critics say ASX has not consulted its users enough over the proposed upgrade. John Fildes, chief executive of Chi-X Australia, which is both a competitor and a customer of ASX, says brokers would prefer ASX to replace its clearing system with an industry standard protocol, which is a uniform way for messages to be sent between brokers and an exchange in order to clear and settle trades. “It is an extra cost burden not to use globally implemented systems,” Mr Fildes says. In a recent presentation to analysts and media, ASX attempted to allay such fears, making a distinction between a public blockchain, such as those developed for cryptocurrencies, and the private technology being considered by the company. ASX says it has begun seeking feedback from its customers, having examined the technical and regulatory aspects of blockchain for six months. “We are consulting on taking what was a prototype that we built and turning that into something much more industrial-strength,” says Peter Hiom, ASX’s deputy chief executive. “A significant engagement with our clearing and settlement participants is about to start.” ASX will make a final decision on the technology in the financial year that ends in June 2018. Other organisations are also considering bringing blockchain to the Australian market. Setl, a UK provider of blockchain technology for settlements and payments, is working with financial administration company Computershare to establish securities ownership registers, or records of who owns shares and other financial instruments. “The focus of competition [in the Australian market] has subtly shifted from ‘front-office’ infrastructure to the much more complex and expensive ‘post-trade’ processes,” says Setl chief executive Peter Randall. ASX’s move to new technology comes amid a wave of consolidation in the sector. The €24 billion merger between the London Stock Exchange Group and Deutsche Börse was recently approved by both companies’ shareholders. Meanwhile, shareholders in the Baltic Exchange have also agreed to its acquisition by SGX, the Singaporean bourse. Nonetheless, Mr Stevens says international consolidation is not in his immediate plans. “There’s nothing on my agenda at this stage, but no one ever rules out anything,” he says.  In 2011 the Labor government blocked an A$8bn takeover of ASX by the Singapore exchange, ruling it was against the national interest. Canberra unveiled a plan earlier this year to relax ownership restrictions, which removed a hurdle to ASX’s participation in overseas mergers. Yet Mr Stevens argues that international consolidation has limited benefits for a business such as ASX. Regulators also prefer clearing and settlement functions to remain within their own countries, he adds. “Financial markets, and particularly the infrastructure and the backbone that sits behind financial markets, I think tend to be best housed inside their own economies,” he says.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jackie Range","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-09-04","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/95dc45df-261b-3302-8f00-221c067b216b","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville.ft.com%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F08%2FScreen-Shot-2016-08-25-at-14.36.58_2048x1152.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchains? Where we’re going, we don’t need blockchains","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In today’s daily blockchain bulletin we bring you news that next big thing in financial back-office technology isn’t actually the blockchain. Apparently it’s something called a “distributed concurrence ledger”. We’re not yet convinced that’s a thing, but the white paper outlining the DisLedger DCL concept does at least provide a refreshingly honest account of the core problems with blockchains. Of note (our emphasis throughout): In current blockchains every transaction conducted by all of the members of a network are batched together and recorded in a single ledger. Other members on the system (not the actual parties to a transaction) must provide their approval for the transaction to be added to the ledger. Because numerous unrelated members have to give consent for a transaction, this type of architecture is called a consensus system. There are a few different protocols that blockchains use for consensus, but at the highest level they have the same effect. Parties that aren’t involved in the transaction, and who are often one’s direct competitors, must give their consent for you to conduct your transactions. The blockchain and consensus protocols are artifacts of the Bitcoin system where their use made sense, but their continued use will keep blockchains from being implemented in some applications. Issues with consensus protocols center on four main areas: an organization is forced to rely on its direct competitors to process every business transaction; it is expensive to prove the non-repudiability of the system during a legal dispute; transaction processing times can’t be guaranteed and the order of transactions can vary unpredictably due to system usage; and intelligence about the organization’s business dealings are provided to its competitors in the network. Distributed concurrence ledgers are designed for situations where these issues aren’t acceptable. Yup. Yup. And yup. Couldn’t agree more. And there’s more: Blockchains utilize a single ledger that is replicated and redundantly processed by all the members of a network. This single ledger batches all of the transactions from all the members within the network into one block. Consequently over time the file of every transaction can become large and unwieldy to transmit and process. Transactions are aggregated into blocks of unrelated transactions gathered from all members of the system for periodic processing which also delays execution and transaction settlement. The massive, but unnecessary, redundancy requires computer processing and data storage of large amounts of transactions to which the organization is not a party with direct impact on IT, electrical and cooling expenses. In distributed concurrence ledgers the parties only process and store the transactions in which they are involved and do so rapidly and in sequential order without chance for frontrunning. Again. We’re with you. So what’s the DCL solution to all these blockchain problems? (FYI Craig Pirrong, you’re going to love this). It’s this: DisLedger™ is a distributed concurrence ledger that provides more secure, faster and more scalable transaction processing than consensus blockchain systems. The same benefits of immutable records, and regulatory transparency are provided, however the transactions are processed only by the actual counterparties involved and not by a consensus of the crowd. But don’t mistake the above for an unashamed call for the return of the good old days of OTC clearing! No no no. This is a distributed concurrence ledger system. It’s what we call innovation. And since we know regulators don’t like being accused of stifling innovation, we can be sure of this: if we create a “shared counterparty ledger that is private and accessible only by the parties involved” and call it a DCL, they’ll definitely not mistake it for a return to OTC clearing. You may also be reassured that in Concurrence ledger… If the counterparty ledger hashes are not equal then there is a problem with updating one of the counterparty’s ledgers and the problem can be resolved. Since the update to the counterparty ledgers wasn’t successful; agreement between the parties did not take place; no contractual obligation is created and effectively the transaction fails. Almost like the days when, you know, representatives from all companies involved in a transaction had to sign off on it for it to be valid. Don’t get us wrong. Digitising the signature process with cryptographic tools is definitely a worthwhile innovation. But it’s not exactly new. Or related to anything that has to do with blockchain. What’s more, it’s certainly not an innovation that will render the need for conscious agents signing off on contracts in accountable ways obsolete. So there you go. You’re safe and sound now, back in good old 2008.

UBS leads dash to develop new form of digital cash Four of the world’s biggest banks this week announced that they had teamed up to develop a new form of digital cash that they believe will become an industry standard to clear and settle financial trades over blockchain, the technology underpinning bitcoin, writes Martin Arnold. UBS, the Swiss bank, pioneered the “utility settlement coin” and has now joined with Deutsche Bank, Santander and BNY Mellon — as well as the broker ICAP — to pitch the idea to central banks, aiming for its commercial launch by 2018. Analysis and comment Suits join the hoodies with blockchain push Cost savings and low returns drive lenders into working with system underpinning bitcoin Blockchain offers banks the chance to rehabilitate their image The big appeal is that the technology should save financial companies money The move is a concrete example of banks co-operating on a specific blockchain technology to harness the power of decentralised computer networks. “Today trading between banks and institutions is difficult, time-consuming and costly, which is why we all have big back offices,” said Julio Faura, head of R\u0026D and innovation at Santander. “This is about making it more efficient.” Blockchain technology is a complex set of algorithms that allows so-called cryptocurrencies — including bitcoin — to be traded and verified electronically over a network of computers without a central ledger. Having initially been sceptical because of worries over fraud, banks are now exploring how they can exploit the technology to speed up back-office settlement systems and free billions in capital tied up supporting trades on global markets. The total cost to the finance industry of clearing and settling trades is estimated at $65bn-$80bn a year, according to a report last year by consultants Oliver Wyman. Jawbone falls at legal hurdle in fight against rival Fitbit In the early days of the wearable-technology market — which is to say, three or four years ago — Fitbit and Jawbone were arch rivals, writes Tim Bradshaw. But while Fitbit has gone on to become the market leader in fitness trackers after listing on the New York Stock Exchange last year, Jawbone has struggled to keep up even as competition grew from Apple and Samsung as well as traditional watch makers such as Fossil. Jawbone, which saw its valuation cut in half in a financing round in January, argues that Fitbit’s success is ill-gotten. The maker of UP wristbands and Jambox wireless speakers sued Fitbit last year for poaching employees, who it alleges took Jawbone’s trade secrets with them when they left, and for infringing its patents.  It has taken its case to both the US International Trade Commission, which has the power to ban offending products from sale, and to the California courts, where it hopes a jury might hand over “hundreds of millions of dollars” in damages. Jawbone’s offensive has not had a great start. First, the ITC threw out both Jawbone’s patent case and Fitbit’s countersuit. Then this week, an ITC judge ruled that “no party has been shown to have misappropriated any trade secret”. Fitbit chief James Park said the ruling showed the allegations were “nothing more than a desperate attempt by Jawbone to disrupt Fitbit’s momentum to compensate for their own lack of success in the market”. Jawbone said it would appeal for a review at the ITC and will press ahead with its California case. ● Related Lex note: Fitbit — bearable wearable VW pays CarTrim €13m after suppliers join forces Volkswagen has resolved a bitter dispute with two small suppliers that had brought production of Golfs and Passats to a halt by withholding deliveries of parts, writes Patrick McGee. The dispute comes as VW tries to slash costs and lift profitability following a €1.6bn net loss last year from the diesel emissions scandal. CarTrim and ES Automobilguss halted deliveries of seat parts and gearbox components this month over a cancelled project. In June VW pulled out of a €500m order for parts from CarTrim, which demanded €58m in compensation.  After weeks of negotiations VW was still refusing to pay the desired amount, so CarTrim and its sister supplier stopped sending their products. Interruptions followed at six German plants and after intense negotiations, according to a person briefed on the issue, VW agreed to pay CarTrim €13m. On Thursday a US judge ordered VW’s lawyers to negotiate a “plan B” in case 85,000 3-litre cars in the US could not be brought up to environmental standards. Last month Judge Charles Breyer gave preliminary approval to a $15bn settlement involving 0.5m 2-litre cars, which VW agreed to buy back or fix. VW has always said fixing the bigger cars will be straightforward. Progress with environmental regulators has been slow, however, so the judge wants a contingency plan ready. VW also reached an agreement-in-principle — to be presented to the court next month — with US dealers that had sued it for fraud. Miners promote prudence as China’s economy slows The world’s biggest mining companies have embraced an age of austerity. That was the message from results this week, as executives lined up to renounce their debt-fuelled expansions of the previous decade and instead laud their ability to cut costs, raise funds and pay down loans, writes David Sheppard. With China’s economy slowing just as hundreds of billions of mining investments started churning out more copper, coal and iron ore it was not surprising Glencore, South 32 and Fortescue all wanted to present leaner, more disciplined companies. For Glencore’s Ivan Glasenberg the conversion has been particularly stark. Mr Glasenberg said this week he did not even know what mines were up for sale, such was his dedication to reduce a debt pile that had swung Glencore close to the precipice last year. The miner was now trying to reduce net debt to as low as $16.5bn by the end of the year from almost $30bn 12 months ago, having sold assets, raised capital and cut dividends. Its underlying earnings slipped 13 per cent to $4bn for the first six months but it generated strong cash flows.  Next year the dividend may be reinstated. For South32, the manganese and coal miner spun out of BHP Billiton last year, there was a similar message even as chief executive Graham Kerr said it may consider smaller deals. By cutting headcount, the company had preserved cash and was considering a bid for Anglo American’s 40 per cent stake in their manganese joint venture. “[But] we’re not talking about large-scale M\u0026A where we’re going to lose our credit rating and blow out our balance sheet,” Mr Kerr said. Australian iron ore miner Fortescue demonstrated why austerity was in fashion. Having cut net debt by more than a quarter to $5.2bn and squeezed costs, it reported full-year net post-tax profits more than doubled to $985m. Nev Power, chief executive, said they had managed to “more than offset the impact of falling iron ore prices”. ● Related Lex note: Glencore — feather in his cap ● Lex note: South32 — low roller Sports Direct faces call to launch independent review Pressure mounted on Sports Direct this week to launch an independent review of its business and overhaul its board as investors criticised Mike Ashley, the founder of the scandal-hit UK retailer, writes David Oakley. The FTSE 250 group was urged to launch the review at its annual meeting in Derbyshire next month by the Investor Forum, a corporate governance body that represents asset managers controlling £14.5tn worldwide. The intervention came in the week the Financial Times revealed that Sports Direct is paying some takings from website customers outside the UK to Barlin, a little-known delivery broker owned by John Ashley. He is the brother of Mike Ashley, who owns 55 per cent of Sports Direct and is deputy executive chairman. Sports Direct said it had wanted a company outside the group to manage the “complexity” of its international delivery operations and it chose Barlin to take charge of organising deliveries and assume responsibility for certain risks. The leading critics of the company and Mike Ashley include four UK asset management groups that together own 8.7 per cent of Sports Direct’s shares. Standard Life, Aviva Investors, Fidelity International and Legal \u0026 General are among Sports Direct’s 12 biggest shareholders, according to Bloomberg. Sacha Sadan, director of corporate governance at L\u0026G’s asset management arm, said: “We will be voting against the re-election of all non-executive directors to ensure the business is run in the interest of shareholders.” ● Related Lombard column: Sports Direct’s choice — reform or a red card.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-08-26","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/3e5fd4b1-c979-35fa-9d12-96f4b00a8c7f","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville.ft.com%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F08%2FScreen-Shot-2016-08-25-at-14.36.58_2048x1152.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"DLTs and the “can’t we all just get along?” barrier","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Another day, another blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) report*. Today’s comes from the World Federation of Exchanges, which provides us with a survey of what financial market infrastructure types are thinking about DLT. And, interestingly enough, the bulk of the survey is dedicated to unknown, unknowns. Since DLT hype is exclusive to all other media outlets on the internet, we won’t feel bad about highlighting some of the real concerns being raised by market practitioners in the space with respect to DLT rollout. From the survey, (our emphasis throughout): Despite agreement that DLT has enormous promise respondents noted there are several, not inconsequential, barriers to widespread adoption of DLT. These include regulatory and legal barriers, lack of technical skills, vested interests in the preservation of the existing system, and uncertainty about the technology itself. —- In addition to barriers to adoption, respondents were also asked to identify potential risks of application of DLT to capital markets. Most responses speak to the immaturity of the solution (e.g. how to ensure cyber-security protection across distributed nodes, the ability of the technology to scale, lack of an IT governance framework) or uncertainty about the application of the technology to existing processes (e.g. how to handle events of theft/fraud, how to ensure transfers that happen outside the blockchain are reflected on the blockchain). However, one respondent, highlighted a potential risk stemming from the transformative nature of the technology, suggesting that as DLT had the potential to disintermediate current trusted parties this might result in reduced regulatory protection for users of the market. —- The majority of respondents believed it was not only possible for non-financial players to take the lead in the development of DLT, but likely, given these firms would tend to be less regulated than financial services firms. This was not the same, however, as agreeing that nonfinancial firms would be in a position to rollout DLT solutions in capital markets without the participation of existing providers. Rather respondents felt this would likely happen in collaboration with market participants and existing service providers. Overall respondents disagreed as to whether or not the adoption of DLT in capital markets would fundamentally change the nature and structure of the industry. The nature of responses can be viewed along a continuum with some stating, “We do not believe that the fundamental roles performed by financial market participants, custodians, exchanges, CCPs and regulators will change materially” and others seeing fundamental change, including much more peer-to-peer activity and less central clearing. Similarly, respondents took different views on the impact of DLT adoption on the role of trusted parties and/or the emergence of new trusted parties. In relation to clearing and settlement specifically, one respondent noted the process might require fewer intermediaries than is currently the case but the need for trusted parties would remain. Other respondents suggested that as some of the use-cases required proof of identity and/or verification of possession of the assets, they could see the emergence of trusted third parties who would perform this verification function. This spectrum of responses is likely the result of the fact that while – in the words of one respondent – DLT can act as pure technology replacement, the capabilities inherent in the technology also mean that it has the potential to disrupt existing business models. And there’s also this: While some FMIs will approach DLT as a source of competitive advantage, the current collaborative approach is likely to persist as FMIs, technology innovators and market participants acknowledge that many of the more significant benefits of DLT will derive from standardisation and broad user-acceptance. Two observations on the back of that. If in the process of disintermediating the market, DLTs create a market for new types of “verification” intermediaries, what really is the point? Meanwhile, if DLT is mostly a collective action endeavour focused on getting everyone to agree not to disagree about what final financial settlement really constitutes (one blockchain to bind them all et cetera), might a more reasonable business case be made for consensus systems focused on getting everyone to agree not to disagree about religion, civil rights, freedom, sovereign property rights, UFOs, guns, the EU and Trump et cetera? (Just imagine the cost efficiencies associated with no more wars or the disruption of the arms industry?) *On the abandonment of blockchains and the birth of DLTs It’s always fun to see how cutting-edge nomenclature gets established. The term blockchain of course was coopted from the world of bitcoin and Scrooge. Yet the way banks and regulators want to use blockchain has very little to do with the original blockchain concept. Mostly, they’ve cherry picked the bits which suit their purposes and in the process turned the whole thing into something else entirely. For example…the bitcoin blockchain is based on an open protocol which consists of three core factors: the use of Merkle trees (the data chain), encryption (the privacy) and Proof-of-work puzzles (the block-based security system). The distribution of its ledger is kinda a byproduct of its open structure. And the whole thing is intentionally capital intensive. Banks and financial players, however, have no interest in making the current system more capital intensive than it already is. As a result, they’ve abandoned the proof-of-work part of the system (a.k.a the blocking system and arguably the real innovation) and replaced it with “permissioned” closed systems which blindly seal transactions transmitted to the network by authorised participants (providing certain collective logic criteria are met). They continue to make use of PGP encryption — though that’s hardly a new thing in finance — and again, depending on the venture, chain the data together — though, again that’s hardly a new thing in finance either. Unlike the incidental distribution which occurs in the Bitcoin blockchain due to its open nature, in the “DLT” space the distribution is hardwired into the system from the outset — a necessary pre-condition for everything else that flows from it. And that’s largely the key innovation in play here. Otherwise reasonable people have somehow convinced themselves that the collectivisation of data is a great idea. More so, that making everyone else responsible for your data as well as yourself, whilst streamlining your business practices so that they fit in with everyone else’s to facilitate the collectivisation, is an even greater idea on the back of it. (We should note there are DLT versions which — Tresasure map style — fracture and scatter both the data and keys randomly among participants to reduce the storage burden). Either way you can’t legitimately call such a brainwave a blockchain. Though you can arguably call it data collectivisation and/or data communism. Not to say that global standards aren’t important. But what we’re talking about here aren’t objective standards about how long a kilometre is, how much a pound weighs, whether off balance sheet liabilities should be reported to investors, or even whether the world should use a two-prong or three-prong socket. This is an all-out attempt to standardise value. That’s hugely scary for one main reason: value is supposed to be subjective. And markets don’t work if we all think value is the exact same thing.

It comes via a report with a handy public link: There’s also some grandiose prose about the importance of transparency in supply chains and the need for every bit of the production process to be digitised and registered from the point of origin on a blockchain. It’s the usual blockchain rhetoric like this: The application links identity, location, material attributes, certifications and audit information with a specific item or batch ID. The data is stored in an immutable, decentralized, globally-auditable format which protects identities by default, allowing for secure data verification. But also stuff like this: Standards allow unconnected systems to communicate using the same language, structures and identifiers. GS1, for example, manages a closed set of global standards for most supply chain concepts such as barcodes and shipping container codes. There are, however, very few standards for identifying individual instances of products or their history. We are working to develop this as a community-owned, open standard. And: In short, the blockchain provides an audit layer sitting on top of an existing ERP or other data management system – like Tally-O. This allows data to be shared and mass balancing of certified product to be conducted between two separate factories. Even more, it allows that data to be joined with data collected from the first mile in a trustworthy way – providing a true end-to-end record without the need to change existing interfaces to data capture. Which begs the question is this really about blockchain technology or the formation of global best-practice standards for supply chain management and product sourcing? Because if it’s the latter, why blockchain? The very amiable and sincere founder of Provenance is Jessi Baker. When we spoke to her on the phone she insisted that “double-spending” in supply chains is a much bigger problem than most people appreciate. “The problem is that along the supply chain these [certificates] are being duplicated or substituted and nobody has a global view of what’s going on,” said Baker. “Our argument is that there can’t be one person to account for all of that data. A blockchain enables the fact that it doesn’t need a central broker.” But before we outline our concerns about that idea, if the tuna blockchain was a Rorschach test might it conjure up thoughts like this? Baker’s motivations seem genuine. She says if we want to create a system where consumers pay a premium, there need to be cheaper ways to create and track claims. But wittingly or not, what she is arguing for is still the introduction of yet another rent extraction layer onto the work of other people. Provenance is, at the end of the day, a for-profit company run on a social enterprise charter which plans to charge affiliated fisheries, producers and retailers for the use of their software solutions on a monthly basis. Consider the following: The social and environmental conditions for the fishermen at the point of capture are verified through trusted local NGOs, whose audit systems validate their compliance to an external standard, resulting in their eligibility to participate in the Provenance-validated chain of custody. So the proposal seems to be this: get conventionally trusted institutions to continue the hard work of verifying, inspecting and authenticating the source material, allow them to continue using non-standardised barcoding and digital registry systems and then sweep all that information up into a single data depository that’s publicly accessible and hope this will drive demands for industry best practice. But who here is the real value creator? The guy doing the authentication work at his own reputational risk? Or the guy aggregating all the information and making it available to everyone at zero cost without any actual subjective filtering, while charging for the privilege? Provenance says stuff like: Sharing data securely between different parties is a clear barrier for achieving the level of trusted traceability needed to prove slavery-free fish. Currently, the main solution being posed is for one of the traceability providers to gain huge monopoly – this is neither secure, just or sustainable. The atrocities in the fishing supply chain mainly occur at catch, before the final destination of the fish is known. This means an incentive structure and data system would have to be shared by a number of companies to cover the data capture needed – but this must be a system that supports each fisherman as much as it helps the brands that add their names to the packaging. At the risk of opining on a market which we fully acknowledge we know next to nothing about, we’re not convinced that makes sense. If the problem Provenance is ultimately trying to solve is that of low quality or unsustainable fisheries passing themselves off as high quality suppliers, in a market where the product itself can’t be distinguished by the consumer, manufacturer or retailer easily, then the “solution” surely isn’t a better or more distributed database of “cleared” tuna. It’s a more comprehensive and intensively supervised authenticator system. The same applies if the problem, as Baker insists, relates to the complexity of the forward supply chain where certificates can get duplicated, duping retailers into taking on products that don’t actually meet their standards. These issues, we’d argue, can’t really be solved without more money being spent on independent authentication and supervision, something which would inevitably drive up tuna costs prompting both demand destruction and substitution. (See the history of the sturgeon market as a good example of what can happen.) The higher the price of responsibly sourced tuna, meanwhile, the greater the payoff associated with corrupting the authenticator and getting black-listed tuna into the pipeline. In turn, the lower the relative price of tuna in the blackmarket where nobody cares about authentication of any sort (again see the Sturgeon example). To wit, here’s Milton Friedman on the consequences of discriminatory preferences in the market even if the end product is largely commoditised or hard to differentiate: The man who objects to buying from or working alongside a Negro, for example, thereby limits his range of choice. He will generally have to pay a higher price for what he buys or receive a lower return for his work. Or, put the other way, those of us who regard colour of skin or religion as irrelevant can buy some things more cheaply as a result. Authenticators ultimately need to be paid if they’re to do their jobs properly and honestly, an expense which can’t be foregone by putting something on a blockchain. Paying authenticators only makes sense if producers can pass those costs on to consumers by highlighting the superiority of their supply chains. The more you supervise a purposefully inefficient market, however, the more competitive the non-authenticated alternative market gets. (Again, see the sturgeon example. Or even counterfeit goods.) Making digital certificate tokens correspond with a global tuna quota, meanwhile, only exposes the system to the same dynamic mismatch and pricing issues that plague other artificially scarce markets (such as carbon offsets). So for example what happens if fish stocks collapse or multiply more quickly than quotas anticipate or if market demand changes unexpectedly? A central regulator is always needed to adjust the figures if market prices are to cover the costs of keeping the market artificially scarce. You don’t need a blockchain. (Arguably, responsible provenance is about more than just quota tracking anyway.) Meanwhile, even if consumers are prepared to pay a premium for responsibly sourced and “branded” fish, the now more competitive and cheaper dark-market is unlikely to be eliminated unless it is openly criminalised. Consequently, there will always be a market for unauthenticated black-market discount fish unless some sort of legal statute is introduced to criminalise the non-authenticated produce. But again criminalisation introduces enforcement costs which have to be passed on to consumers or taxpayers (again see the sturgeon example). Furthermore, if the measures successfully restrict supply then the overall net consequence is one of declining productivity and higher prices all round for everyone. But we don’t think this is even about that. Provenance claims there’s market demand for simply knowing the “full-story” of any particular fish sold in Tesco yet doesn’t fully explain why that “story” should be provided to the customer via a blockchain. Fundamentally, we’d argue, it’s the reputation of the authenticator which matters the most as well as customer preferences, not the mode in which the information is stored or distributed. As a rule, the most trusted authenticator and enforcer with the best reputation is always going to be a well regarded government, NGO or properly regulated commercial monopolist. If these entities abuse their powers, the market fragments allowing variable standards to compete with one another again. Information asymmetries then undermine the frictionless consumer experience incentivising the return of a new trusted standard bearer. Since blockchain enthusiasts are against the idea of governments or centralised monopolies setting standards anywhere, however, they strive to create the illusion that systems featuring rival commercial authenticators can still be as efficient and cost effective as those that are not. But this, of course, is a fallacy. A system of rival authenticators is only as good as the weakest link allowed to input information into the hub, meaning no one can take it for granted blindly. Quid pro quo, informed buyers will always be able to draw an economy over uninformed buyers to the economic detriment of the latter creating a market for qualitative middlemen or brands which can bridge the information gap with a trust-based guarantee . To wit, the following extract from Akerlof’s Market for Lemons is worth noting: …the difficulty of distinguishing good quality from bad is inherent in the business world; this may indeed explain many economic institutions and may in fact be one of the more important aspects of uncertainty. Hence when it comes to standards, inter-operability is relatively meaningless. But there’s also a huge political challenge to all this. For example, if a state claims to operate on British standards, but British inspectors don’t have the right to police origination there’s no guarantee at all those products really are compliant. Politically neutral NGOs can offer some cross-border authentication harmonisation, but even then there’s corruption risk unless all authenticators are paid enough to make them resistant to that risk. (Again, do see the sturgeon example.) Meanwhile, even if Western export standards are complied with, there’s no guarantee developing countries will enforce the same standards domestically or to other less discerning markets. This renders the entire Provenance concept a luxury geared at the world’s most affluent consumers who have the time and resources to demand point-to-point tracking of production processes. Digging into the Provenance literature it soon becomes clear Baker’s real objective is encouraging consumers to boycott irresponsibly sourced produce in the hope that a buyers’ strike will change producer attitudes: On the tablets, shoppers can view stories for each product range, seeing the producers and suppliers involved in farming or processing. Through smart stickers and packaging, shoppers can hover their smartphones over a product to track its provenance right on their screens. This system empowers a new era of more conscientious, trusting consumers willing to pay more for products with proven origins. What the vision arguably overlooks is that sustainability is by definition a luxury market because of how it impacts high-yield food production (all the more so when coupled with an energy guzzling blockchain). Consequently, if these practices are to be popularised on a mass scale that means purposefully unwinding the intensive farming processes which helped to solve the global hunger problem in the 1960s awarding Norman Borlaug the Nobel Peace Prize. That’s a problem for blockchain-motivated standards because hungry people don’t tend to share the opinions of those who are full. Second, who really has the time or the expertise to determine whether a fish sourced in Indonesia by Japanese fishermen, processed in Amsterdam and which carries an authentication seal from Thailand but not from France, is really what it claims to be? International fishing rules are some of the most complex in the world. What consumer really has the depth of knowledge to be able to understand what he’s seeing and not be distracted by price, promotions or attractive packaging? Do they even know which fish are more at risk than others? A mass-market buyer’s strike is unlikely to be ignited by any system that requires consumers do the heavy-lifting on the information processing front. The imperative for the consumer is and always will be convenience, which is why they entrust that job to well known brands and retailers. Case in point: Chilean Seabass. It is neither Chilean nor a Seabass. What it actually is is a relatively endangered Patagonian toothfish, which shouldn’t really be being peddled to anyone. Information pertaining to this fact is freely available on the internet, and verified by many trusted sources. Yet none of this has curbed its popularity with discerning upper-class types who live close to Whole Foods in Richmond and can afford to spend squillions on fresh groceries. That’s not to say that collecting data from authenticators who meet a common minimum standard and storing it in one useful place for retailers or manufacturers wouldn’t be useful. We’re sure it would. We just genuinely don’t understand why it needs to be a on a blockchain or how a blockchain would encourage more sustainable practices. Though there is perhaps one exception. It’s in the fully transparent world Baker ultimately envisions — a world where surveillance systems and sensors monitor every natural variable from fish and fishermen to boats, processing plants and retail sites, and don’t sign off on any ongoing process unless pre-determined conditions are proved to have been met algorithmically. But that’s a future which is positively Orwellian.

In the fanfare, however, lots of common sense has been abandoned. The big idea here (allegedly) is that banks will use a “utility settlement coin” to bypass the need for costly and inefficient fiat liquidity from the cbank. The utility settlement coin, based on a solution developed by Clearmatics Technologies, aims to let financial institutions pay for securities, such as bonds and equities, without waiting for traditional money transfers to be completed. Instead they would use digital coins that are directly convertible into cash at central banks, cutting the time and cost of post-trade settlement and clearing. Except none of this is new. And none of this is really all that pioneering. In fact, we’d argue, it’s more of a step back to the logic that brought us the euro than it is a step forward. As we’ve noted before, the Target settlement system underpinning the euro was from the outset supposed to fulfill two objectives: to allow the European central bank to transmit its monetary policy decisions to the money markets and to develop a sound and efficient payments and clearing system by introducing a real-time gross settlement systems and one overarching common clearing currency (a.k.a the euro). Prior to the introduction of the euro as the go-to “bridging currency” for the multi-currencied eurosystem, cross-border international settlements in Europe were mainly settled using the dollar as a “bridging currency”. As Patrick Mcguire at the BIS recounted in 2004, throughout the 1970s and 1980s, almost all trading of convertible currencies used the US dollar as a conduit currency. When the euro was introduced US dollar transactions shrank by about 15 per cent. And yet, because demand for higher yielding eurodollar deposits didn’t go away, these excess dollars were instead put to use financing US dollar borrowing by non-banks, primarily in the United States. In short there is a viable argument to be made that the creation of a eurozone master settlement currency (aka the euro) augmented cross-border imbalances in the global monetary system. So there’s that to consider when flouting new master settlement currency systems as controlled by new bank cartel systems. But there’s also the RTGS issue. Since time immemorial, banks have used private techniques to square or “net” intraday obligations between themselves to cut the cost of having to source final settlement currency every time they transact. As a result these processes have minimised the capital intensity of their operations. Under such systems if and when imbalances between the banking system and the central bank did pop up they did so either because of unexpected demand for banknotes the banks couldn’t print directly or because somewhere in the system they had double-counted something or over-extended credit which had no chance of being squared ahead of a regulatory check. In the latter situation such imbalances resulted either from temporal lags in the squaring system due to administrative errors or an inability to liquidise existing assets quickly enough to make reserve requirement (aka a liquidity issue) or simply because the system as a whole was operating on an unfunded basis (implying bank-specific or system-wide solvency issues). The difficulty of predicting who would might be caught short turned it all into a bit of an arbitrary game of musical chairs. In a bid to prevent banking panics or price instability scenarios, central banks would punish whatever banks drew were left holding the short straw at pre-determined times — denying them liquidity unless they had viable assets to pledge. The fear of being caught out created a mutual incentive amongst all banks to act prudently. All this changed, however, when real-time-gross settlement (RTGS) systems were introduced to the world of central banks in the 1990s. To avoid the nasty problem of some banks finding themselves without a seat in the liquidity musical chairs game, the system moved to a continuous settlement system instead. Thanks to digital technological tools, it was now believed banks could finally have the best of both worlds: the low risk scenario of a real-time clearing system, where system imbalances never amounted to much because everything was squared on the go, as well as the low capital cost of a netting system, because the instantaneity of the system meant the overall daily imbalance of the system was so small it needed hardly any reserve capital at all. The problem with RTGS systems, however, was that even one teeny tiny delay could snowball into a system-wide freeze. To keep the system flowing, liquidity had to be dispensed to members on an on-demand basis. As a result whatever liquidity banks needed, they got. And banks determined how much “final settlement currency” was consequently in circulation at any given point rather than the central bank. For the most part banks would only be punished if they had badly forecast their liquidity needs. Credit quality, some might say, became an after thought. Fast forward to 2008, and it’s fair to say things started to go wrong. Over time, the quality of the underlying assets which could be used by banks to raise emergency funds began to lose their market appeal and trust. The story of what happened next is well known. The one thing we’ll add is that by injecting permanent liquidity into the system against government-issued bonds to cope with the distress, central banks arguably intensified the capital costs of the clearing system. The sheer volume of additional idle reserves made this inevitable. We’d also add that central banks may have inadvertently broadcast via this process that Tbills were now a better and more universal form of final settlement unit than central bank reserves. So how does the introduction of a new real-time clearing conduit-currency combat the capital intensity of the current settlement system? We’re not sure it does. What the proposal really amounts to is the introduction of a parallel clearing system that claims to be less capital intensive than the underlying system, and which can as a consequence minimise the amount of flow which needs to be transacted through the capital intense system. Except rather than being based on a netting system it’s based on a zero-reserve RTGS system run on a blockchain, with the ultimate objective of phasing out the need to settle through the central bank reserve system altogether. All this sounds lovely in theory. Except… if what’s really plaguing the market is an overall loss in faith in unbacked bank reserves, then just substituting a final settlement system which has finally been backed with something of significance (government bonds) for one that is backed by nothing isn’t going to solve the capital intensity problem of the clearing system or the real capital shortage issue in the market (a.k.a the scarcity of safe assets). Moreover, if the expectation is that a “utility settlement coin” will be so good at squaring value within its own parallel closed system that it will never need to source additional intraday liquidity from the central bank to cover unexpected logjams (something we think is super unlikely in a competitive system)…we’d note, that doesn’t necessarily free up spare capital either. If any potential liquidity jams are to be dealt with by the blockchain issuing its own liquidity against high quality collateral encumbered in a self-governed multilateral escrow account, that doesn’t solve the capital intensity issue either. If, however, the blockchain plans to issue liquidity against nothing at all, then the question becomes why bother calling this a clearing system at all? To wit, Bloomberg’s Matt Levine nails the real innovation in play: Having a pseudo-currency does not solve problem 1, though of course there is much discussion of blockchains to record entitlements to securities. Having a pseudo-currency also does not solve problem 2: You don’t get your dollars any faster; you just get your pseudo-dollars faster. (To get the dollars faster, you’d need to speed up the Fed’s central-ledger technology.) But for many purposes — for example, just doing more transactions with other banks — the pseudo-dollars are just as good as dollars. If every bank signs on for this, then they can go out and buy more securities with their pseudo-dollars, and rarely need to bother with the Fed. This is what blockchain is: It’s banks developing better and faster systems to agree with each other on what they all own. (I mean, the bitcoin blockchain is a wilder and woollier thing, but too scary for many banks.) That seems good! I have no real complaints! It is all just, like, 20 percent less magical than it is usually made out to be. This we think supports our overall point. For a final “pseudo currency” settlement system to properly trump the capital intensity of today’s central banking system, the pseudo currency being unleashed must be deemed universally acceptable by all banks everywhere not just a subset of four banks. That’s a big ask in a world where those carrying over international imbalances at the margin demand Tbills for final settlement rather than bank reserves. And even if one specific blockchain-based pseudo currency could convince all the world’s banks to accept it over all other reserves, there’s still another paradox in play. The less capital intensive a pseudo currency is, or the easier it is for one bank faction to produce it over another bank faction (like err Irish and Greek banks vs German banks) the less likely it is to be a universally accepted pseudo currency. Universal “final settlement” status isn’t necessarily something that can be engineered, especially in a world where Tbills are still the preferred balancing unit. Bitcoin’s proof of work mechanism may be a hugely capital intensive waste of energy, but it’s also the thing which keeps it honest and endows the scheme with some known value set. That a handful of banks feel inclined to create and treat a psuedo-currency as a final settlement unit between themselves, says nothing about whether the rest of the world will agree with them on that categorization. After all, the top of the money hierarchy tree isn’t determined by a “final settlement unit’s” capacity to balance a bunch of arbitrary numerical inputs in ways that a computer deems appropriate (the euro achieves that job fine). It’s determined by a final settlement unit’s ability to create real value so as to give rise to a socio-economic system which benefits as many people as possible (something the euro currently certainly does not do).

Tarnished by the 2008 financial crisis, and in some cases still struggling to find a profitable business model for the future, it can only help for a UBS or a Deutsche Bank to be associated with cutting-edge technology. Whether there is more to this than good marketing is the question. Blockchain, the technology that facilitates the bitcoin alternative currency, certainly seems to offer opportunities for the financial system to streamline itself. In particular, the blockchain’s underpinning distributed ledger system should allow securities transactions to be settled more quickly and cheaply. UBS, Deutsche, Santander, BNY Mellon and ICAP this week became the latest posse of financial groups to collaborate on the development of a settlement blockchain. The initiative, dubbed the utility settlement coin or USC, is essentially a spinout from a mass blockchain collaboration, R3, which encompasses more than 50 financial groups worldwide. The broader R3 project is looking at dozens of areas in which the blockchain could revolutionise current technology, from identity checks to securities registration. A core securities settlement ledger is in advanced testing. Banks and their technology executives like to talk about the greater safety that will come with a “golden record” of trades — one ledger that updates in real time as trades are executed. They hope to get regulators onside by granting them sight of the ledger, as a result improving the quality and timeliness of regulatory data. But the big appeal to banks is that the new technology should save them money. That, at least, is the theory. First, there should be a cost saving, as a fully synchronised and digitised settlement operation makes cumbersome, labour intensive back offices redundant. Second, there should be a capital saving, as the time delay between transactions being executed and settled is reduced, ensuring assets do not hang around on balance sheets for longer than they need to. With banks under severe pressure on both fronts, any mitigant is welcome. There are snags, though. Testing the technology in laboratory conditions, as has happened so far, is a long way from making it work in a chaotic market environment. Even if it does work, it may not receive a swift go-ahead from the authorities. Some regulators have been gently encouraging up to now but, given that the main beneficiaries will be the banks, watchdogs will be in no rush to approve the initiatives. The latest project’s “early 2018” commercial launch plan looks extremely ambitious. Banks, regulators and everyone else should be worried about some danger areas. Most serious is that the distributed ledger data, though secured through encryption, may be more systemically risky if miscreants or incompetents gain access to the single “golden record”. A similar argument may undermine cost-saving hopes. The whole reliance of the ledger system on automation and models may mean that in case of problems, the unpicking of misreported trades, or system outages, becomes more laborious and disruptive. Innovation in banking is still a tainted concept. Pre-2008 it was code for the absurd financial engineering behind the derivatives that ended up spreading financial crisis around the world. If banks are to have any chance of being rehabilitated, they must prove that blockchain innovation will not help them at the expense of everyone else. patrick.jenkins@ft.com  A clear understanding of blockchain’s complexities will be key for banks / From Michael Thomas","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Patrick Jenkins","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-08-24","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/be30b74c-6a01-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fca3c7e24-34f3-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Suits join the hoodies with blockchain push","INTRO":"Cost savings and low returns drive lenders into working with system underpinning bitcoin","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Early bitcoin enthusiasts hailed the cryptocurrency as a revolutionary way to sideline banks in a libertarian drive to upend the traditional order of capitalism. Since then the banks have fought back. Nowadays most people attending conferences about the blockchain technology that underpins bitcoin are more likely to be wearing suits than the hoodies and ripped jeans of a few years ago. Having kept their distance from bitcoin, fearing the risks of fraud and criminality, big banks now see huge potential benefits from harnessing the blockchain to make the existing financial system more efficient. “In today’s banking world, it is all about cost savings, as they are all struggling with low returns and that is why they are all locking on to the blockchain,” says Richard Lumb, head of financial services at Accenture. The latest example of big banks organising themselves to exploit the potential of blockchain technology came this week with the announcement that four big lenders have teamed up to develop a “utility settlement coin” — a new form of digital cash. The four banks — UBS, Santander, Deutsche Bank and BNY Mellon, which are working with UK broker ICAP and developer Clearmatics Technologies — stress that they are not creating a new cryptocurrency. Instead, the system they are developing uses blockchain technology to create different coins that are each directly convertible into existing currencies deposited at central banks. In essence, it is a way of putting dollars, euros and pounds on the blockchain. While other digital cash projects are being examined by banks — such as Citigroup’s Citicoin or Goldman Sachs’ “SETLcoin” — this is the first time several institutions have teamed up to create a digital cash utility for use in financial markets. So how does it work? And what problem is it trying to solve?   The coins are stored on a network of computers, all of which must approve that a transaction has taken place before it is recorded in a “chain” of computer code. Cryptography is used to keep transactions secure and costs are shared by members. Details of transfers are recorded on a ledger that anyone on the network can see, eliminating the need for a central authority, which is why the technology has also been dubbed a “distributed ledger”. The aim is to speed up clearing and settlement in financial markets by allowing institutions to pay for securities, such as bonds and equities, without waiting for traditional money transfers to be completed in the so-called delivery-versus-payment process. By switching clearing and settlement of financial markets on to a distributed ledger, the banks hope to do away with much of their costly back office operations that process trades and keep records up to date. Quicker settlement should also free up capital that banks hold against trading risk. Hyder Jaffrey, head of fintech innovation at UBS, says: “Every bank, exchange and clearing house, we all have our own sets of the same data, which get out of sync and have to be updated and reconciled.” “The distributed ledger is the first technology which could implement a shared golden copy of that data,” says Mr Jaffrey. “If you have that breakthrough you can really see how that would be revolutionary in the financial world.” Total savings from using blockchain technology in payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance could reach $15bn-$20bn a year by 2022, according to a recent report by Santander, Oliver Wyman and Anthemis. The consortium behind the universal settlement coin is aiming for a commercial launch by early 2018, by which time it expects to add many new members to its ranks, which are being kept small to retain flexibility. It plans to spend the next year winning over central banks and regulators, whose support is essential for the project to succeed. Central bankers are warming to the idea of digital currencies and some, such as the Bank of England, are actively working on creating their own — so they are likely to be supportive. The project, however, still faces many challenges. One is transaction speed. Bitcoin is often criticised for being unable to scale up because its blockchain can handle only about seven transactions a second, as opposed to, say, the 24,000 a second that Visa can. Any solution from the banks will have to be fast and capable of processing heavy loads. There is also a question over whether the banks will lose almost as much revenue as they save in costs. They make $1.7tn a year, or 40 per cent of total revenue, from global payment services, according to McKinsey. How much of that could be replaced by a blockchain payments solution? Finally, the proliferation of various blockchain projects among banks, already numbering in their hundreds, raises fears of whether they will coalesce around a single standard or end up using several incompatible technologies. “Everyone is hoping they can rise up and be the new Microsoft,” says Michael Parsons, a consultant advising big banks on the blockchain. “None of the banks in a consortium has a competitive advantage as they are sharing the information, but if they work separately they haven’t got economies of scale.” Some sceptics reckon the banks are missing the point. “This is banks talking to each other and the point of blockchain is to establish consensus in the presence of potentially untrusted actors, as with bitcoin, on the internet,” says Dave Birch, of payments consultancy Consult Hyperion. “It’s a sorry state of affairs, that technology is not going to fix, if the banks don’t trust each other. “ The hoodie-wearing bitcoin pioneers may be despairing to see their creation hijacked by the big banks. But Mr Jaffrey at UBS says many people now working on the blockchain for banks started their careers on bitcoin projects. “In terms of the debate about hoodies versus the suits, a lot of the so-called hoodies are the ones working with the suits on these solutions,” he says. “We need their expertise.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold Jane Wild","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-08-24","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/8ab3c696-6634-11e6-8310-ecf0bddad227","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F88a6049e-341c-11e6-ad39-3fee5ffe5b5b?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"FCA considers approving blockchain businesses","INTRO":"Watchdog weighs approval for a small number of companies using process behind bitcoin","DETAILED_CONTENT":"UK consumers are one step closer to using products underpinned by blockchain technology after the financial watchdog said it was considering approving a “small but significant number of firms” using the process behind bitcoin, the cryptocurrency. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, considered by the fintech industry as among the most forward-thinking regulators in the world, said that several groups in its preapproval stage are developing consumer-facing and compliance products that use blockchain technology. Blockchain’s attraction for banks is it provides a unique shared database across multiple locations as an immutable public ledger of transactions, offering the potential to cut costs and speed up areas such as settlement of securities trades. However, some regulators have been wary of the technology, warning of its potential vulnerability to fraud or to undermining financial stability. “We do think [blockchain] has got some potentially interesting applications and we are talking to firms thinking about how to apply that to financial services and how it could benefit consumers or indeed make the business of compliance easier,” said Chris Woolard, the FCA’s director of strategy and competition, in an interview with the Financial Times. “There may be areas where we might want to encourage it a bit.” The companies in question are being scrutinised as part of the FCA’s so-called Project Innovate. This offers advice to companies — either start-ups or incumbents — trying to develop cutting-edge products on what regulations they need to adhere to. In its first year, the project assessed 177 companies and approved 40 of them. It includes a so-called regulatory sandbox, where companies can test products with temporary FCA authorisation. Mr Woolard said that a “small but significant number” developing blockchain technology are part of the project, adding the FCA would announce more details in the coming months. If a company wants to start lending or undertake any kind of payment services in the UK it would need FCA approval. If the FCA did give its imprimatur the companies would be among the first in the world to gain regulatory approval. Today, the number of blockchain-enabled products in commercial use is “close to zero”, said Nick Williamson, chief executive of London-based blockchain start-up, Credits, because the technology is still being tested.  San Francisco-based blockchain payments company Ripple, is one of the handful that is integrating its platform with banks. This summer, it partnered with Japan’s Mizuho Financial Group, and Santander in the UK, the first banks in their respective countries to pilot blockchain technology for cross-currency settlement and cross-border payments. Currently, financial services make up over half of the global blockchain market, according to Jeremy Millar, founder of Ledger Partners, an advisory firm focusing on blockchain. A recent estimate from Greenwich Associates said that financial institutions will spend more than $1bn on blockchain in 2016. “Reports have claimed up to $100bn could be saved on the post-trade settlement process by using blockchain. Another estimate by Goldman Sachs said there could be $50bn of savings in the US repo market alone. The numbers are huge,” Mr Millar said. The UK government has stressed the need for new companies to challenge incumbents, particularly in financial services, and policymakers and regulators have followed suit. The UK is seen by the industry as having the most fintech-friendly regime worldwide, according to a global survey by consultants EY.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Caroline Binham Madhumita Murgia","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-08-21","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/0ddfcdf1-0ab2-3476-b767-ad3cac27d2d9","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville.ft.com%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F08%2FScreen-Shot-2016-08-12-at-17.14.58_2048x11521.png?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How global money transfers will work in the future","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Courtesy of WEF: How blockchain is going to become the beating heart of the global financial system, neatly summarised in two charts and a few explanatory bullet points.

For example, there was a time in this reporter’s life when she aspired to be cutting edge and cool. Joyfully, no longer. This involved dying her hair pink (as much as she could get away with without being expelled), reading NME and Melody Maker, and listening to the most obscure bands available in the acceptable genre, which was Indy rock. If and when the bands went “mainstream”, however — something assessed by whether the year below was listening to them — it was time to move on and find something more obscure. “Are you seriously listening to Blur? What seriously? Jeez. I much prefer Radiohead. What!? You’ve never heard of Radiohead? I can’t believe it. I’ve been a fan for like ‘forever’. You’re not cool.” But even that cycle eventually became repetitive, predictable and conformist in its own right. To be truly non-conformist one had to adopt an entirely new musical genre (drum and bass). But then *that* genre got polluted too. Long story short, it was time to become a Barry Manilow fan – the ultimate act of musical defiance because no seventeen-year old in the world would dare to admit they enjoyed a bit of Mandy. And yet even this became a sub-genre by way of the cheesy revivalist movement. And soon enough there was no defence. The only remaining option was to think to hell with it – I’ll embrace the all time greats and stop trying to second guess the musical popularity market. Rolling Stones. Kate Bush. Pink Floyd. Mozart. All the stuff that parents liked. The irony. Financial technology fads are seemingly undergoing a similar pattern. Blur (bitcoin) evolved into a love of Radiohead (Blockchain). But Radiohead (blockchain) was adopted too quickly by those who then compromised the likeability of the entire Indy genre (cryptocurrency). It was time consequently to turn to drum and bass (private blockchains). But drum and bass was being cross-polluted by Indy rock enthusiasts (cryptocurrency enthusiasts) so it became time to embrace something totally radical and segregated, ie go backwards to an ironic appreciation of Barry Manilow abandoning all refs to modern musical phenomena (Distributed Ledger Technology). Which puts us roughly at the point where cheesy revivalism should be turning into a general love of the all time provable greats (old school centralised ledger technology, but you know, digitally remastered). Suffice to say, there is some commentary emerging to suggest we are indeed in a phase transition and what’s cool isn’t the blockchain anymore but rather the defiant acknowledgement that the old operating system — for all its flaws — is built on the right regulatory, legal and trusted foundations after all and just needs some basic tweaking. And in that regard the following appear to be early trend setters. Credit Suisse’s team this month on blockchain limitations: The buzz surrounding blockchain is comparable to that surrounding the internet in the late 1980s – some go as far as to suggest that blockchain has the potential to reimagine and reinvent key institutions – for example, the corporation. We are less sanguine, and note eight key challenges that have the potential to limit the utility, and therefore reduce adoption, of blockchain systems. 1. Security vs Cost trade off: The security of the bitcoin blockchain is ensured by syntactic rules and computational barriers to mining. Permissioned architectures are cheaper to run, but as we increase our trust in permissioned authors, we lose the distribution which is a guarantee of ledger integrity 2. Do you actually need blockchain? ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,’ for a blockchain to be relevant you must: (1) require a database, (2) need shared write access, (3) have unknown writers whose interests are not unified, and (4) not trust a third party to maintain the integrity of the data. 3. Critical mass is essential: Blockchain-based solutions intrinsically rely upon multiple users, particularly at the authoring level. We see clear threats to achieving critical mass (1) fragmentation of platforms, and (2) institutional and social inertia to transition to and/or agree on a platform. 4. What you get out is only as good as what you put in… In reality the ‘truth level’ of on-chain information is only as good as barriers employed to (1) ensure the quality of data being added is high, and (2) ensure the quality of node permissioned to add to the chain is high. 5. More entry points make a blockchain system more hackable… The hackable ‘surface area’ of a distributed network increases with each node added. 6. You have to see it to believe it… Although identity can be encrypted relatively easily on a blockchain, transaction data are not for the simple reason that nodes have to see it to verify it. This may be an issue for those concerned about data privacy. 7. Identity problems? On-chain asset ownership by virtue of private key knowledge essentially makes all on-chain assets bearer instruments. The issue with bearer instruments is you can lose them; cash being the most salient example. A better solution to reconciling on and off-chain identity appears necessary. 8. A forked road, the lesson of the DAO attack… The DAO attack exposed flaws in smart contracts on Ethereum which should act as a reminder that nascent code is susceptible to bugs before it is truly tire-kicked, and even then, complete surety is never guaranteed. The ‘hard fork’ undertaken by the Ethereum community also shows that blockchains are only immutable when consensus wants them to be. Thomas Philippon, a financial economist at the Stern School at New York University (h/t Matt Levine), reviving our longstanding point about blockchain’s capacity to cartelise the market even more than the standing system already does: There are many regions of the financial system where incumbents are entrenched and entry is difficult. This is precisely where regulators should actively encourage entry. An example of a highly concentrated market is custody and securities settlement. In theory, the blockchain technology could improve the efficiency of the market, but if there is no entry, this would simply increase the rents of incumbents. A restricted blockchain could in fact be used by incumbents to deter entry and stifle innovation. Matt Levine’s entire blockchain compendium not least because of observations like..: I find this all a bit depressing. This is not the future of finance; it is the past of finance. It is a harsh world of naked caveat emptor; it demands the enforcement of trickery just because it was tricky enough to trick people. Consumer protection is a relatively new idea in finance; it has caught on because it is a good idea. You can debate how far the law should go in protecting people from the consequences of their own mistakes, but a world in which at least some mistakes are fixable does seem nicer than the alternative. As well as: Don’t forget, this is the future of banking, and money, and the Postal Service. It would be rude not to refer to Opimas‘ research earlier in May which labelled the whole blockchain thing a pipe dream with insightful observations about the bitcoin blockchain like this: Certainly, implementing blockchain in the capital market industry would greatly simplify the design of the post-trading infrastructure. However, the simplicity would raise, not lower the operating cost. Although complex, the current post-trade structure has been through a constant push towards greater industrialization of its processes in a quest for economies of scale. By contrast, the simpler blockchain technology relies on “inefficient” procedures to validate trades, which are the “hashing” and “proof of work” processes. In order to estimate the savings that one might expect if blockchain technology were used, we have compared its likely costs in the French and German listed cash equity markets with how much the investment industry actually paid in 2015 to use the current post-trading infrastructure. The result cracks the myth: Blockchain is not cheap. It would have cost the industry an additional billion of euros to trade the same volume of equity in France, and over €600 million in Germany. One may correctly argue that if blockchain were to be implemented in capital markets, the nodes/miners would be more efficient and therefore the transaction cost would be lower than the Bitcoin one and that we have not factored in the cost of global custody services. It is true that in reality the differences between the two models would probably not be as severe as we have estimated. Nevertheless, with costs multiplying by 3.4 and 4.5 for France and Germany, Blockchain technology has little chance in a highly industrialized and standardized market like the listed cash equity one. With this about the bitcoin blockchain’s security issues (our emphasis): Blockchain is not only expensive but has clear technical limits that will prevent it from becoming a mainstream solution in the capital markets. Numerous studies of blockchain claim that it is more resilient to cyber-attacks than the current infrastructure in place in capital markets due to its combination of “proof of work” and distributed ledgers model. The reality is quite different. First of all, the so-called resilience to attack provided by the proof-of-work chain is not a technological one, but an economic one. In order to conduct an attack on the system and modify a past transaction, the attacker would in theory have to control over 50% of the network nodes (in reality it is closer to 30%). The cost to do so is supposed to surpass the benefits that the felon would derive by isolating a user from the greater network and producing a forged block. While this probably holds in the small world of Bitcoin payments, it’s unlikely to deter felons in major capital markets where a single trade can be worth hundreds millions of dollars. Realistically, there will be single transactions that will be worth attacking. Secondly, the security of a network depends on its weakest link. In today’s capital market operations, retail and professional investors have been the targets of most cyber-attacks that we are aware of. Using blockchain will not prevent malicious attempts to steal a user’s cryptographic private key. Adding to the risks, a criminal could then use the key to send a transaction over the blockchain network that could not be deleted or retrieved. Legitimate traders would be on the hook for that fraudulent deal. And some foresight on the DAO issues: IRREVERSIBILITY OF TRANSACTIONS According to blockchain supporters, trades cast in stone are probably one of the main benefits of the technology: once a transaction has been added to the chain it cannot be deleted or changed. Once a transaction is part of a validated block that is included in the chain of the block it is impossible to change it, because that would mean not only redoing all the proof of work for that block but also for all successor blocks before another block is added to the chain. In our view, it is certainly one of the primary disadvantages of blockchain. In the real world, mistakes are made, orders are mishandled, trading algorithms can be poorly designed, etc. Therefore the ability to recover, amend, change and sometime even delete transactions, is essential. In fact, it is easier to create a database with irreversible rights than it is to devise a more flexible one that allows correction of faulty records. Comparative flexibility is a crucial advantage of the current systems. Permanent trades in the blockchain system would create a whole new set of complications requiring new processes and a legal framework in place. And this on the permissioned ledger space: Numerous initiatives are now evolving toward a permission environment, in which only a selected and restricted number of participants would be allowed to operate nodes and be miners. This is an interesting approach because it’s removing a major benefit of the blockchain system: the system works between parties that do not need to trust each other. If the concept is to implement permissioned distributed ledgers between trusted/identified parties, let us say custodians, why would you use blockchain technology when more efficient alternatives are available? Angela Walch, associate professor at St. Mary’s University School of Law, has been offering insights like the following since at least May 2015: The amalgamation of Bitcoin’s vulnerability to bugs, attacks, and uneven adoption of new releases, coupled with the governance problems that stem from its decentralized, open-source nature, must factor into the analysis of whether the Bitcoin blockchain is reliable. From my perspective, this package of risks, taken as a whole, makes Bitcoin too unreliable to support financial market infrastructure. Given that significant resources are being devoted to Bitcoin and its surrounding ecosystem, as well as financial market infrastructures that will rely on it, it is vital to evaluate these risks now, to avoid building important structures on shaky foundations. While the harms that a Bitcoin blockchain failure would cause right now are relatively limited (particularly in comparison to what a collapse of an existing major payment system or clearing house would cause), the more structures that come to rely on the Bitcoin blockchain, the greater the global harms (and the waste of resources) will be. She’s back with a column in American Banker this week where she doubles up on her contrarian view with references to the DAO Ethereum affair: The default position in tort law is that it is very difficult to hold software developers liable for the harms their software wreaks. Software licenses — the terms on which people use software — generally disclaim all liability for problems the software causes. In keeping with the tech mantra that it’s always better to ask forgiveness than permission, these powerful shields encourage coders to experiment. This lax liability standard may work when we are talking about sharing music or creating cat videos. It doesn’t work so well with money, finance, contracts, property records, medical records, proof of identity — all matters of fundamental importance in people’s lives that blockchain technology seeks to disrupt. It’s not just coding and running software that is happening here. People are making decisions about what should happen with other people’s money. With high-stakes matters like these, we want people to slow down and act carefully. When you know you are accountable to others, you take what you are doing extremely seriously. You get malpractice insurance. You evaluate whether you have the right expertise to execute your plan or whether you need to get some help. You consider the potential risks of your plan in addition to the benefits. Blockchain technology jumped into the big leagues when it attempted to replace existing monetary, financial, property, contracting and identity systems. Those who are creating and operating the technology must therefore be accountable in a big-league way. Last and not least, even well known tech commentator Irving Wladawsky-Berger is identifying a blockchain tipping point based on the fact that blockchain must succeed in cultivating mass industry collaboration if it’s to succeed after all (easier said than done): In my opinion, what has brought blockchain to its tipping point is the realization that these critical problems can only be addressed by the close collaboration among companies government and research communities around the world. You could sense this consensus emerging over the past year by the growing number of newspaper and magazine articles, as well as government and business reports. As was the case with the Internet, the consensus to collaborate is absolutely critical for blockchain technologies and applications to move forward, – including common standards, open source implementations of key components, and marketplace experiments to see what works and what does not.

Tuesday’s theft of nearly 120,000 bitcoins from Hong Kong-based exchange Bitfinex, however, served to highlight the shortcomings of an entire technology. Not bitcoin itself but blockchain. Blockchain underlies the cryptocurrency, authenticating each bitcoin. New transactions are added to a chain as a “block” of information once a transaction is verified by unrelated network participants in a computer-power and energy-intensive process. The history serves as an audit trail, minimising the risk of double counting or duplication of use of a specific asset. Proponents say that blockchain has the potential to transform multiple industries through use of distributed ledgers. In place of the energy-intensive bitcoin authentication process, users would rely on trust. Such digital ledgers could be accessed across dispersed locations and institutions. Distributed ledgers could be particularly useful in the financial services industry. Settlement, custody and registration of assets, for instance, could in theory all be simplified by open, transparent access to assets with verifiable provenance. Add smart contracts — which can self-execute at given prices or on given dates — and financial intermediary functions could be drastically reduced. But there remain drawbacks, most obviously security. In June, US regulators expressed concern that “bitcoin-like” systems were vulnerable to fraud through user collusion. And as the Bitfinex incident has shown, theft through hacking is also a risk; the more so with multiple institutions operating different levels of security providing multiple entry points. Even Bitfinex’s “multisignatory” system, in which transaction permission was required from two of three users, proved insufficiently robust. Bitfinex heist or no, trust-based blockchain systems are far from ready to be trusted.

UBS, the Swiss bank, pioneered the “utility settlement coin” and has now joined forces with Deutsche Bank, Santander and BNY Mellon — as well as the broker ICAP — to pitch the idea to central banks, aiming for its first commercial launch by early 2018. The move, to be announced on Wednesday, is one of the most concrete examples of banks co-operating on a specific blockchain technology to harness the power of decentralised computer networks and improve the efficiency of financial market plumbing. “Today trading between banks and institutions is difficult, time-consuming and costly, which is why we all have big back offices,” said Julio Faura, head of R\u0026D and innovation at Santander. “This is about streamlining it and making it more efficient.” Blockchain technology is a complex set of algorithms that allows so-called cryptocurrencies — including bitcoin — to be traded and verified electronically over a network of computers without a central ledger. Having initially been sceptical about it because of worries over fraud, banks are now exploring how they can exploit the technology to speed up back-office settlement systems and free billions in capital tied up supporting trades on global markets.   The total cost to the finance industry of clearing and settling trades is estimated at $65bn-$80bn a year, according to a report last year by Oliver Wyman. There are several rival digital cash systems being developed. Setl, a London-based group founded by hedge fund investors and trading executives last year, also aims to settle financial market payments with digital cash linked directly to central banks. Citigroup is working on its own “Citicoin” solution, while Goldman Sachs has filed a patent for a “SETLcoin” to allow trades to be settled near-instantaneously. JPMorgan is also working on a similar project. The utility settlement coin, based on a solution developed by Clearmatics Technologies, aims to let financial institutions pay for securities, such as bonds and equities, without waiting for traditional money transfers to be completed. Instead they would use digital coins that are directly convertible into cash at central banks, cutting the time and cost of post-trade settlement and clearing. The coins, each convertible into different currencies, would be stored using the blockchain, or distributed ledger technology, allowing them to be quickly swapped for the financial securities being traded. “You need a form of digital cash on the distributed ledger in order to get maximum benefit from these technologies,” said Hyder Jaffrey, head of fintech innovation at UBS. “What that allows us to do is to take away the time these processes take, such as waiting for payment to arrive. That frees up capital trapped during the process.” He said the project team would spend the next year seeking the approval and co-operation of regulators and central banks and aim for a “limited and low-risk” commercial launch by early 2018. The consortium members plan to argue that the system would improve transparency for regulators. The US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada are among central banks examining the potential benefits of digital currencies. But concerns include the security and the impact on banking stability. David Treat, head of Accenture’s capital markets blockchain practice, said the technology was still at a stage of having “three to five years before we get things adopted at scale and several more years before it goes mainstream”.

The 37-year-old is one of a group of chief executives developing the new form of technology and who, instead of only talking in the corporate language of strategy and returns on investment, argue zealously that blockchain will change the world, making systems from banking to voting more transparent and democratic. Blockchain is an electronic ledger of transactions that are continuously maintained in blocks of records. What gets its developers, investors and fans so excited, however, is that ledgers are jointly held and run by all participants. It is meant to be cryptographically secured to prevent anyone being able to manipulate records, such as who voted for whom, or who owns a bank account. Mr Vavilov says his enthusiasm for the technology is rooted in personal experience. He grew up in Latvia, and when the Soviet Union fell, he says, his parents’ wealth evaporated in the ensuing chaos. “My parents lost almost everything, savings, pensions, because of systems not designed to work for people,” he says. “I studied it, and I understood, this technology can really change this world.” Such talk is common in the excitable world of blockchain, which continually hatches new companies, often on the strength of optimism alone. Beyond bitcoin, which divides opinion between those who believe it has democratised finance and those who claim it encourages criminals, there are few blockchain ideas that have progressed very far. Detractors view it as a solution in search of a problem.   But there are already 400 blockchain start-ups working in financial services alone, estimates Simon Taylor, a fintech consultant. Investment of $290m went into bitcoin and blockchain start-ups globally in the first six months of 2016, according to market analysts Juniper Research. Banks, stock exchanges and governments are buying into the hype too and have called in specialists to work out whether they need blockchain technology. Many executives from traditional institutions, however, still do not quite understand what it is. “We’ve had top executives from global organisations come in here and say ‘show me a blockchain — get me one, get me two’,” says a senior figure at a US start-up, who asked not to be named. “Our joke was ‘why, certainly, would you like it in blue or green?’” Like other electronic databases, blockchains are not visible to the human eye. Mr Vavilov co-founded Bitfury in 2011, a lifetime ago by industry standards. It is now a 250-person business and is working on a pilot project aimed at helping landowners in the former Soviet state of Georgia register and transfer their property on a ledger, atthe cost of just a few cents. Like many entrepreneurs, Mr Vavilov also believes his product will be as popular as ride-sharing app Uber. “Once we start to deliver value — like Uber — in democratic countries people will start to vote in this technology,” he insists, adding: “Never disregard the power of a few committed individuals to change the world.” Just as enthusiastic about blockchain’s potential is Colorado-based Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of start-up IOHK, which focuses on Asian markets. He launched the company in 2015 to build cryptocurrencies, just as central banks began exploring putting money on the blockchain. A mathematician, Mr Hoskinson believes blockchain has the potential to reduce society’s need for banks, with people and companies eventually sending each other money over blockchain platforms instead, without any third party acting as middleman. Mr Hoskinson says his company, working with a global group of academics, has developed a new algorithm called “proof of stake”. It will help make blockchain applications quicker and easier to scale up for wider use in the financial system, he says. In a commonly made move in the blockchain community, he has made his work freely available online for other developers to use. While IOHK is working with universities, a markedly different approach to bringing the ledger technology to market is visible at R3 CEV, a start-up headed by David Rutter, a former senior executive at electronic broker ICAP. Unlike the blockchain developers who see a future where the dominance of banks in the global economy is weakened by widespread use of the ledger technology, Mr Rutter has brought together more than 70 banks and financial institutions who are keen to make it work for them. He says members of his group want to build blockchain applications to form part, if not all, of banks’ operating systems. Many banks have creaking, legacy IT structures that were shunted together following a wave of mergers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Like his entrepreneurial peers, Mr Rutter speaks in terms of grand visions. “There needs to be deep and collaborative thinking on what kind of infrastructure you need to support global financial transactions in the cloud,” the New York-based chief executive says. Mr Rutter argues global banks will recognise the mutual interest in working together, not least because this helps them to cut costs. There is, however, no strong sign yet of the world’s fiendishly competitive major banks embracing the spirit of co-operation. In November, two members of R3, Goldman Sachs and Banco Santander, quit the consortium to continue their own existing blockchain projects. Because the business is at such an early stage, R3 is not yet selling a product. Aside from its membership fee, which industry insiders said is $250,000, it plans to raise $150m by selling 60 per cent of the company. Eventually, however, Mr Rutter aims to make money from fees that customers pay to license the technology it develops. San Francisco-based Chain is another blockchain start-up that is beginning to work with established financial services businesses. It is working with Visa to build a network to allow 17,000 of the credit card company’s business customers to make cross-border payments almost instantaneously, rather than in days, using the blockchain. Investors have put $43.7m into Chain, according to the company, which employs former Google and Microsoft engineers to design applications and write code. Adam Ludwin, Chain’s chief executive, recounts that three years ago, he was laughed off the phone when he called a former JPMorgan executive about blockchain. “There were a lot of chuckles back then,” he says, but concedes that “even today, there are sceptics”. Distributed ledger: A type of database spread across multiple sites, countries or institutions. Records are stored one after the other in a continuous ledger. Data can be “permissioned” or “unpermissioned” to control who views it. Blockchain: A distributed ledger comprised of unchangeable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks (rather like collating them on to a single sheet of paper). Each block is ‘chained’ to the next block, using a cryptographic signature. This allows blockchains to be used like a ledger, shared and accessed. Cryptocurrency: Mathematically based digital currency, such as bitcoin. Encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units and verify fund transfers. Mining: A process in which transactions are verified and added to a blockchain — this cryptographic problem-solving also triggers the release of cryptocurrencies. Proof of work: a system that ties mining capability to computational power.

What is worth noting is that the hack follows a CFTC action against Bitfinex operations in the US which found: …that from April 2013 to at least February 2016, bitfinex permitted users to borrow funds from other users on the platform in order to trade bitcoins on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis. Bitfinex did not actually deliver those bitcoins to the traders who purchased them. Instead, Bitfinex held the bitcoins in deposit wallets that it owned and controlled. Therefore, Bitfinex engaged in illegal, off-exchange commodity transactions and failed to register as a futures commission merchant, in violation of Sections 4(a) and 4d of the Act, 7 U.S.C. §§ 6(a) and 6d. The regulators at the CFTC, in other words, were unhappy with the fact that the exchange was acting more like a margin-taking, potentially balance-sheet deploying, broker-dealer than a conventional matching broker or exchange. Bitfinex promised to change its ways and run a more robust system which properly segregated funds in future. None of this “off chain” business, however, should be a surprise to FT Alphaville readers. We’ve been noting for years that bitcoin aficionados suffer from an acute form of cognitive dissonance when it comes to their “full-reserve banking trumps fractional-reserve banking” obsessions. This is because most of the exchanges and wallet services they depend on operate on a fractional reserve or trusted custodian basis, netting flows “off chain”, taking balance sheet risk for liquidity provision purposes or issuing their own liabilities to customers in lieu of actual bitcoin. These tactics have for years been justified by the community in two ways. First, by the fact that customers can’t be relied upon to store their own private keys (once the key is lost or forgotten there’s no way to retrieve the funds), and second, because client funds are best kept off exchange in “cold storage” so as to limit the risk of keys being stolen. Cold-storage is the crypocurrency term for the offline bank vaulting the hard drives within which private keys are kept. As a result, most exchanges manage daily transfers and withdrawal requests out of a much smaller pot of liquid bitcoins they control directly on users’ behalf, depositing and receiving sums as and when client liquidity requires, whilst supposedly parking the excess safely in storage. (And if that sounds an awful lot like the current system to you, you’d be darn right.) But of course since many of these exchanges aren’t subject to public audits or disclosures, it’s hard to know if the balances are really being segregated or reserved as claimed. They could, for example, be being re-lent for other purposes. There is, as with banking, a huge temptation to put those idle reserves to better use. We probably won’t know what really happened at Bitfinex for a while. But what is clear is that thus far the technology which was supposed to be revolutionising finance and making it more secure (oddly, by skirting regulations) is looking awfully like the old technology which ran the system into the ground. Either way it’s unlikely to be good news for Bitfinex. If the failing was down to a problem with the multi-signature mechanism, then the affair potentially stands to undermine many of the blockchain systems and companies which have come to rely on the system for security. On the same basis it also stands to undermine the side-chain and escrow-based solutions bitcoin developers are working on to overcome the bitcoin network’s scaling constraint. If the failing was down to an internal security breach or poor risk management on the other hand (say due to naivety or inexperience), this creates an argument for additional capital provisioning, regulatory scrutiny and macroprudential oversight — taking away much of the cost advantage associated with the network. Don’t say we didn’t warn you.

In one sense they’re the most privacy-minded people in the world (allegedly). In the other sense they seem happier than most to provide government authenticated ID to relative newcomer businesses — who have little to no track record with respect to abiding by data privacy laws. What’s more, it’s odd that these people should offer up all this information for the sole benefit of using or speculating on a virtual currency that, via that ID link alone, allows the same third parties to maintain some of the most intrusive records of day-to-day spending activities within their closed systems, but also beyond. Take Coinbase as an example. Being something of a centralising liquidity hub, it’s fair to say the company, which operates both as an exchange and a wallet provider, probably knows as much if not more than banking institutions about how their customers deploy their balances. Once you further account for the fact that most of these third-parties operate on a broker-dealer basis, wherein accounts are made up of third party liabilities to customers not actual bitcoin balances (do see the Mt Gox drama for how that can end up), one really has to wonder what exactly the innovation is? Overall, the average customer needs to give up as much if not more personal data, often by more dubious means (online upload mechanisms, email or the post) to much less experienced organisations. Once in the system, meanwhile, customer transactions can be linked on a much broader and more publicly intrusive level than anything in the standing banking system. Moreover, there are no associated par value or liquidity guarantees for the customer if and when things go wrong. And that’s before accounting for services like Elliptic which take pride in describing themselves as.. …the global standard in blockchain monitoring technology, and is recognised as an established authority on blockchain compliance. In addition to providing data and analytics services to financial institutions and law enforcement agencies around the world, Elliptic advises governments on blockchain regulatory matters. So, thus far, it seems to fuse the worst of the old system with the worst of a hyper transparent future panopticon system. Which begs the question once again, where exactly is the innovation? Bar the whole point of the bitcoin blockchain being an attempt to manufacture a false sense of security among those who would ordinarily never trust the financial sector, it also seems like a play to gobble up more personal data and related transaction history than any banking system would ever manage to unless it was inclined to bank a much broader and more risky clientele. Mostly, and arguably, it’s a giant privacy bait and switch. There are simply no money transmitter institutions of Coinbase’s size that can afford to operate in defiance of the law of the land, unless they care to be based in the sort of jurisdictions most other banking institutions won’t care to do business with. Meanwhile, if the cost in the banking system is indeed mostly related to the cost credit checking, due diligence and policing non-compliance, it’s worth considering how exactly the likes of Coinbase improve on these processes vis-a-vis traditional institutions? After all, just knowing who your customer is fairly meaningless. What really matters is having the guts to deny them access if they fail to make the grade, blocking or requesting further information about transactions if and when they’re suspected to be fraudulent and generally actively monitoring the clientele base for risk — and that usually takes expensive layers of personnel. If bitcoin third parties are doing that properly, it’s likely their cost advantage over conventional banks is linked to more to their non-bank “money transmitter” status, than it is to the fact they’re operating in bitcoin. Which begs one last question about Coinbase. Is it an exchange, a money transmitter or actually a plain old deposit-taking institution such as a bank? Judging by this tweet from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on August 1, Coinbase certainly views itself as a deposit taker. If that’s truly the case, it might not be that long before authorities insist Coinbase gets itself a proper banking license — in the process losing most of its cost advantage. Coinbase has all funds to cover user deposits.

Building a closed smart-contract blockchain run by banks defeats that purpose, and makes the blockchain just a boring upgrade to existing bank technology systems. But there’s another objection, which is that the maximalist blockchain dream isn’t just about disintermediation. It’s also about putting everything on one blockchain, using a single universal blockchain to track identity and money and commerce and whatever else you’ve got. Shipping companies would track their cargos on the same blockchain where they tracked payments, rather than relying on banks to do the payments on their own separate blockchain. Securities transactions would settle instantly because both the securities and the currencies would live in a single system. Creating different blockchains for different purposes is just like — well, I mean, banks keep track of who has money now, and securities intermediaries keep track of who has securities, and shipping companies keep track of where their ships are. Doing all of that on separate blockchains, instead of separate databases, might be a technology upgrade (or a bunch of technology upgrades), but it is not a revolution. He’s right. It’s not a revolution. It’s a systems upgrade at best, and at worst a downgrade into a less efficient system which heightens cartelisation forces and introduces all sorts of new collective action and group-think problems to banking and risk management. Meanwhile, most of the blockchain companies involved in this venture have pivoted on their initial propositions so many times, it would be fake news to keep calling this a blockchain story. In the interests of highlighting today’s modern mode of journalistic/PR management, it’s worth noting the story about the alliance’s formation was shopped around on supposedly exclusive terms (with all sorts of opportunities for journalists to have the relevant context “framed” for them ) to at least six media firms since Jan 29, among them the NYTimes, the WSJ, Bloomberg, Reuters, CoinDesk and FT Alphaville. We said we’d wait for the public press release. Of course, in a world where journalists are believed to be malleable if they think they’re being offered an exclusive, should we really be surprised the corporations involved think no-one will notice that “alliance” in this use-case is just a euphemism for cartel. Not that we’re surprised this is happening. As we’ve argued for ages, cartel formation was inevitable for any of this stuff to be even vaguely succeed. It’s worth caveating, of course, that banking has always orientated towards cartel structures with high synthetic start-up capital costs,because the good the sector ultimately provides (trust) has a zero marginal cost of production. This renders the industry uniquely vulnerable to undercutting (which, in the case of banking, equates to competitors buying off customers with other people’s money by providing loans at ridiculously cheap risk-inducing rates at the same time as over-promising returns to investors. A.k.a taking on too much risk). But given we already have a pretty substantial banking cartel defending our interests from macro-prudential risk, do we really need to revolutionise the sector with more?

The Department for Work and Pensions began a trial in June of the system, which uses blockchain technology to pay benefits directly to welfare claimants. GovCoin Systems, the UK technology company behind the blockchain system, said initial trials had proved successful but that final results being collated by University of College of London were not expected until October. “Claimants are using an app on their phones through which they are receiving and spending their benefit payments,” David Freud, the welfare reform minister, told a payments conference last week. “With their consent, their transactions are being recorded on a distributed ledger to support their financial management.” If successful, the technology could be used for everything from tax collection to the sharing of health records, according to a government report released this year. Advocates of blockchain technology argue it is more secure and transparent, cutting down the risk of fraud and error. But welfare campaigners are concerned it would allow the DWP to check that payments are spent only on certain things. Critics including the Open Data Institute, which was established by David Cameron in 2012 to promote transparency in government, described the move as “very concerning”. “Experimenting with putting highly personal data in immutable data stores is fraught with danger,” said Jeni Tennison, the ODI’s technical director and deputy director. “To avoid undermining trust in government’s use of data, DWP should be much more open and transparent about the policy objective of these trials, the safeguards they are putting in place to limit the risks and the lessons being learnt through the trial.” GovCoin said it was aware of the ODI’s concerns and had taken the data protection and privacy issues seriously. The DWP said it would “continue to monitor new innovations in the marketplace which would represent value for money, safeguard information and protect and improve payments to customers.  “This trial is designed to explore how distributed ledger technology could help support financial inclusion and budgeting support through the anonymous capture of data and does not place any restrictions or limits on what a claimant can spend their welfare payments on,” it added. Blockchain is the shared database technology that is best known for powering the bitcoin online currency. In this case, a digital “benefit coin” could effectively replace welfare payments in sterling. GovCoin said it was in discussions with other countries that are considering using the technology. Honduras is using it to handle land titles, while the Isle of Man has begun testing it with a registry of companies on the island. Estonia has been experimenting with distributed ledger technology that allows citizens to verify the integrity of their records on government databases. Blockchain has been hailed by admirers as holding the promise that the internet did two decades ago. Banks, insurers and companies ranging from IBM to PwC are also seeking to harness the power of the blockchain, in the belief that it could lead to greater efficiency. But IT experts caution that blockchain technology is still at an early stage of development and moving any of Britain’s public services away from their existing IT systems is likely to prove difficult, expensive and potentially risky.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Gill Plimmer","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-07-12","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/79cf65fe-379c-11e6-a780-b48ed7b6126f","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F16365890-37a1-11e6-a780-b48ed7b6126f?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Euroclear looks to apply blockchain to gold market","INTRO":"Belgian settlement house partners with US start-up itBit","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Euroclear, one of the world’s largest settlement houses, is to make its first foray into emerging blockchain technology by exploring creating a new settlement system for the London gold market. The Belgium-based settlement house, which houses more than €27tn of bonds, equities, funds and derivatives for customers, has partnered US start-up itBit to explore ways to modernise trading in the precious metal. The group will look at ways to harness itBit’s blockchain-based clearing and settlement network Bankchain for gold. To date Euroclear has been sceptical of the hype behind the push for blockchain technology, the digital ledger that underpins cryptocurrency bitcoin, into capital markets. It has argued that the electronic ledger that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records at the heart of blockchain could be taken on by expanding the role of a central securities depository. Angus Scott, director of product strategy and innovation at Euroclear, said settlement of unallocated gold was capital-intensive for banks and it was a market that was in need of modernising. “We have also created an advisory group, which recently convened to discuss the building of the new service with the ambition to make the London bullion market more efficient.” Despite the excitement around blockchain, attempts to apply it to large real markets and payments systems have so far been limited. Underscoring financial markets’ concerns, in recent days the DAO, the decentralised autonomous organisation that uses a blockchain by Ethereum, was hacked and about $60m of Ethereum’s digital currency removed. The industry is trying to resolve the problem as the hacker has argued that it was the nature of the smart contract for payment, and not the code, that allowed the hack to take place. ItBit has opened a new London operation as it turns its focus to trading and settlement on the UK gold market. The two are talking to banks and broker dealers to create a blockchain network that clears, tracks and settles trades in close to real time. “Gold also has a big enough market to want to track and the ownership, said Chad Cascarilla, chief executive of itBit. “It’s a market that recognises it needs to change, it’s a bilateral, decentralised market.

Demand from professionals for learning about blockchain, the technology that powers the virtual currency bitcoin, is so great that Cambridge university plans to offer courses to executives about its disruptive potential this year. Blockchain has been the subject of a significant amount of hype over the past year as institutions ranging from banks, exchanges, insurers and governments have rushed to work out how blockchain could be used, by them or rivals. The technology deployed is known as a distributed database, which runs from many computers and needs no central authority. Cambridge’s Centre for Alternative Finance, based at its Judge Business School, will be the first in the UK to teach the subject, with demand coming mainly from employees of global banks. “Nobody wants to be Kodak,” says Robert Wardrop, executive director of the school’s centre for alternative finance, comparing the film-maker’s failure to adapt to the digitisation of photography to the change in the banking sector. “They [bankers] all know their industry is being digitalised, how you develop a competitive response . . . that is the challenge,” Mr Wardrop says. “Do you do nothing, collaborate or compete?” Advocates believe that though blockchain is at an early stage in its development, it has the potential to disrupt many sectors. This is because it is transparent, indelible and tamper-proof and is jointly run by several parties. It could be used to keep records such as on a person’s complete health or insurance history, for example. Or it could be used for cross-border clearing and settlement. Cambridge’s teaching about blockchain and digital currencies will be a core part of its educational programme on fintech, which is being developed by the Centre for Alternative Finance. Professors will also cover peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding, alternative investments and new forms of credit analytics. The material will be included in the university’s master of finance programme this summer. The introduction of the Cambridge course comes after several US universities that had added bitcoin to their syllabuses in 2014 shifted their attention to blockchain. David Yermack, a professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, says there is great interest in the quandaries posed by emerging technology to regulators. “There are huge challenges for most governments around the world because they assume the current law will deal with a lot of blockchain issues,” he says. “But it is a totally different animal.” Professor Yermack predicts that a technological evolution will shrink the size of the industry’s workforce overall, but in doing so it will create many specialist tech jobs. [Bankers] all know their industry is being digitalised, Do they do nothing, collaborate or compete? Stern School will teach its MBA students about digital currencies, blockchains and their growing place in the financial services industry from next spring. It also plans a course for executives. At Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, emphasis has also shifted away from bitcoin. Duke says its innovation and cryptoventures course, which is part of the MBA, has been heavily oversubscribed and is aimed at students who want to create their own blockchain start-ups. Campbell Harvey, finance professor at Fuqua, says: “Now it’s the general technology called blockchain. There are apps that go with it, bitcoin is one of them.” Universities are mostly teaching the basics of blockchain: the context of how the technology came about, its mechanics and how people are trying to commercialise and innovate with it. Garrick Hileman, who teaches blockchain and virtual currencies at Cambridge, says that for more than two years he has seen “tremendous” interest from companies. He has been called in to teach executives informally about bitcoin and other virtual currencies such as ether, and more recently, blockchain. “Many people are still trying to understand the basics,” he says. Blockchain’s reputation has suffered from its association with bitcoin, which has been tarnished by the collapse of Mt Gox — a prominent exchange, with the disappearance of $500m worth of customers’ bitcoins — and the closure by US authorities of the Silk Road website, which facilitated the sale of illegal drugs. But part of what attracted executives to the potential of distributed databases was seeing how well bitcoin performed as it attracted users around the world. Launched in 2008, bitcoin’s market value now stands at more than $10bn, according to Coindesk, which tracks bitcoin data. While the new Cambridge course will teach key concepts — such as what blockchain is and how it is being experimented with — it will not go in depth into the complex cryptographic processes that would be more suited to a computer science course. Manfred Alfonso Dasenbrock, an executive at Brazilian co-operative Sicredi, who attended a fintech course at Cambridge in September, says: “The way we do banking business will not be the same in a few years.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jane Wild","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-06-20","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/591518a0-34df-11e6-ad39-3fee5ffe5b5b","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fee0a5718-1b7b-11e6-b286-cddde55ca122?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"‘Ether’ brought to earth by theft of $50m in cryptocurrency","INTRO":"Value slumps after user takes advantage of software flaw in app on blockchain","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The value of an up-and-coming cryptocurrency that has been touted as a possible successor to bitcoin slumped on Friday, after a hacker took advantage of a software flaw to siphon off nearly $50m worth of digital bits. The currency, called ether, tumbled by 25 per cent, souring a rise that had seen the total value of ether in issue reach a peak of $1.6bn earlier this week. Ether is the currency used by Ethereum, a blockchain platform that has been winning an increasingly enthusiastic following this year in the cryptocurrency world. Ethereum can be used to create so-called smart contracts, or automated agreements, making it a distributed platform for all kinds of business transactions beyond currency transfers. On Friday, Vitalik Buterin, the Russian programmer who came up with the idea for Ethereum while a teenager, pleaded for online exchanges to halt trading ether while developers try to sort out the software flaw. The problem occurred in an application running on Ethereum rather than in the system itself and people involved in the system “should sit tight and remain calm”, he urged. Mr Buterin’s intervention, and the methods now being considered to undo the diversion of cash out of the system, mark an ironic inflection point for the cryptocurrency. Supporters of systems such as bitcoin and Ethereum claim much of their value stems from the fact that they are distributed networks governed by clear rules embedded in software, making them immune from the kind of intervention by central authorities that characterise traditional monetary systems. However, the Ethereum community might now have little choice but to go back on its principles and retroactively invalidate some past transactions if it wants to maintain confidence in its system, said Emin Gün Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University. “This is our brush with ‘too big to fail’,” he added. “Otherwise, the number of people who will be turned away from cryptocurrencies and smart contracts will be too great.” The crisis for Ethereum arose when it emerged that an unknown participant had taken advantage of a loophole in the system to siphon more than 2.4m units of ether from an entity called The DAO. Set up last month as a type of crowdsourced venture capital fund, the DAO raised nearly $170m worth of the digital currency, with a view to investing it based on votes from its members.  The weakness in The DAO’s software had been identified in advance, said Mr Gün Sirer, who had himself co-authored a paper pointing to possible flaws. He added that the complexity of writing code for Ethereum made the same flaw a potential threat in all applications on the system, though it represented a “growing pain” that was likely to be solved once more developers were aware of the problem. Under The DAO’s rules, currency withdrawn from the fund has to sit in another account for 27 days, meaning that the ether that has been diverted is now effectively frozen. That has left Ethereum’s backers facing the choice of reversing the transactions, or allowing them to stay in place and leaving backers with a loss. The decision has been complicated by the fact that the diversion of cash was not the result of an “illicit” hack of the system, said Mr Gün Sirer. Rather, investors in The DAO were simply outsmarted by someone who had a better understanding of how the code functions, he said. The conundrum triggered a vigorous online debate on Friday over whether it was right for a central “authority” to intervene. “Ethereum worked exactly as intended. I don’t believe software should be updated when it works exactly as intended,” wrote one commenter on Reddit. “You assume the risks of your investment. If you don’t understand your investment, you assume unknown risk. Anything else is a bailout by a central authority, ie the antithesis of the crypto world.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Richard Waters","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-06-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/2df2f65c-234f-11e6-9d4d-c11776a5124d","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F46a9d2e8-c49e-11e5-808f-8231cd71622e?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Santander pilots blockchain payments app","INTRO":"UK bank to use bitcoin technology for cheaper overseas transfers","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Santander is aiming to become the first UK bank to use blockchain, the technology behind digital currency bitcoin, to enable customers to make faster and cheaper international payments. In a move to fend off competition from digital payment businesses, such as TransferWise, the bank is piloting an app-based service among staff, before rolling it out to customers. By using blockchain — database technology that enables a secure, widely held ledger of transactions to be kept — Santander plans to provide next-day money transfers and ensure that customers’ funds arrive in full. Payments of between £10 and £10,000 can be sent, at any time of the day, in euros or dollars across 21 different countries. At the moment, money transfers abroad tend to take several days, and customers cannot be sure how much money will arrive in an overseas account, as various fees are taken along the way in an opaque process. Blockchain, which has been used to support virtual currency transfers, can enable the transfer of data in a faster and more accurate way. All transactions are recorded uniquely, helping to improve fraud protection. News of Satander’s pilot comes as mounting competition from digital payment providers threatens to lure customers away from the banks. TransferWise, for example, sends money between people in a way that strips out the need for currency conversion charges. It claims to be eight times cheaper than traditional banks, which it says can charge hidden fees of up to 5 per cent. Ed Metzger, head of innovation, technology and operations at Santander UK, said: “Clearly, it’s an area where, as an industry, we don’t have as good a customer experience as we could do . . . there are a lot of pain points.” He said: “There’s lots of activity in international payments”, adding that the reason why new digital players have been able to make progress is because “customer experiences through normal channels isn’t great”. Santander is using US-based fintech group Ripple, a company in which the bank already invests, to provide the underlying blockchain technology. Mr Metzger said that, as more banks joined the Ripple network, its ability to facilitate payments overseas instantaneously would grow.  Santander recently teamed up with US online lender Kabbage, another fintech company in which it invests, to help provide its small-business customers with funding within hours. Other banks have partnered with burgeoning fintech companies as a way to gain access to superior technology, and lessen the risk of having their operations disrupted by new and more efficient services over time. Barclays, for example, has linked up with Circle Internet Financial, a US mobile payment start-up backed by Goldman Sachs. Their partnership allows users to exchange sterling and dollars immediately and free of charge.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Emma Dunkley","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-05-26","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/c81c45ae-053f-11e6-a70d-4e39ac32c284","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fe03fe0f0-e708-11e5-a09b-1f8b0d268c39?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"UK companies more likely to hire outside CEOs","INTRO":"Global turnover at the top rose to 16.6% due to dealmaking","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Big UK companies are breaking with their global peers and hiring more chief executives from outside than ever before. Last year, 58 per cent of new UK chief executives came from another company, versus 23 per cent globally, according new research by PwC that also found record turnover at the top of the world’s biggest companies. “Hiring a CEO from outside the company used to be seen as a last resort. That is not the case any more,” said Ashley Unwin, UK consulting leader at PwC.  Bank chiefs Bill Winters at Standard Chartered and Jes Staley at Barclays were among the highest profile new hires. CEO turnover at the world’s 2,500 largest public companies — 300 of them in the UK — rose from 14.5 per cent in 2014 to 16.6 per cent in 2015, boosted by a bumper year for corporate dealmaking. Departures due to mergers and acquisitions accounted for 17 per cent of all turnover, the highest share since 2007, and a reflection of the record $5tn in deal volume last year, according to PwC. High-profile departures due to deals included David Pyott, who left Allergan when it was bought by Actavis, Robert Duggan, who left Pharmacyclics after its acquisition by AbbVie, and Lafarge’s Bruno Lafont, who was bumped up to co-chairman when the cement maker was taken over by Switzerland’s Holcim. Brazil, Russia and India topped the list for highest rates of turnover — nearly a quarter of big company heads left in 2015 in those countries. They were followed by the UK at 19.3 per cent and Japan, where the rate rose sharply from 12 per cent in 2014 to 19 per cent. Only 14 per cent of US and Canadian companies changed their chief executive in 2015. Western European boards were the most open to foreigners. Nearly one-third of 2015’s incoming chief executives came from a country other the one where the group was headquartered. By contrast, only 16 per cent of North American’s new corporate top dogs were from overseas. “It’s a sign of strength to employ from outside the company,” says Randall Peterson, professor of organisational behaviour at London Business School. The PwC research found that female chiefs were more likely to be hired from outside the company than male CEOs. Nearly a third of all incoming and outgoing female CEOs from 2004 to 2015 were outsiders compared to just 23 per cent of the men. Overall, companies proved more reluctant to take on female heads — just 10 of the 359 new hires, or 3 per cent, were women, the lowest percentage since 2011. The ranks of women were particularly thin in the US and Canada, where just one of the 87 new chiefs (1 per cent) was a woman. “Companies should be challenging themselves on why they don’t have more women poised to take on executive level roles,” said Mr Unwin. “The executive level is where women and diverse leadership teams can make a tangible difference to the culture and management of a business.” Telecoms had the highest rate of turnover, followed by energy, while information technology had the lowest turnover rate, at 11 per cent.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Sarah Gordon","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-04-18","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/bca31b78-1d02-11e6-b286-cddde55ca122","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F3e310e7c-1d1a-11e6-b286-cddde55ca122?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"‘Blockchain could be totally transformative for fund industry’","INTRO":"Technology likely to cause huge disruption to how the fund industry operates","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Asset management insiders believe blockchain, the nascent technology behind bitcoin, the controversial digital currency, will cause huge disruption to how the fund industry operates, prompting significant changes to its business model. Blockchain, which is a giant, online public ledger, was developed to keep track of who owns bitcoins and who owned them in the past. But now the fund industry is examining how it could use the technology. Proponents say blockchain will revoluntise the finance industry. They believe it could eradicate the need for clearing and settlement, the long-standing process whereby ownership of a security is moved from one investor to another. This could mean fund managers and banks would need fewer staff for some roles, while investors would probably benefit from lower fees. Asset managers, including a cohort of UK managers, are also looking into employing the technology to trade directly with each other, cutting out traditional middlemen such as brokers and bringing their costs down in the process. According to a survey of 125 asset management professionals across fund houses, custodian banks and consultancies, blockchain is expected to be a very disruptive force within the fund industry. Asked which areas of financial technology will have the biggest impact on the fund industry, 42 per cent of those polled listed blockchain, while 43 per cent nominated big-data analytics, where large sets of information are analysed to uncover market trends or other useful information. In contrast, only a fifth listed robo-advisers, which provide automated online investment services. Keith Hale, executive vice-president for client and business development at Multifonds, the software provider that carried out the survey, says the possibility of blockchain disrupting so many different parts of the asset management industry has left many concerned. “There is quite a lot of the fear of the unknown with blockchain,” he says. Michelle Seitz, head of William Blair Investment Management, the $64.7bn US asset manager, says: “I do believe that [blockchain] has the power to disrupt the plumbing of the asset management industry, and if it does, it will speed the service and the delivery of what we do for the client, and cut out costs. “It could be a massive disrupter to the industry, but in a good way.” The fund industry is still trying to get to grips with the impact blockchain could have. Experts say it is difficult to understand the wider implications of the technology. Olivia Vinden, principal at Alpha FMC, the consultancy, says that as well as having the potential to eradicate the traditional settlement process, blockchain could also be used across other functions in the fund industry. This could include providing a new way for asset managers to interact with regulators or helping to prevent money laundering by making it easier for asset managers to keep track of their investors. “Blockchain could be totally transformative for the [fund] industry, both in how it operates and in terms of costs,” says Ms Vinden. Richard Hinton, a partner at KPMG, the professional services firm, says it is likely to take some time before blockchain’s impact is seen in the fund industry. “There is a still a lot of work to be done before it is adopted in a widespread fashion,” he adds.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Attracta Mooney","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-05-22","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/600e137a-1ba6-11e6-b286-cddde55ca122","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fbee44d94-04b1-11e6-9b51-0fb5e65703ce?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Automated company raises equivalent of $120m in digital currency","INTRO":"Code-controlled vehicle with no human input beyond its backers will invest in other enterprises","DETAILED_CONTENT":"An automated business run on computer code, with no human input beyond its anonymous backers, has raised the equivalent of $120m in digital currency. The financial support for the vehicle, called The DAO, makes it the most advanced embodiment yet of an idea that has long captivated idealists: automatic companies that operate without managers or boards of directors, making them the purest form of shareholder governance. The DAO — an acronym of decentralised autonomous organisation, the name given to such entities — has been set up to invest in other businesses, making it a form of investor-directed venture capital fund. “There are no humans controlling it, it’s just the code,” said Simon Jentzsch, a German software developer who was one of the people behind the idea. “There is no one who will take money for favouring one or other contract. You will have the wisdom of the crowds.” As of Monday, The DAO had raised 10.7m units of a digital currency called Eth, said to be worth $120m. Its investors will vote on what to do with the money after fundraising ends on May 28, and after choosing between proposals submitted to its website. The organisation is governed by a set of so-called smart contracts which run on the Ethereum blockchain, a public ledger designed to make its operations transparent and enforceable. The contracts are designed to guarantee things like the “deliverables, responsibilities and operating parameters” agreed by companies The DAO invests in. The computer code behind the organisation was written by Mr Jentzsch’s brother, Christoph, and released publicly on Github, an online repository for code. “We didn’t want to be the ones who started or controlled this, we didn’t want to do it for ourselves,” said Mr Jentzsch. According to The DAO’s website, the only human involvement comes from a group of volunteers called “curators” who check the identity of people submitting proposals and make sure the projects are legal before “whitelisting” them. The organisation’s investors will then vote on which ones to give money to. There are no humans controlling it, it’s just the code. There is no one who will take money for favouring one or other contract. You will have the wisdom of the crowds As of Monday, Slock.it, a blockchain technology company where the Jentzsch brothers hold senior positions, was one of only two organisations to pitch for financial backing from The DAO. Mr Jentzsch said that, if successful, they would use the money to build a “universal sharing network”, a worldwide network “where you can share whatever things you have, [like] cars or houses”. He added that Slock.it had not decided yet how much money it would ask for, but that it would have to “negotiate” with The DAO for the money. Asked how the autonomous organisation could ensure it was not being used for money-laundering by its anonymous investors, Mr Jentzsch said a vehicle had been set up in Switzerland to facilitate The DAO’s investments in other companies, since Swiss law makes it possible to “take money from an unknown source as long as you know where it’s going”. The only other investment proposal listed on The DAO’s website is for Mobitiq, a French electric vehicle start-up.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Richard Waters","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-05-16","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/7bfdfe6c-1b6d-11e6-b286-cddde55ca122","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F2f2c34aa-1cee-11e6-a7bc-ee846770ec15?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Review — ‘Blockchain Revolution’, by Don and Alex Tapscott","INTRO":"A thorough and enlightening guide to the grand vision of the technology’s enthusiasts","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In 1993, the New Yorker ran a cartoon of a dog at a computer telling another, “On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog”. It called attention to one of the peculiarities of the world wide web. The technology allows anonymity because there is no way to identify users — robots, humans, or animals — apart from network address numbers. This is helpful in some ways: it fits with the libertarian ethos of the early internet and encourages freedom of expression. But it creates huge difficulties when it comes to basic functions, such as security and copyright protection. When an MP3 file could be copied and dispersed at the touch of a button by anonymous pirates, it upended the music industry. Now here comes the blockchain to solve these problems by providing the identity and transaction technology the web lacks. Excitement about the blockchain — the technology underlying bitcoin, which uses a peer-to-peer network of computers to authenticate transactions — has been building in many unlikely quarters, including banks and legal firms. This technology revolution is raising spirits both among revolutionaries and incumbents. Banks see a more secure and better-designed means of clearing transactions. Other industries muse about “smart contracts” — which hold the possibility of selling services to customers on the internet far more simply and efficiently. Meanwhile, blockchain enthusiasts imagine the outsmarting of corporate monoliths by networks of buyers and sellers linked by technology. Hold on, the reader may say. Have we not heard this before, including from Don Tapscott, whose 2006 book with Anthony Williams, Wikinomics, told us how mass collaboration would revolutionise commerce, thanks to the internet? The future lay with co-operatives and networks of companies. Blockchain enthusiasts imagine the outsmarting of corporate monoliths by networks of buyers and sellers linked by technology “Naive to be sure, but many people, present company included, hoped the internet, as embodied in the world wide web, would disrupt the industrial world where power was gripped by the few,” Tapscott and his son Alex write in this latest book. Instead, network effects and economies of scale have facilitated more powerful digital oligopolies such as Facebook and Google. Since the last wonder product did not work as advertised, the Tapscotts are more circumspect this time. Although their tone is largely what they call “rational exuberance” about the blockchain, they include plenty of warnings that optimism may be misplaced. “Rather than predicting a blockchain future, we’re advocating for it,” they say. One difficulty with blockchain technology being widely adopted, as they admit, is that it is hard to grasp. But if the idea could be fitted to broader use it could, for example, allow a “blockchain Uber”. Instead of one monopoly’s software co-ordinating passengers and taxis, customers and drivers could fix trips as a co-operative, enabled by their identities. It could amount to, as one “blockchain theorist” exclaims, “a complete revolution in how we do everything”. Somehow, I doubt that. The Tapscotts provide a thorough, balanced and enlightening guide to the next big thing. How big, we shall see.

Potential uses of blockchain — essentially a database that enables a secure, widely held, online ledger of transactions to be kept — have been hotly debated in the insurance industry. To date, however, product launches have been few and far between. But Blem, which makes IT systems for the industry, is set to become one of the few companies to use blockchain in a live product. It will use the technology to permanently record details of claims, so that insurers and their reinsurers can accurately divide the costs between them. “The system is really based on timestamping and auditing who has used which documents,” says Michael Mainelli of Z/Yen, a consultancy that helped to develop the system. “There have always been suspicions that insurers could change the data on what the situation was in the past.” Gavin Blem, Blem’s chief executive, says timestamping is one of the critical features of the product. “The opportunity that timestamping provides is a certainty that the information provided to the reinsurer existed at a particular moment in time and has not been changed since.” Z/Yen was also behind one of the few other uses of blockchain in the UK insurance market. Safeshare, a start-up, launched a blockchain-based insurance policy in March for people who rent out spare rooms in their homes for use as offices, via the Vrumi website.  That sort of commercial use is often excluded from traditional home insurance policies. Using blockchain helps Safeshare and Vrumi to permanently record details of transactions that have taken place. “2016 has been the year we’ve moved from proof-of-concept projects for mutual distributed ledgers to working systems,” says Professor Mainelli. There are hopes that blockchain could be widely used in insurance. According to Matthew Wong of CB Insights, a consultancy that compiles data on start-ups and venture capital, one possible use is in next-generation mutual insurance, where people pool their policies. Blockchain technology could help to permanently verify the details of people involved in the pool. Another potential use is fraud prevention. Everledger, a London-based start-up, is using blockchain to create a ledger of diamond ownership for buyers, sellers and insurers to use. It says that 65 per cent of fraudulent insurance claims go undetected. But, in the industry more generally, blockchain development is still in its early stages. “A lot of the insurers are in exploration mode,” says Mr Wong, “and there haven’t been a lot of start-ups.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Oliver Ralph","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-05-16","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/8090cc80-fff6-11e5-99cb-83242733f755","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F65ce007a-c40f-11e5-808f-8231cd71622e?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Comment: With blockchain, regulators should first do no harm","INTRO":"Authorities should avoid undue restrictions on emerging technologies","DETAILED_CONTENT":"September 2008 was a perilous time in global financial markets. I was a senior executive of one of the world’s major trading platforms for credit default swaps (CDS), then the focus of systemic risk. I remember a call from a US bank regulator asking about trading exposure in CDS of several major banks and brokers, including Lehman Brothers. Trading conditions were deteriorating by the minute. It was clear that the regulator had little means, short of telephone calls, to read all the danger signals the markets was broadcasting. Unfortunately seven-and-a-half years later and global regulators still do not have full visibility into the swaps trading portfolios of major institutions. One of the key reforms agreed upon following the crisis was the reporting of swaps transactions to regulators and central data repositories. My agency, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), started that initiative in 2011 and has pursued it ever since. Yet CFTC data still do not provide a complete picture of global swaps trading. In part, that is because global regulators have not harmonised global reporting protocols and data fields across international jurisdictions. It is also because of the practical impossibility of a single national regulator collecting sufficient quality data to recreate a real-time ledger of the highly complex, global trading portfolios of all market participants. Fortunately, emerging distributed ledger technology (DLT), or “blockchain”, may address this crucial need. The Bank of England has called DLT the “first attempt at an ‘internet of finance’”. It has the potential to link legal recordkeeping the same way the internet connects networks of data and information. It could increase settlement efficiency and speed, reducing transaction costs and broadening market access. Importantly, DLT could provide regulators with access to a “golden record” of the real-time ledgers of all regulated trading participants, rather than piecemeal data belatedly gathered to recreate complex, individual trading portfolios. In 2008, prudential regulators had to call around brokerage firms like mine searching for market confirmation of Lehman’s distress. If, however, they had access to a DLT golden record, they may have recognised anomalies in market-wide trade activity and divergence in counterparty exposures on a near or real-time basis. The blockchain could have allowed for far prompter, better-informed and more calibrated regulatory intervention instead of the disorganised response that unfortunately ensued. The blockchain could have allowed for far prompter, better-informed and more calibrated regulatory intervention instead of the disorganised response that unfortunately ensued Had Lehman still failed, records powered by DLT and held by trading counterparties (and available to regulators) would have accurately shown Lehman’s open positions across asset classes. Imagine if, instead of requiring countless legal actions spanning eight years, we could have known all of Lehman’s exposures within minutes of its bankruptcy filing. Accelerated settlement of open positions and accounts could have taken weeks, not years. Not surprisingly, millions are being invested today in new DLT ventures and innovations. Development is moving rapidly, certainly faster than underlying legal and regulatory frameworks. DLT is still in its infancy, with many hurdles to cross for it to reach its full potential. Yet, if it succeeds, it may face the danger of regulation from a dozen different directions with disparate restrictions stifling crucial technological development and implementation. Fortunately, there is a good model for the healthy development of DLT — the “do no harm” approach to the early internet. In the mid-1990s, a Republican US Congress and the Clinton administration were clear: the private sector should lead. Governments and regulators should avoid undue restrictions, support a predictable, consistent and simple legal environment and respect the “bottom-up” nature of the technology and its development in a global marketplace. “Do no harm” is the right approach for DLT. It appears to be the approach of the British Bankers’ Association and the UK Financial Conduct Authority. It must be the approach of all responsible policymakers. I recently called on the CFTC and its domestic and overseas counterparts to join an international consensus to avoid impeding essential DLT innovation by protracted rule uncertainty or uncoordinated actions. Thanks to policy foresight and initial regulatory restraint, the internet has revolutionised nearly every aspect of human life. Policymakers today must show that same wisdom. They must adopt a “do no harm” framework and let DLT realise its potential to help regulators better anticipate and respond to future financial market crises. J.

It is the first time a European bank has allowed a digital currency company to use its infrastructure — enabling it to transfer sterling and euros — according to the two companies. Boston-based Circle, which is valued at $250m, is expanding into Europe after launching a dollar transfer service for US users late last year. From Wednesday the payment app — which transfers dollars by first converting them to bitcoin — will also be able to transmit sterling between users of the app by linking to their debit cards. The tie-up with Barclays means Circle will be able to move sterling across the blockchain — a public ledger where bitcoin transactions are verified and recorded. Users will be able to exchange sterling and dollars immediately and free of charge. The move was welcomed by the UK Treasury, with economic secretary Harriett Baldwin saying that Circle’s partnership and UK launch were “major milestones”. Jeremy Allaire, chief executive and founder of Circle, said the app would add euros “in coming months”, and had plans to add Asian currencies in the future. Barclays said it was interested in “accelerating positive uses of blockchain”. Using the blockchain means that money can be exchanged without using a bank clearing system. Mr Allaire said the financial services industry did not fully realise the potential of the open-source blockchain, concentrating instead on developing its own closed versions based on similar technology. Barclays is among nine of the largest investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse, which are working on developing common standards for blockchain technology in an effort to broaden its use across financial services. Banks, exchanges and settlement houses are exploring ways to harness the much-hyped technology to reshape many of their daily operations, from upgrading back-office systems and outsourcing billions of dollars in costs to automatic execution of contracts. However, Mr Allaire said that blockchain would sooner disrupt the mobile payments industry, calling it a “blank slate” for innovators. “Payments are the next thing to be commoditised as a free service,” he said. Alongside Goldman Sachs, the company is backed by Jim Breyer’s Breyer Capital, Oak Investment Partners, Accel Partners and General Catalyst. Circle launched its first product, a mobile app for storing and transferring bitcoin, in late 2014 and says it has attracted customers in the “six figures” across 100 countries.

From this week, tech start-up Circle will allow UK users to transfer dollars and pounds sterling immediately and free of charge — even if converting one currency to the other. The smartphone-based system is able to make funds available to recipients and customers instantly, and its makers predict that as mobile “tap and pay” technology develops, paying commission to change money could become a thing of the past. The Boston-based company’s payment app — which transfers dollars by first converting them to bitcoin — will also be able to transmit sterling between users of the app by linking to their debit cards. It plans to add euros to the mix in “coming months”. Its UK launch is accompanied by a new partnership with Barclays, which provides Circle with the underlying infrastructure needed to settle sterling transactions. Circle differs from many of its competitors in that it uses blockchain — the encrypted public ledger that underlies bitcoin and records its transactions — to facilitate its currency exchanges, moving sterling by converting it to bitcoin before transmitting it. The app is the latest innovation in the fast-moving mobile payments industry, which includes the likes of TransferWise, the international money transfer service that currently claims to be “the cheapest way of transferring money globally”. Circle is also proud of its low-cost credentials — it is free to download and use. Unlike most mobile payment company chiefs, founder Jeremy Allaire believes that exchanging money is the next thing that will become totally free for consumers. Although the potential of blockchain technology has been widely recognised by those within the financial industry, most companies are exploring ways to build their own closed versions of blockchain to use within their own business. Goldman Sachs, an investor in Circle, itself made a patent application for a cryptocurrency settlement system in December. The bank would use digital currency — which it dubbed “SETLcoin” — to offer “nearly instantaneous execution and settlement” of trades involving assets including stocks and bonds. Mr Allaire said the financial services industry does not fully realise the disruptive potential of the technology underlying bitcoin, comparing the situation to the early days of the internet. Whereas the internet allows for the transmission of data, said Mr Allaire, “blockchain is an open-source protocol for transmitting value” — anybody with a powerful enough computer can exchange bitcoins through the blockchain. This, he predicts, will enable blockchain to completely disrupt the payments industry, calling it a “blank slate” for innovators. “Payments are the next thing to be commoditised as a free service,” he said. The Circle app — which its founders call a “social payments app” — allows users to send messages, photos and GIFS as well as money. This puts it in direct competition with Venmo, a similar app launched in the US by online payment company PayPal, which features emoticons and symbols that flash across a news feed within the app. By linking the app to debit cards, users could move money from one person’s bank account to another regardless of which bank they used. Circle — which is currently estimated to be worth $250m — is also backed by venture capital firms Breyer Capital, Oak Investment Partners, Accel Partners and General Catalyst. Circle launched its first product, a mobile app for storing and transferring bitcoin, in late 2014 and says it has attracted customers in the “six figures” in 100 countries.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Aime Williams","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-04-08","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/d6813cba-dd55-11e5-b072-006d8d362ba3","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fa21a289c-cb4e-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Financial Stability Board adds fintech to list of worries","INTRO":"Carney says technological innovations have transformative implications for the financial system","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Innovations in financial technology have been added to the list of things the Financial Stability Board worries about by Mark Carney, head of the international group of policymakers and regulators. The governor of the Bank of England told G20 finance ministers that the FSB would start to examine whether the growing fintech sector presents any risk to the financial system. The FSB will determine its next steps in March. “A number of technological innovations with potentially transformative implications for the financial system, its intermediaries and users are now receiving close attention,” he wrote in a letter to the ministers published on Saturday. “The regulatory framework must ensure that it is able to manage any systemic risks that may arise from technological change without stifling innovation.” “The FSB is evaluating the potential financial stability implications of emerging financial technology innovation for the financial system as a whole, working with standard setters that are monitoring developments in their respective sectors. We are also working to understand better the potential impacts on financial stability of operational disruption to core financial institutions or infrastructure.” The FSB’s scrutiny comes as financial companies are grappling with blockchain, the open-ledger technology that underpins bitcoin, the cryptocurrency. In turn, that has attracted the attention of regulators around the world. But this is the first time an international group has flagged its interest. The influential FSB makes policy recommendations around financial regulation to the G20 nations, whose finance ministers were meeting in China. Its past work has included leading work to mitigate “too big to fail” banks. Its attention this year is moving beyond banks: Mr Carney reiterated comments that broadly speaking banks were moving to what the FSB considers is the safe amount of capital to conserve, and that the FSB would concentrate on making sure existing regulations were implemented consistently around the world. In a move that will cheer banks, he added that the body would examine any unintended consequences of post-crisis regulation; something that the BoE and EU are also doing. The FSB will continue looking at asset managers, the shadow-banking sector, clearing houses and insurers. While asset managers managed last year to convince the FSB to shelve a plan to label them as systemically important as some banks are — which would have brought extra capital charges and increased supervision — Mr Carney’s letter said the FSB would put out policy recommendations for the sector, particularly around reducing fire-sale risks. The body has been concerned with open-ended funds offering their investors redemptions at very short notice.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Caroline Binham","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-02-27","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/1538efd8-c4e3-11e5-808f-8231cd71622e","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fbc29beb0-ea56-11e5-bb79-2303682345c8?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Digitised diamonds battle to defy thieves","INTRO":"Could new technology have stopped the Goodwood House robbery?","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When Lord March described a violent robbery at Goodwood House, his stately home, in January as “challenging”, this was a very particular kind of English understatement. He and Lady March had been attacked by a burglar in the middle of the night, forced to open their safe and tied up for two hours. More than 40 items were stolen from their 18th-century house near Chichester, south-west of London, including a diamond tiara dating back to 1820 and an emerald and diamond ring given by Charles II to his mistress Louise de Kérouaille, duchess of Portsmouth. Earrings, bracelets, necklaces and antique Rolex and Girard Perregaux watches were also part of the £700,000 haul. If the theft were not bad enough, with every week that passes the prospect of recovering any of the heirlooms grows bleaker. The last public update from Operation Forster — the investigation into the Goodwood House robbery — came on January 27, when it was announced that a “substantial” reward for information leading to the jewels’ recovery was being offered; since then, nothing. However, as a range of new security measures emerge, future victims may fare better than the Marches. Stolen jewellery normally disappears without a trace, says Paul Higgins, head of specie at RK Harrison, part of Hyperion Insurance Group. “You tend to see recoveries only when thieves are apprehended quickly, within weeks,” he says. “Much beyond that, recoveries are very, very rare. I’ll be honest, in around 15 years, I can only recall working on a couple of cases where jewellery actually resurfaced a year or more after it was stolen.” “The recovery rate of diamonds is usually very low. Open-source cases show that stolen diamonds and jewellery are usually not found,” said a 2013 report by the Financial Action Task Force, a Paris-based intergovernmental body set up to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, two activities frequently fuelled by stolen diamonds. In a case such as the Goodwood House burglary, involving highly distinctive, easily recognisable items of “estate” jewellery, says Mr Higgins, a smart thief wouldn’t even attempt to sell on a piece in its intact state. Precious metal, after all, can be melted down. Diamonds, once liberated from their settings, are eminently portable, thus easy to transport abroad on a commercial flight, stashed in a piece of carry-on luggage, for example, and then sold on in a foreign market. Enter the blockchain. This is perhaps best known as the underlying technology for the bitcoin digital currency, but it is becoming clear it has applications for diamonds too. Blockchain is, in essence, an online recording system which can be used to track where a diamond comes from and can keep strict details of how and when it passes from owner to owner. That, at least, is the idea behind Everledger, a London-based start-up that is using blockchain technology to replace the current paper-based and fraud-prone processes that surround diamond ownership. For a start, explains the company’s chief executive Leanne Kemp, a blockchain-based ledger like Everledger is not stored in one place, but is distributed across a potentially vast number of computers belonging to participants in a network. In Everledger’s case, these are owners, insurance companies, diamond certification bodies and law enforcement agencies. Every member of that network has access to the most up-to-date version of the ledger, making it transparent. Each record on the ledger, meanwhile, is immutable — so the transaction history of a specific diamond can only be added to with a new “block” of information. This creates a complete chain of ownership that can be trusted by the whole community because it cannot be otherwise altered or removed. Most importantly, Everledger holds a multi-layered, digital version of a diamond that links closely to its physical incarnation, via the serial number laser-engraved on its girdle. As with all diamond certification, the all-important “four Cs” of a stone — its cut, colour, clarity and carat weight — are captured on Everledger, along with its serial number, but 40 other data points are added too. By early February, Ms Kemp says, there were around 980,000 diamonds registered on Everledger, allowing network members to check out a stone’s full history and characteristics. The information that Everledger holds could thus be useful in investigating robberies of high-value stones if they resurface some time after an insurance claim for their loss or theft has been paid out. The big drawback is the unique identifying number engraved on a diamond That is not Everledger’s primary purpose, Ms Kemp says, which is to combat fraud rather than theft, by helping insurance companies guard against fraudulent claims. According to Ms Kemp, around 65 per cent of such claims go undetected. An Everledger-registered diamond which had been falsely claimed for would be much harder to sell on, assuming the buyer checked out its provenance. The big drawback is the unique identifying number laser-engraved on a diamond’s girdle that links a physical stone to the “digital copy” held on Everledger. As Vartkess Knadjian, chief executive of Backes \u0026 Strauss, the world’s oldest diamond company, points out, removing such an engraving is an easy job for an experienced diamond polisher. Ms Kemp says that this process often depletes a diamond’s value, by removing weight — but that may well be a sacrifice that a determined fraudster or thief is prepared to make. Technology needs to catch up with thieves. “As an industry, there’s a problem here with traceability that technology really should be helping us to solve — and I still believe that it will, but we’re not there yet,” says Mr Knadjian. He says he is yet to see, for example, any kind of technology based on a global positioning system (GPS) that is small enough to be incorporated into one of his company’s diamond-set watches without compromising its aesthetics. And there are additional problems with which the industry must contend, mainly around its largely paper-based documentation processes: one is the issuing of fraudulent certificates, another is the altering of genuine ones. Transaction histories are often incomplete, or a stolen gemstone may be traded multiple times in swift succession in Dubai or India, for example, in order to create a convincing new transaction history. This technology, of course, would only work on “estate” jewellery, such as that owned by the Marches, if the owners were prepared for pieces to be dismantled, to get the individual diamonds laser-engraved, and then reassembled. With antique items, there’s a considerable risk of damage to the settings, which might be almost impossible to repair without devaluing the item. In other words, Lord and Lady March may in future still have to rely on old-fashioned detection, rather than up-to-the-minute technology. To understand blockchains, it is worth looking at the digital currency bitcoin, writes Kadhim Shubber. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by an anonymous person or persons using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The intent was to create digital money that would be free from the control of governments and banks. To prevent such a thing from being shut down, it needed to exist in more than one place, as governments can seize and destroy one computer server. Distribute the information across many computers over the world and the task becomes so prohibitive as to nearly be impossible. What is more, a central authority could not be trusted to verify transactions for the same reason. So the users themselves do it, adding blocks of transactions on to the existing chain and stamping it by solving a computationally difficult maths problem, just as a writer might seal a letter by using a wax stamp. While debates continue over the sustainability of bitcoin, a broad range of new and old companies are creating their own blockchains, including Everledger, either choosing to make them accessible to anyone or to a select few approved parties. But whether companies choose to use the existing bitcoin infrastructure or to create their own blockchain system, the core characteristics that make the technology appealing as a database are the same. One of these is its distributed nature. Instead of one copy of the database in one place, a blockchain necessarily has many copies in many places, providing reliability at the expense of efficiency. If one computer fails, data are not lost because many other computers hold the same information. Another is immutability. New entries in the database are tied to preceding entries using cryptography, creating a chain that prevents earlier entries from being altered. Combined with the distributed nature, this dramatically increases the likelihood that any record made in a blockchain system will be permanent. Some of these things become redundant for spinout applications of the blockchain. Bitcoin is open to the whole world and full of anonymous users — are such security measures or incentives necessary when users are pre-vetted and known? But with either the public bitcoin network or some more private, generic blockchain system, there is the potential not just to maintain a database of transactions but to link those transactions to individual, identifiable real-world objects. The ownership history of a specific diamond, for example, could be stored securely and permanently, providing confidence about its true source. The obvious difficulty is that a digital database, no matter how technically advanced, cannot in itself address the real-world issue of fraud. Indeed the permanence of blockchain systems carries that risk that fraudulent records persist — blockchains solve many things, but cannot escape the myriad political, legal, ethical and economic complexities of the real world. So think of it as just a sort of database, albeit a very interesting one.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jessica Twentyman","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-03-16","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/b83a0a74-ca8c-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F0d864cf8-7e35-11e5-98fb-5a6d4728f74e?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Australia is in the vanguard of blockchain’s march to market","INTRO":"The technology behind bitcoin will be used for clearing and settlement by ASX","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Australia is set to become the test case for an attempt by custodians of the world’s financial data to apply emerging blockchain technology to markets. Blockchain — which combines the peer-to-peer computing ethos of Silicon Valley with the money management of Wall Street — is slowly being introduced to financial markets. To its champions, the technology that underpins bitcoin — when shorn of the association with the controversial cryptocurrency — can free up billions of dollars of costs included in delays and insurance within the financial system. It could even undermine the banks’ role in the market. Efforts have been tentative, but the experiment could advance greatly this year after ASX Group revealed potentially radical plans to move Australia’s equities clearing and settlement system on to the blockchain. The operator of Australia’s market infrastructure is partnering with Digital Asset Holdings, a US group that last month secured $60m in backing from Deutsche Börse, Icap, CME Group and others, to see if such a move is feasible. The start-up is headed by Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker who helped popularise credit default swaps. “We think we should lead the world in this, and we believe we can,” Elmer Funke Kupper, chief executive of ASX, told analysts last week. “We have taken it more seriously because the work we’ve done suggests for a market of our structure and size, the opportunity could be quite material to take cost [of A$4.5bn] out of the end-to-end system. All this might fail, but what will fail is the real thing and not a trial.” The technology allows a digital asset to be moved electronically between counterparties and for transactions to be maintained on a shared digital public database. The record is continuously maintained and verified by all the other computers involved in a chain of transactions, preventing fraud. While the world watches Australia, big hurdles remain — especially companies that have been running settlement infrastructure for a generation. Digital Asset Holdings has a working prototype but says the $60m will be used primarily to cover investments in people, to develop computer code for multiple use cases. “The user cases are in equities, repo [repurchase agreements], equities, foreign exchange, syndicated lending, trade finance . . . each of those needs a lot of investment,” said Ms Masters. “You need to build out the common technology that’s fundamental to all use cases, as well as the business logic for specific asset classes.” One issue that ASX will have to decide is where blockchain can make the biggest difference. One concept common among blockchain developers is a “genesis block”, the first block of a chain. It contains the details of a financial transaction and encrypted data that is passed on to other parties for deciphering and verification. But a report by Oliver Wyman and Euroclear, the European settlement house, noted that this “single universal source of the truth” database could be taken on by expanding the role of a central securities depository. The warehouse is a standard feature of most markets and the place where a transaction is confirmed as final and the security swapped for cash. “Are we talking about a wholesale replacement of the system with blockchain or will it use blockchain to solve issues where the technology doesn’t exist?” says Ben Shepherd, partner at Oliver Wyman. Many countries also have legislation that requires data to be physically maintained in the country. That cuts across the ability of a ledger that can be distributed around the world. And local regulators are conscious that, ultimately, ordinary consumers will have to trust the new system. Greg Medcraft, chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, has floated the idea that “exchanges will need to guarantee the customer behind it”. Oliver Wyman and Euroclear warned blockchain technology could take more than 10 years to reach the core of financial markets because of a lack of common standards and contractual documentation, scalability and regulation. Mike Bodson, chief executive of Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the US post-trade group, acknowledges it is a potential “game changer” but says: “How do you transition from today’s world to a distributed ledger in a way that is seamless, not cost prohibitive and do-able? That is some ways the biggest conundrum.” Even if successful, there are doubts the lessons will really be applicable elsewhere. Australia is relatively unique in that it has only about 2,500 financial entities in its ecosystem, the ASX owns all the main infrastructure and the country has a fully dematerialised equity market — in which share ownership only exists in digital form. Mr Shepherd also notes that Australia had invested billions of dollars in faster payments systems in recent years. Ms Masters says that “where fragmentation is greatest, the potential for user savings is greatest”. But it is taking years for DTCC to move the US equity market even from a three-day to a two-day settlement system because the system is complex. “The technology is the easy part. It is getting everyone together and marching to the same drummer,” says Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, which is developing its own blockchain trials in Estonia. “The US is much larger, more complex, more competitive and more fragmented. The level of discussion increases exponentially.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford Nicole Bullock","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-02-17","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/db833e5a-6eb1-11e6-a0c9-1365ce54b926","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F77bb205e-86c1-11e6-bcfc-debbef66f80e?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ten fintech start-ups that are causing a stir in insurance","INTRO":"Links between traditional insurers and new players are critical for both","DETAILED_CONTENT":"For a long time, the fintech start-up scene took little interest in the seemingly sleepy world of insurance. Payments, foreign exchange and peer-to-peer lending grabbed the headlines, plus the funding. But over the past couple of years, all that has changed. Insurtech — or instech — is now attracting entrepreneurs and the investors that back them. “Quite a few entrepreneurs who have been in other areas of fintech have moved over to insurance,” says Matthew Wong of research company CB Insights. Funding for insurance technology companies rose from $740m in 2014 to $2.7bn a year later, according to CB Insights. This year has also been busy. “Deal pace is higher than it was last year,” says Mr Wong. “There’s a lot more enthusiasm, especially at the early stage.” The start-ups are targeting all parts of insurance. Many are focusing on distribution, using new technology to reach consumers that traditional insurers miss. Others are looking at analytics, helping insurers to use data to make better underwriting decisions. Blockchain — the technology that underpins bitcoin — is increasingly popular, while health insurance has been a big area of start-up activity in the US. Nor have start-ups ignored the potential of the “internet of things” — the growing use of data-collecting devices in everyday items, from cars using telematics systems to connected homes.  Few start-ups have become full, risk-bearing insurers. Analysts say that the capital requirements, regulatory burden and complexity required, combined with the desire of investors for short-term returns, means that very few of them underwrite their own policies. The result is that for most start-ups, partnerships with existing insurers are critical. Without them, many would struggle to make the business model work. Insurers tend to be willing partners, seeing start-ups as a way to win business in normally out-of-reach markets. But Nigel Walsh, partner at Deloitte, warns of drawbacks. “The risk is that the insurers will have no interaction with their clients,” he says. “They’ll just be product manufacturing.” Founded: 2014 Founders: Freddy Macnamara and James Billingham Shareholders: Angel syndicate Funding: £500,000 Based: UK Activity: Cuvva takes a fresh approach to car insurance. While most insurers cover customers’ vehicles for a full year, Cuvva breaks it down into smaller chunks. Its first product allows policyholders to insure themselves on a friend’s vehicle for as short a period as an hour via an app. Its second, to be launched this autumn, will allow drivers to buy an hour of coverage for their own vehicles, which is designed to suit people who do not drive frequently. While Cuvva is still at an early stage of development, some analysts say that insurers will increasingly have to follow its model of offering more flexible products than their current range of fixed, year-long contracts. Cuvva uses data provided by the UK’s Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority to help verify policy requests, a process that it says takes about 10 seconds. Founded: 2014 Founders: Arvind Parthasarathi and George Ng Shareholders: New Enterprise Associates, IVP and Dowling Capital Partners Funding: $40m Based: US Activity: Demand for cyber insurance has been growing rapidly over the past few years, with high-profile attacks on companies such as Target in the US and TalkTalk in the UK persuading companies that they need cover. For insurers, cyber offers plenty of potential growth but also lots of uncertainty. How likely is it that any given client will be hacked — and, if they are, how much damage could there be? San Francisco-based Cyence is developing a system that can model these risks in financial and economic terms. It has already won its first customers, including Brit Insurance, AM Best and Marsh. In September it raised $40m from investors in one of the largest insurtech fundraisings of the year. Founded: 2014 Founders: Daniel Schreiber and Shai Wininger Shareholders: Sequoia, Aleph and XL Innovate Funding: $13m Based: US Activity: Lemonade has been the subject of speculation. It first billed itself as a peer-to-peer insurer, but was coy about exactly what that meant or its business model. It has since raised money, signed partnerships with the likes of Berkshire Hathaway, Lloyd’s and XL Catlin, and recruited high-profile executives. It even hired behavioural economist Dan Ariely, author of bestseller Predictably Irrational, as chief behavioural officer. In September the company, which unlike many other insurtech start-ups is licensed as an insurer, revealed it will sell home insurance in New York. It will group its customers together and, at the end of each year, any premiums that have not been paid as claims will be given to a charity of the group’s choosing. Founded: 2012 Founders: Mario Schlosser and Josh Kushner Shareholders: Fidelity Investments, Google Capital, General Catalyst, Founders Fund, Lakestar, Khosla Ventures and Thrive Capital Funding: $750m Based: US Activity: Oscar is one of the older and more developed insurtech start-ups. Focused on health insurance, Oscar uses technology and data to improve the care it offers to its customers. It was created after the introduction of the US Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and its services are available in New York and New Jersey. Among the benefits it offers are phone lines to its doctors and systems that help healthcare professionals manage members’ care. It has some big-name backers, including Fidelity and Google, and a fundraising earlier this year valued the company at almost $3bn. According to Deloitte it has annual revenue of $200m. Founded: 2014 Founders: Jennifer Fitzgerald and Francois de Lame Shareholders: Revolution Ventures, Karlin Ventures, Susa Ventures, Transamerica Ventures, Axa Strategic Ventures and MassMutual Ventures Funding: $21m Based: US Activity: Price comparison sites have been in the UK for many years, regularly assaulting potential customers with TV ads featuring meerkats, opera singers and other outlandish characters. But the US market has been slower to take off. Analysts blame a reliance on brokers for distribution, state-by-state regulation and wariness from customers and insurers. PolicyGenius is hoping to help change that, arguing that more and more Americans would rather organise their insurance online than via an agent. It offers a range of products including life, health and pet policies. With backers such as big insurers Axa, Transamerica and MassMutual, it could make a dent in the market. Founded: 2015 Founders: Alexander Steinart and Christiano Pizzocheri Shareholders: Founders and Z/Yen Funding: £200,000 Based: UK Activity: Blockchain is one of the buzzwords of the fintech world, and this is no different among insurers. The technology allows transactions to be recorded securely in multiple locations. How exactly it can be used in insurance is the subject of much discussion within the industry. Safeshare is one of the few companies to have launched a blockchain-based product. It describes its market as “insurance for the sharing economy”, and its first product illustrates what it is trying to do. In March it announced it had teamed up with Vrumi — a website that allows people to rent out their spare rooms for use as offices — to launch property insurance. The policies are underwritten at Lloyd’s and the use of blockchain should, in theory, allow the parties involved in the policy to be linked securely and cheaply. Founded: 2012 Founders: Robin von Hein, Joachim von Bonin and Ismail Asci Shareholders: Rheingau Founders, Assurant, Route 66 and Allianz SE Funding: €20m Based: Germany Activity: One of the big hopes for insurtech is that it will break insurance down from the catch-all policies insurers have traditionally offered into more specific coverage for individual needs. Simplesurance is one of the companies aiming to do that by allowing people to buy insurance for products at the point of sale. Although smartphones, laptops and tablets dominate, it can be used for a much wider range of items. Founder Robin von Hein says the company has almost 2,000 ecommerce providers using its system, and that it launches in a new country every four weeks. Like other start-ups, Simplesurance is not a risk-bearing insurer itself. Instead it acts as a broker, passing on the risk to traditional players such as Allianz and Assurant. Founded: 2016 Founders: Alberto Chierici, Renaud Million and Alberto Pasqualotto Shareholders: Founders Funding: Under £50,000 Based: UK Activity: A relatively new start-up, SPIXII was founded by a group of former actuaries and computer scientists, one of whom used to be a consultant for high-frequency trading firms. Like many insurtech start-ups, its target is the way insurers interact with their customers. SPIXII is developing a chatbot — software that allows insurers, brokers and price comparison sites to talk to customers via programs such as Facebook Messenger and Skype. It is still early days, but SPIXII’s founders say that within four months of launching it had a pipeline of more than 60 companies that were interested in its technology. It has also caught the attention of Germany’s Allianz, which has put SPIXII into a five-month accelerator programme at one of its bases in France. Founded: 2011 Founders: Jan-Kees Buenen and Danny Holten Shareholders: Mangrove Capital Partners, 5 Park Lane and Tiketitoo Funding: €5m Based: Netherlands Activity: Synerscope is one of a clutch of companies focused on helping insurers make better use of their data. Its chief technology officer, Jorik Blaas, has a background in MRI scanning and equipment used to look beneath layers of paint on old masters’ artwork. The company aims to take the growing volumes of data that insurers collect — such as data produced by in-car cameras and drones — and turn them into something insurers can use. It has had some success in its home market, with insurers including Delta Lloyd and Achmea using its systems. Achmea used Synerscope to find out which road junctions had more accidents than others. That information can be used not only to reduce claims but also to prevent accidents. Founded: 2012 Founders: Scott Walchek Shareholders: OAK HC/FT, Anthemis Group, Guidewire and Suncorp Group Funding: $46m Based: US Activity: Trov is another company aiming to break insurance down into easily digestible chunks. It sells item-by-item insurance policies for personal possessions, for whatever duration customers choose, via an app. Trov also hopes to improve the claims experience, using a chat service to automate the process. Despite being based in the US, its first market was Australia, where the service has been most popular with 18- to 34-year-olds. Like other start-ups, Trov does not do underwriting itself, preferring to partner with established companies. In Australia, where it launched in May, Suncorp is the underwriter. In the UK Trov’s imminent launch will be Axa, while in the US — where it plans to launch next year — Munich Re will provide the underwriting, it announced in September.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Oliver Ralph","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-10-03","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/3be95e82-cc19-11e5-a8ef-ea66e967dd44","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F13e5f850-cc37-11e5-a8ef-ea66e967dd44?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Five UK fund houses explore blockchain technology","INTRO":"Asset managers join forces to see if bitcoin technology can save billions of pounds in costs","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Five of the UK’s biggest fund houses have joined forces on a secret project to test if blockchain, the nascent technology underpinning bitcoin, the digital currency, can be used to save billions of pounds in trading costs. Schroders and Aberdeen Asset Management, the second and third-largest listed fund houses in Europe by assets, are working on the project with Columbia Threadneedle Investments, the £320bn asset manager. Two people familiar with the project said Aviva Investors, which oversees assets of £246bn, and Henderson Global Investors have also had some involvement in the discussions. It is the first time asset managers have come together to experiment with blockchain, which is a giant, online public ledger. Banks have been working together for months to unpack the technology, which proponents claim will revolutionise finance. The UK fund houses, which collectively manage more than £1tn in assets, are looking into several applications for the technology, including trading illiquid securities directly with each other. The aim is to speed up how quickly ownership of illiquid securities can be moved from one asset manager to another, a process that can currently take several days. If successful, the asset managers believe they could reduce costs substantially by cutting out intermediaries such as banks. They would also require fewer staff. One person involved in the project said: “We want to see if there is a commercial benefit in this in the long term.” The asset managers are understood to be working with fintech companies, start-up technology businesses, and KPMG, the audit and consulting firm. The project is in its early stages. Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, a consultancy, described asset managers involved in the blockchain project as “early adopters who want to gain a competitive edge”. Fund houses have lagged behind banks in exploring potential uses of blockchain. This is despite R3, a consortium of banks and technology companies, suggesting the technology has the “potential to impact the financial services sector the way the internet changed media and entertainment”. “Asset managers are probably a year or more behind the banks [when it comes to blockchain],” according to one consultant. Several banks are involved in large-scale blockchain projects. JPMorgan Chase, the US investment bank, is working with Digital Asset Holdings, the New York-based start-up run by Blythe Masters, the former banker, to see how it can cut the cost and hassle of trading. Goldman Sachs has filed a patent application for a blockchain-based system that would offer “nearly instantaneous execution and settlement” of trades involving assets including stocks and bonds. Barclays, UBS and Deutsche Bank are also experimenting with the technology, although there are currently few working models. Mr Rajan said it will probably be years before most fund houses embrace blockchain. “Asset managers are wary of transformational changes, since they are dealing with other people’s money. Systems failures can cause huge reputational damage,” he said. Blockchain’s links with bitcoin, which is best known for its fluctuating value and popularity with criminals, has spooked some asset managers, while others are concerned about the costs involved in developing the technology. Several of the world’s largest asset managers, including Pimco and JPMorgan Asset Management, are not looking closely at how blockchain can be applied to the fund industry, according to people familiar with the fund houses. A spokesperson for BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said: “Like many other firms, we are monitoring developments in this area.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Attracta Mooney","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-02-07","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/42dce148-ca87-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F6283b5cc-cb5d-11e5-a8ef-ea66e967dd44?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin stigma hobbles blockchain take-up","INTRO":"Asset managers unconvinced about the benefits of the technology behind the cryptocurrency","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The asset management industry and a technology that has found favour with drug dealers do not seem like natural bedfellows. Yet blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin, the controversial digital currency, is being heralded as “revolutionary” for fund houses. The nascent technology’s would-be impact on financial services has been likened to the effect the internet had on the music and media industries. Blockchain has the potential to turn the finance industry on its head, saving asset managers billions of dollars and “making the whole investing process much quicker and more transparent”, says Jeff Levi, a partner at Casey Quirk, a consultancy. It is a far cry from a few years ago, when bitcoin — and by default blockchain — was labelled the “Wild West of finance”. The cryptocurrency is best known for its fluctuating value and use on the dark web, the part of the internet that is only accessible by means of special software and which is often used for criminal activity, such as buying drugs or guns. The focus has shifted from bitcoin to blockchain, which, in essence, is a giant, online public ledger that keeps track of who owns bitcoins — and who owned it in the past. If you bought an item using bitcoin, the blockchain would record that the ownership of the digital currency has moved from the seller to you. It is this continuous and quick recording of transactions that has the financial services industry both excited and scared. “It is a really, really exiting area for the asset management industry,” says Jackie Alvarez, who is carrying out research on blockchain for Investit, a consultancy. Most commentators say blockchain’s biggest impact on the fund industry will be in the clearing and settlement process, the often dull side of asset management that involves moving ownership of securities from one investor to another. When an asset manager buys a security, a large number of in-house staff and service providers set to work processing the transaction. A record of the trade is submitted to the clearing agency, often a bank, which then matches the buyer and seller records. Money to pay for the security is moved from the buyer to the seller, while the security is given to the buyer. These labour-intensive jobs can take days, tying up cash in the process. Widespread adoption of blockchain could mean almost instantaneous settling of securities, says Hu Liang, senior managing director of the emerging technologies centre at State Street, the US bank. “It is an efficiency play.” Quicker settlement would also have a big effect on asset managers’ balance sheets. Fund houses would need far fewer staff for some roles, says Mr Levi. Faster settlement “changes the whole workload. That is a fundamental change in their operating model”, adds Chris Mills, who runs the global blockchain initiative at KPMG, the consultancy. Asset managers could get rid of their cumbersome and expensive IT systems, adds Charley Cooper, managing director of R3, a consortium of banks and fintech companies working together to use blockchain. “All of this would have a significant impact on reducing costs,” he says. Steve Libby, co-chairman of the digital/fintech forum at Alfi, the fund industry association in Luxembourg, adds: “The knock-on effects [of faster and more accurate settling] are very positive for the asset management industry.” Other uses for blockchain include making it easier for asset managers to trade directly with each other, cutting out traditional middlemen such as brokers. Blockchain could furthermore play a role in preventing money laundering by helping asset managers to understand who their underlying investors are. The adoption of blockchain by asset managers would be good news for investors, says Mr Cooper. “Any time you can make the system safer and reduce costs, that is good for investors.” Despite all the potential uses of blockchain, few asset managers are running projects to see if the technology works. Alex Birkin, advisory leader at EY, the consultancy, says: “A lot of asset managers are observing [the work that is being done to develop blockchain technology], rather than committing a lot of their money.” This is in stark contrast to other parts of the financial services sector. JPMorgan Chase said last week it had begun a trial project using blockchain to cut costs and reduce the hassle of trading. The US bank is working with Digital Asset Holdings, the New York-based start-up run by Blythe Masters, best known for creating the modern credit default swap. The Nasdaq stock exchange used blockchain for the first time in December to transfer shares. Banks are also working together in consortiums such as R3 to see how blockchain can be used in financial markets. R3 recently opened up its membership to asset managers, although none has joined so far. One of the reasons behind this reluctance to embrace blockchain is because of its associations with bitcoin. “The stigma around bitcoin has distracted people from the benefits of blockchain technology and the applicability of blockchain. Had there not been the stigma around blockchain, people would have realised faster how useful the technology could be,” says Angus McLean, a partner at Simmons \u0026 Simmons, the law firm. Many asset managers still have concerns about the technology, chiefly how scalable it is and how robust the encryption is, says EY’s Mr Birkin. Then there is asset managers’ general reluctance to embrace technologies. “In the asset industry, technological change comes at a glacial pace. It tends to come later rather than sooner,” says Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, the UK-based consultancy. Asset managers who think blockchain is not a big deal for them are mistaken, says R3’s Mr Cooper. “If you are sitting there thinking this doesn’t affect me, that is not the case.” Bitcoin has a chequered past. Since its invention seven years ago, the digital currency has been heavily associated with crime. It has found favour with individuals looking to buy drugs or weapons on the dark net, the part of the internet that is only accessible by means of special software. Its value has fluctuated widely. The price of a bitcoin reached a high of $1,124.75 in November 2013. It now typically trades at between $200 and $300. There are widespread concerns about the security of the digital currency, while officials are worried about the lack of a central authority overseeing it. Thanks to these issues, one US regulator described bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the “Wild West of finance” in 2014. Mike Hearn, a prominent developer of bitcoin, recently called the cryptocurrency a “failed experiment”. Yet bitcoin is gaining some legitimacy. There are 100,000 merchants that accept bitcoin for payment, including PayPal, Expedia, the travel-booking site, and Microsoft, the technology company. The UK also wants to become a hub for bitcoin trading and Europe’s top court ruled bitcoin should be treated as money for tax purposes. The court’s decision “is the first step in securing bitcoin’s future as a genuine alternative to national currencies”, Richard Asquith, a vice-president at Avalara, the tax compliance company, told the FT.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Attracta Mooney","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-02-07","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/7498c8ba-d4e0-11e5-829b-8564e7528e54","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fe72228ca-c0a6-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blythe Masters forges blockchain partnerships","INTRO":"Digital Asset Holdings agrees alliances Accenture, PwC and Broadridge","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blythe Masters, the investment banker turned blockchain entrepreneur, will on Wednesday announce a string of partnerships with consultancies to help their financial clients harness the technology that underpins bitcoin. Digital Asset Holdings, the New York start-up run by Ms Masters, has agreed alliances with Accenture, PwC and Broadridge to offer its blockchain technology to their consulting clients with a promise to save them money and time. Accenture is building on its partnership with the former JPMorgan Chase banker by also announcing the launch of a blockchain practice, which will advise clients on how to implement the technology. The moves highlight how the financial services sector is rushing to explore the potential of blockchain, the computer network on which bitcoin sits. The technology is based on a shared digital database that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records and is accessible by various parties. This means payment or trading ledgers can be instantly updated in multiple locations without a single, centralised authority. Ms Masters said Digital Asset’s technology “improves post-trade processing efficiency for banks and other financial institutions”. She added: “Instead of building countless duplicative records, one master prime record can eliminate the need for reconciliation, which is a very costly process for financial institutions, while improving compliance, security and privacy.” “Investment banks are spending about $100bn a year on technology, and the blockchain could take out about 10 to 20 per cent of that,” said Richard Lumb, chief executive of Accenture’s financial services operating group. “When you look at an industry that is down on its knees in terms of profitability, the blockchain offers some really valuable answers,” he added. “There is a market forming around the blockchain, and we don’t want to be left behind in that race.” While most regulators and senior bankers view bitcoin with suspicion, the technology that underpins it has caught the imagination of the financial services industry within the past year. A host of companies are vowing to find ways to use it to reshape many of their daily operations, from upgrading old back-office systems to automatic execution of contracts. Digital Asset recently announced it had raised $60m in funding from 15 financial institutions. Accenture was one investor, as were several big banks, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citigroup, Santander and BNP Paribas. It has also agreed a deal with JPMorgan to look at several applications for the technology, such as addressing liquidity mismatches in JPMorgan’s loan funds, which normally let investors take out their money at short notice — even though the underlying assets can require much more time to sell.

ASX has signed a deal for Nasdaq, the US operator, to upgrade the Sydney group’s equities clearing platform and will roll out the project as it tries to create a workable system for settlement. Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, told analysts last week that the previously unannounced deal had contributed to the company’s “exceptional quarter in terms of total order value”. The disclosure came days after the ASX announced it would work with Digital Asset Holdings, a US blockchain technology provider, to design a new system for clearing and settlement in the Australian equity market. ASX has a longstanding plan to upgrade all of its trading and post-trade platforms over the next three years. Nasdaq and Sweden’s Cinnober Financial Technology will provide some components of the system. DAH will potentially provide the existing settlement system as ASX upgrades Chess, an equities settlement services business that transfers money between counterparties and legal ownership of the shares. The move reflects growing interest by global exchanges, clearing and settlement operators in the potential benefits of blockchain technology, which aims to bring large-scale computing power to much of finance. It allows a digital asset to be moved electronically between counterparties without using a central ledger to record the transaction. A shared digital public database is continuously maintained and verified by all the other computers involved in a chain of transactions, preventing fraud. Proponents say the technology could speed up slow and inefficient back offices and reshape trade processing and settlement. However, in a report released on Wednesday Oliver Wyman, the consultancy, and Euroclear, the European settlement house, argued that “the obstacles to be overcome are significant, and it is far from clear what will ultimately emerge”. The report said established market operators needed to develop standards, preserve the strengths of current payment and settlement systems and meet existing regulations. It pointed out that many of blockchain’s touted benefits could be achieved by expanding the role in the market played by central securities depositories, such as ASX’s Chess. ASX has not committed irrevocably to blockchain, which will work in tandem with existing systems. “This will allow all stakeholders to assess the benefits and implications before a final decision is made on Australia’s post-trade technology in 2017.” DAH, headed by former JPMorgan banker Blythe Masters, yesterday said IBM and Goldman Sachs had also invested in the company, taking the fundraising total past $60m.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-02-03","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/2d3f9296-c5ef-11e5-b3b1-7b2481276e45","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fe72228ca-c0a6-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blythe Masters and JPMorgan trial blockchain project","INTRO":"Bank working with Digital Asset Holdings in efforts to cut trading costs","DETAILED_CONTENT":"JPMorgan Chase has begun a trial project using blockchain as it seeks to lead banking-industry efforts to cut the cost and hassle of trading. The move by JPMorgan, the biggest US bank by assets, is among the clearest statements yet of banks’ determination to explore the potential of blockchain, the computer network on which bitcoin sits. The bank is collaborating with Digital Asset Holdings, the New York-based start-up run by Blythe Masters, the bank’s former head of commodities. The pair are looking at several applications for the technology, including addressing liquidity mismatches in JPMorgan’s loan funds, which normally let investors take out their money at short notice — even though the underlying assets can require much more time to sell. “To sell a loan is a very cumbersome, time-consuming process; settlement can take weeks,” said Daniel Pinto, head of JPMorgan’s investment bank. Exploring alternatives through blockchain “makes all the sense in the world; it’s easier and faster operationally, and you get fewer mistakes”. Blockchain has caught the imagination of the financial services industry within the past year, with a host of companies vowing to find ways to use it to reshape many of their daily operations, from upgrading old back-office systems to automatic execution of contracts. The technology is essentially a digital public database of events that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records and shared among various parties. This means payment ledgers can be instantly updated in multiple locations without a single, centralised authority. JPMorgan appears to be taking a lead in encouraging broader, industry-wide adoption of blockchain technology — in a similar way to how Goldman Sachs has led a consortium developing Symphony, a communications tool. Officials at JPMorgan point to the bank’s involvement with the Linux Foundation’s Open Ledger Project, which said last month that it was aiming to create standards that the entire financial services industry could adopt. Mr Pinto said loans were a good place to start trialing blockchain technology, because “the settlement process is complex with lots of manual intervention and multiple parties”. A couple of months into the trial, the 52-year-old executive — among the leading candidates to succeed chief executive Jamie Dimon should he step down in the near-term — is pleased with progress. “Blockchain will be big in everything related to settlement, and not just loans. While it is still early days, the technology looks very good,” he said.  Ms Masters noted that efforts to improve the speed of settlement led to “reduced capital requirements, lower operational costs and an improved client experience”. Previously, she had described reducing the costs of financial transactions as “one of the greatest challenges of our time”. Last week Digital Asset Holdings announced it had raised more than $50m from a group of 13 financial companies including JPMorgan, Citigroup, Deutsche Börse and the Depository Trust \u0026 Clearing Corporation. Goldman Sachs is now in discussions to join that latest round of funding, according to people familiar with the situation. Autonomous Research, a New York-based financial services boutique, estimates that the global investment banks now spend about $50bn a year on post-trade processes, a figure that could be cut by about one-third with greater use of blockchain-type technologies. “There has been endless innovation in the pre-trade world. But in the post-trade world, your trades are still going to a reconciliation clerk and they’re faxing it back and forth and three days later,” said Brian Foran, a partner at Autonomous.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ben McLannahan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-01-31","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/68f938dc-7b39-11e6-b837-eb4b4333ee43","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F2f2c34aa-1cee-11e6-a7bc-ee846770ec15?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"StanChart joins group investing $55m in blockchain business","INTRO":"California company has completed first real money international transfer using blockchain technology","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Standard Chartered has joined a group investing $55m in Ripple, the San Francisco-based blockchain company, which recently completed the first real money cross-border transfer using the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency bitcoin.

Greg Medcraft, who chairs the International Organization of Securities Commissions (Iosco), a global standards body for the world’s securities watchdogs, said the technology was potentially “good for investors and issuers” but it still needed to reassure ordinary investors that their transactions are safe. “One way to get consumer confidence is that someone has to look after the issue of fraud,” he told the Financial Times on Monday. “At least at the start, exchanges will have to guarantee the customer behind [the trade].” Mr Medcraft’s comments come as the world’s largest exchanges step up their experiments with a technology few were even contemplating a year ago. Blockchain is a marriage of computing power and finance. It allows a digital asset to be moved electronically between counterparties without using a central ledger to record the transaction. The technology aims to prevent fraud by using a shared digital public database that is continuously maintained and verified by all the other computers involved in a chain of transactions. Proponents say the technology could speed up slow and inefficient back offices and save billions in the amount of collateral that is currently required by the global financial system. Blockchain databases could also cut transaction costs and potentially remove the need for market middlemen including banks and settlement houses. To date, blockchain has been used primarily for transactions involving the digital currency bitcoin. Use of the technology in more common financial products took a big step forward last week when the Australian Stock Exchange said it would become the world’s first market to settle equities trades using blockchain. The US start-up Digital Asset Holdings, which will supply the project’s technology, has drawn investment from JPMorgan, Citigroup, Deutsche Börse, CME Group and ICAP, among others, in its $52m fundraising.

The meeting in Madrid next month will also have presentations from Blythe Masters, chief executive of Digital Asset Holdings and from Setl, a UK-start up that is currently raising funds to commercialise its technology. Separately, the DTCC, which settles payments in the US securities market, also said on Monday that blockchain technology may not be a cure-all for financial markets infrastructure. The industry may achieve improvements by standardising industry workflows and using cloud computing to manage vast amounts of data, it said in a white paper. Blockchain technology “is immature, unproven, has inherent scale limitations in its current form and lacks underlying infrastructure to cleanly integrate it into the existing financial market environment”, the DTCC warned. It also called for common standards to avoid “a new jumbled, disconnected maze” of blockchains around the world.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-01-25","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/9c8be99c-c0a4-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fd90e1ece-c0a6-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blythe Masters’ blockchain start-up raises $50m and inks ASX deal","INTRO":"Digital Asset Holdings to upgrade Australian exchange’s systems","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Digital Asset Holdings, a blockchain start-up run by former JPMorgan executive Blythe Masters, has raised more than $50m and inked a deal with ASX, Australia’s main exchanges operator, to upgrade its systems. Blockchain is the electronic ledger for transactions in bitcoin, the digital currency, and has generated enthusiasm in the financial industry for its potential to make payments systems and capital markets transactions faster and cheaper. It is essentially a shared digital public database of events that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records, and shared among various parties. Supporters say that its near-instantaneous settlement of transactions can transform the way settlement and payments are made in the financial system, by automating banks’ clunky back offices and freeing up billions in collateral that is used as insurance for trading. “The technology allows a significant reduction in operational cost, it reduces the likelihood of errors or ‘fails’, reduces capital requirements and allows for a reduction in settlement times,” Ms Masters told the Financial Times. The move by ASX is the most ambitious attempt yet by a major exchange to integrate the technology into modern financial markets. Nasdaq, the US exchanges operator, is also experimenting with the technology in its private share market in Estonia. The initial focus for ASX and Digital Asset will be on clearing and settlement services in the cash equities market. “It’s about optimising settlement, rather than simply saying the world has to work at the pace of the slowest investor,” said Peter Hiom, ASX deputy chief executive. “Some investors may want to sell their shares, go to the ATM and take their money out immediately.” The funding round, Digital Asset’s first beyond initial seed money and investment from friends and family including Ms Masters, brings in titans of the financial industry including banks and exchanges. The other investors are ABN Amro, Accenture, BNP Paribas, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Citigroup, CME Ventures, Deutsche Börse, ICAP, JPMorgan, Santander InnoVentures, the Depository Trust \u0026 Clearing Corporation and PNC Financial Services. ASX paid A$14.9m ($10.5m) for a 5 per cent equity interest in Digital Asset and will also have the right to purchase further equity and appoint a director to the board. “The funding will be used to hire new personnel that will enable us to pursue a number of specific applications of our technology for use in different projects across the world,” Ms Masters said. One advantage Australia has over other developed markets is its concentrated nature, where the ASX owns the country’s main clearing house and central depository. Mr Hiom said: “In Europe, there are multiple clearing houses and depositories. It’s not impossible but it would be a significant challenge.” A major hurdle remains safeguarding security. Contrary to public perceptions relating to bitcoin, the technology’s proponents suggest a private distributed ledger could be more secure than existing systems. Current systems work off one single instance of everyone’s database. That database does not check with any other databases to make sure it is correct. Mr Hiom added: “In a distributed ledger, all the instances of the ledger are checking with one another all the time to make sure they’re correct. If one of them has been hacked, it will be instantly recognised as incorrect and can be shut down.” ASX and Digital Asset will also liaise with Australia’s regulators and government agencies to assess the potential benefits of blockchain.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nicole Bullock","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-01-22","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/a0a4f42e-a4b1-11e5-a91e-162b86790c58","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F1df4b296-bd7d-11e5-846f-79b0e3d20eaf?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain raises fundamental questions","INTRO":"Banking and law will be fundamentally changed if shared ledger technology takes off","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain — which is seen by many as the next big thing in the financial service sector — has many potential uses, from transforming money to modernising the banking system to digitising legal processes. Many of these uses raise questions about a changing relationship between the individual and government, but the debate is complicated by misunderstandings about how the technology works. Blockchain is essentially a shared public database for recording transactions in a way that does not allow the record to be altered at a later date. Before the term blockchain became popular, it was more typical to refer to bitcoin, the digital currency that is built upon blockchain technology. Bitcoin is a system of value transfer that is apparently outside of the control of the state. Early adopters of bitcoin viewed it as a way to both escape a monetary system controlled by central banks and operate anonymously beyond the prying eyes of government. Bitcoin raised the question of whether computer code, rather than a central bank, should control the money supply. And if a digital money system enabled its users to operate beyond the law — as physical cash does — was that desirable for wider society? The first fallacy about systems such as blockchain is to believe that they are a defence against government, rather than an enabler of it. This was described the “libertarian fallacy” in a speech at a blockchain conference in Sydney by Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor who warned in the late 1990s that the internet would be an enabler of surveillance. If a society adopts a single system of digital money, where transactions are recorded on a single database as they are with bitcoin, it is possible — even likely — that governments will successfully attempt to control it “It’s a good method for surveillance of cash transactions, but the question is, do you want this surveillance?” says Ben Zevenbergen, a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. Now much of the conversation has moved on from bitcoin and cash, to blockchain and what shared database technology might mean for the financial system. The hype and investment have moved to blockchain start-ups that promise to decrease settlement times and cut back-office bank costs. Unlike bitcoin, which has been running since 2009, uses of blockchain in banking remain largely experimental. One vision is for a single database maintained and accessed by the biggest banks to execute and settle trades. Simon Taylor, who leads the team looking at blockchain and distributed ledger at Barclays, says there are industry discussions about how each bank would maintain its own privacy in a shared database. There are also questions about how much access regulators should have, he adds. “If a shared ledger has the golden source record of everything that’s happening, under what circumstances can the regulator see it? What’s the appropriate regulatory input into that system? And are they ready for that level of automation? Are they ready for a software-driven regulation?” he says. There is a second blockchain fallacy. If digital money enables government surveillance, banks seeking to shift the cost of regulatory compliance from themselves could argue that access to a shared blockchain is all a regulator needs to supervise the banking system. It is wrong to assume, however, that a digital database, whether for a country’s currency or for a bank’s back office, records everything. Blockchain exists in the real world that is ambiguous, messy and full of people who may wish to keep things off the database. One of the most radical ideas for blockchain technology is the notion of digitising law. The industry jargon is “smart contracts” — code on a shared database that automatically executes a contract based on the fulfilment of certain real-world conditions, just as a vending machine obeys rules to provide sweets when money is inserted. One aim would be to eliminate “one of the most frustrating aspects of contractual drafting: the inherent ambiguity” of language, according to a paper last year from researchers at Harvard Law School and Yeshiva University in the US. But is it desirable, or even possible, that contracts become inescapable chains? In removing ambiguity or room for disagreement, “you’ve evacuated the very core concept of what a contract is”, says Quinn DuPont, a researcher in cryptography and society at the University of Toronto.

Sir Mark Walport published a report on Tuesday arguing that the blockchain — the shared database technology that is best known for powering bitcoin — should be used to improve everything from tax collection to the sharing of health records. “It has the potential to redefine the relationship between government and the citizen in terms of data sharing, transparency and trust,” Sir Mark said. At its core, the blockchain is a technology for storing and sharing information. But unlike conventional databases, which are controlled from a single point, the blockchain is a “chain” of “blocks” of data that is held by a network of computers. Peter Roe, an analyst at Tech Market View, a research company, said the blockchain “is certainly going to be a very important technology” and would have a number of applications in public services. The advantages of the blockchain over legacy database systems, he said, include increased security, transparency, and the fact that multiple parties can write information into the database. But Mr Roe cautioned that the technology would take a number of years to implement, as “there’s always a difficulty in bringing in something so new and different in tandem with legacy systems”.  The first application of the blockchain was to money. However, bitcoin has been bogged down in scandals including its role in facilitating illegal drug-dealing in the now-defunct black market website Silk Road. Sir Mark’s report said: “Distributed ledger technologies have the potential to help governments to collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land registries, assure the supply chain of goods and generally ensure the integrity of government records and services.” Blockchain technology is still at an early stage of development and moving any of Britain’s public services away from their existing IT systems is likely to prove difficult, expensive and potentially risky. Yet there is a precedent. Estonia’s government has been experimenting with distributed ledger technology for a number of years using a system known as Keyless Signature Infrastructure. The technology allows citizens to verify the integrity of their records on government databases. Blockchain has been hailed by admirers as holding the revolutionary promise that the internet did two decades ago. Business figures from Microsoft’s Bill Gates to Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group, have extolled its potential. Banks, insurers and companies ranging from IBM to PwC are also seeking to harness the power of the blockchain, in the belief that it could lead to greater efficiency.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Robert Cookson","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-01-19","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/156c4096-c055-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F1b82a158-c061-11e5-9fdb-87b8d15baec2?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain debate eclipses Basel III at Davos","INTRO":"Bankers and start-ups clash over the future of finance","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When the World Economic Forum staged its flagship debate about the future of the financial services industry this week in Davos it sparked a disorderly scrum. The Davos elites were not scrambling to listen to the debates that have dominated the WEF agenda in recent years, namely the financial crisis and regulatory reform; these are largely absent from the agenda this year. Instead the current hot issue is how financial technology or fintech could revolutionise the world of money; topics such as blockchain have eclipsed discussions on Basel III. Critics argue that the shift is a little premature. After all, the day-to-day life of most senior bankers is still dominated by regulatory reform issues and parts of the eurozone banking world are still grappling with legacy problems such as Italian bankers who have earnestly been downplaying concerns about bad loans. Yet the bankers attending Davos insist that the sector is on its strongest footing than at any point since the financial crisis of 2008; capital reserves have increased, risk reduced, operations streamlined. Indeed, a survey from Edelman, the public relations firm, this week even showed that public trust in banks is rising. “If you look at the amount of capital, oversight and approach to risk in the banking world today, I strongly believe that the banking system is a lot more solid than it was,” says Andrea Orcel, president of UBS investment bank. This does not mean that the banks are out of the woods, however. “Trying to get the appropriate risk-adjusted returns from banks given the state of the economy, regulation, markets, and the necessary transformation of both business models and cost structures is a challenge — and competition is rising,” says Mr Orcel. The most intense source of this competitive challenge comes from fintech, and its potential to upend the status quo. This is now affecting numerous aspects of finance, ranging from back office payments to investment advice and retail payments. Indeed, the revolution is now so dramatic that the chief executive of one big European bank told the audience in Davos that cash might “cease to exist” in its current form in a decade. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund issued its first white paper on virtual currencies this week. The report argued that while these new forms of money are still very small in scale — totalling a mere $7bn in market value compared to the $1.tn value of US paper currency in circulation — they are exploding so fast that policymakers and bankers alike need to take note.  Many financial technology companies, who are out in force for the first time this year in Davos, hope to use this financial revolution to disrupt the incumbent banks. But the banks are trying to fight back by developing their own fintech capabilities, while also collaborating — and purchasing — tech start-ups. In the next few months, for example, senior officials at JPMorgan expect the bank to start settling loan trades using blockchain technology, the ledger that enables electronic payments, and operating in collaboration with one fintech start-up, Digital Assets Holdings (a group created by Blythe Masters, a former JPMorgan luminary.) Many of the new entrants argue that the incumbent banks move too slowly to outwit the upstarts, while established financiers are apt to retort that the issue of fintech has been overhyped. The issue of the blockchain, for example, is particularly problematic because of the controversy that surrounds the virtual currency, bitcoin. “We know that bitcoin itself is a complete failure and shows the number one law of programming and software: that anything that can be programmed can be hacked. So nothing is completely secure,” said Willem Buiter, Citi’s chief economist and former member of the Bank of England’s rate-setting committee. “The cyber boys . . . they believe that this is something that can just work on its own and allow a seamless web of costless transactions across the world. Forget it.” Nevertheless, nobody expects this type of cynicism to undermine the enthusiasm for fintech at the WEF, particularly since the official theme for this year’s meeting is focused on technological revolutions. The new battleground for the financial world is the issue of whether the new entrants will be subject to the same regulatory controls as incumbent banks — or whether these radical changes are simply concealing a new explosion of risk under the guise of “innovation”. “If you’re going to be in the finance business, the finance regulation should be the same for everyone,” says Cathy Bessant, chief technology officer at Bank of America. Ms Bessant stresses that banks need to harness the power of technology and innovation, without reducing the capacity of the banking sector to absorb and deal with risk. By this time next year that issue of “regulation” may be top of the agenda in the WEF finance debates again. Originally, blockchain referred to the distributed ledger technology — or computer protocol — which powered the virtual currency bitcoin, writes Izabella Kaminska. In its purest form, it represented a shared public database for recording transactions in a way that ensured the entries could not be altered at a later date. Anyone who downloaded the protocol would be able to contribute processing power to help secure the network. The incentive to do so was the opportunity to win a digital currency coupon, which may or may not have value in the market. Updates to the ledger were entirely dependent on the network reaching consensus on the latest version of the database, as well as its historical versions, something known as “the chain”. It is this shared chain which makes the system so incorruptible. While banks have been drawn to the technology from the outset, the practical reality of banking means some aspects of the bitcoin blockchain are not suitable. For example, banks can’t forgo the ability to reverse transactions unilaterally, nor can they be reliant on entirely anonymous contributors of security to their networks. Efforts to leverage the advantages of the bitcoin blockchain without sacrificing control of the network have as a consequence led to an arms race in the development of so-called “private blockchains”, also known as distributed ledger or consensus algorithm technology. Banks hope the ability to operate in lock-step via the blockchain can harmonise cumbersome back-office processes to gain efficiencies. One vision is for a single database maintained and accessed by the biggest banks to execute and settle trades. Unlike bitcoin, however, for now these blockchain projects remain largely experimental.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Izabella Kaminska Gillian Tett","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-01-21","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/eab49cc4-af18-11e5-b955-1a1d298b6250","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fe147457e-4a41-11e5-b558-8a9722977189?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Nasdaq claims to break ground with blockchain-based share sale","INTRO":"Fight for bragging rights to ‘first’ transactions breaks out","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Nasdaq claims to have broken new ground on use of blockchain with a share sale on Wednesday that used a system based on the technology. The blockchain is the shared database technology that initially gained notoriety as the platform for bitcoin and other crypto currencies. But many large financial groups are now seeking to use its technology to make payment systems and capital market transactions faster and cheaper. It works as an electronic ledger of digital events that uses cryptography to continuously verify “blocks” of records and then distribute them among parties to the transactions. The enthusiasm around blockchain on Wall Street has been so intense that Nasdaq’s announcement prompted a scuffle over who owns the bragging rights to the first share sale using blockchain. Nasdaq said Chain.com, a privately owned company that itself specialises in blockchain technology, had issued shares to a private investor using the US exchange’s new Linq system that is based on the digital ledger technology. The exchange group said the transaction had created a digital record of share ownership — “significantly reducing settlement time and eliminating the need for paper stock certificates”. It also allowed the issuer and investor to complete and execute share subscription documents online. Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, said: “We believe this successful transaction marks a major advance in the global financial sector and represents a seminal moment in the application of blockchain technology.” But Symbiont, a start-up backed by trading veterans including Duncan Niederauer, the previous chief executive of the rival New York Stock Exchange, hit back, claiming it issued the first securities using blockchain technology in August. Symbiont issued its own shares using the bitcoin blockchain while a privately held company used Nasdaq’s proprietary blockchain network to sell shares to a private investor. Nasdaq said the blockchain technology could significantly speed up the clearing and settlement of equity trades from the existing standard of three days in the US and two days in Europe to as little as 10 minutes.  Supporters of blockchain technology argue that near-instantaneous settlement of transactions can transform the financial system by automating the clunky back offices of banks. This could also free up billions of dollars that banks and others must hold as collateral to insure against things going wrong while a trade is being settled. However, despite a plethora of industry consortiums, no widely used financial product has yet been switched to blockchain technology. Mr Greifeld said: “Through this initial application of blockchain technology, we begin a process that could revolutionise the core of capital markets infrastructure systems. The implications for settlement and outdated administrative functions are profound.” The technology could cut banks’ infrastructure costs for cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance by $15bn-$20bn a year from 2022, according to a recent report by Spanish bank Santander, management consultancy Oliver Wyman and venture capital investor Anthemis. Other groups are also turning their attention to bitcoin and its technology. The NYSE this year launched the first exchange-calculated and distributed bitcoin index. In January, NYSE made a minority investment in Coinbase, a bitcoin wallet and platform. Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker who helped develop the idea behind credit default swaps, has joined a group of trading executives who have set up company called Digital Asset Holdings. It sells software using the underlying blockchain technology to improve the settlement time and cost of transactions for financial institutions and other market participants.* *An earlier version of this story misstated the nature of Digital Asset Holdings.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Arnold Nicole Bullock","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-12-30","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/454ef494-a899-11e5-955c-1e1d6de94879","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F3cf849dc-6008-11e5-a28b-50226830d644?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"ASX eyes ‘blockchain’ for risk management of market trades","INTRO":"Australia’s main exchanges operator may integrate fast-emerging technology as part of system upgrade","DETAILED_CONTENT":"ASX, Australia’s main exchanges operator, is looking at employing so-called “blockchain” in the country’s financial system by integrating the fast-emerging technology into risk management of trades on its markets. The Sydney group is due to upgrade its system for clearing and settlement of trades and is considering whether to use a technology that has generated enormous interest among banks, exchanges and clearing houses. The blockchain works as an electronic ledger of digital events that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records, and shared or distributed between various parties. Its supporters argue that near-instantaneous settlement of transactions can transform the way settlement and payments are made in a financial system, by automating clunky back-offices of banks and freeing up billions in collateral that acts as insurance for trading. However, despite a plethora of industry consortiums, no widely-used financial product has yet been switched to blockchain technology. Nasdaq, the US exchanges operator, is readying a pilot in Estonia but ASX’s potential move would make Australia the largest and most mature global economy to embrace it. “We’re having a very close look at this. The timing is almost perfect. Where blockchain can make an enormous difference, we’re having a look at whether this is a way to transform our equity markets,” Elmer Funke Kupper, ASX chief executive, told the Financial Times on a visit to London. “In post trade we have to let go of our assumptions that things are because of the way they are.” Mr Funke Kupper envisaged a system in which market participants permitted to access the network would have the flexibility to finalise payments as it suited them. “You want to be able to settle in real time where it’s beneficial and settle later where it is not,” he said. He added that ASX would consider partnering with other companies to build it. “We won’t make a decision for another six to seven months,” he said. He said the local market had advantages that gave it a chance to succeed where others may struggle. Australia has around only 2,500 financial entities in its ecosystem and has a fully dematerialised equity market — in which equities are no longer recorded on paper but only exist in digital form. Mr Funke Kupper also pointed to the registry system that is owned by ASX which keeps details of market actors on record. “In the US they can’t do it. We have a central ‘know-your-customer’ utility that is incredibly powerful. As we own the central securities depository, it allows us to bring everyone along,” he said. Australian regulators have also taken a close interest in blockchain. Earlier this year Greg Medcraft, chair of the Australian Securities \u0026 Investments Commission, said the technology had the potential “to fundamentally change our markets and our financial system”. However, he added there was a need for authorities to focus on accountability, security and how transactions using blockchain can be reported to and used by the relevant regulator.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-12-22","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/cf6644e8-a33f-11e5-bc70-7ff6d4fd203a","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F0ba7594a-8a33-11e5-9f8c-a8d619fa707c?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Charities weigh up gains in accepting bitcoin donations","INTRO":"Technology would increase transparency and allow donors to track how their money was being spent","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The technology underpinning the bitcoin digital currency could revolutionise the way in which charities operate by cutting transaction costs and ensuring more money goes to worthwhile causes, according to the Charities Aid Foundation. Greater transparency provided by the “blockchain” technology — effectively a public ledger managed by a third party — would allow donors to track more effectively how their money was being spent, a CAF report found. “Charities always face issues in terms of managing trust,” said Rhodri Davies, head of the Giving Thought policy programme at CAF. “With blockchain, you will be able to see where the money goes and track your donation as it goes through the charity.” The financial services sector has been closely scrutinising developments in blockchain technology to see how cuts in transaction costs, as there is no intermediary to pay, can be applied to their businesses. Barclays, for example, has been working with Safello, a bitcoin exchange, as part of the bank’s small business accelerator programme. Barclays said that while the project was still at the exploratory stage, one of the possible spin-offs was to examine how charities could start accepting bitcoin payments. Peter Randall, chief operating officer of UK blockchain start-up SETL, said the charity sector could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the financial services sector’s investigation into the new technology. “A blockchain can be used to …reduce the costs of collection …very significantly. It is equally at home processing small amounts as well as larger donations.” “Nano-donations” — much smaller amounts of money — could become the way in which people donate in the future, said Peter Smith, chief executive of Blockchain, a provider of bitcoin software. “At the moment, you can’t really donate tiny amounts of money — and can’t send small amounts of money as well,” he said. “With bitcoin and blockchain, you could now [donate money to] pay schoolchildren a dollar for every assignment that they complete or a cent for every page they read in a book: you can incentivise reading. There are lots of really cool models.” The Royal National Lifeboat Institution was one of the first charities in the UK to accept donations via bitcoin. So far the charity has raised just over £2,500 from 600 different donations — many at a much smaller level than usual. “We look at [bitcoin] as an online cash box,” said Luke Williams, project leader for bitcoin at the RNLI. Mr Williams said he was aware of the benefits offered by blockchain technology but it was not something the charity was considering at present. “There is great value in bitcoin and blockchain in terms of international aid and moving money internationally,” he said. “One bitcoin wallet is the same regardless of where you are in the world. You don’t have the same fees to transfer the money.” Sam Deere, of Giving What We Can, part of the Centre for Effective Altruism, said the transparency offered by a blockchain-based transaction system would lead to a greater number of people being able to trust charities with their money. “Donors can be confident that what they donate actually goes to the charity,” he said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hugo Greenhalgh","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-12-16","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f436ae7a-9d3b-11e5-8ce1-f6219b685d74","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fa75f27e8-9981-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Goldman puts its muscle into tech push","INTRO":"SETLcoin virtual currency settlement system among raft of projects","DETAILED_CONTENT":"If Goldman Sachs had its way, “SETLcoin” could ultimately be as much a part of the financial services lexicon as dollar, euros or yen. Last week, it emerged that the Wall Street bank had applied to patent a virtual currency settlement system under that name, in the hope that the blockchain — the ledger system backing bitcoin — could ultimately offer near-instant trading of stocks and bonds. “The blockchain could disrupt everything,” wrote Goldman strategists last week in a note to clients called “Themes, Dreams and Flying Machines”. The SETLcoin project is among dozens that emerge each year from Goldman’s technology group, which, with about 9,000 engineers reporting to Marty Chavez, chief information officer, is easily the biggest of 11 divisions within the 36,000-strong bank. Another 3,000 or so “strats”, or tech strategists, are sprinkled across other divisions. Goldman is not alone in going big on tech. Most of the leading banks are ramping up spending, as they attempt to keep pace with a host of new entrants promising swifter, cheaper ways of carrying out core banking processes. And like its peers, Goldman has misses, as well as hits. Several of the external investments made by Goldman have flopped, while internal projects such as GSessions, a bond-trading platform, have floundered when other financial institutions proved wary of collaborating with the bank. Goldman has also been embroiled in a long legal spat with a former programmer, over definitions of what exactly constitutes “open source” software. But the difference between Goldman and its peers is scale. According to estimates by Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke, Goldman will spend between $2.5bn and $3.2bn on tech this year, or 7 to 9 per cent of its revenues. That compares to a public disclosure from Bank of America of 4 per cent of revenues.* “[Goldman] has a very good track record of staying in front of technological change in their industry and harnessing it to help them build market share and manage expenses and risks,” says Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Autonomous Research in New York. According to Harvey Schwartz, chief financial officer, Goldman’s tech group is there to “play defence”, helping the bank to adjust to tougher post-crisis regulations, the ongoing electronification of finance and the constant threat of cyber attacks. But increasingly, the group also plays a “very offensive role in terms of innovation”, he said last month, as it attempts to try to keep pace with a host of new entrants. In 2004, one in 16 promotions to managing director at Goldman — the tier below partnership — were engineers; this year it was one in six. Analysts and investors have grown used to sparse disclosures, accepting that they will never know quite what will emerge from Goldman’s 1.5bn lines of code in production, or the 90 market infrastructure patents — more than double the next bank (Morgan Stanley). Eric Wasserstrom, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, is happy to reserve judgment on that basis. “It’s clear there’s going to be technological innovations that will significantly change the cost structure,” he says. “I don’t know if that’s $100m of incremental savings or $200m, so it’s hard to know if $25m or $50m is the right amount to invest.” One of the bank’s big hopes is Symphony, a messaging and workflow start-up which was spun out of an internal project last year. Goldman has about 19,000 users of the software internally. Don Duet, co-head of the tech unit, is keen to see many more outside the company, and not just in the core investment consortium of 15 banks and asset managers. There is also Mosaic, which is the working title for a project that apes online lending platforms such as Lending Club and Prosper. Goldman declines to provide much detail, saying the consumer-focused venture is at an early stage. But it is aggressively recruiting staff. “Goldman has been calling our people for some time,” says Noah Breslow, chief executive of New York-based OnDeck Capital, a fellow online lender which last week signed a deal with JPMorgan. “They’ve been calling everyone [in the sector].”  Some of the bank’s tech ventures have failed. The roll-call of Goldman-backed flops includes Webvan, a grocery-delivery business, Cereva Networks, which sold enterprise storage systems, and Terraliance Technologies, which tried to put a new spin on energy exploration. GSessions, the electronic bond-trading platform, was scrapped after Goldman failed to reassure potential users that it would not use data from the trading venue to tip off its own teams of traders and market-makers. But like a slate of films under development, where a studio expects one in 10 to make good money, Goldman is prepared to back losers. As one senior executive noted recently, failing costs a lot less than it used to. A proliferation of cloud-based software and pay-as-you-go platforms, combined with free, open-source databases, means it can cost as little as $2m to bring a start-up to break even, on a cash flow basis. A decade ago, that figure was more like $50m, the executive said.  Still, relying on open-source development is risky in itself. Goldman has spent the past few years in dispute with Sergey Aleynikov, a former programmer who prosecutors accused of stealing proprietary code when he quit to join a competitor six years ago. Mr Aleynikov — who declined to comment for this story — has countered that what he took from the bank was in part open-source software. A federal court threw out an earlier conviction in July. Despite the pitfalls, though, Goldman’s direction is set. The bank’s embrace of tech shows “an appreciation of a secular trend”, says Mr Wasserstrom of Guggenheim. “The alternative if they were to stand still would be strategically devastating.” Additional reporting by Kadhim Shubber and John Gapper * This story has been amended after Credit Suisse corrected its research note","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ben McLannahan Laura Noonan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-12-09","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/b0d8f614-997c-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fa75f27e8-9981-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Goldman Sachs files patent for virtual settlement currency","INTRO":"US bank files patent application for bitcoin-like ledger system","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Goldman Sachs has made a patent application for a cryptocurrency settlement system in a move that underlines bank hopes that the architecture behind bitcoin can revolutionise global payments. The application for a new virtual currency, dubbed “SETLcoin” by the bank, said it would offer “nearly instantaneous execution and settlement” of trades involving assets including stocks and bonds. Banks have been racing to tap the power of blockchain — the ledger system that backs digital currencies such as bitcoin. Harnessing the technology has been likened to the changes wrought by file transfer systems on the music industry, or to the effect that email had on communication. Although electronic dealing platforms have increasingly made front-office trades virtually instantaneous, the actual swapping of payments often still takes days, creating risk in the banking system. The premise of blockchain is a network of computers that share the costs of transactions and use cryptography to keep deals secure, although regulators have expressed concerns about this aspect. Trades are recorded on a public ledger that anyone on the network can see. Potential uses range from payments and storing client identities to possibly developing “smart” products, such as a credit derivative that pays out automatically upon default by the underlying company. Goldman’s recently published application, first reported by bitcoin magazine, describes processes “to substantively instantly settle securities, based on cryptographic currency technology, without the risks associated with traditional settlement technologies”. The application is the latest in a series of efforts by banks to determine how to adopt the technology, which in theory removes the need for middlemen such as exchanges and clearing houses. One recent report estimated blockchain could cut up to $20bn a year off bank’s infrastructure costs by 2022. But few are sure yet how blockchain will ultimately be adopted. Some would-be users are trumpeting a “permissionless” open source system — similar to bitcoin — while others are backing private networks. In a bid to standardise use of the technology, more than 20 banks, including Barclays, HSBC and UBS have backed a start-up called R3 CEV, which is setting up a private blockchain open only to invitees. Others, such as Goldman, are developing their own systems. Citigroup is testing its own “Citicoin” in its laboratories. Banks are also increasingly hedging their bets: Goldman also led a $50m funding round for Circle Internet Financial, which aims to use bitcoin to handle consumer payments.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jennifer Hughes","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-12-03","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/61a5ae38-9a77-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fb105ff4c-5f93-11e5-a28b-50226830d644?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How this blockchain reaction could lead to fairer transactions","INTRO":"Technology should help prevent terrorism financing and money-laundering, and free up bank capital","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Goldman Sachs is betting on blockchain. This week the US investment bank filed a patent application last year for “SETLcoin”, a virtual currency that it plans to use to offer “nearly instantaneous execution and settlement”. Goldman is one of many financial groups seeking to exploit the technology that is best known for powering bitcoin, the controversial cryptocurrency. Bank of America filed a patent about the same time for a money transfer system that uses similar technology. Nasdaq recently launched Linq, a blockchain-powered system to help private companies keep track of their share ownership. At base, blockchains are digital ledgers. But rather than having one record keeper, the information sits in a shared database that all participants have access to. It works a bit like a Lego set. Each transaction is bolted on to the next one and all the data are passed around. The system is meant to be impossible to edit or forge. That means one could theoretically follow a particular piece of currency or share of stock as it travels from account to account. Enthusiasts say the system could also be used to set up future transactions that automatically trigger — if stock index A hits level B, that triggers derivative contract C requiring D to pay E. In theory, eliminating the central record keeper could speed transactions and cut costs. It might also eliminate much of the need for clearinghouses, which protect against the risks of a counterparty collapse. A blockchain system might also help level the financial playing field. If all participants can see prior transactions and what others have paid, hedge funds would struggle to get an edge on ordinary traders. Banks would also have a harder time charging different prices to different customers, potentially squeezing profits. Increased transparency would also make it harder to rig prices or trade ahead of large orders. But there are significant hurdles. Decentralised record keeping could make the data easier to store, but the sheer volume of information could bog the system down. Many experts believe blockchain will never work fast enough to satisfy high-frequency equity traders. Security is also a big issue. Some blockchains are open to all comers. Like Wikipedia, they rely on consensus and collective memory to weed out fakes and errors. With bitcoin, this has led to large numbers of fraudulent transactions. Most banks prefer a closed system where only approved participants have permission to add transactions to the blockchain. But for this to work, banks have to work with their competitors to develop a common system. So far they seem to acknowledge this is an issue — more than 30 global banks including Goldman and BofA, have joined a blockchain development project known as R3 CEV. Banks have another reason to work together. A closed blockchain system would partly preserve their information advantage and might also help deter challengers. If it works (a big if), society could benefit along with the banks’ bottom lines. The information chains should make it easier to prevent terrorism financing and money-laundering, as well as freeing up precious bank capital. They should also speed the recovery of proceeds of crime. Advocates say blockchains could create a fairer, more efficient transaction system. Maybe, just maybe, Goldman and the other banks are the good guys in this particular game. brooke.masters@ft.com","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brooke Masters","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-12-04","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/85f60d08-99cf-11e5-987b-d6cdef1b205c","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fa75f27e8-9981-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Vampire’s quid a bet on blockchains unlocking animal spirits","INTRO":"Watchdogs bound to blench reading cryptocurrency’s patent application","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A world where businesses create their own currencies, as Goldman Sachs has signalled it may do, would be a neoconservative’s wet dream. Uncontrolled, it could be a regulator’s nightmare. The credibility of pioneering cryptocurrency bitcoin has been sapped by its use in speculative scams and money laundering. Watchdogs are bound to blench reading Goldman’s application for a patent on a cryptocurrency called “SETLcoin”. Key examples for the use of SETLcoins include trading them for bitcoins. Funds could be particularly hard for regulators to trace when they had been pumped through chains of cryptocurrencies. Goldman is a reputable investment bank whose ascendancy is largely the result of hard work. Critics still see the Wall Street group as emblematic of bankers’ ability to commandeer information and squeeze out fat profits. Oversight of a cryptocurrency could further increase asymmetries. One wisecracking FT colleague calls SETLcoin “the vampire’s quid” — a reference to Rolling Stone’s description of Goldman as “a vampire squid wrapped round the face of humanity”. But on the basis that conspiracy theories are generally too exciting to be true, SETLcoin looks more like a response to a contingency. Settlement of financial transactions may switch from the current unwieldy system of interlinked counterparties to so-called “blockchains”. Here, an electronic ledger to which all participants had equal access could collapse settlement times, raise regulatory transparency and, in some scenarios, eliminate central clearing. Blockchains, within which Goldman envisages SETLcoin operating, are a promising part of bitcoin’s ambiguous legacy. Like Catholicism, as described by comedy priest Father Ted, the wonderful thing about blockchain technology is that’s all terribly vague and no one really understands it. That is how it feels to non-technologists, a group including 85 per cent of bankers and 99 per cent of City columnists. Blockchains are a work in progress. One expert says we should not expect them to enter service until “they satisfy CARL” — a mnemonic for Compliance, Audit, Regulatory and Legal rules. Not soon, then. Banks will meantime place bets on the technology via the accumulation of intellectual property. They hope to limit the impact of disruptive technology on their market positions. Media companies did the same in buying up dotcom start-ups ahead of the tech rout of 2000. As for universal currencies, Goldman already controls one of these. It is the Goldman partnership, readily exchangeable by older Goldmanites for a well-paid job almost anywhere else. House of card Corrugated cardboard in the warehouses of European packaging group DS Smith. Corrugated foreheads in the boardroom as the shares slide 5 per cent after half-year results. Didn’t investors like the tie of chief executive Miles Roberts? Or had chairman Gareth Davis been insufficiently avuncular with the younger analysts? None of the above. Investors fear DS Smith is running out of steam. Sales were flat at £1.9bn. Profits before tax were 26 per cent lower at £91m. The company spent £500m on bolt-on acquisitions during the period. But shareholders hanker after big deals to rival the €1.6bn acquisition of SCA Packaging in 2012. Mr Roberts makes corrugated cardboard sound like a wonder stuff discovered by Nasa — “recyclable and warm to the touch”. DS Smith collects the card and turns it into boxes for big consumer product groups. Margins of 9 per cent should be sustainable. Mr Roberts’ job is to chivvy stronger growth from DS Smith, preferably without driving the multiple of net debt to earnings much above its current level of 1.9 times. That will require smart dealmaking at a time when prices are high for corporate assets, DS Smith’s shares included. Presentation matters, too. DS Smith quoted weak pre-tax profits upfront alongside barely-adjusted earnings, almost as if the company was trying to give the market an accurate picture of trading. Who bothers with that, these days? Analysts and some reporters happily parrot massaged numbers. Scrap paper Christmas is a time when families get together …and have a row. The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum has got in early by way of a scrap with the Financial Reporting Council. The trade body has accused the watchdog of creating a “regulatory catastrophe”. This datapocalypse involves hairsplitting differences in the interpretation of “fair and true”. LAPFF has written to the UK’s top 350 companies telling them to ignore the FRC’s guidance, rather in the spirit of an estranged partner posting abuse on Facebook.

Setl, a London-based group founded by a group of hedge fund investors and trading executives this year, is also in discussions with about 20 institutions to develop the prototype as a way to standardise processing of payments, from foreign exchange trading to consumer loans. Its move comes as most of the world’s biggest banks are exploring, both individually and collectively, how they can harness blockchains, the algorithms that allow so-called cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to be traded and verified electronically without a central ledger. Using large-scale computing power and decentralised networks for payments and settlement could help banks save billions of dollars a year by improving and outsourcing slow and inefficient back-office settlement; this would cut the amount of collateral held up in global payment systems and reduce transaction costs. The total cost to the finance industry of clearing, settling and managing the post-trade environment is estimated at between $65bn and $80bn a year, according to a report by Oliver Wyman. Existing bitcoin blockchains also fully process and verify payments once every 10 minutes or so, making it unworkable for large-scale use in financial markets. A report by Capgemini and RBS Worldpay this year estimated that just over a billion non-cash payments take place every day. Peter Randall, chief operating officer, said the Setl blockchain was the first to demonstrate that the technology could handle the volumes required by the financial services industry, “where speed, capacity and reliability are crucial”. He said: “Our processing capacity now exceeds the volume of every electronic payment made globally on a live-time gross basis.” Setl, its founders say, is built specifically for financial markets as it settles payments in central bank money and not a cryptocurrency. To test its efficacy, it has created a blockchain engine and simulated real-world payments. It is based on data from the UK payment system, including networks such as Link, CHAPS, BACS and CLS, which settles foreign exchange deals. Despite the buzz and involvement of high-profile individuals such as Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker, banks have been split over how to create a workable blockchain. Some start-ups offer ways to use the existing bitcoin network, but many financial services companies are wary of its past controversies involving theft, money laundering and drugs. Last month Andrew Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, described the technology as having “real potential” but added: “Whether a variant of this technology could support central bank-issued digital currency is very much an open question.” Mr Randall co-founded Chi-X Europe a decade ago; it has since become Europe’s largest stock exchange by trading volume. Commercial and investment banks as well as market settlements houses are interested in the technology, he said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-10-11","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/eb1f8256-7b4b-11e5-a1fe-567b37f80b64","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fa3598a72-7f2c-11e5-98fb-5a6d4728f74e?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Technology: Banks seek the key to blockchain","INTRO":"Financial groups race to harness the power of the bitcoin infrastructure transaction database to slash costs as they see it slashing costs","DETAILED_CONTENT":"It doesn’t feel like a revolutionary moment. A member of a small team from the Swiss bank UBS, holed up on the 42nd floor of London’s Canary Wharf, taps a screen and a bond is sold by a company called ABC to an investor called XYZ. It is the type of transaction executed millions of times a day by banks globally but this dummy transfer is different. It was completed via an internal blockchain, the shared database technology that gained notoriety as the platform for the crypto currency bitcoin. Banks are now racing to harness the power of the blockchain technology, in a belief that it could cut up to $20bn off costs and transform the way the industry works. UBS is not alone. Its skyscraper laboratory is part of a huge experiment taking place across several industries that is most pronounced in the finance world. Banks, insurers and companies ranging from IBM to PwC are trying to work out how they can adapt the technology that, in its simplest form, allows consumers and suppliers to connect directly and form online networks, removing the need for middlemen. For the financial services sector it offers the opportunity to overhaul existing banking infrastructure, speed settlements and streamline stock exchanges, although regulators will want to be assured that it can be done securely. The developments potentially combine two of the most dynamic industries: the computing hub of Silicon Valley and the money management of Wall Street and the City of London. “We could go the way that file transfer technology changed music, allowing new businesses like iTunes to emerge,” says Michael Harte, chief operations and technology officer at Barclays. “That is why there is such feverish activity at the moment.” Blockchain has been hailed by admirers as holding the revolutionary promise that the internet did two decades ago. Business figures from Microsoft’s Bill Gates to Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group, have extolled its potential; on a trade mission to Asia in August, David Cameron, the UK prime minister, included a blockchain expert among his entourage. Evangelists say the possibilities are limitless. Applications range from storing client identities to handling cross-border payments, clearing and settling bond or equity trades to smart contracts that are self-executing, such as a credit derivative that pays out automatically if a company goes bust or a bond that regularly pays interest to the holder. Some go as far as to suggest that the technology even offers the potential to disrupt companies that have forged reputations as “disrupters”, such as Uber and Airbnb. At its core, blockchain is a network of computers, all of which must approve a transaction has taken place before it is recorded, in a “chain” of computer code. As with bitcoin — the first application of the technology, applied to money — cryptography is used to keep transactions secure and costs are shared among those in the network. The details of the transfer are recorded on a public ledger that anyone on the network can see. In the present system a central ledger is likely to act as the custodian of that information. But on a blockchain the information is transparently held in a shared database, without a single body acting as middleman. Advocates argue that trust is increased among the parties, as there is no possibility for abuse by someone in a dominant position. The lack of a central authority is the very feature of bitcoin that provoked consternation among traditional financial institutions, most of whom gave it a wide berth. The wisdom of that seemed to be borne out when the crypto currency became bogged down in scandals ranging from its links to drugs money in the now-defunct black market website Silk Road to the disappearance of client assets at the collapsed bitcoin exchange Mt Gox. Yet almost every big financial services institution has now overcome that initial suspicion. And the technology has swung from being a weapon wielded against the banks to being heralded as their ultimate back-office makeover, a bitter blow to the libertarians who conceived the idea of the blockchain to circumvent the global banking system. “Suits are replacing hoodies and ripped jeans at blockchain conferences,” says Mark Buitenhek, head of transaction services at Dutch bank ING, which has hired a team of specialists to examine ways of using the technology to increase speed and cut costs in payments and trade finance. Experiments, initially conducted in secret, have begun in earnest over the past year. The desire to make a success of the technology, also described as a “distributed ledger”, is huge. It offers major rewards: cutting out inefficient banking intermediaries could save billions for consumers and the financial services industry, enthusiasts claim. The technology could cut banks’ infrastructure costs for cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance by $15bn-$20bn a year from 2022, according to a recent report by Spanish bank Santander, management consultancy Oliver Wyman and venture capital investor Anthemis. “In lots of areas it looks like the blockchain will work and it is easy to see how it could revolutionise finance,” says Rhomaios Ram, head of product management at Deutsche Bank’s global transaction banking division. “T he speed of execution is so much faster for securities settlement. [And] you can see how it could reduce the capital, that banks have to hold, against each trade.” For big banks, scrambling to modernise their often outdated IT systems in the face of pressure from regulators, digital challengers and cyber criminals, blockchain represents an opportunity to rethink much of what they do. The ability of the technology to provide an unforgeable record of identity, including the history of an individual’s transactions, is one area being eagerly explored. Intermeshing records could prove highly useful, insurers believe, in cross-checking an individual’s actions. “If you have a secure distributed ledger it could be used to store validated ‘know your customer’ data on individuals or companies,” says David Grace, global financial crime leader at PwC, the professional services firm. “It’s a potentially global application that could provide more security over identity data and where that data are stored.” Governments are also investigating its potential: Honduras is using blockchain to handle land titles while the Isle of Man has begun testing the technology with a registry of companies on the island. Longer term, a tamper-proof ledger could be used to hold medical records or develop transparent electoral voting systems. While they understand its potential, many financial institutions are still trying to work out whether blockchain technology offers a cost-cutting opportunity or represents a margin-eroding threat that could put them out of business. Banks are taking a variety of approaches in their search for answers. Some have developed in-house models, such as Citigroup’s creation of Citicoin, a digital currency being tested in the bank’s laboratory. Others have chosen to invest in a specialist: Goldman Sachs led a $50m funding round for Circle Internet Financial, which aims to use bitcoin to handle consumer payments. Podcast Fixing the eurozone, digital currencies and peer to peer lending Patrick Jenkins and Martin Arnold discuss the highlights of this week’s FT banking summit in London, including reflections by Yanis Varoufakis, former Greek finance minister, on how to fix the eurozone, a prediction on the future of digital currencies and what direction peer to peer lending will take next. A third route has been to find a partner. Commonwealth Bank of Australia has teamed up with open source software provider Ripple to build a blockchain system for payments between its subsidiaries. Some banks, like Barclays and UBS, are working with blockchain start-ups through a technology incubator or accelerator programme. UBS has a team of eight working in London’s Canary Wharf alongside start-ups in what it calls its Level 39 incubator — they graduated to the 42nd floor as the project grew. The collaboration, to investigate bond trading and the creation of its own currency, exposes a major problem that financial institutions are grappling with: whether membership of a distributed ledger network should be invitation only, and therefore more controlled, or not. Bitcoin’s open source blockchain, described as a “permissionless” system, means it is decentralised and open to anyone. UBS and Microsoft are both working with blockchain start-up Ethereum, which runs a similar open source technology, and allows for the smart contracts that can execute trades automatically. But many in banking, wary of losing their grip over operations or of upsetting regulators, see the future in closed, or permissioned-only, networks. Almost two dozen of the world’s largest banks, including JPMorgan, UBS and Barclays, have thrown their weight behind R3 CEV, a start-up venture, to set up a private blockchain open only to invited participants who between them maintain and run the network. It forms part of an effort to build an industry-wide platform to standardise use of the technology. “This isn’t going to happen with everyone working on their own: it’s got to be collaborative,” argues Hyder Jaffrey, head of the blockchain team at UBS. There are about 300 technology start-ups, mostly in the US and UK, developing ideas for how to make blockchain work for financial services, according to PwC. Many of them are run by former senior executives at big banks, for example Blythe Masters, formerly from JPMorgan and now leading the blockchain start-up Digital Asset Holdings. “You should be taking this technology as seriously as you should have been taking the development of the Internet in the early 1990s,” she told a recent audience. “It’s analogous to email for money.” Venture capital has poured into the sector according to Coindesk, a bitcoin trade publication, with an estimated $462m committed between January and September this year, double the amount raised in the same period of 2014. Amid the fervour there is a recognition that it will be between two and five years before real-world, practical applications emerge. The technology will have to overcome serious hurdles to prove itself to be robust and secure and will need to win regulatory backing. “The question in the end is how safe is all of this and would you put your life savings on the blockchain?” says ING’s Mr Buitenhek. “What do regulators and central banks do about it and can banks and regulators guarantee it?” Vitaly Kamluk, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab, which advises clients on digital security, argues that the decentralised nature of distributed ledger technology has still to be reconciled with how such databases can be maintained cleanly and securely. “The problem with malicious actors can be quite easily solved when it’s a centralised technology,” he says. “[But] this is yet to be solved in cases of decentralised architectures where each participant has equal rights and cannot enforce a sole decision.” Timeline ● 2008: Under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, a white paper on ‘a new electronic cash system’, is published ● 2009: Bitcoin begins running, on an open source blockchain ● 2012: Ripple, a digital currency and blockchain for transferring money, is released ● 2013: Price of bitcoin hits $1,242, a record high, having been as low as $0.31 in 2011.

The SEC ruled that Sand Hill was “illegally offering complex derivative products to retail investors”. Other reactions have been warmer: the Bank of England is studying the technology and said in a recent paper that “it may be possible in the future — in theory, at least — for the existing infrastructure of the financial system to be gradually replaced by a variety of distributed systems”. The technology is already handling a brisk business. On an average day more than 120,000 transactions are added to bitcoin’s blockchain, representing about $75m exchanged, according to blockchain.info. There are now 380,000 blocks; the ledger weighs in at nearly 45 gigabytes. But it still has a long way to go before it can prove itself in the world of finance. For instance, it is not yet clear that the technology can be scaled up in an efficient enough way to meet the challenge. “There was some hype six to nine months ago when you had to be talking about the blockchain,” says Didier Valet, head of corporate and investment banking at France’s Société Générale, which recently signed up to the R3 CEV venture. “[But] the jury is still out as to whether it will be revolutionary or not.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jane Wild Martin Arnold Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-11-01","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/efa10418-9747-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fe7c5dc34-9dad-11e5-8ce1-f6219b685d74?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain believers seek to shake up financial services","INTRO":"Meet one of the innovators looking at mainstream applications for the infrastructure behind bitcoin","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Michael Mainelli was well prepared for the surge of interest this year in how blockchain technology might transform financial services. Two decades ago, Z/Yen, the City consultancy he co-runs, was approached by a client with a request. The client was working in a sensitive area that required a high degree of trust between the parties involved. They wanted a shared database to provide an indelible and tamper-proof record of who had spoken to who and when. Mr Mainelli did not know it at the time, but the decentralised electronic ledger that his consultancy produced was an early type of the technology now being called a blockchain. Fast-forward 20 years and the invention of bitcoin, the digital currency, whipped up publicity about the technology that powers it — the blockchain — and what else it might be able to do. “To be candid, bitcoin has made this popular,” he says. “It’s back to the future for us.” In essence, a blockchain is a digital ledger on which parties can log transactions. No one group has control over another. Because it is decentralised it eliminates the need for intermediaries, such as in the case of transferring money instantly without a central clearing house. Mr Mainelli and his team are just one of many groups in the financial services industry that are experimenting with how blockchains could be used for central clearing, back office operations and cross-border payments. They are looking at how blockchains could replace existing systems, stripping out layers and streamlining processes. From Z/Yen’s office near the Guildhall in London, Mr Mainelli’s team have built about 40 blockchains ìn the past three years. These have been for projects involving the professional services firm PwC; the Australian insurance group Suncorp, a handful of gambling companies, five global banks and three exchanges that wish to stay anonymous. Mr Mainelli walks across to some sheets of white board propped against a wall to explain the experiments that Z/Yen has been masterminding. Dozens of pieces of paper are tacked to the boards and these show diagrams and text. They are a distinctly low-tech way to illustrate a technology that many in Wall Street and the City say is set to revolutionise the industry — and save billions of pounds. This work on digital ledgers is not the first time that 56-year-old Mr Mainelli has been at the forefront of technology. After an early career in rocket science, he developed a commercial digital map of the world in the early 1980s, a Google Earth of its day. A spell at accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn was followed by the Ministry of Defence research division, and he then co-founded Z/Yen. Mr Mainelli, who lectures in finance at the London School of Economics and Gresham College, is also an alderman of the City of London. He plays the bagpipes, at Burns Night dinners. He sees a future where blockchains are the infrastructure behind much of our world and there are millions of different chains. “They are going to be like databases, doing different things. In the history of the database we didn’t try and put everything through one big database.” For now, that vision is far off, but Prof Mainelli is enthused about a step along the way. A prototype blockchain that his team has built — a type known as a mutual distributed ledger — could vastly simplify compliance with anti-money laundering measures and be aware of customer rules, he says. PwC is assessing how a blockchain could be used for “know your customer” procedures. A wealthy individual who needed to prove their identity could walk into a PwC office with their passport and identity documents, he explains. The firm’s staff would run checks on who the person was, then scan and upload the documents on to the blockchain. The next time that person wanted to prove their identity, they could refer to those records, eliminating the need for later paperwork costing time and money. “No one owns the data except the person with the key, the individual whose data it is,” Mr Mainelli says. He moves to a nearby computer, smiles, claps his hands and leans towards the terminal. On the screen are rows of data, showing files, numbers representing companies and cryptographic information: a sample data set. Ultimately it is still fallible humans who will log the records and take decisions “This is inordinately dull,” he says apologetically, adding that the interface needs more work on its design. “This can be an exciting application but really it looks like this.” Custom-built blockchains may take two months to build — or longer if the project is more complex. The team creating them at Z/Yen have backgrounds in maths, cryptography, statistics and computer science. “One of the great myths is that a lot of people think these things are really difficult to build,” Mr Mainelli says. Despite the increase in interest this year, much remains to be proved as systems are tested in real-life situations. While there is broad agreement that the technology has potential in areas such as proving identity, Mr Mainelli points out that, ultimately, it is still fallible humans who will log the records and take decisions. Transactions logged on a blockchain could also become out of date if, say, an individual went on to commit a crime. Biometric features such as finger scanners and facial recognition are being proposed as ways to increase security, and the industry in general is interested in how identities could be processed to cover many facets of a person’s life. Does this not also raise the prospect of blockchain being the ideal tool of a dictatorship or Orwellian dystopia? Mr Mainelli’s face falls. “There is a danger of that. He argues, however, that data on a chain cannot be accessed without a cryptographic key owned by the individual. He says this is one of the reasons why the integrity of encryption must be maintained in the face of government proposals to be able to access all communications. “I don’t see that the government has any right to do this,” he says. “If we’re all owned by the state, sure, but if you want your Orwellian nightmare, it’s going to come from that sort of thing, maybe, not from this [blockchain]. That’s how centralised, fascist control starts.” In some eyes, the concept of blockchains has been tarnished by the connection with bitcoin. Mr Mainelli admits there has been scepticism. He says, though, that you have to ask what people are sceptical about. “A lot are sceptical about the coins. So am I; there we are in agreement. There are no coins on these ledgers.” Coins are integral only to some blockchains, such as Ripple and Ethereum, which are both being tested by banks, and of course bitcoin. The objections to the technology are falling away, he says. Its foundation of cryptography has been robust over the past few decades. While in the past, a criticism was that running such systems from multiple machines was too complex, he says that now “we live in a world where we don’t think twice about the cloud and have five devices each”.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jane Wild","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-12-14","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/72ffd222-66be-11e5-97d0-1456a776a4f5","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fa824d55a-0eb3-11e5-8aca-00144feabdc0?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain initiative pulls in another 13 banks","INTRO":"Citi, BofA and Morgan Stanley join movement to broaden use","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Citi, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley are among an additional 13 banks that have joined a growing initiative to develop blockchain technology for the financial industry. The addition of the banks, which also include HSBC, BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank and seven others, is a sign the industry is gathering behind R3 in one potential implementation of the distributed ledger technology behind the currency bitcoin. R3, a competitor to the likes of Blythe Masters’ Digital Asset Holdings and other start-ups trying to reduce costs in banking, now has the backing of 22 banks, including founding members JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, UBS and Barclays. “The addition of this new group of banks demonstrates widespread support for innovative distributed ledger solutions across the global financial services community,” said David Rutter, chief executive of R3, in a statement. “A collaborative model is the best way to quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively deliver these new technologies to global financial markets,” he added. Blockchain is the shared database technology beneath the currency bitcoin and is being touted as a way of overhauling outdated bank back-office systems. Its backers point to inefficiencies in the ageing network of bank payments and settlements, where transactions in markets like syndicated loans can take 20 or more days to finalise. Niall Cameron, HSBC head of markets for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said distributed ledger technology had “huge potential, offering banks and their clients the prospect of enhanced security, lower costs and improved error reduction”. Financial services institutions such as banks, exchanges and clearing houses are all exploring ways of utilising the technology, with Nasdaq using blockchain to set up a private share trading platform with Chain, a start-up that has received funding from Nasdaq, Visa and Citi Ventures. A stream of bankers have joined the burgeoning blockchain start-up space, either as advisers, investors and board members, or in the case of former JPMorgan banker Ms Masters, heading up the company themselves. Major banks have used their venture units as a Petri dish for blockchain experiments, but R3 is the first major industry-wide initiative in the space. R3 is seeking to create a private blockchain where access is restricted and the network is secured by the select group of institutions who have permission to use it. The approach is distinct from that of open blockchains like bitcoin, where anyone is able to access the network and it is secured by a digital token. The original group of nine banks backing the initiative included BBVA, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit Suisse, Royal Bank of Scotland and State Street. Now Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Commerzbank, National Australia Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, SEB, Société Générale and Toronto-Dominion Bank have joined.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Kadhim Shubber","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-09-29","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/f358ed6c-5ae0-11e5-9846-de406ccb37f2","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fa824d55a-0eb3-11e5-8aca-00144feabdc0?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain initiative backed by 9 large investment banks","INTRO":"Move towards common standards for the technology in effort to broaden use across financial services","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Nine of the largest investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse, are planning to develop common standards for blockchain technology in an effort to broaden its use across financial services. The group is looking to channel data, ideas and financial backing to a start-up called R3CEV, a New York-based group of trading and technology executives. Barclays, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, State Street, RBS, BBVA and UBS are also backing the initiative, which intends to be an industry utility to accelerate the acceptance of blockchain. Blockchain, the computer network on which bitcoin sits, has caught the imagination of the financial services industry in the past six months for its potential to overhaul the sprawling and complicated network of bank payments and settlements. It is seen as a way of instantly updating payment ledgers in multiple locations without a single, centralised authority. Banks, exchanges and settlement houses are exploring ways to harness the much-hyped technology to reshape many of their daily operations, from upgrading old back-office systems and outsourcing billions of dollars in costs to automatic execution of contracts. Such exploration has sent the industry in many directions, from looking at networks that rely on bitcoin or other digital tokens for their use, to ones in which accredited users are given “permission” to access a particular blockchain. And despite the interest, the industry has yet to come up with a widespread application for financial markets. “If you’re looking to introduce applications with distributed ledger technologies to improve the financial markets, you can’t have each participant working to a different pattern,” said Christopher Murphy, global co-head of FX, rates and credit at UBS. “What R3 are doing is bringing a consensus which could establish common standards.” R3 wants to establish consistent standards and protocols, while linking bank collaboration on research, experimentation and design of prototypes to create a “network” effect. Data will be stored outside the bank’s firewalls, and analysed and matched against other counterparties. Blythe Masters says US trails in blockchain use Technology underpinning bitcoin touted as a way to save banks billions Read more “This partnership signals the first significant commitment by the banks to collaboratively evaluate and apply this emerging technology to the global financial system,” said David Rutter, chief executive of R3. The banks will also back R3 with seed capital, collectively contributing “several millions of dollars”, according to a person familiar with the talks. The funds are expected to go a forthcoming series A capital raising for R3. One issue is whether the industry can overcome any mutual distrust and share information and ideas. Many banks, including Barclays and UBS, are also developing their own in-house blockchain trials or partnering with other start-ups. “You don’t put all your eggs in one basket — you hope one of the bets pays off,” said the chief information officer at one investment bank. Proponents point to critical post-trade markets infrastructure like the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, CLS and messaging system Swift as examples of industry collaboration. “It comes down to ethos and focus,” said Brad Novak, chief technology officer for Barclays’ investment bank. “We want people to actively shape the landscape and not just look at what others are doing. We’re confident this group want to contribute.” Mr Rutter, the former head of ICAP’s electronic broking business, in recent months has recruited another former ICAP trading executive, Nichola Hunter to join R3. Richard Brown, a technology expert formerly with IBM UK, and Tim Swanson, a US-based cryptocurrencies consultant, have also joined the company.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-09-15","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/dc1d46c2-572d-11e5-9846-de406ccb37f2","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F771fb53e-e64e-11e4-aa59-00144feab7de?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Finance heavyweights invest in blockchain start-up","INTRO":"Visa and Nasdaq see potential for the technology to transform financial services","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A group of financial industry heavyweights, including Visa and Nasdaq, are investing in a blockchain start-up in the latest example of enthusiasm around the technology’s potential beyond the transfer of Bitcoins. Banks, clearing houses and exchanges have become excited at the prospect of blockchain fundamentally transforming their business models. Blockchain is a new model for transferring financial assets that uses cryptographically secured networks instead of myriad third-party intermediaries. Supporters believe its broad application in financial services can speed up settlement times, reduce costs and cut counterparty risk. Visa, Nasdaq and Citi Ventures — a part of Citigroup that invests in financial services start-ups — joined Capital One, Fiserv and Orange in participating in a $30m equity financing round for Chain, a company that helps financial institutions build blockchain networks. No valuation was given. “Blockchain technology represents a fundamental, generational shift for financial services, and Chain’s platform is enabling and accelerating this transformation,” said Ramneek Gupta, co-head of global venture investing at Citi Ventures. “We hope to leverage Chain’s platform to rapidly test and develop applications as part of Citi’s multi-faceted blockchain strategy which has the potential to greatly enhance our customers’ experience well beyond just currencies and payments.” Chain’s new investors will also form a working group with the company, which launched just over a year ago, to explore the application of the technology in various markets. Jim Robinson, a former chief executive at American Express, is joining Chain’s board of directors, the company also said on Wednesday. Nasdaq already has said it will use Chain’s blockchain technology to underpin its new private share-trading market, in one of its most high-profile applications to date. Former New York Stock Exchange chief Duncan Niederauer and former JPMorgan banker Blythe Masters have also lent their support to start-ups exploring its use. Former Merrill Lynch executive Bob Wigley recently hailed the cost-cutting potential of bitcoin and the technology underpinning the controversial currency. The group’s former head for Europe, the Middle East and Africa called bitcoin a potential “leading global payments system”, saying he had invested an undisclosed amount in Blockchain, a UK-based company that derives its name from the underlying technology, and was now advising the group. Blockchain claims to be the leading supplier of consumer bitcoin “wallets” — software used for receiving and making payments with the currency.

Ms Masters has become the most high-profile former banker to join a rapidly growing industry of technology companies, venture capitalists, banks and exchanges all investing in ways to harness the latest computing trends from Silicon Valley to Wall Street. Blockchain, the technology on which the controversial bitcoin digital currency sits, has been touted as a way to save banks billions in costly back office procedures such as clearing and settlements and loan processing. Such a move could overhaul some of the financial industry’s most entrenched and inefficient practices. But Ms Masters damped hopes that the US could lead a potential‎ revolution. “There are jurisdictions outside the US where it will happen quicker and that’s because there are markets where there is a vertical integration all the way from the exchange through to the custodian’s custodian if you will,” she said on Thursday at a conference organised by CoinDesk, an industry news site. “There the decision-making process is contained within a smaller number of bodies and there are a couple of jurisdictions with very supportive governments that are driving that. So I think you will see it outside the US probably before you see it meaningfully in the US,” she added. Clearing of securities in US markets is largely processed via the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation. Other clearing houses around the world, including in the UK and Germany, clear both securities and derivatives and have closer links with their settlement houses, which speed up the time it takes to post collateral from customer accounts. While stock markets have been reshaped by high-frequency trading that takes place in milliseconds, the transfer of many financial assets still takes days if not weeks as a result of legacy back office systems. Securities deals in the US typically take up to three days to settle, a process known in the markets as “T+3”, while waits of 20 days or more are typical in the settlement of loans. “T+3 is not particularly satisfactory, but it isn’t profoundly broken,” Ms Masters said. “If you look at the loan market that is operating at a T+20 — plus plus plus — basis and the consequences of that are impacting the economics of the business materially and adversely, that’s going to have to change whether it’s distributed ledger technology that fixes it or not,” she added. Ms Masters’ Digital Asset Holdings is just one in a crowded field of companies vying to develop products to replace existing securities trading systems. Duncan Niederauer, a former chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, has invested in Symbiont, which is developing a platform that uses blockchain, while Nasdaq has partnered with US start-up Chain for a private share-trading platform earlier this year. On Wednesday, Chain announced $30m in new funding from investors including Visa, Nasdaq and Citi Ventures. Banks too are exploring the technology’s potential through their own innovation arms and incubators, but there is still scepticism about blockchain start-ups promising to transform their businesses with shared database technology. “Am I going to go rip out all of that legacy infrastructure and start sharing it with other banks anytime soon? I think that’s a five to 10-year dream,” said Simon Taylor, blockchain and distributed ledger lead for Barclays, in a later panel discussion at the same conference.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Kadhim Shubber Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-09-10","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/454be1c8-2577-11e5-9c4e-a775d2b173ca","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F771fb53e-e64e-11e4-aa59-00144feab7de?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"FT Explainer: The blockchain and financial markets","INTRO":"A closer look at the financial networks underpinning bitcoin","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Banks and exchanges are all taking a keen interest in applying the blockchain, the record of asset ownership that underpins bitcoin, to financial markets. It mixes Silicon Valley and Wall Street and could represent a radical departure from longstanding financial networks. How does it work? At present, when one bank sends money to another, no physical currency changes hands. Banks and settlement systems use central electronic ledgers to track assets. But they can be slow and inefficient, often relying on faxes or manual input. That not only wastes time but racks up fees. The system is also open to hacking and fraud. The blockchain works by sequentially ordering blocks of transactions into a chain. Transactions between bitcoin users are gathered as blocks and broadcast to a network of computers. Those gathering the blocks are known as “miners”, and compete to verify them by unscrambling standard cryptographic puzzles derived from their contents. The “winner” publishes the result to other computers and receives a monetary incentive. A new block is added to the blockchain roughly every 10 minutes, containing the transactions of the last 10 minutes. Other computers then verify the work. The open source code means it can be widely distributed and stored, decentralising it. Altering it would require changing every copy. What’s in it for financial markets? Proponents say a ledger updated in minutes could save millions in collateral and settlement costs, while also automating banks’ creaky and expensive back office systems. Collateral could also be moved around the system faster, to meet new rules on derivatives markets implemented after the financial crisis. Santander InnoVentures, Anthemis and Oliver Wyman estimated distributed ledger technology could cut $15bn-$20bn from banks’ costs for cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance by 2022. Banks are looking at other ideas, such as programming “smart contracts” that can verify and execute commercial agreements. What’s the catch? The blockchain was never directly aimed at overhauling financial markets. As a result it contains flaws, critics argue. Computing processing power requires electricity — a real world cost. Already mining is controlled by a small group of actors, using huge farms of servers. That creates potential issues. If the monetary incentive for mining does not outweigh the cost of running servers, will there be enough miners? The ”longest” chain of blocks — the one with greatest sum of work done — is accepted as the ledger. An actor attempting to modify it would need control of enough computing power to overtake the genuine block chain as the longest. If he controls the majority of the network’s computing power — even temporarily — he could alter the ledger. Without that it becomes difficult to distinguish — legally — who owns what. The system can show fallibility. Recently Bitcoin.org, a closely watched industry site, warned some computers were generating “invalid blocks”. In effect the computers were more incentivised to win new bitcoins and did not validate existing transactions. (Since invalid blocks costs miners money, they assumed the chain was correct). Others worry that the blockchain is growing too big and inefficient to deal with a growing number of transactions. When the invalid blocks were found, Bitcoin.org suggested customers waited for 30 confirmations — or five hours — before accepting transactions. What if these problems were ironed out? “Ultimately every financial transaction is recorded by at least two parties,” the Bank of England noted last year. Without certainty of legal enforcement of contracts and security concerns, others accept that a central authority has a role to play. Real-world goods — like commodities — may be settled but still require proof of delivery. The blockchain is a protocol and does not have the ability to identify parties. Banks point out that they must comply with tough regulations around money laundering. Then there’s the clearing problem. A securities clearing house can net offsetting long and short trades from brokers. If positions cancel each other out, the member has to put up little margin to the clearing house. A distributed ledger would require the clearing house to settle long and short positions per client — a huge extra burden. Trades would also have to be pre-funded, which is such a drag on market liquidity that countries like Russia have moved away from same-day settlement. Derivatives clearing is about managing margin on outstanding contracts. “In a derivatives world, I have all the incentive to get margin (paid) when my contracts are in the money, but the incentive to leave things alone when my contracts are in the red,” says one specialist. “If a bank is dealing with someone unsophisticated then the other side may not know that they can demand a margin payment.” So how about settlement? As with any new technology, experimentation abounds. The term “blockchain” is becoming difficult to define. For instance there is a growing debate about whether a blockchain even needs a digital token like bitcoin. Some start-ups are turning to “permissioned” distributed ledgers, where permission is granted to approved actors to access the network, and quickly record trades and discover asset ownership. Companies like Hyperledger do not use blocks but a more traditional, consensus algorithm that could mean transactions could be settled in under 400 milliseconds. Whether that is still a “blockchain” is another matter. Critics say at that point, distributed ledger technology becomes less of a revolutionary tool and merely the next stage of back office IT infrastructure.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-07-14","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/0823a136-0ead-11e5-9ae0-00144feabdc0","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F53c7253e-ff05-11e4-84b2-00144feabdc0?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ex-NYSE head among trading veterans backing blockchain start-up","INTRO":"Symbiont will use bitcoin technology for issuance and trading of ‘smart securities’","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The former head of the New York Stock Exchange is among veteran trading executives who are backing a start-up that aims to use the type of technology that underpins bitcoin for securities issuance and trading. Duncan Niederauer, the previous chief executive of NYSE, is part of a group that has produced $1.25m of seed money for Symbiont. The other members are Matt Andresen, trading head at Citadel who founded the Island ECN, and Getco founders Dan Tierney and Stephen Schuler. Symbiont is developing a platform that allows market participants to create digital versions of securities. These “smart securities” are not just tokens of their counterparts but can be programmed to include attributes such as the paying of coupons or call functions. The securities will be stored in a distributed ledger known as a blockchain, originally used to record bitcoin transactions. Symbiont hopes the development of these securities, and their availability in one global, decentralised peer-to-peer network, will increase efficiency and transparency and lower the cost of issuing, trading, settling and clearing securities. “Symbiont is bridging the gap between Wall Street and the emerging blockchain ecosystem,” said Mr Niederauer, a member of the Symbiont board and a first-time investor in the bitcoin ecosystem. “It’s an exciting, timely and much-needed development for the long-term health of the markets.” The investors’ move reflects growing interest by professional traders and infrastructure providers in the use of blockchain technology for global financial markets.

Now banks, clearing houses and exchanges are becoming increasingly excited at the prospect of blockchain fundamentally transforming their business models. Last week Nasdaq said it would use blockchain technology from US start-up Chain to underpin its new private share-trading market, in one of its most high profile applications to date. Former New York Stock Exchange chief Duncan Niederauer and JPMorgan banker Blythe Masters have also lent their support to start-ups exploring its use. “Blockchain technology continues to redefine not only how the exchange sector operates, but the global financial economy as a whole,” says Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq. To its supporters, it marries the major preoccupations of Wall Street and Silicon Valley: tougher post-crisis regulations and cost-cutting on one side, community-agreed technology and new peer-to-peer structures to move money around the financial system on the other. This model, however, is fundamentally different to the financial industry’s current approach of using overlapping centralised ledgers. Settling trades can take days, is often expensive and, for many banks, is partly done by humans. The blockchain and the bitcoin assets it tracks set out a way to create an unforgeable, unchangeable ledger of asset ownership. Transactions between bitcoin users are broadcast to a network of computers. The latter, known as “miners”, gather together blocks of transactions and compete to verify them and receive monetary incentives in return for being “first”. The blocks are secured by cryptography and other computers can verify the work. The “cost” of running the network is borne by the anonymous owners of servers. The open source code means it can be widely distributed, making it highly decentralised and difficult to change. Banks and exchanges see a ledger updated in minutes as saving millions in collateral and settlement costs to third parties. New post-financial crisis rules have forced more over-the-counter derivatives to be processed through centralised clearing houses. That has increased demand for collateral to be sent around the financial system rapidly in order to be used as insurance for cleared derivatives trades. A recent report by Santander InnoVentures, Anthemis and Oliver Wyman estimated distributed ledger technology could cut $15bn-$20bn from banks’ costs for cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance by 2022. Banks are developing other ideas, such as programming “smart contracts” that can verify and execute commercial agreements. In depth Bitcoin As interest in bitcoin increases, US officials are looking into how to regulate, rather than shut down, the virtual currency Further reading As with any new technology, experimentation abounds. For a start, enthusiasts debate whether the blockchain even needs a digital token like bitcoin. For some, it is an article of faith that ensures miners are incentivised to do the work. Some start-ups, such as Ripple and Chain, are trying to create distributed ledgers with identifiable owners of assets and settlement finality. They argue an authoritative and unforgeable ledger for securities and derivatives is impossible, since legal enforcement of contracts requires people to prove ownership. “A lot of bitcoiners don’t realise how finality and settlement works with title transfer. You need to identify people or it’s a big waste of energy,” says Tim Swanson, a consultant advising start-ups including Hyperledger, Clearmatics and R3CEV, a venture capital group. Clearing houses, set up to manage systemic risk, are also special cases, he adds. “If participants ‘fail’ then the operator will probably move to centralise the credit risk — which was the purpose of the clearing house in the first place.” Identification of the true owners would be vital if the blockchain is compromised. At present the “longest” chain of blocks — the one with greatest sum of work done — is accepted as the ledger. It is protected because any actor attempting to modify it would have to have control of enough computing power to overtake the genuine block chain as the “longest”. In reality mining is controlled by a small group of actors. If one controls the majority of the network’s computing power — even temporarily — they could alter the ledger, says Robert Sams, founder and chief executive of London-based Clearmatics. “The law will not treat a ledger record as authoritative if everyone knows that the current longest chain contains blocks generated by an anonymous attacker who replaced a bit of history that was chronologically prior,” he says. “In financial markets there’s always a mechanism to correct an attack. In a blockchain there is no mechanism to correct it — people have to accept it.” Others worry that the blockchain is growing too big and inefficient to deal with a growing number of transactions. New lines are added on to the bitcoin block every 10 minutes. Consequently, others are talking about so-called “sidechains” that can process trades in milliseconds, interoperating with other blockchains. At that point, critics say, an interlinking network begins to look like the existing infrastructure. For now many start-ups accept they cannot go around the system. “It’s very important to work with existing market participants,” says Adam Ludwin, chief executive of Chain. “The mantra of Silicon Valley is: ‘Move fast, break things’. That mantra doesn’t apply in financial services.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-06-30","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/81b6145c-0309-11e5-b31d-00144feabdc0","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F51933084-ee96-11e4-88e3-00144feab7de?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Nasdaq to step up blockchain trials","INTRO":"Exchange operator hopes the bitcoin backbone will reshape market plumbing","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Nasdaq, the US exchanges operator, this year plans to increase the number of trials with the decentralised network that underpins bitcoin.

This month Nasdaq announced it would test the blockchain ledger with its venue for trading shares in private companies, making it the first high-profile exchange to say it was exploring the use of the blockchain in financial markets. Mr Greifeld told the FT he wanted Nasdaq to be “a leader in the field”. He added the network could potentially revolutionise the time it took to finalise deals on US securities markets from a maximum of three days — known in the industry as “T+3”. As a public, distributed ledger, the blockchain acts as a central repository for details of all bitcoin trades, though it could also be used for other financial assets. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency transactions are validated based on a mathematical formula running on the computers of volunteers, allowing assets to be transferred without using a centralised agency such as a bank or a clearing house. “I am a big believer in the ability of blockchain technology to effect fundamental change in the infrastructure of the financial services industry. Clearing houses are a wonderful invention, but if you have a public ledger that is trusted, you can evolve back to a bilateral (trading) world but proceed with instantaneous settlement. We currently settle at T+3. Why not settle in 5-10 minutes?” Shortening settlement times for trading could reduce the risk that counterparties would not be paid, while also cutting the amount of collateral, or insurance, used to back trades. In depth Bitcoin As interest in bitcoin increases, US officials are looking into how to regulate, rather than shut down, the virtual currency Further reading However, it could also mean investors may be required to pay for some trades far earlier than they have become accustomed to. For the Nasdaq Private Market, using blockchain means transforming the recording of transactions from paper certificates and spreadsheets to an audited record of the lineage of ownership of private securities. Nasdaq has had other forays with new ventures with mixed results. The exchange has struggled, for example, with a push into the US Treasuries market through the purchase of the eSpeed bond trading platform. Although Nasdaq is exploring its use in post-trade services, other groups are also turning their attention to bitcoin and its technology. Nasdaq’s rival, the New York Stock Exchange, this month said it would launch the first exchange-calculated and distributed bitcoin index. In January, NYSE made a minority investment in Coinbase, a bitcoin wallet and platform. Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker who helped develop the idea behind credit default swaps, has joined a group of trading executives setting up a venue that will convert buyers and sellers of financial assets into bitcoins, thus cutting settlement times.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford Nicole Bullock","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-05-26","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/7ea83e9a-f7f9-11e4-962b-00144feab7de","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Faf5a3fdc-c82b-11e4-8fe2-00144feab7de?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Nasdaq adopts bitcoin backbone for stocks","INTRO":"Blockchain seen as way to streamline many types of transactions","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Nasdaq is to start using the technology behind the virtual currency bitcoin to handle transactions on its market, making it what is thought to be the first major financial market to adopt the idea. The blockchain — the backbone on which bitcoin depends — has attracted wide interest in the financial world as a potentially revolutionary way to streamline many different types of transactions, though few alternative applications have yet been tried beyond bitcoin. As a public, distributed ledger, the blockchain currently acts as a central repository for details of all bitcoin trades, though it could also be used for other financial assets. Transactions are validated based on a mathematical formula running on the computers of volunteers, removing the need for banks, clearing houses or other intermediaries. “It brings a level of auditing that’s based on mathematics and not based on trusting a third party,” said David Johnston, chairman of Factom Foundation, a start-up trying to expand the use of the blockchain beyond bitcoin. Nasdaq said it was looking to use the blockchain across its markets. The first application, due later this year, will handle the issuance and transfer of stocks on its Nasdaq Private Market platform, which was set up to handle trades in private company stocks. The technology will “modernise, streamline and secure typically cumbersome administrative functions,” said Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive officer. Private companies in particular struggle with the requirements of keeping share registers manually, he added. In a sign of the growing interest in the blockchain’s potential to disrupt how financial markets operate, Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan executive who helped develop the idea behind credit default swaps, earlier this year joined Digital Asset Holdings, a start-up focused on the area. At the time, she described the task of reducing the costs and inefficiencies in financial transactions as “one of the great challenges of our time.” Besides ending the need for intermediaries like banks or clearing houses, the use of the blockchain could also make the completion of transactions almost instant, compared to the period of days most trades currently take to settle, Mr Johnston said.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Richard Waters","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-05-11","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/541414c0-3834-11e6-a780-b48ed7b6126f","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2Fee0a5718-1b7b-11e6-b286-cddde55ca122?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Banks claim blockchain breakthrough in money transfer","INTRO":"Santander, CIBC and UniCredit move real money across borders using the technology","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A group of seven banks including Santander, CIBC and UniCredit is claiming a breakthrough, ranking among the first financial institutions in the world to move real money across borders using blockchain-based technology. On Wednesday the banks announced they had taken part in projects to make international payments using digital assets on the platform of Ripple, a San Francisco-based digital settlement firm. Instead of transacting via local currency accounts at correspondent banks around the world, the banks convert funds to Ripple’s own digital currency, known as XRP, then complete an exchange almost instantly. Until now, the settlement process has been slow — often three to five days — and prone to errors. The seven banks signing up “is a big milestone, maybe a tipping point,” said Chris Larsen, Ripple’s chief executive officer and co-founder. He noted that about 80 other banks — including 12 of the top 50 by assets — were experimenting with the platform, and could commit to using it soon. “The more banks we get on there, the more useful it becomes for everybody else.” Blockchain-based technology has caught the imagination of the financial services industry within the past couple of years, with a host of companies looking for ways to use it to shave costs and reshape their daily operations. The technology is essentially a digital public database of events that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records and shared among various parties. This means ledgers can be instantly updated in multiple locations without a single, centralised authority. On Tuesday the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of US regulators, said in its annual review that systems such as Ripple’s can lower transaction costs and improve the efficiency of financial intermediation. However, the FSOC added that such systems “pose certain risks and uncertainties” and noted that banks had limited experience of them. “Operational vulnerabilities . . . may not become apparent until they are deployed at scale,” it said. The warning came just days after the DAO, the decentralised autonomous organisation that uses a blockchain by Ethereum, was hacked and about $60m of Ethereum’s digital currency removed. Last week New York’s Department of Financial Services granted Ripple the first licence to sell and store XRP for institutional investors and financial institutions in the state, having been satisfied that its anti-money laundering, consumer protection and cyber security standards were up to scratch. The group of banks using Ripple also includes Switzerland’s UBS, Germany’s ReiseBank, National Bank of Abu Dhabi and ATB Financial of Edmonton. Tim Wan, Calgary-based director of innovation at ATB, said his bank had begun by using the platform to process small payments running to thousands of dollars, but wanted to try higher-volume “batch” settlements — or even use it to enter new business areas, such as becoming a big provider of liquidity in foreign exchange. “At the end of the day, the great thing about the technology is it is the great democratiser,” he said. “It is not the institution you trust but the transaction. If the funds exist then the transaction will happen.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ben McLannahan","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-06-22","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/1117c780-3397-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F045ccbee-0b01-11e6-b0f1-61f222853ff3?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Canada experiments with digital dollar on blockchain","INTRO":"Country’s central bank poised to embrace technology behind bitcoin","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Canada is exploring the creation of a digital version of its currency as central banks examine whether modern technology can create a new medium of exchange. The Bank of Canada, the country’s central bank, revealed in a private presentation in Calgary on Wednesday that it was working with the country’s biggest banks to develop an electronic version of the Canadian dollar. It is examining how to put a government-backed, or fiat, currency on blockchain, the digital ledger that underpins cryptocurrency bitcoin. Full adoption would mark a significant advance for the emerging technology. According to slides seen by the Financial Times, the initiative will involve issuing, transferring and settling central bank assets on a distributed ledger via a token named CAD-Coin. It is being carried out in conjunction with several of Canada’s biggest banks, including Royal Bank of Canada, CIBC and TD Bank, as well as Payments Canada. It is using intellectual property developed by R3, a New York consortium of more than 50 of the world’s biggest banks. Financial institutions have been keen to exploit the much-hyped technology, which works as an electronic ledger that is continuously maintained and verified in “blocks” of records. It is shared on computer servers between various parties and protected cryptographically to prevent it from being altered. Putting a fiat currency on a distributed ledger could pave the way for customers to deposit money with their central bank directly rather than use a commercial bank. The Bank of Canada said the experiment was a proof-of-concept and confined to interbank payment systems. “Other frameworks need to be investigated, and there are many hurdles that need to be cleared before such a system would ever be ready for prime time,” said Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada. “None of our experiments are to develop central-bank issued e-money‎ for use by the general public.” Advocates have argued that blockchain — which combines the peer-to-peer computing ethos of Silicon Valley with the money management of Wall Street — can free up billions of dollars of costs included in delays and insurance within the financial system. Attacks on banks using existing payments infrastructure such as Swift have also highlighted security flaws. Sceptics of blockchain say the technology does not adequately improve existing market operations such as settlement systems. They also say that the technology’s promise cannot be fulfilled until government-backed currency is issued on the ledger. In a speech last year Andrew Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, said the central bank may be able to use a government-backed electronic currency as a way to levy negative interest rates. Under Project Jasper, participants would pledge cash collateral into a special pool, which the central bank would convert to CAD-Coin. That would be then used as a medium of exchange but the central bank would retain the ability to destroy redeemed CAD-Coins. Other central banks, notably the US Federal Reserve, have also been exploring its use. Earlier this month the US central bank hosted a meeting of 100 central bankers and regulators from around the world to discuss its future.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philip Stafford","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-06-16","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":"article.n-content-body"},{"LINK":"https://www.ft.com/content/a1fc3522-314b-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Financial Times","IMAGE":"https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fprod-upp-image-read.ft.com%2F308d4afa-3161-11e6-bda0-04585c31b153?source\u003dnext\u0026fit\u003dscale-down\u0026dpr\u003d2\u0026width\u003d240","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Handled right, blockchain could help banks and their customers","INTRO":"Despite the hype, there are several misconceptions about the technology, writes Huw van Steenis","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Few issues in financial policy are more controversial than the impact of blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that sits behind the digital currency bitcoin. Does it threaten not only the profits of financial intermediaries but also their business models? Could it undermine the control that central bankers exert over global payments and securities processing? Or is it a tool to streamline cluttered processes, improve resilience and enhance transparency? The case for change is clear. Even if the dangerous experiment of negative interest rates proves to be shorter lived than many fear, banks’ need for more operating leverage will remain in a modest growth economy. The key to cutting costs? Harnessing technology to improve productivity. Enter blockchain. It offers the promise of a unique shared database across multiple sites and geographies as a public ledger of all transactions. Broad-based adoption could take as long as a decade, as issues such as scalability and standards have yet to be resolved. And while there is a great deal of hype surrounding the technology, there are also several misconceptions. For the more radical proponents of blockchain, a distributed ledger means a peer-to-peer system, eliminating the need for middlemen. But neither banks nor policymakers take the idea of an “unpermissioned” network seriously, principally because of anti-money laundering and “know your customer” (KYC) rules. This of course raises the issue of who will be in charge. Another claim often made is that blockchain can eliminate existing infrastructure. But its scalability has not yet been tested and firms cannot risk trillions of dollars of daily fund flows on an unproven system. Blockchain will need to be able to be plugged into existing technology to be usable and affordable. This is more evolution than revolution. What does this mean for policymakers? Christopher Giancarlo, a commissioner at the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has argued that in order for blockchain technology to develop, regulators must take a “do no harm” approach. He is right. Regulators should be agnostic about new technology, but there are some practical steps they could take in order to encourage blockchain innovation. A recent Morgan Stanley report outlined ten potential obstacles to making blockchain a reality in banking. Overcoming half of them would require collaboration with public authorities. The adoption of blockchain hinges on regulation, most of which is still to be written.  First, regulators need to work with innovators on areas such as digital identity, smart contracts, tokenisation, privacy and data ownership. Second, legal issues need to be addressed. For instance, who is responsible in a decentralised system? Who has jurisdiction when a network is spread over a large number of regions and companies? How will existing regulations be adapted to new technologies and business models? More broadly, shared services are likely to be central to the next decade of banking. Regulation will play a critical role in supporting this shift. A healthy financial system will require more mutualisation of costs, given that multiple rules are a disincentive to consolidation. These include areas such as KYC, which are particularly difficult to manage given differing legal interpretations. Blockchain may bring about dramatic change. And if it does, there will be losers, as floor traders found out to their cost when securities exchanges went through a technological disruption of their own. This, however, did not spell the end of all intermediaries. Rather, it reinvigorated the winners, who are able to manage volumes several orders of magnitude higher than before at a fraction of the cost, and with greater functionality for investors. The blockchain revolution, if it happens, could prove to be just as important to customers.

Rather than spinning straw into gold it transforms wasted computing power into money that people will actually accept as payment. Radical libertarians have desperately wanted to believe in it because they hope it can resolve the following dilemma. They prefer markets to politics and they violently distrust states. But modern states in effect have a monopoly over the currencies that markets need in order to work. Bitcoin, if it became broadly accepted, would challenge states’ dominance of the economy. It is designed to prevent monopoly by states or other entities, building a new currency based on shared information and making it hard for any entity to gain control. Politics disappears and a combination of technology and cryptographic proofs is conjured up in its place. Unfortunately, the magic is wearing off. Some of the technological innovations associated with bitcoin will stick around. The political project will not. Rather than overcoming conventional politics, bitcoin is succumbing to it. The biggest fights are focused on the most innovative element of bitcoin: the “blockchain”. This is a decentralised ledger of transactions using bitcoin. Bitcoin “miners” compete with one another to solve computationally hard problems. The winner receives new bitcoin but also validates a “block” of queued transactions, which is then added to the ledger and shared with the community. This system was designed to replace third-party regulation with decentralised authority. For technical reasons, it is starting to fail. Each block is small, meaning the system can handle only a few transactions at a time. As more people have started to use bitcoin, the system has grown more unreliable. The problem is that coming up with a fix requires political agreement. Because there is no centralised authority within bitcoin, there is no one who can impose a mandate. Bitcoin’s creator, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, apparently vanished years ago, leaving big decisions to an increasingly quarrelsome community. Some influential members of the bitcoin network want to change the currency’s protocols to make the blocks bigger so that more bitcoin are released at one time, speeding up transactions. Others have responded with outrage, claiming that this would destroy bitcoin. A fundamental change to the protocol would “fork the chain”, potentially creating two different currencies with irreconcilable records, one for those who embraced the fix and another for those who refused it. Others want instead to move crucial parts of transaction handling away from the block chain, relying more on “side chains”. Again, this idea is disputed: side chains could turn bitcoin’s unified approach into a stew of quasi-compatible proprietary solutions. The leading proposal to fork the chain would require 75 per cent of the bitcoin network to agree to the proposal before it was fully implemented. However, no one is empowered to stop people from swaying opinion in illegitimate ways. Companies that favour changing the protocol, such as Coinbase, a bitcoin “wallet” and exchange business, have been targeted by distributed denial of service attacks intended to knock their servers off the internet. People on both sides have withdrawn from the bitcoin network after receiving threats.  This free-for-all demonstrates the main problem of technological libertarianism. It does not escape politics but temporarily displaces and conceals it. As bitcoin has become more successful, it has also become potentially more lucrative. Ideology is giving way to fights over who gets what. And it turns out that libertarians are not very good at figuring out how to resolve these political clashes. As these fights become more publicly visible, they will hurt bitcoin outside its core base of enthusiasts. The advocates of bitcoin got one thing absolutely right. Money is a confidence trick, a form of “frozen desire”, as the writer James Buchan describes it. We only believe in it because everyone else believes in it. So if bitcoin believers believed hard enough, and convinced other people to believe, they had a shot at making it generally accepted. That is now going to be far harder. The apparent value of bitcoin depends on a suspension of disbelief. It is hard to see how the illusion can work when the magicians are punching each other out on stage.
