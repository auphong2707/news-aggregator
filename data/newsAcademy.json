Full Galxe Crypto Review and GAL Coin Analysis","INTRO":"The Galxe crypto project, formerly known as Project Galaxy, is all about helping other projects build and grow their Web3 communities. With big-name projects in their portfolio, such as Arbitrum and Polygon, there\u0026#8217;s no doubt Galxe knows how to build crypto communities. But, although these other projects have had successful communities and tokens, how are things looking for Galxe and its GAL coin? Let\u0026#8217;s find out in this article as we conduct a full Galxe review and GAL crypto analysis and answer \u0026#8220;What is Galxe?\u0026#8221; among many other questions!","DETAILED_CONTENT":"As we dive into today’s article, we’ll first cover the basics of the Galxe crypto project. As such, you will find out what Project Galaxy (now Galxe) is, what the project is all about, what its core features are, who’s behind the project, and more. With a proper understanding of Galxe, we’ll focus on the GAL coin. You’ll get to learn the gist of this original Project Galaxy coin, how it works, its tokenomics, and use cases. Then, we’ll also analyze the GAL coin’s price to determine what price levels the token has covered. Using the basics of technical analysis (TA), we’ll also outline all significant price levels for this crypto asset. Plus, we’ll speculate on some GAL crypto token price predictions. Nonetheless, we’ll also demonstrate how to use Moralis Money to help you discover if/when to buy $GAL. And for those of you who may decide to get a bag of the GAL coin, we’ll even tell you where and how to do that without breaking a sweat or the bank. Galxe is a crypto project focusing on building powerful tools and solutions to help Web3 projects build strong communities. According to Galxe’s docs, the project is the leading platform for building Web3 communities. It has more than eleven million unique users and has helped some of the leading crypto projects, including Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon, to grow. Aside from the above three projects, the Project Galaxy crypto protocol claims to have helped over 2,700 partners with reward-based loyalty programs. However, there’s more to the Galxe crypto project! As such, make sure to explore the subsections below. The official websites of projects themselves are typically the best places to learn what each project is all about. So, to learn more about what Galxe is, “galxe.com” offers quite a lot to explore. Visitors will first notice the “Earn NFTs/OATs/Tokens by Contributing to Your Favorite Web3 Community” heading. This tells us that the former Project Galaxy crypto platform offers Web3 community-building solutions and invites potential community members interested in other projects’ loyalty programs created using Galxe’s solutions. So, if visitors are potential community members, they get to hit the “3k+ Trusted Brands” button. Then, they can select any of the projects using Galxe’s tools if they want to contribute to their growth. On the other hand, Web3 projects interested in growing their communities get to hit the “Create Your Space” button to start using Galxe’s crypto solutions. Scrolling down the Galxe homepage, you can find several sections targeting potential community members by presenting various spaces and reward programs of projects using Galxe’s solutions. Furthermore, you can also learn the basics of Web3 via Galxe’s mission Web3 content. To see the full spectrum of features and solutions this project offers, you can explore the “galxe.com” top menu or the footer area. However, you can also learn the gist of it in the following subsection. Bullet Labs is the venture behind Galxe. After checking out Bullet Labs’ socials and website, we couldn’t find out much about it. After all, these outlets only state that Bullet Labs is focusing on Web3 product development. Plus, they link to the Galxe crypto project. As such, it is reasonable to presume that Galxe is Bullet Labs’ only project. According to Bullet Labs’ LinkedIn profile, the company has its headquarters in San Mateo, California. This outlet also tells us the company behind the former Project Galaxy crypto protocol went live in 2021. The co-founders of Bullet Labs are Charles Wayn and Harry Zhang. The transition from Project Galaxy to Galxe took place in September 2022. You can see the announcement on the above screenshot of the Bullet Labs official website. The latter leads to the following Medium post: The reason behind this rebranding is explained in the above-outlined post, and it expresses where the project was at the time it was called Project Galaxy and where it was planning to go. It’s time to take a closer look at this project’s solutions. On the “Solutions” page from the former Project Galaxy crypto project, we can read more about the project. It points out that it offers a powerful plug-and-play dashboard, which enables projects to create customized campaigns. This means that projects don’t have to deal with any coding to get going with Galxe’s infrastructure. These are the core selling points Galxe can provide that the “Solutions” page points out: In order to deliver on the above-outlined promises, the Galxe protocol deploys the following solutions: Note: We’ll take a closer look at the GAL crypto token herein. However, to explore the project’s other solutions, make sure to visit Galxe’s documentation: Galxe offers projects the following three-step process to get going: By covering the above info and answering the question, “What is Project Galaxy?” you know that Project Galaxy is the former name and that Galxe is its current name. Also, you know Galxe is a community-building platform. That said, being such a specific platform that aims to build strong communities, the project itself must have a strong community. Judging by the project’s X following, it is doing quite alright: Aside from Galxe’s X profile, this former Project Galaxy crypto venture offers several additional community outlets. You can access them via the project’s top menu on its homepage: The GAL coin is the Galxe crypto protocol’s native cryptocurrency. The token’s original home was the Ethereum chain, where it was born on January 19, 2022. However, since April 30 of that same year, the GAL crypto token has also been roaming the ecosystem on BNB Chain. The Project Galaxy crypto asset is a fungible token. On the Ethereum chain, it follows the ERC-20 token standard and has a total supply of 200,000,000 $GAL. In order to understand how the GAL coin works, make sure to check out the asset’s tokenomics and use cases. After all, GAL is an important part of the Galxe credential data network. The Project Galaxy coin has multiple use cases. It primarily serves governance, incentivizing, and payment purposes within the Galxe crypto ecosystem. When it comes to governance, the GAL crypto token allows its holders to cast votes and participate in the Galxe DAO. This enables GAL holders to have a say in how high the Galxe platform fees are and how to use Galxe’s community treasury. As far as payments go, GAL covers two main aspects. On the one hand, developers who want to use Galxe’s credential data through the platform’s application modules use GAL to pay platform fees. On the other hand, the GAL crypto asset is also the medium devs use to pay for the Galxe oracle engine and the Galxe Credential API. The Project Galaxy coin is also used to incentivize the curators of Galxe’s digital credentials. Moreover, curators can collect rewards in the form of the GAL coin for their contribution to helping identify valuable credential data. The above weekly chart on the logarithmic scale shows the entire Project Galaxy coin’s price action. Given the fact that the crypto market as a whole entered a bear market at the end of 2021, it is not surprising to see that the GAL crypto token price has spent most of its time in a downtrend. However, it is important to note that the token listed on Binance at $1.5 rallied well over $10 in the first days of trading. From approximately $10, the value of GAL reduced to $1-ish in late December 2022. From that level, it had quite a run (150%-plus) in January 2023. However, the asset couldn’t close its weekly candles above $2.5-ish. Instead, it went to its all-time low (ATL) at $0.837. Since then, the price recovered a bit; however, it has been mainly ranging on top of the $1-ish level. The above image indicates the Project Galaxy coin price on a weekly timeframe and a regular scale. We’ve also marked all the levels of significance with blue lines. In addition, we added a downsloping trendline (white line). The latter shows us that the $GAL price has recently broken out of a 480-day-long downtrend. By looking at the above chart again, you can also see that this breakout came with a slight increase in trading volume. Thus, it is quite likely that this cycle’s low for GAL is already in. So, if the crypto market as a whole manages to start moving upward, the Project Galaxy token is likely to reach significant price levels above its current price. So, you can view the above market levels as the most likely price targets for $GAL. However, as the next bull run takes over, many projects will be even more interested in building their communities. And they might decide to use the power of the Galxe crypto project for those purposes. If so, $GAL’s price will most likely reach new ATHs. There’s no other successful project with similar use cases as Galxe. Thus, we can’t do a comparison where we put GAL up against another coin. However, we can use the Fibonacci retracement tool to get some speculative future price predictions. So, if GAL were to break above the $17.3-ish, which is the asset’s ATH daily close so far, it would enter price discovery mode. In that scenario, the Fibonacci retracement tool’s most optimistic level (the “4.236” extension) points to $70-ish. The information provided in the sections above should be more than enough to help you determine if you find the Galxe crypto project’s native token interesting. If not, you should leave the GAL coin in the rearview mirror immediately. Instead, start searching for other great altcoin opportunities with Moralis Money’s Token Explorer. However, if you find our answers to the “What is Project Galaxy?” question intriguing enough to consider getting a bag of $GAL, then you must further research this project and its coin. And there’s no better tool to do that than the Moralis Money Project Galaxy ($GAL) token page. On that page, you can find all the links you need to explore the Galxe project.

While WINR Protocol with its WINR token may fall into that category, there\u0026#8217;s so much more to WINR than simply being stamped as a top iGaming project. In fact, the WINR Protocol aims to position itself as a decentralized on-chain iGaming infrastructure platform. Of course, only time will tell how successful their venture will be and whether the WINR crypto asset will offer massive profits. However, as the next bull run is slowly warming up, now’s a good time to examine this protocol and its native token.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"As we dive into the core of today’s article, we’ll first cover the basics of the project behind the WINR token – WINR Protocol. So, you’ll get to find out what the protocol is all about, what its unique aspects are, and how it operates. Then, we’ll focus on the WINR crypto asset. Again, we’ll cover the basics first and then proceed to specifics. In doing so, we’ll look at WINR’s tokenomics, use cases, and more. Next, we’ll shift our attention toward the WINR token price. We’ll first look at the asset’s entire price action. Then, we’ll use the basics of technical analysis (TA) to determine some WINR token support and resistance levels. These levels and using some other tools will help us speculate on some of the asset’s price predictions. In the last part of today’s article, we’ll focus on helping you determine if you should buy $WINR. This is where you’ll learn how Moralis Money makes that decision a whole lot simpler. And, for those of you who may decide to get a bag of WINR, we’ll also explain where and how to do so. WINR Protocol is a crypto project that provides smart contract tools, a liquidity engine, and an incentive framework for other developers and projects wanting to step into the Web3 iGaming realm. Or, as the project’s official website states: “WINR protocol is a decentralized on-chain iGaming infrastructure.” By using the WINR SDK, developers can plug their games into the project’s deep multi-asset liquidity pool. Plus, the protocol’s incentive framework allows them to incentivize their players and themselves as builders. Essentially, WINR Protocol allows other projects to easily utilize the protocol’s infrastructure to implement Web3 functionalities. As such, these projects can focus on creating exciting and engaging games and not worry about the “Web3” aspects of their iGaming venture. According to the project’s official website, there are four specific aspects that the WINR crypto project solves. First, it delivers a transparent liquidity engine. In turn, it prevents fractionalized liquidity; it takes the load off of new Web3 iGaming platforms in order to attract new liquidity pools (LPs). Second, this protocol helps other projects cut development costs. As a result, by using WINR’s smart contract SDKs and on-chain tools, projects can save on expenses. Third, the protocol claims to ensure that platforms built using its tech are provably fair. It does so by offering transparent and verified tools and the process of approval executed by the WINR DAO. Fourth, projects interested in entering the Web3 iGaming arena get to avoid the need to create new tokenomics. Instead, they get to plug into the WINR tokenomics. By doing so, the WINR ecosystem also covers their marketing needs. As outlined in the above image, here’s how WINR Protocol works: The “winr.games” website further explains that projects built using WINR’s tech use WINR’s WLP bankroll and WING game engine. However, projects are in complete control over their UX/UI. At the time of writing, the protocol’s official website lists three dapps currently using WINR tech. One is already live, and it’s known as JustBet, while two other projects, 0xsportsbet and DegensBet, are set to launch relatively soon. According to the protocol’s documentation, projects building on top of WINR’s smart contracts also have the opportunity to leverage WINR games. But what are WINR games? Well, these are popular Web2 games modified for Web3. Essentially, WINR games allow projects to expand their Web2 user acquisition reach. From a technical perspective, the WINR crypto project presents its backend as WINR Chain. The latter is the backbone of the protocol’s infrastructure, and it was constructed using Arbitrum Orbit. Note: If you wish to dive deeper into the technical aspects of WINR Chain, the WINR liquidity pool, and the WINR game engine, make sure to explore the protocol’s docs: Unless you are new to crypto, you know that communities for projects are a great source of helpful information. And the more decentralized the project, the greater the role of its community. So, if you wish to get involved with the WINR community, you ought to follow its X account, join its Discord server and Telegram channel, and explore the WINR GitHub repo. You can find links to all these outlets on the project’s official website. Here’s also the protocol’s roadmap: The WINR token is WINR Protocol’s native cryptocurrency. It is an essential part of the mechanics of the entire WINR ecosystem, particularly of the protocol’s incentive model. With that said, it’s important to get better acquainted with this crypto if you wish to know what WINR is all about. As such, make sure to look at the coin’s tokenomics and its use cases, which we cover below. Note: More details regarding WINR’s tokenomics await you in the protocol’s docs. The role of the WINR token is multi-fold. Users can stake WINR and earn tokens, and WINR serves as a gas token on the layer-3 WINR Chain and grants governance rights. As outlined above, a large portion of WINR’s total supply is allocated to the ecosystem’s rewards. The latter is done via the vWINR token, which is the vested (v) version of WINR. Users can stake both WINR and vWINR to earn real yield in the form of WLP, which represents the underlying assets in the WINR liquidity pool. The addresses that stake these tokens are eligible to participate in WINR DAO voting proposals. WINR, as a gas token, covers transaction fees, and the protocol’s mechanics burn a portion of WINR used in each transaction. As such, this creates a deflationary mechanism to enhance the token’s long-term value. This further means that any project building on top of WINR Chain gets to use WINR as the medium to cover transaction fees. Note: To explore the use cases of the WINR token, dive into the protocol’s documentation. This is particularly important if you wish to use WINR games or build your unique games on top of WINR Chain. The above chart covers the entire history of the WINR token price. As you can see, the token started to trade on March 16, 2023, at $0.04-ish. Over the five days following the token’s listing, its value increased by nearly 200%, reaching as high as $0.12-ish. However, the initial asset’s momentum ran out at the level mentioned earlier, and the WINR token price took a downturn. It first bounced off of the $0.07-ish level, but eventually, it went significantly lower than that. After setting new lows at $0.03-ish in mid-May 2023, $WINR nearly doubled its price. But the $0.06-ish level rejected the WINR token price, which set the asset on another down-trending path. This time, $WINR found its bottom at $0.012-ish on July 20, 2023. Next, the chart printed a clear double-bottom pattern, which played out in early August 2023. This took the WINR token price up to $0.07-ish. However, these new local lows couldn’t hold, and the price returned to the lower regions. First, it bounced off the $0.036-$0.04-ish region. But eventually, it went again as low as $0.023-ish on September 9, 2023. Since the aforementioned low, WINR’s price managed to reclaim its position above the $0.03-ish level. At the time of writing, the asset sits just above that support, fluctuating around $0.034-ish. Compared to some other crypto gambling tokens, the WINT crypto asset’s performance so far is far from impressive. But it’s worth pointing out that WINR games and projects using the protocol are just getting started. And that could spur the token’s growth. Looking at the above chart, you can also see that the WINR price broke out of a descending trendline (white line) and is currently retesting it. So, it is likely for the price to go higher from the current level. Of course, for that scenario to unfold, the rest of the crypto market must show some strength. So, if WINR were to go higher, the above-outlined levels of significance (blue line) are the most likely price targets. However, if the crypto market were to plunge further, the $0.023-ish and $0.013-ish supports would come into play. As for the WINR price in the upcoming bull market, given the current popularity of Web3 iGaming, there’s more upside potential. As such, it is highly likely that $WINR will manage to break above its current ATH level. And based on the Fibonacci retracement tool, the asset could reach $0.46-ish. However, at the time of writing, WINR still has a meager market cap, which gives it a lot of room to grow. So, a 100x or more price increase might be possible for $WINR. The above sections should help you determine whether or not the WINR crypto project and its native token interest you. If not, then you can leave this Web3 iGambling ecosystem in your rearview mirror and focus on other altcoin opportunities. However, if you find WINR interesting, you should decide if you should buy it. In case you decide to take that path, you’ll also want to be able to know when, where, and how to do so. And that’s exactly what the following sections will help you with. Presuming you find WINR interesting, then you need to research the token further to answer the above question with confidence. And the best place to do that comes in the form of the Moralis Money $WINR token page. On that page, you can find all the links to the project’s outlets that you may use to further explore the project. By investigating further, you can decide whether or not you should buy it. Plus, the page provides other useful resources and tools, including the token’s price chart and the asset’s real-time, on-chain metrics (a.k.a. alpha metrics). Moreover, it is the combination of these two insights that will allow you to determine when to buy the token. So, follow the above “$WINR” link or use the interactive widget below to properly research this cryptocurrency: While there are a couple of markets where you can buy WINR, Camelot is the only one with significant trading volume. This is a popular DEX on the Arbitrum network that anyone with internet access can visit. To buy the WINR crypto token, you’ll need an EVM-compatible Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask). You’ll also need to ensure you add the Arbitrum network to your wallet in order to be able to buy $WINR. Plus, make sure to have enough ETH or ARB in that wallet. To access the Camelot swap, you need to hit the “Launch App” button on the “camelot.exchange” page: Once inside the app, connect your Web3 wallet. You also need to select the token you want to use to buy $WINR as well as the target asset itself. To avoid landing on a scammy trading pair, use the above-provided smart contract address and paste it into the search bar. Then, enter the amount you wish to buy and execute the swap. Note: If this is your first crypto-swapping feat, we encourage you to check out our step-by-step guide on how to swap ERC-20 tokens. Whether you decide to buy WINR or not, you need to remember that there are countless other altcoin opportunities in various cryptocurrency categories. That said, if you wish to focus on crypto gambling tokens, you have several options (e.g., RLB, BAZED, BETS, etc.). Still, the best way to make money is not by focusing on any particular token category. Instead, you should find the best altcoins at any given moment based on their real-time, on-chain metrics. And there’s no better tool for the job than Moralis Money’s Token Explorer. Plus, you get to do this on all the leading chains, including Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, and several others.

Bluzelle Crypto Analysis","INTRO":"The Bluzelle crypto project is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution for storing and managing data for dapps. Furthermore, it aims to position itself as a network to serve GameFi projects. Although Bluzelle has existed for quite some time, it has stayed under the radar until recently as it has started to gain some on-chain momentum. That said, is Bluzelle (BLZ) a good crypto to buy? If you want the answer to that question and many others, read on as we explore the Bluzelle crypto project and conduct a full BLZ coin price analysis!","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Moving forward, we’ll first make sure you know what the Bluzelle crypto project is; we’ll examine the ins and outs, look at the creators, and see how Bluzelle works. With a basic understanding of the Bluzelle crypto project under our belts, we’ll be ready to take a closer look at the BLZ coin. We’ll start with the coin’s basics and dive deeper as we move on. So, you’ll get to learn what the BLZ token is, what its purpose is, and what the BLZ cryptocurrency’s use cases are. Plus, we’ll also inspect the asset’s tokenomics, including some key metrics and what its distribution looks like. Learning about the Bluzelle crypto project and its BLZ coin will serve as a sort of fundamental analysis of this GameFi venture. As such, the obvious next step is to perform a technical analysis (TA) of the Bluzelle token. Accordingly, we’ll perform a full $BLZ price analysis and use TA basics to outline core support and resistance levels. Nonetheless, we’ll even use a valid technique to offer a speculative BLZ coin price prediction. Last but not least, you’ll get to find out how Moralis Money can help you decide if and when you should buy $BLZ. Bluzelle is a blockchain company that strives to level up the technological power structures and access to information through decentralization. This is reflected in the company’s mission, which is all about ensuring creators get to control their intellectual property free from any gatekeepers. As part of this mission, the company created a unique blockchain network. Bluzelle is also a blockchain for GameFi, with a special decentralized storage layer. According to the Bluzelle crypto project’s website and documentation, the Bluzelle blockchain has the ability to support high-quality games, protect players’ NFTs in its decentralized storage layer, and leverage DeFi yields. As far as the latter goes, the project points out that Cosmos-based 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) capabilities play a key role. So, one of the reasons why the project created the Bluzelle crypto is to help overcome the issue of high gas fees on Ethereum. They believe that high fees and scaling issues deliver poor user experience and are not something gamers would like to experience. Inside the Bluzelle GameFi Overview section on their website, the project presents Bluzelle’s four-point framework as a solution to the aforementioned issues: It’s worth pointing out that Bluzelle is not a new kid on the block. After all, the company went live ten years ago. It was in 2014 when Pavel Bains and Neeraj Murarka co-founded Bluzelle. Bains took on the role of the company’s CEO, and Murarka the role of a CTO. They are the only two team members that the project’s website outlines. The three core components of the Bluzelle infrastructure include a validator network, the Keplr wallet, and a block explorer. Bluzelle’s validator network is the backbone of the platform and its decentralized blockchain, as well as its decentralized storage layer. This network consists of distributed validators that ensure proper security and decentralization. The task of validators is to collaborate on transaction confirmation and data integrity in order to ensure a robust infrastructure. With Keplr, a versatile crypto wallet, users get to securely store the BLZ coin and other digital assets. Bluzelle ensures that this wallet has a user-friendly interface and advanced security features. As such, Keplr offers a seamless experience for handling BLZ tokens. As for the Bluzelle block explorer, just like any other blockchain explorer, it is a tool anyone can use to monitor and analyze activity on the Bluzelle network. This is where users get to view transactions, on-chain addresses, and other data within the Bluzelle network. The project’s documentation highlights that decentralization and mutability, greater global coverage, and lower cost are Bluzelle’s core storage features. So, unlike a typical blockchain database that stores data permanently, Bluzelle storage does sort of the opposite. The project sees keeping data permanently costly and ineffective for applications. As such, it stores data like a traditional database, but it does so with an added blockchain-like security. This combo ensures that data is updated and deleted at a low cost and that it is accurate and can only be changed by its rightful owner. Bluzelle achieves that by integrating Tendermint – a byzantine fault-tolerant system. Bluzelle’s docs further outline that the network’s providers are spread across Asia, Europe, and North America and that the expansion to Africa, South America, and Australia is in the pipeline. This ensures proper distribution and multi-region coverage. To achieve lower costs, Bluzelle utilizes outside sources, which reduces the project’s overhead. This means that Bluzelle gets to offer lower prices to developers interested in a decentralized storage solution. Note: You can dive into the nitty-gritty of the Bluzelle network and storage solution by exploring the Bluzelle documentation! While many of us appreciate blockchain technology and its potential applications, almost all of us primarily want to make money with altcoins. For that, Bluzelle offers its own token: the BLZ coin. So, let’s look at what BLZ is, its purpose, and what the token’s use cases are. The BLZ token is the Bluzelle ecosystem’s native cryptocurrency. The native token lives on the BLZ mainnet and this BLZ cryptocurrency is also known as L1-BLZ. On the other hand, the BLZ coin is also available on the Ethereum chain, following the ERC-20 token standard known as the ERC-BLZ token. However, the two instances of the Bluzelle token are interchangeable and have the same value denoted in USD. Of course, they serve different purposes. The above-presented dual-token system may be a bit confusing at first. However, this section will clarify things. The ERC-20 BLZ token is an external token, and its core purpose is to allow crypto users to access it easily via CEXs and DEXs. So, those interested in buying and trading BLZ need to focus on that particular Bluzelle token. As for the Bluzelle crypto token on the BLZ mainnet, it is a utility token. Hence, it can be used to pay for Bluzelle network transactions and to participate in the network as a validator. Since the Bluzelle crypto network uses a PoS (proof of stake) consensus mechanism, validators must stake their BLZ cryptocurrency stack. By doing so, they become eligible for the network rewards, which allows them to earn passive income. In addition, Bluzelle tokens may also be used to pay for Bluzelle storage and Bluzelle Oracle services and to participate in the BLZ mainnet network governance. By this point, you know there are two BLZ crypto assets – one on Ethereum and the other on Bluzelle. Since they are interchangeable, we’ll focus on the ERC-20 Bluzelle token as we move forward. After all, that is the one you can buy and trade using popular outlets. With that in mind, here are the core BLZ cryptocurrency’s tokenomics: As outlined above, the Bluzelle crypto asset went live in January 2018. However, the Bluzelle team announced the asset allocation details on the project’s blog and in their Telegram group in December 2017. According to that announcement, the token’s hard cap was $19.5 million, and this was the allocation of a total of 500,000,000 $BLZ: Since the BLZ coin has been around since 2018, it offers quite a lot of price data. So, we can start by looking at the asset’s complete price chart: A quick overview of the above chart tells us that the token started to trade at approximately $0.78 in February 2018. However, the price plummeted to $0.26-ish by April of that same year. From there, it managed to bounce back above the $0.7 level but then pulled back again. The 2019-2020 bear market hit the BLZ crypto token quite hard and brought its price down below one cent, reaching as low as $0.008 in March 2020. However, that low marked the beginning of a bull market. After that, the BLZ coin’s price started to recover. It went on several rallies; however, even its top of that cycle ($0.55-ish) didn’t manage to reach the asset’s 2018 price. After the spring of 2021, which marked the top of most of the altcoins for that cycle, $BLZ had another run. However, on that occasion (November 2021), the price didn’t get above $0.4. Then, as the entire crypto market, with Bitcoin leading the herd, pulled back, the price of BLZ again started to decline. The asset found its bottom in December 2022, at $0.05-ish. After a short-lived rally in early 2023, the price revisited the $0.05-ish level on two other occasions (June and August 2023). Following that last retest, the BLZ cryptocurrency started to recover. In less than one month, it doubled its value and even managed to break above the previous resistance at $0.12-ish. At the time of writing, the Bluzelle crypto asset is trading at $0.13-ish. The following image shows the BLZ price chart on a weekly timeframe, showing data from August 2020. Based on that chart, we can see that the bottom is highly likely in. So, the $0.05-ish level will most likely mark the bottom of this bear market: Multiple confluences confirm the above conclusion, including a breakout through the downsloping trendline and a bullish RSI divergence. Plus, the $BLZ price already printed a weekly close above the previous resistance at $0.11-ish. Still, the current region has served as both resistance and support in the past. Thus, some side movement above $0.11-ish is the most likely scenario in the upcoming days and weeks. In the above-covered price analysis, it’s clear that the BLZ price moves with the rest of the crypto market. Hence, if the crypto market as a whole manages to hold current levels, BLZ is likely to stay above $0.11-ish. However, in case of a further downside, the BLZ coin will probably revisit $0.08-ish and perhaps even the $0.05-ish level. On the other hand, if the crypto market as a whole starts to move to the upside, $BLZ is likely to go higher. In that case, the most likely price predictions will be the outlined levels of significance (blue horizontal lines) from the previous image. And, if the Bluzelle crypto token were to break above $0.8-ish, it would enter a price discovery mode. That scenario is likely to take place in the upcoming bull run. So, in that case, one of the optimistic price targets (offered by the “4.236” Fib extension level) points to $2.8-ish: However, for even more optimistic targets, one can compare BLZ’s market cap with the $AR and $FIL tokens’ all-time high (ATH) market caps. In that case, the $BLZ price could reach cross $6 or even $29. Just by being around since 2014, Bluzelle deserves a “good crypto” title. However, that doesn’t mean you should run off and buy it. After all, the token’s price didn’t perform “that good” in the last bull market either. Plus, the token’s allocation is quite poor, with the company and the founders holding a lot of BLZ tokens. Still, if, based on the above sections, you find $BLZ interesting, we encourage you to research the entire project and the BLZ asset further. Fortunately, there’s no better place to do that than the Moralis Money Bluzelle ($BLZ) token page. Aside from finding all the links and resources required to properly research BLZ, this page also offers the token’s real-time, on-chain metrics (a.k.a. alpha metrics). These invaluable insights will help you determine if now is a good time to buy $BLZ. With that said, make sure to follow the above “$BLZ” link or use the interactive widget below to research the Bluzelle crypto: There are many markets (including some of the most popular CEXs where you can buy $BLZ). However, if you believe in decentralization and want a user-friendly experience, then the Moralis Money instant crypto swap feature is your best bet. It is safe, simple to use, affordable, and right on the above-presented page: As for the how part of purchasing $BLZ, Moralis Money is highly intuitive.

Although both types have their pros and cons, wouldn\u0026#8217;t it be great if there was a platform combining the two, allowing traders to experience the power of both CEXs and DEXs within a single UI? Well, there is, thanks to RocketX Exchange! RocketX took a unique approach in developing its platform and RVF coin, and this approach is certainly making waves in the DeFi space! So, if you\u0026#8217;d like to learn more about this project, read on!","DETAILED_CONTENT":"If your primary concern revolves around making profits by trading the RVF coin, then you may want to jump straight into the “RVF Coin Price Analysis” section. However, if you are not yet familiar with this project and the RocketX Exchange platform, we encourage you to follow our lead from the top. We will start by exploring the RocketX crypto project. This is where we’ll covers the basics and ensure you all know what it is all about. We’ll also explain what the connections are between Rocket Vault and RocketX. Plus, for those of you interested in using the RocketX Exchange dapp, we’ll also offer some useful info on how to get going in that direction. Next, we’ll shift our focus to the RVF coin, starting by answering the question, “What is the RVF coin?” We’ll also look at the RVF’s tokenomics, distribution, and utility. With the basics of the RocketX crypto project and the RVF token under our belts, we’ll dive into the $RVF price analysis. After covering where the RVF crypto token’s value has been and currently is, we’ll also speculate on the token’s price predictions. Nonetheless, to help you answer the question, “Should I buy $RVF?” with confidence, we’ll introduce you to Moralis Money – the ultimate on-chain analysis tool. For those of you who may decide to get a bag of the RVF coin, we’ll also ensure you learn where to do that without breaking a sweat or the bank. Like with all crypto project explorations, we looked at RocketX Exchange’s official website, socials, vision paper, FAQ page, and more. As such, we can tell you that the RocketX crypto project means business. Plus, they already have a functioning cross-chain dapp up and running. The official name of the project is RocketX; however, since their core product is a special kind of exchange, “RocketX Exchange” is often used instead. This crypto project launched in 2021 under the Rocket Vault name. The project rebranded to RocketX later that same year. The project utilizes the same cryptocurrency, the RVF coin, which still goes by the original name. So, by “Rocket Vault,” users are referring to the RocketX crypto project or to its native token – the RVF crypto asset. The project’s About page provides a very nice overview of what RocketX is all about. It plans to be a one-stop shop for getting the best rates for on-chain and cross-chain swaps. But how is RocketX planning on accomplishing this? Well, they are following 1inch’s lead by creating a DEX aggregator that checks all available trading options for particular trading pair and finds the best (most affordable) path. However, their unique approach is that they do not stop at DEXs. Instead, RocketX Exchange considers CEXs as well. This hybrid approach enables the project to support a large number of crypto assets across many blockchain networks. It also gives RocketX users a chance to utilize the advantages of CEXs (such as lower gas fees) without actually having to become direct users of those exchanges. Plus, they’ve already created a neat UI where users get to connect their Web3 wallets (e.g., MetaMask), select the crypto assets they wish to trade (on the same chain or two different chains) and execute the trades. The image below outlines RocketX’s roadmap for 2023. Green check marks indicate milestones that the project has already achieved: As for the future plans, the project’s vision also promises the following products/features: As per the project’s vision paper, its goal is to create an intuitive one-stop exchange experience. Furthermore, there’s only one RocketX dapp, which already has a user-friendly interface. However, there are multiple components on the backend part of this dapp. And the project’s About page refers to these components as the RocketX ecosystem: You can read more about each of the ecosystem’s components in the image below: Another positive aspect of the RVF crypto project is the fact that its core team is doxxed. The project lead is Kiran Mannam, Davinder Singh takes the role of the CTO, and Prathap Simha is the project’s senior software architect. Plus, the Core Team section mentioned Ian Friend, a co-founder of Ferrum Network, as the project’s core advisor. You can find links to these people’s Twitter and LinkedIn accounts on the About page. As far as we’ve tried, using the RocketX Exchange dapp is really easy. First, you need to access the project’s dapp. You can do so by hitting the “Trade Now” button on the homepage or the “Launch App” button at the top of the About page. By doing so, you’ll land on the swap page: Once on the above page, you can already explore the dapp without connecting your Web3 wallet. You can click on the source network to select the chain supporting your entry asset (the cryptocurrency you plan to sell). And you can do the same for the destination asset. You must also select the exact two assets you wish to swap on each chain. Once you select the chains and the tokens you wish to swap, the platform will display all available options and will place the best one at the top. On the left side, under “you save,” you can see the details of your potential swap. If you decide to execute that swap, you just need to connect your wallet that supports the chains and tokens in question. The RVF coin is the RocketX Exchange project’s native cryptocurrency. The RVF token was minted on the Ethereum chain on April 8, 2021. Furthermore, it is a fungible cryptocurrency that follows the ERC-20 token standard. As the project grew and expanded across other networks, so did the RVF token. As such, you can now find $RVF on Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon. Here are the core aspects of the RVF crypto tokenomics: The following image shows the token’s initial distribution: Looking at the above image, you can see that token allocation was far from what is known as a “fair launch.” The asset’s price reflected that once it started to trade, which you’ll see below. Also, note that by September 13, 2022, all RVF crypto tokens have been released. However, it is worth pointing out that the team locked liquidity until December 31, 2024, and the team tokens are locked until December 31, 2023. So far, the main use case for the RVF coin comes in the form of platform fee discounts. As such, users holding specific amounts of RVF enjoy low platform fees. And, the more tokens users hold, the higher the discount they can expect. Let’s look at the RVF coin’s price action on a weekly chart: As you can see, the token started trading in mid-April 2021, when the crypto market as a whole reached its top. As such, the market’s reversal brought the price of RVF down with it. After spiking all above the $1 mark, the price of $RVF crumbled all the way down to $0.01884. That value marked the asset’s all-time low (ATL), which was set in mid-July 2021. The price rallied nearly 700% from that point, followed by a 75% correction. Then, it went on another 900% run but returned to the same levels in three weeks following that local high at $0.4-ish. Since the entire crypto market was in a bear market (that is slowly coming to an end), the price of $RVF stayed rather low. There were three attempts to break above the $0.17-ish level; however, that level turned out to be strong resistance. On the downside, the asset found strong support at $0.035ish. As such, it’s been ranging between these two levels for more than a year and a half. But on July 15, 2023, RVF finally broke out of that range and found new support at $0.27-ish. As you can see more clearly in the above daily chart, the token’s price is currently trying to break above the $0.4-ish level. Plus, as indicated by the two white lines, the chart is forming an ascending triangle, which is known as a continuation pattern. As such, unless the entire crypto market experiences some sort of correction, it is more likely than not for the RVF price to continue its uptrend movement. Overall, the most likely short-term price predictions for $RVF are obviously all the previous levels of importance (the blue lines on the above two charts). If the price crossed the $1 mark again, the asset would go into price discovery mode, which is highly likely to happen in the upcoming bull market. So, for that, we can use the Fibonacci retracement tool to predict the most optimistic target (the “4.236” extension). The latter points to $4.4-ish. While the RocketX Exchange project is relatively unique, it does have some similarities with the 1inch crypto project. So, to further speculate on the RVF coin price, we can use 1inch’s ATH market cap and divide it by RVF’s total supply. That approach returns $13.9-ish as a realistically achievable target in the next bull run. The information provided in the above section should be enough for you to decide if the RVF crypto project deserves further attention. However, to answer the above question with confidence, you ought to research the project and its token further. As such, make sure to visit Moralis Money’s Rocket Vault ($RVF) token page. There, you can find all the resources and tools you need to build a strong conviction on why you should or shouldn’t buy RVF. Plus, if you do decide to get your bag of $RVF, this page also offers alpha metrics for that token. These are real-time, on-chain metrics for the asset in question that will help you determine whether now’s the right time to buy or not. After all, on-chain activity always precedes price action! So, use the above link or the interactive widget below and decide if you wish to invest in $RVF. In case you decide to buy the RVF token, you have several options. For one, if you find the RocketX crypto dapp trustworthy, you can use the “BUY RVF” button on that page. You can also visit Uniswap, PancakeSwap, or any of the CEXs that offer $RVF trading pairs. However, there’s a much simpler and safer path. After all, since you’ll already be researching RVF using a dedicated Moralis Money token page, you can simply use the instant crypto swap feature that awaits you at the top. Note: If you are new to swapping cryptos, we recommend you check out our step-by-step guide on how to swap ERC-20 tokens. Keep in mind that $RVF is just one of many altcoin opportunities. And, since the average altcoin tends to increase in value by 50-70x during a bull run, now’s still a great time to find tokens before they pump. Fortunately, this is what Moralis Money’s core feature, Token Explorer, was created for! Not only will it help you spot the best altcoins to invest in, but it will also empower you to finally overcome crypto FOMO. And as a bonus, you will get to enjoy Moralis Money’s other features, including its volatility indicator, portfolio tracker, and much more. If you are serious about your altcoin investments, make sure to opt in for the Starter or Pro plans. They are the gateway to joining traders in the know that have been pocketing rather incredible gains from many meme coins (e.g., $BOBO) and other alts (e.g., $WOOF, $IQ, $PRIME, etc.).","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Matic Pirc","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Updated 10th August 2023 at 08:00"},{"LINK":"https://academy.moralis.io/blog/what-is-the-iq-crypto-and-is-the-iq-coin-a-good-investment","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Academy Moralis","IMAGE":"https://academy.moralis.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/What-is-the-IQ-Crypto-and-is-the-IQ-Coin-a-Good-Investment-768x471.png","TYPE":"Blog","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"What is the IQ Crypto, and is the IQ Coin a Good Investment?","INTRO":"The IQ crypto project, formerly known as Everipedia, aims to educate the world on blockchain technology. Via the IQ.wiki website, the project offers the largest blockchain and cryptocurrency encyclopedia, and it does so by ensuring the highest possible level of decentralization and transparency by utilizing blockchain tech itself. But is there a significant future for this project and its IQ coin? Also, is the IQ token a good investment? Read on as we address these and many other questions!","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Today’s article will help you get acquainted with the IQ crypto project and the IQ coin. We will start things off by covering the basics and answering what the IQ crypto project from IQ.wiki is all about. As such, we will cover the project’s fundamentals, roadmap, and community. Before focusing on the IQ token, we will also try and answer what the future of IQ.wiki may look like. Then, we’ll explain what the IQ coin is, what its tokenomics look like, and what its use cases are. In turn, you’ll be ready to follow our IQ token price analysis and speculate on the asset’s future price with our IQ price prediction. All in all, the information provided throughout the following sections will help you determine whether or not IQ crypto is a good investment. Furthermore, to help you determine that with even higher confidence, you’ll want to utilize the power of Moralis Money. This is also the tool to find and explore other altcoin opportunities cross-chain. The IQ crypto project from IQ.wiki is on a mission to educate the world on blockchain technology. It aims to fulfill this mission by using blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI). By combining the power of these two innovative technological solutions, the former Everipedia crypto project aims to scale crypto knowledge. As you may know, the crypto sphere is evolving quickly, and new projects are entering the scene daily. Hence, it is quite impressive to see a project that has its roots back in 2014 still around. It was in that year that Sam Kazemain and Theodor Forselius founded Everipedia in their UCLA dorm room. They soon joined forces with Travis Moore, who was the company’s first CTO and is now considered one of the three founders. You can also see that the Everipedia crypto project has been around since 2014 by looking at the project’s X (formerly Twitter) profile: Here’s a quick overview of the core Everipedia crypto project’s milestones: Whenever you are getting acquainted with a crypto project, you want to take a closer look at its fundamentals. This is known as the fundamental analysis (FA), and there are various methods on how to do it. However, it typically starts by taking a closer look at the project’s official website, documentation, whitepaper, socials, team, etc. So, when done properly and in-depth, FA is a rather lengthy process that exceeds the scope of this article. Still, you can think of this article as a sort of FA overview. Above, you already learned about the project’s path and that it has been around for a while now. That is typically a very positive sign. The former Everipedia crypto project is also tackling the actual problem of people not being properly informed about blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Plus, it aims to do so by utilizing this new tech itself. For instance, the project has its own cryptocurrency (more on the IQ coin below), decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) BrainDAO, uses IPFS to store data and images, runs on the Polygon blockchain, and more. In addition, as of 2023, the project started integration and utilizing the power of AI, which gives it an additional edge. While IQ.wiki has democratic governance, it also has a fully doxxed team: You can visit the “Meet our team” section on the About page and read more about each core team member. For instance, the above screenshot shows the three Everipedia founders. We weren’t able to find any roadmap for this blockchain encyclopedia project. However, it is worth pointing out that roadmaps are mainly applicable for projects that are just launching and haven’t delivered anything tangible yet. And that is definitely not the case with former Everipedia. After all, the IQ crypto project is up and running. It already offers thousands of crypto articles, has an active DAO, a crypto token with an actual use case, and is actively looking for new ways to add more value and improve the IQ ecosystem. With that in mind, we recommend you visit the project’s official page and explore the IQ ecosystem, including the crypto wikis (t.i., the IQ articles). For instance, you can use the search bar to find wikis, explore the latest topics, take a look at “Wiki Rank” by market cap, or use the top menu options to explore other options. And if you want to edit or create wikis, make sure to check out “IQ Learn” and the project’s FAQ page. Since the project has been around for several years, it also has a rather large community. So, there are many ways to get involved with the “IQ” folks. For instance, you can follow the above-presented project’s Twitter account, join their Discord and Telegram groups, follow them on Instagram, engage in the Everipedia subreddit, and more. However, if you are serious about joining the IQ community, you ought to consider joining BrainDAO. The project invites everyone to join its mission to expand the scope of human knowledge via its governing DAO, which powers the IQ ecosystem. As pointed out above, there’s no roadmap leading forward. Plus, there are no active votes (at the time of writing) on the IQ voting page of the BrainDAO dashboard. Therefore, it’s hard to say what the exact plans are for the IQ crypto project in the future. However, there are some comments from the project regarding “HiIQ Brain Pass NFTs.” These NFTs are supposed to be assigned to those who stake the IQ coin. Plus, users will be able to buy these NFTs with IQ tokens. However, given the 2022 rebranding and transition to the Polygon blockchain, it’s safe to say the project is alive and kicking. So, we can expect the number of quality wiki pages to continue to increase. It’s also safe to expect additional incentives to be offered for IQ community members as well as content contributors. Plus, new crypto and AI tech integration by the IQ project in the future are also highly likely. The IQ coin is the native cryptocurrency of the IQ crypto project. The token went live back in 2018 on the EOS blockchain, where it served the Everipedia crypto as a utility and governance token. However, back in 2021, the IQ token was also launched on the Ethereum chain (as an ERC-20 token), where it could be transferred via the EOS-ETH bridge. The IQ bridge is available within the BrainDAO dashboard: You can also find $IQ on BNB Chain and Polygon. With that in mind, it is clear that the IQ token is a cross-chain cryptocurrency, and it is at the heart of this former Everipedia crypto project. When it comes to $IQ’s tokenomics, we need to consider the IQIP-14 proposal. The latter took place in October 2022 and proposed new tokenomics for the IQ coin. It successfully passed. Following the IQIP-14 suggestions, devs put in place new mechanisms that made $IQ behave more like Bitcoin. For instance, the update included a “halving” model and a new maximum supply capped at 21 billion IQ tokens. Here’s the gist of IQ’s tokenomics: The IQ crypto project categorizes the IQ coin as a DeFi and governance token. The former comes to play via IQ staking, known as HiIQ. As such, $IQ stakers earn a yield on the platform’s native token, which qualifies it as a DeFi token. Plus, by staking this native token, users also get their governance rights, which classifies $IQ as a governance token. It’s also worth pointing out that the token is managed by BrainDAO. After all, the latter holds a treasury of various digital assets, including IQ tokens. Nonetheless, tokens also incentivize contributions to the IQ.wiki encyclopedia. Plus, BrainDAO has the power to use the IQ token rewards to incentivize the testing and development of artificial intelligence and other new integrations of the platform and the entire IQ ecosystem. Due to the cross-chain nature of $IQ and a relatively long history, there are many charts out there that do paint the entire picture. As such, it’s best to use CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko to look at the IQ price: By doing so, we can see the entire IQ price data on a single chart. Of course, covering five years’ worth of price action on a single chart is not good for detailed analysis; however, it is great for a proper overview. So, by looking at the above chart, we can immediately get the big picture. For instance, it’s clear that after reaching as high as $0.076-ish (ATH) on July 16, 2018, which was shortly after the token’s launch, $IQ has never reached those levels again. Of course, the price action of the token also corresponds to the entire crypto market’s cycles. The bear market that started in 2018 hit $IQ quite hard. So, on March 13, 2020, the token hit its all-time low (ATL) price of $0.0006241. However, the project managed to survive, and the price of the token increased in value during the bull run that followed. The token reached a new local high at $0.035-ish in the spring of 2021, when trends again shifted to the downside for most alts. As we are still in the ending phase of that bear season, the price of the IQ coin remains significantly lower than its ATH. However, at $0.0052-ish, the price of $IQ sits about 80% above this season’s low. First, you need to keep in mind that, like all crypto predictions, any IQ price prediction is highly speculative. However, since the project had a successful rebranding and transitioned to a popular chain like Polygon, the future for the IQ crypto project and its native token looks quite optimistic. Hence, it’s highly likely for the token to revisit some of its previous levels of importance above the current price as the upcoming bull market takes off. As such, these are the IQ price prediction levels that are most likely to take place as the bull market evolves: And if the token manages to break above the highest level of the previous bull run ($0.035-ish), it will have a good chance of reaching its ATH levels (up to $0.076-ish). However, keep in mind that the IQ’s circulating supply is changing, so this makes further complicates any reliable IQ price prediction attempts. Still, it is not impossible for $IQ to go past its ATH. Let us start by pointing out that we are not financial advisors. As such, we are not in a position to do more than provide you with information about the IQ project. And we did that in the above sections. So, use that info to determine if you like the project and if you feel it has more upside potential. Also, do not let the above speculative IQ price prediction cloud your judgment. We encourage you to research the project and its token further. And the best tool to do that is Moralis Money’s Everipedia IQ ($IQ) token page. On that page, you will find all you need to build up your conviction regarding IQ, which will help you determine if you should buy this token or not. What’s more, on that page, you can find IQ’s real-time, on-chain metrics (alpha metrics). They will also help you get the timing right if you decide to get your bag of $IQ. How? Well, on-chain activity always precedes price action. So, by looking at these metrics, you get to front-run the token’s next rally. Of course, you could find additional motivation to invest in this project by considering staking IQ. In that case, it is even more important to properly research this former Everipedia crypto project. With that said, follow the above link to its token page or use the interactive widget below to determine if $IQ is a good investment or not. Since $IQ has been around for a long time and lives across multiple chains, you can find many places to buy it. However, many of these options come with some risks and are often not user-friendly. But there is a safe, practical, and cost-efficient way to swap ETH or any other ERC-20 token for $IQ. The latter comes in the form of the swap feature that awaits you on Moralis Money’s page dedicated to IQ: Whether you decide to buy the IQ coin or not, you need to keep in mind that the average altcoin tends to increase in value by 50-70x during a bull run. As such, you ought to explore other altcoin opportunities. This is where Moralis Money’s core features enter the scene. This tool utilizes real-time, on-chain insights to help you find up-and-coming crypto opportunities. And there are many ways to do that. For instance, you can focus on high-volatility crypto assets.

Full SDEX Coin Analysis","INTRO":"DeFi (decentralized finance) is still one of the most significant use cases of blockchain technology, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) remain at the forefront of this crypto category. But although decentralized exchanges are good and all, they are far from perfect. One of the common issues these DEXs face is impermanent losses (ILs). However, the SmarDex crypto project claims to have successfully solved that issue. That being the case, plus its sudden increase in popularity \u0026#8211; as seen when looking at the project\u0026#8217;s on-chain data \u0026#8211; made us want to look closer at this project and its native token: the SDEX coin! So, if you want to know more about this project and if the SmarDex crypto coin is worth investing in, follow along in our full SDEX coin analysis!","DETAILED_CONTENT":"As we dive into the core topic of today’s “SDEX crypto” article, we’ll first make sure you know what the SmarDex crypto project is all about. This is where we’ll closely examine the project’s fundamentals, roadmap, platform, and use cases. Then, we’ll focus our attention on the SDEX coin. We’ll explain what the SDEX token is all about and take a look at its tokenomics. However, since most of you want to know whether or not you should buy the SmarDex token, we’ll also analyze the SDEX price. As such, you’ll get to learn what price levels the SDEX coin already covered and what the most significant levels of support and resistance are. Plus, using the Fibonacci retracement tool and comparing SmarDex with the leading DeFi projects, we’ll also offer some SDEX price predictions for the upcoming bull run. Nonetheless, you’ll also learn about Moralis Money and how it can help you decide if and when you should buy the SDEX crypto asset. We’ll also answer where and how to buy $SDEX. SmarDex is a new DEX that launched in the spring of 2023. It primarily caters to liquidity providers as it introduces a fine-tuned algorithm to eliminate impermanent loss (IL). In fact, in many instances, this enhanced DEX algorithm even introduces impermanent gain (IG). Of course, this new decentralized exchange’s track record can’t compare with the leading DEXs, such as Uniswap. However, the SmarDex crypto team created a simulation that compares IL for Uniswap’s algorithm and SmarDex’s fine-tuned one. This is the chart that presents the results in relationship to the ETH price from 2018 up to 2023: You can explore the above chart more closely on the project’s official website (smardex.io). There, you can also find the “Simulate the algorithm now” button, which allows you to compare the performance of SmarDex against the other competitive DEXs. When exploring the above chart, keep in mind that the negative percentages represent IL, while the positive percentages represent IG. So, the larger the negative value, the larger IL, and the larger the positive value, the larger IG. Moreover, if the above simulation is legit, it is clear that SmarDex outperforms Uniswap and offers a rather significant IG. Why is that so important? Well, on the one hand, this offers liquidity providers more profits and, therefore, also incentives them to use their crypto funds with SmarDex. On the other hand, it also enables SmarDex to offer lower fees and, in turn, attract more traders. So, whether you are a trader or a liquidity provider, you can already use the SmarDex crypto platform. There are many ways to access it; however, the most legit path to do so is by hitting the “Launch App” button on the project’s official website. As a crypto investor, you must familiarize yourself with fundamental analysis (FA). This is where you look closely at the project’s website, whitepaper, team, VCs, tokenomics, and more. Essentially, your goal is to dive deep and determine if the project is sound and if it is solving any actual problems. A detailed FA of the SDEX crypto project exceeds the scope of this article. However, we will provide you with a decent overview. The latter should suffice for those of you who’ll decide to trade the SDEX coin. However, if you plan on providing liquidity on SmarDex, or using its staking and farming features, we highly recommend you dive deeper. Part of the fundamentals have already been covered above. As such, you already know that the SmarDex crypto is a project that aims to offer a DEX that not only overcomes impermanent loss but even provides impermanent gains. By the way, IL occurs when one of the asset pairs in the liquidity pool increases compared to the other one. If a liquidity provider is to collect their assets in such a case, the profits would be lower than if the liquidity provider were to hold the asset in their wallet. Note: We encourage you to read SmarDex’s whitepaper. It properly describes the SmarDex technology and also includes a nice example that will help you grasp the concept of IL. The gist of SmarDex is its protocol, which uses the traditional DEX model. The latter uses the constant product (k), which the SmarDex protocol modifies. As a result, the protocol automatically adjusts the balance of the reserve and, in turn, always ensures the best possible swap. These automated adjustments make the protocol smart; hence, “Smart + DEX \u003d SmarDex.” After scavenging through the project’s website, documentation, and whitepaper, we couldn’t find any official roadmap. However, at the time of writing, the project already offers an active DEX app where users can swap tokens, provide liquidity, use the farming feature, and stake the SDEX token. Nonetheless, we did manage to find some graphic roadmaps that were most likely used for promotional purposes. This is the one outlining major milestones for 2023: Here’s the one that is all about hyping the SmarDex project: As pointed out above, the SmarDex platform is already live. So, anyone with a Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) can start interacting with it. To access the platform, you can use the aforementioned “Launch App” button or simply select “Swap,” “Liquidity,” “Farming,” or “Staking” from the top menu of the project’s official website. The platform seems to be user-friendly and is running smoothly, as per our quick check. However, please note that we haven’t performed any of the on-chain transactions required to execute any of the above-outlined core features of SmarDex. We will focus on the SDEX coin and its utility in one of the following sections, but as for the SmarDex platform, its obvious use case is that it serves as a decentralized exchange. As such, it offers a P2P, decentralized tool to trade cryptocurrencies. Of course, in order for there to be sufficient liquidity for traders to actually use this DEX, there need to be committed liquidity providers. And the core use case of SmarDex is the fact that via its fine-tuned algorithm, the DEX offers better incentives for its liquidity providers. We like the fact that the team behind the project – which by the way, is doxxed – open-sourced their algorithm. This invites other existing and upcoming DEXs to explore and implement better conditions for liquidity providers as well as traders. All in all, these are some of the highlights of our quick SDEX crypto FA: The SDEX coin is the SmarDex crypto project’s native token that was minted on March 9, 2023. Furthermore, it is an ERC-20 cryptocurrency, which means it lives on the Ethereum chain and follows the most common standard for fungible tokens. However, it’s worth pointing out that SmartDex supports multiple chains, so you can also find the SDEX token on BNB Chain, Polygon, and Arbitrum. As the above roadmap suggests, the team plans to create SDEX DAO. So, it’s safe to presume that the SDEX coin will serve as a governance token at that point. However, the SDEX token already has a use case. After all, SDEX crypto holders can use the above-presented SmarDex platform to stake this cryptocurrency. By doing so, they are able to earn passive income from farming rewards and protocol fees. The SmarDex token has a capped supply of ten billion $SDEX. Moreover, the token was allocated into three liquidity-providing pillars: Note: You can find more details regarding the long-term and boost period farming in the SDEX crypto documentation. So, there are no locked SDEX tokens and no team allocation. Essentially, everyone who wants to get a bag of the SDEX coin needs to buy it. There are various platforms where you can monitor the SDEX price chart. However, since the token initially started trading on SmarDex, which was at the time just getting started, most charts do not include the SmarDex token’s entire price action. Still, we managed to find a line chart on CoinGecko that covers the majority of the SDEX price path. So, after listing at approximately $0.002, the token went on a noticeable rally. The latter ended on April 5, 2023, with the SmarDex token reaching nearly $0.006. After that local high, the price underwent a 42-day-long correction. But the SDEX price found support at $0.0027-ish and bounced from that level back into the $0.005-ish region. $SDEX stayed in that region until the end of June 2023, when it finally broke to the upside. Since then and until July 24, 2023, the SDEX crypto has been in a clear uptrend. And, on that day, the SDEX coin marked its current all-time high (ATH), which sits at $0.0124-ish. Following its ATH, the SmarDex token pulled back roughly 25% and is currently trading just below $0.01. When it comes to short-term SDEX price prediction, you can look at the above daily chart. The latter marks all the most important levels of support and resistance for the SDEX crypto. However, by the looks of the chart, a reduced volume during the ongoing pullback, the region between $0.00889 and $0.00928, is rather likely to hold. Of course, presuming that the entire crypto market doesn’t experience any major corrections. So, if those levels were to hold, the price of $SDEX could make a move toward a new ATH. As such, we can use the Fibonacci retracement tool to determine some of the most likely levels in the price discovery region. The most optimistic level (the “4.236” extension) points to $0.022-ish. As for the long-term SDEX price prediction that could occur during the top of the upcoming bull run (2024-2025), we need to take a more speculative approach. So, let’s say that the SDEX crypto’s protocol continues to work properly and ends up attracting liquidity providers. If that were to happen, the SDEX coin would most likely end up benefiting as well. Furthermore, we can say that it could potentially reach the same market cap levels as some of the leading DEX native tokens in the past, such as UNI, SUSHI, and CAKE. Thus, we can take the ATH market cap levels of those tokens and divide them by SDEX crypto’s total token supply. This gives us the following price predictions: If you read the introduction of today’s article carefully, you might have noticed that we already hinted that it’s up to you to answer the above question. After all, we are not financial advisors. Plus, we are not familiar with your financial situation and your risk tolerance. So, use the above-provided information about the SDEX crypto project and the SDEX coin to determine if you are interested in this altcoin. If not, then you should start finding other altcoin opportunities right away. And, there’s no better tool to find up-and-coming crypto tokens than the Moralis Money core feature: Token Explorer. On the other hand, if $SDEX caught your attention, you ought to research this alt further. In that case, you’ll want to visit Moralis Money’s SmarDex ($SDEX) token page. These types of token pages offer you all the links, tools, and resources you need to decide whether a token is a worthy investment. Plus, if you decide that you should buy $SDEX, this page will also help you get your timing right. How? Well, near the top of the page, you can find so-called alpha metrics. These are the token’s real-time, on-chain metrics that tell you whether the coin is gaining or losing on-chain momentum. And, since on-chain activity always precedes price action, these insights allow you to enter your position at an appropriate time. So, visit the above link or use the interactive widget below and determine if and when you should buy the SmarDex token. There are several paths you can take to buy SmarDex. The three best ones include the SmarDex platform’s swap, Uniswap, and the Moralis Money instant crypto swap feature. And, since you will already be on the above-outlined page, it is by far the safest and most practical option to use the Moralis Money swap. This option is not only safe and practical, but thanks to the power of the 1inch aggregator, it also ensures you get the best available price. In fact, these advantages make Moralis Money’s token pages one of the best Ethereum swap sites. In case you are new to swapping cryptos, you may want to check out our step-by-step guide on how to swap ERC-20 tokens. It will help you prepare all you need to get going. It will also guide you through every step along the way.

Full POP Coin Price Analysis","INTRO":"On July 8, 2023, a new token \u0026#8211; POP coin \u0026#8211; entered the meme coin landscape. At first glance, $POP seems to be just another meme coin; however, if you take a closer look at the project, you’ll see that it aims to become a lot more. After all, it already has its own L1 mainnet live! So, we believe now’s a good time to learn what Proof of Pepe is and determine whether you should get a bag of the POP token or not.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"We have been spotting the POP coin with different Token Explorer strategies (like the one in the above image) for a while now. With some cooldown periods, Proof of Pepe has now started to gain some on-chain momentum, which we can see being reflected in the POP token’s price. And since the POP crypto coin is in its early stage, now’s a good time to explore it! So, moving forward, we’ll first explain what the Proof of Pepe crypto project is. We’ll do this by exploring the project’s official website, its X (former Twitter) account, and whitepaper. Next, we’ll focus on the POP coin. Again, we’ll first explain what $POP is. Then, we’ll look at the token’s tokenomics and analyze its price action. This is where we’ll also speculate on some price predictions for this crypto. Lastly, we’ll explain how Moralis Money helps you determine if POP deserves your further attention and when to buy/sell it. The Proof of Pepe crypto project is all about meme coins. It aims to become a designated decentralized network for meme coins, particularly catering to the PEPE community. It’s important to point out that this project started by launching the POP coin on July 8, 2020. Judging by the way things are headed, this was mainly to gain some recognition. We’ll discuss the POP token further later on. After all, the project’s plans, as stated on its official website and in the Proof of Pepe whitepaper, were always bigger. The project intended to create a new layer-1 (L1) blockchain network all along. And according to the current pinned tweet on the project’s X account, they’ve already reached the first phase of that milestone: And, using the above-outlined details, anyone can add the POP network to MetaMask: According to the above-outlined tweet and the project’s chain explorer – “pepescan.app” – the mainnet went live on July 27, 2023. So, what is the POP mainnet? According to the project’s whitepaper, the POP mainnet is a new Ethereum-like L1 blockchain. Plus, users can use the PEPE token to cover the gas fees. Unfortunately, the whitepaper doesn’t provide any technical details. However, it does point out that this new network uses a unique consensus mechanism called “Proof of Pepe” (PoP). The latter is allegedly the key that makes the POP L1 fast, secure, and cost-efficient. If all this is actually true, then according to the well-known blockchain trilemma, the network must not be properly decentralized. Unless the devs of this memetic project have cracked the code (which is highly unlikely). With that in mind, make sure to be extra cautious interacting with this network. You should also take the project’s claims with a grain of salt. Note: If you are new to blockchain technology, we recommend checking out the project’s whitepaper. The latter actually rather neatly explains what L1 networks are. It also covers the two most commonly used consensus mechanisms – PoS and PoW. According to the project’s mission, the POP crypto network aims to become the go-to hub for memes. The team’s goal is to provide a dedicated platform and blockchain where anyone can create, share, and engage with memes and do so in a seamless and decentralized manner. At the forefront of this hub is supposed to be a user-friendly meme-creation platform. Note that this platform doesn’t exist yet. In addition, as per the announcement of the project’s dev (@QuadaBullHours), the network will launch the PEPErium DEX. If you’ve been around the crypto block for a while, you know that often seemingly impossible things end up happening. You must have also noticed that there have been tens of thousands of projects making wild claims and not delivering on them as well. Thus, only time will tell if the PoP consensus is really as good as the project’s whitepaper claims. However, we probably agree that the performance of the PEPE token and the adoption it received in a relatively short time surprised most of us. So, by targeting Pepe’s strong and large community, the project has an increased potential for success. Of course, presuming that the team behind it can deliver. Speaking of the POP team, aside from the aforementioned dev’s Twitter handle, there are no details about the creators behind the project. Like most meme coins, the project claims to be in the hands of the community. If you like exploring new blockchains, feel free to use the above-outlined details to add the network to your MetaMask. Then, you can use the POP mainnet bridge to transfer over some $PEPE from Ethereum: On the other hand, you might just be interested in making a profitable trade on the POP coin. In that case, the following sections will be your cup of tea. POP stands for “Proof of Pepe,” which is both the name of the above-presented crypto project and the project’s cryptocurrency. Aside from being the abbreviation of the token’s name, “POP” ($POP) is also its ticker or symbol. Until POP gets a clear use case, it falls under the category of meme coins. So, it is a meme coin that lives on the Ethereum chain, where it follows the ERC-20 token standard. Here are the details that will help you further grasp the gist of the POP coin: Typically, L1 blockchains (e.g., Ethereum) use native coins (e.g., ETH) to power transactions. However, in the case of the POP network, the creators decided to give that utility to the PEPE token. Plus, the POP coin was created on the Ethereum chain before the network went live. By using Etherscan, we can see that the on-chain transaction that was responsible for minting the POP token took place on July 8, 2023: Still, the project’s whitepaper presents the POP coin as the PoP network’s native cryptocurrency. As such, it is not clear whether $POP will also be able to be used to cover gas fees on that chain. Perhaps, we can expect $POP to serve governance purposes, allowing the POP crypto community to propose and vote on the direction the ecosystem ought to take. So, at this point, we can only say that users will be able to explore the POP ecosystem using $PEPE and $POP: It is also not clear yet how the existing POP token that lives on the Ethereum chain will be transitioned to the POP chain. After all, the aforementioned bridge only focuses on the PEPE token. Whether you wish to get a bag of $POP because you really believe in the project or because you feel it can be a good short-term trade, you need to consider the token’s price. As such, let us look at the price trail of the POP coin on a four-hour chart: The top line of the above image indicates the token’s lowest and highest price points so far. The asset’s all-time low (ATL), which was also the POP token’s listing price, sits at $0.000004688. And the current all-time high (ATH) price equals $0.006349. Even just a quick glance at the above chart clearly tells you that the token’s value has been on the rise since the listing. And, by comparing the ATL and ATH values, you can see that the POP crypto increased in value by more than 1354x. However, if you take a closer look at the above four-hour chart, you can see a significant pullback on the POP coin’s path. The major retracement (more than 90%) took place after the initial pump, where the token found support in the $0.00016-$0.00017 region. It took a lot of courage to buy the POP coin after such a pullback; however, many Moralis Money users were brave enough. After all, the on-chain momentum that was behind the initial price spike made them believe that the project had solid potential. Those who entered the aforementioned region are now sitting on impressive profits, more than 3600%, to be more specific. Of course, the journey to the current levels ($0.006-ish) had two additional corrections. On the one hand, those pullbacks tested the conviction of buyers. But on the other hand, they offered additional opportunities to get a bag of the POP coin at a discount. Let’s start by pointing out that any meme coin price predictions are pure speculation, especially with new coins like the POP token. That said, we have some tools we can use to mark certain prices as “more likely.” For instance, charting important levels (as in the above image) is one of the valid TA methods. However, all the current “significant” levels are below the current price. As such, they can come to play if the token loses momentum. In that case, any of those price levels are potential price predictions. In case of another pullback, the most likely level is the one at $0.0035-ish, as it marks the previous local top. How about price targets to the upside? For that purpose, we can use the Fibonacci retracement tool. According to the last local top and the following local low, the most optimistic level (the “4.236” extension) points to $0.012-ish. We’d say that this price target is definitely within POP’s reach. As far as the more “exotic” predictions go, we can compare POP to some of the leading meme coin or even DeFi projects. Since the POP crypto is shaping to be a sort of mixture between a meme coin and a DeFi token, it also makes sense to compare it with, for example, Volt Inu. So, let us take these project’s ATH market caps and divide them by the POP coin’s total supply: Since we are not financial advisors, we cannot answer the above question. However, using the details obtained throughout the above section, you should already be able to determine whether or not POP deserves your attention. If yes, you should still DYOR (do your own research). Plus, if you conclude that you want to get a bag of $POP, you should make sure to get your timing right! Fortunately, you can cover both of these steps (researching and timing) in one place. Namely, on the Moralis Money’s Proof of Pepe ($POP) token page. This page provides all the tools and links you need to properly research the token and the project behind it. Thanks to the real-time, on-chain metrics for the POP coin, you’ll be able to determine whether or not now’s the right time to buy. After all, on-chain activity always precedes price action! So, by using insights into the on-chain momentum, you can time your entries and exits a lot more effectively. That said, make sure to use the link above or the interactive widget below and do your thing. If you determine that now’s the right time to buy $POP, use the swap feature that you can find on the same page. The latter prioritizes safety, price efficiency, and user-friendliness, which makes Moralis Money token pages one of the best Ethereum swap sites out there. Note: If you are new to swapping alts, use our step-by-step guide that will show you how to swap ERC-20 tokens. Last but not least, we ought to mention the core Moralis Money feature: Token Explorer. The latter enables you to spot the best altcoin opportunities at any given moment. All it takes is for you to apply various combinations of simple filters. This is how Moralis Money users, especially the ones on the Starter and Pro plan, have been making life-changing gains. With the Token Explorer feature, they get to find up-and-coming crypto as well as spot increasing momentum in existing projects! Some of the latest assets that Moralis Money users were spotting include the MNT coin, MOG, HAMS, ARKM, Sam Altman’s WLD, and many others. So, whether you decide to buy POP or not, you need to keep in mind that there are many other altcoins that you should consider. Especially now that the next bull market is getting ready to take off. After all, the average altcoin tends to increase by 50-70x during the bull run!

Backed by Bybit via BitDAO, Mantle Network and its MNT token are now considered one of the serious players in the scaling-solution race. Of course, only time will tell what the future looks like for the Mantle crypto project. Meanwhile, it’s worth getting acquainted with the project and determining if money can be made on the MNT coin, which is exactly what this article will help you with!","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Moving forward, we will first explain what the Mantle crypto project is. As such, you will learn the gist of Mantle Network, what makes it unique, and who is backing this project. We will even take a closer look at the network’s architecture and the project’s roadmap. Next, we will shift our focus to the MNT coin and explain what the token is all about, analyze its tokenomics structure, and what role it plays in the Mantle Network ecosystem. Once we ensure that you’re all caught up with the basics of this new layer-2 scaling solution, we will dive into the MNT token’s price. As such, we’ll properly analyze the available data regarding $MNT’s price action. Plus, using TA tools and comparing Mantle with other popular scaling solutions, we’ll speculate on the token’s price. We’ll also address the question, “Should you buy the Mantle crypto coin?” For those of you shouting a resounding “Yes!” we’ll even direct you to the best place to buy $MNT. Plus, as a bonus, you’ll learn how to move beyond MNT or any single altcoin. With Moralis Money, you’ll get to start seeing the big picture of the altcoin investing/trading game! Mantle Network is a new Ethereum layer-2 (L2) scaling solution. It is an EVM-compatible execution blockchain network that utilizes Ethereum to cover three key functions. For those of you who are new to scaling solutions, it’s worth mentioning that many projects are trying to solve the scalability challenge. After all, scalability is one of the three core aspects of the famous blockchain trilemma. While there are still new layer-1 networks aiming to become better than Ethereum, scaling on top of Ethereum seems more promising. Scaling solutions are also known as “modular blockchains.” So, unlike monolithic ones (e.g., Ethereum), which cover all four key functions – execution, settlement, consensus, and data availability – modular chains typically focus on one of the four core functions. And most often, they cover execution and rely on monolithic chains to cover the rest. As you can imagine, the network wasn’t built overnight. In fact, the Mantle testnet has been running successfully for more than six months before the mainnet launch on July 17, 2023. Mantle Network is the core of the Mantle ecosystem, and the entire Mantle project is possible thanks to BitDAO – the Bybit-backed initiative to support blockchain development. Take a moment and look at the above image – it will give you a decent overview of the Mantle crypto ecosystem. As you can see, the Ethereum blockchain is the foundation upon which Mantle Network is built. The latter uses a popular L2 scaling solution known as optimistic rollups. However, Mantle has its own unique twist that includes an innovative data availability (DA) solution powered by EigenDA technology. Note: EigenLayer is a re-staking protocol that enables any rollup-based L2 to guarantee data availability by leveraging Ethereum’s trust. Since Mantle Network is EVM compatible, it is able to support the same smart contracts and dapps as Ethereum. However, it does so at a faster throughput. Mantle LSD (liquid staking derivative) is not yet live (at the time of writing), but it will offer those who stake on Ethereum to re-stake their staked ETH. The ecosystem is also anticipating many other projects as it expands and gains adoption. As for the Mantle governance and treasury, they are essentially transitioning from BitDAO. After all, ever since the launch of the Mantle mainnet, BIT (BitDAO’s native token) holders can migrate this asset into the MNT coin in a one-to-one ratio. Additionally, as you can see in the above image, the MNT token makes the entire ecosystem fluid. The following schematic should help you further solidify your understanding of Mantle’s architecture: Note: In case you find it challenging to understand the above diagram, visit Mantle’s documentation for a detailed explanation. As far as the Mantle’s roadmap goes, there are no clear dates or milestones to be found on the project’s official website or docs. The MNT coin is Mantle Network’s native cryptocurrency, and MNT ($MNT) is the token’s symbol/ticker. Furthermore, it is an ERC-20 token that was minted on the Ethereum chain on June 20, 2023. That transaction created a total of 10,000,000,000 MNT tokens. A decent portion of the amount mentioned above of the MNT coin has already been burned. As such, the current total supply sits at 6,219,316,794.99, according to Etherscan: Aside from the token’s current total supply, here are other important aspects: The MNT coin has a dual role. On the one hand, it serves as the native currency of the Mantle blockchain and, in turn, powers transactions. So, whenever any user executes a transaction on the Mantle mainnet, its $MNT is used to execute it – to cover gas fees. On the other hand, the MNT coin also serves as the ticket to the governance voting power. Each $MNT carries an equal vote weight. With it, holders get to actively participate in DAO voting and influence the decision-making process. In that aspect, the token is taking over $BIT’s function. Note: If you hold $BIT, make sure to visit Mantle’s official instructions on how to convert it into $MNT. If your $BIT is on centralized exchanges, the conversion will be automatic in most cases. Aside from this primary utility and use cases of MNT, the token can serve as a collateral asset for the Mantle mainnet nodes. In that case, it serves to additionally incentivize participation and contribution to the security and stability of the network. Of course, the coin can also be used to transfer value and for speculative trading, which brings us to the Mantle crypto price analysis! The MNT coin started to trade on July 17, 2023. As such, it doesn’t offer a lot of price data. However, since the token is, in a way, taking BIT’s place – the latter is migrated in the one-to-one ratio – we can use $BIT’s data for additional insight. If we look at the above hourly chart showing the MNT coin’s price action, we can see that the price hasn’t changed all that much. The listing price was $0.04733, which increased by roughly 25% in the first two days. However, after touching the $0.6 price mark on several occasions, the price decreased slightly. At the time of writing, $MNT retests the $0.51-$52 region previously served as resistance. As such, it now has the potential to turn into support. Since the above chart doesn’t tell us much, let’s look at $BIT’s weekly price action: In the chart above, we’ve marked all major levels BIT reached in the past. These levels act as support/resistance. We can also see that it is highly likely that BIT’s price reached the bottom at the end of 2022 at the $0.27-ish level. Following that low, the price doubled and has been ranging, more or less, sideways since January 2023. Currently, $0.42-ish acts as a rather important support level. So, unless there is some bad news for Mantle or we see a crypto market correction, we can expect this level to hold for the MNT coin’s price as well. There are a couple of levels in between; however, the next important price region to consider is the one between $0.6-$0.64. If $MNT manages to break above $0.64 and the crypto market embarks upon a bull run, we could see the token reach other higher levels. Eventually, it could reach BIT’s ATH, which sits at $3.0814. To speculate on the next potential ATH price (if/when the above gets broken), we can use the Fibonacci retracement tool. The tool’s most optimistic level (the “4.236” extension level) points to $12.17. Additionally, we can look at the two other leading L2 projects and their tokens’ prices: ARB and OP. However, we can see that both of these tokens’ market caps already sit below Mantle’s. Plus, both ARB and OP went live in the bear market, so their ATHs in market caps can’t really serve as a reference to what is possible for the Mantle crypto. All in all, it is possible that L2 tokens will be one of the focal points of the upcoming bull run. In that case, the price of the MNT coin could go even beyond the above-outlined speculative prices. Still, it is rather difficult to predict how high $MNT’s price could go. That said, it will definitely compete with ARB and OP for the top place. Still, since all these assets already sit above a billion-dollar market cap, the upside potential is not as high as with some other altcoins. At the same time, the positive reputation of Bybit and BitDAO gives the Mantle crypto project a lot of credibility. Thus, the risk of investing in $MNT is also on the lower end. Aside from chasing potential gains, you may also be interested in joining the Mantle DAO. In that case, you’ll also need to buy the MNT token. So, that’s another aspect to consider when deciding whether or not to get a bag of $MTN. Since we are not financial advisors, we can’t answer the above question for you. However, based on the information and resources provided herein, you should be able to make an informed decision yourself. That said, we encourage you to research the Mantle crypto project and its native coin further. And the best place to do that is brought to you by Moralis Money. By visiting Moralis Money’s Mantle ($MNT) token page or using the interactive widget below, you can build up your conviction about why you should or shouldn’t buy MNT.

Although many are quite excited about what the future holds for it, some split opinions remain about the Worldcoin project from Sam Altman. To unravel the facts and help you create your own opinion about $WLD, we analyzed it further and have outlined all the essentials in this article! So, if interested, follow along as we look closer at this \u0026#8220;eyeball-scanning\u0026#8221; crypto project!","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Throughout the following sections, you’ll have a chance to find out what the Worldcoin crypto project is all about, who’s behind it, what makes it quite controversial, and how Worldcoin actually works. Additionally, we will also explain what a Worldcoin Orb is! Along the way, you’ll learn all the essentials about the WLD token and discover its purpose (use case). To cover that aspect properly, we’ll take a look at $WLD’s tokenomics. Moreover, since many of you most likely wonder if you should buy the WLD token, we will also look at the token’s price. By analyzing the token’s current price data and considering some other prominent projects launched in the past, we will also play around with some $WLD price predictions. And, for those of you who will decide to get a bag of the Worldcoin crypto token, we will also explain where you can buy it in a safe, user-friendly, and decentralized manner. This is also where you’ll find out how to move beyond the Sam Altman Worldcoin project and explore other altcoin opportunities. The Worldcoin crypto project is attempting to build the world’s largest identity and financial network to serve as a public utility. It aims to do so with the use of a special eyeball-scanning device known as a “Worldcoin Orb” and blockchain technology. As a well-funded project, Worldcoin actually has the means to pull off this mission successfully. However, the main question is whether people around the globe will decide to put their trust in this new tech. So, on the one hand, most of us applaud the idea of creating a better future, which Worldcoin definitely has the potential for. However, many of us will find it challenging to trust this new tech to have our eyeballs scanned and get the data fed into a new network. So, in an attempt to help you overcome this dilemma, let’s look at the Sam Altman Worldcoin project more closely. Note: At the time of writing, a little more than two million people have gotten scanned and confirmed on Worldcoin. At this point, it should be rather obvious that Sam Altman has something to do with Worldcoin. Another person behind this ambitious and controversial crypto project is Alex Blania. These two individuals also have their names signed under the Introducing Worldcoin page on the project’s official website. So, it is not wrong to say that they are the two co-founders of Worldcoin. But it’s technically more correct to say that they are the co-founders of Tools For Humanity (TFH), a tech company that aims to ensure a more just economic system. Furthermore, the company’s website states that it is currently building tools for the Worldcoin crypto project. However, the project aims to become fully decentralized and owned by all its participants. Thus, the project’s documentation states no names. That said, it does point out that the non-profit Worldcoin Foundation is behind the project. It’s supposed to offer support until Worldcoin becomes self-sufficient and the community can take the reins. The foundation’s founding documents specifically contemplate DAO-driven governance. Accordingly, it is essentially “memberless” – it has no owners or shareholders. Still, the Worldcoin Foundation is governed by a board with three directors: Chris “W” Waclawek, Phillip Sippl, and Glenn Kennedy. Further, this foundation is the sole member and sole director of World Assets Limited – the entity responsible for issuing 75% of the WLD token total supply. But, since these tokens were allocated to the Worldcoin community, the company’s sole responsibility is the content of the Worldcoin’s documentation (whitepaper). So, to sum it up, these are the known names behind the Worldcoin crypto project: The two core aspects of the Worldcoin crypto project are World ID and the WLD token. The former is a privacy-preserving digital identity, and the latter is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency. The project also already provides its protocol-compatible wallet: World App. This app, in combination with World ID, can serve as an identity-proofing tool. Also, in combination with WLD and other digital currencies, it serves as a wallet. So, how do these components work together and where does the orb fit in? The process starts with users visiting one of the Worldcoin Orb locations. It’s also worth pointing out that a Worldcoin Orb is a special kind of biometric verification device. There, Orb operators ensure that users scan their eyeballs properly and verify their World ID. There are already more than 120 locations worldwide, and you can find them at “worldcoin.org/find-orb.” On that page, you can also learn more about becoming an Orb operator. The project claims that World ID lets you prove your personhood online without compromising your privacy, which they are able to achieve thanks to blockchain technology. The following image neatly outlines all the aspects of the Worldcoin system: Of course, for World ID to reach its full potential, it is essential that people adopt this way of verification. And the project is well aware of this. Thus, the official Worldcoin website points out that it is an attempt at global scale alignment. If you are interested in the technical aspects of the Worldcoin crypto project, including a detailed description of Worldcoin Orb, dive into the project’s whitepaper. Folks that have already verified their identity can use World App to collect one $WLB weekly, acting as an incentive. Plus, the app already enables users to send digital currencies to other users. When it comes to using World App as a wallet, even users that haven’t verified their World IDs can use it. So, you don’t have to have a verified World ID to own $WLD. However, it’s important to note that you don’t need World App to own WLD, either. Now that you know what the Sam Altman Worldcoin crypto project is all about and how it works, it’s time we take a closer look at the WLD token. The WLD token is the Worldcoin protocol’s native currency. The token has two core purposes: Of course, as with any other ERC-20 token – fungible cryptos that live on Ethereum – WLDs can be freely traded. So, by using a DEX or a CEX supporting this asset’s trading pair, anyone can buy/sell the WLD token. The Worldcoin project went live officially on July 24, 2023. That is also when the WLD token got listed on exchanges. However, by looking at the token’s on-chain metrics, we can see that WLD was minted on July 17, 2023. The Worldcoin token has a total supply of ten billion $WLD. According to the project’s whitepaper, that supply is capped for at least 15 years. Then, up to 1.5% inflation yearly is possible. That said, the default inflation rate is 0%. Below, you can find the summary of all important aspects of the $WLD’s tokenomics: Since the WLD token has been trading for just over a day (at the time of writing), there’s obviously not much price data to analyze. Still, let’s look at the asset’s 15-minute chart: Looking at the above chart, you can see that after the initial pump. The asset has been trading more or less sideways. The listing price was $0.15; however, the price wicked all the way up to $5.29 in the first minute of trading, and $WLD closed its first 15-candlestick at $3.181. Over the following 17 hours, the price was in a downtrend until it found its low at $1.85. The asset formed a local support at the $1.9-ish level and started to slowly climb up again, reaching the $2.26-ish level. This is also the region where the price is currently (at the time of writing). As a large, popular, and well-funded project, the Worldcoin crypto token launched on some of the most popular centralized exchanges. Namely, Binance and KuCoin. While the official listing price sits at $0.15, no one could have caught that deal. By looking at other more significant projects with that type of launch in the past, we can see a clear pattern. Usually, the price of the asset continues to decrease, at least for some period following its launch. Of course, the Worldcoin crypto project is pretty unique, and it could easily take a different path. However, if we had to speculate, we’d say the price will stay below the $3.181 mark for a while. An important aspect is also the circulating supply of the WLD token. Currently, the latter is capped quite low. However, as additional WLD tokens are unlocked, the supply increase will push the price downward. Still, if altcoin trade/investors show a lot of buying interest, they could push the price up despite the increase in circulating supply. But we think that the likelihood of that happening is not that high. After all, the fully diluted market cap of this project is a whopping $22 billion. Nonetheless, with a “circulating” market cap in the $250,000,000 region, it is not impossible for that value to reach billions or even tens of billions in the upcoming bull market. So, in that case, the price of $WLD would increase by 10x or even 100x. So, if you believe this project has what it takes to attract buyers, then you may decide to get a bag of $WLD yourself. If you do not mind using centralized exchanges, you can find WLD on several popular ones. However, if you prefer to be in control of your crypto assets, you ought to stick to decentralized exchanges (DEXs). In that case, the most obvious choice would be to use Uniswap. After all, you now know that the Sam Altman Worldcoin token lives on Ethereum. However, we also recommend using another popular, arguably the best option among the Ethereum swap sites. We are referring to Moralis Money and its powerful swap feature, which you can see in the above image. This cheapest crypto swap feature awaits you on every Moralis Money token page. It’s easy to use and safe. Plus, it sits right on the same page that allows you to determine if now’s the best time to buy $WLD.

The token’s trading volume has also been relatively high. After a look at its fundamentals and on-chain metrics, we decided to examine Arkham Intelligence further and provide you with an in-depth look at this project so you can get better acquainted with Arkham and the ARKM token. The content outlined in this article should also help you decide whether $ARKM deserves to be on your altcoin watchlist!","DETAILED_CONTENT":"As we dive into the following sections, you’ll first discover what the Arkham crypto project is all about. As such, we’ll look at its specific use cases and its tool. After getting you up to speed regarding the basics of the Arkham Intelligence crypto idea and the Arkham crypto tool, we’ll focus on the ARKM token. We’ll explain what ARKM is, look at its tokenomics, and even analyze the token’s price. Based on that analysis and some speculation, we will share our $ARKM price prediction. Nonetheless, we’ll even explain how to buy the ARKM token the easy way. And, as a bonus, you’ll have a chance to learn how to move beyond the Arkham crypto project. But more on that later on! The Arkham crypto project (a.k.a. Arkham Intelligence) is all about blockchain data. And, as the project’s tagline suggests – “Deanonymizing the blockchain” – the project aims to add more clarity, insight, and transparency. However, to better understand what the gist of the Arkham Intelligence crypto is, we recommend looking at the project’s codex, which you can find on the official Arkham website outlined above. According to the creators of Arkham, crypto is covered in darkness, which breeds fear and uncertainty. The latter, according to the codex, brings down confidence and growth. So, the Arkham team believes that the solution lies in bringing light by providing total crypto intelligence to deanonymize the blockchain. They further believe that the shroud currently covering many crypto transactions will be overcome by entity-based intelligence. The latter will be sourced from the community at scale and available to everyone. The project and the currently available Arkham crypto tool are based on the following Arkham thesis: All in all, Arkham’s mission is to map the entire blockchain. By doing so, the project aims to help everyone move on the crypto frontier with confidence. The Arkham crypto tool refers to the Arkham intelligence crypto project’s platform. The latter is already live, and anyone can access it via the “PLATFORM” button in the top-right corner of the project’s homepage: Note: To gain access, you must create your free account using your email address. The Arkham crypto tool is the initial manifestation of the above-outlined ideas. However, it is in many ways no different than many on-chain explorers you can find on the internet. The tool already includes a dashboard where users can view transactions of tracked entities. The Alerts functionality allows users to set up alerts for specific transfers based on details (from, to, value): Next, there’s the Visualizer feature that enables visual insights into transfers regarding entities, Web3 wallets, and token addresses: Here’s an example of Visualizer’s result for the ARKM token address: The Arkham crypto tool also includes the Oracle feature, which is an AI chat where one can search for blockchain information. Last but not least, the tool also includes the Intel Exchange feature, which was launched on July 10, 2023, judging by the pinned Tweet on the Arkham official Twitter account: Speaking of the project’s Twitter account, it’s worth pointing out that it has a rather impressive following. However, it’s also worth noting that the account joined Twitter in May 2019: So, while the Arkham crypto project went live recently, the Arkham Intelligence company was founded back in 2020, according to its LinkedIn account. Focusing back on Arkham’s Intel Exchange, its name tells everything – it is a place where users can buy and sell intel: Note: If you wish to explore these Arkham features and upcoming ones, you can explore the “The Platform” section of Arkham’s codex. This is also the place to learn about the intel economy. The ARKM token, or $ARKM, is the Arkham Intelligence crypto project’s native cryptocurrency. Its main function is to serve as the currency of the intel-to-earn economy, which was introduced with the launch of Arkham’s Intel Exchange. $ARKM is also at the core of Arkham’s system of incentives aimed at generating a positive feedback loop of the platform’s adoption. This incentive system includes ARKM rewards and ARKM discounts. The former is reserved for users taking actions that are beneficial to the Arkham ecosystem. The latter refers to discounts (up to 60%) the platform offers to the users holding $ARKM. Another utility comes in the form of governance. According to the Arkham codex, ARKM holders can submit and approve Arkham Improvement Proposals (AIPs) to update the exchange’s smart contracts, alter exchange fees, and use ARKM allocated to the Arkham Foundation treasury. The token went live on July 5, 2023, when “Arkham: Deployer” minted it on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s important to note that ARKM is a proxy token – a proxy token represents another asset, providing additional functionality. As for the token’s total supply and initial allocation, dive into the following sections. As you can see on the Arkham Etherescan page above, the total supply of $ARKM is one billion. Furthermore, here’s the initial allocation distribution: There are also specific vesting periods in place for the ARKM token. Altogether, it will take seven years for the total ARKM supply to become fully unlocked, and the initial circulating supply was only 15% of the total supply. Unlike many ERC-20 tokens, $ARKM didn’t start to trade on Uniswap but on Binance. After all, as the above-explained allocation indicates, the project decided to use the Binance launchpad. So, the largest trading volume of $ARKM is, to this day, on the Binance exchange with the ARK/USDT trading pair. Looking at the above price chart, you can see that the token’s initial price was $0.05. However, it took $ARKM roughly five minutes to reach as high as $0.89, with a three-minute breather at the $0.5-ish level. But as you can see in the above hourly chart, following the initial 17x-plus rally, the token’s price has been in a clear downtrend. We marked all the “important” price levels that may serve as support and resistance as ARKM’s price decreases or increases. These levels are also the most obvious price predictions. As pointed out above, the most obvious price levels for the Arkham intelligence crypto token are its resistance/support levels. Of course, the token could also find its bottom at its listing price of $0.05 or even lower. However, that is less likely, especially if Bitcoin and the entire crypto market make a move to the upside. So, these are the most significant price levels for $ARKM: But since the ARKM token has a limited amount of price data, the above-outlined levels have a rather low significance level. So, for the sake of price speculation, let’s presume that Bitcoin won’t go much lower than $28.5k and will soon move higher. In that case, we could see $ARKM find support at no lower than $0.5. And, if that level were to become the new local bottom, we may use the Fibonacci retracement tool from the token’s ATH to that level. By doing so, the most optimistic (the 4.236 extension) short-term level for the ARKM token price points to $2.16-ish. Of course, once the bull run takes off, $ARKM has the potential to go significantly higher. Given that the project is backed by some influential names, a $20 or even $200 token is not impossible. However, in that case, the project should reach the one billion dollar or ten billion dollar market cap. Do you think Arkham can pull off something like that? If so, you are probably interested in buying this altcoin at the best possible price and time, right? Considering that the token launched on the Binance launchpad, this popular centralized exchange (CEX) would be the most obvious place to buy $ARKM. However, if you, like us, prefer decentralized exchanges, we have a better option for you. Simply use Moralis Money’s Arkham ($ARKM) token page. As showcased in the above screenshot, this is where you can use a highly intuitive, cheapest crypto swap feature. If you don’t know how to swap ERC-20 tokens yet, make sure to use our step-by-step guide. That said, the swap feature is just a bonus of this powerful tool.

With the continuous growth of the industry and the emergence of new real-world use cases, it’s becoming increasingly important to access, analyze, and leverage this publicly available data as a basis for everything from crypto trading to Web3 development. And for this, we use blockchain analytics. However, what exactly is it, and how does blockchain analytics work? Join us in this article as we address these questions further, explain how it works, and dive into some common use cases!","DETAILED_CONTENT":"To kickstart this article, we’re going to dive straight into the main topic and explain blockchain analytics. From there, we’ll take a section to discuss the importance of leveraging on-chain data as a foundation for businesses and investment decisions. After that, we’ll explain how it works. To top things off, we’re going to explore five common blockchain analytics use cases: So, without further ado, let’s dive straight into the intricacies of blockchain analytics! Before exploring the ins and outs of blockchain analytics, we must go back to basics. So, let’s initiate this guide by looking at what a blockchain is and how it works. A blockchain is an immutable, distributed, and usually decentralized cryptographic ledger. Each blockchain is made up of blocks of data chained together in chronological order. Due to the decentralized and transparent nature of public blockchains, anyone can examine the transactions occurring in real-time to understand what’s happening on a network. Being decentralized means no single entity controls or manages the system. Instead, an entire blockchain database is usually distributed among thousands of network participants from all over the world, and they optimize resource distribution, lower the risk of system failure, and reconcile data. Now, with a brief understanding of blockchains and how they work, what is blockchain analytics? Blockchain analytics is the process of identifying, collecting, interpreting, analyzing, and visualizing the publicly available information stored on a blockchain network. It involves using techniques and specialized software to extract this information to gain insight into user behavior, transactions, and other aspects of a blockchain network. Doing so helps traders, regulators, developers, law enforcement, and users understand historical and current events in real time. This level of transparency and functionality in data analysis and management isn’t possible with conventional databases. This is mainly an effect of centralization and the fact that only a limited number of people can access the servers involved. Consequently, blockchain networks and blockchain analytics offer numerous advantages compared to what’s possible in traditional centralized networks, especially in an ever-chaining world with unpredictable financial markets and tightening regulations. Data is digital oil, and there is no secret that some of the largest conglomerates in the world harness vast quantities of data to guide their business decisions. Consequently, with such large amounts of data available through public blockchain networks, disregarding this resource would be a huge mistake. And by analyzing historical and current events, companies using blockchain analytics can gain insight into user behavior and overall trends to get an edge in the market. Also, companies levering blockchain technology in any way in their business – regardless of industry – need a clear and complete view of everything happening in an ecosystem. This is essential for maintaining efficiency and compliance within the system. Furthermore, this data is not exclusive to businesses; individual investors can also use this information. In doing so, they can base investment decisions on irrefutable real-time data to stay on top of the market and maximize their cryptocurrency gains. Now, with an overview of blockchain analytics and why it’s important, let’s answer the question, how does blockchain analytics work? In order to make the data stored on a blockchain network actionable, it needs to be extracted, analyzed, and processed into convenient formats. The raw blockchain data would need to be queried from nodes and decoded to ensure the accuracy of all transactions and events. However, this is easier said than done, and if you’re somewhat familiar with the space, you know it’s a hassle to query a blockchain network. Fortunately, this is where blockchain analytics tools enter the equation. Blockchain analytics tools handle the hassle of querying, indexing, and analyzing publicly available blockchain information. Moreover, these platforms usually also provide helpful visual representations of the data so it’s more easily understood. There are many different blockchain analytics tools, and they often have their own unique niches. For instance, a tool like Moralis Money focuses on token data, making it the ultimate crypto scanner for traders. While Etherscan is more directed towards transactions, making it a valuable tool for Web3 developers. Nevertheless, to understand how blockchain analytics can be used, let’s explore some different types and use cases in the next section. The types and use cases of blockchain analytics are endless, and in this guide, we’ll cover the following five: So, with no further ado, let’s start with the first of our use cases: blockchain analytics for crypto traders! All transactions occurring on a public network like Ethereum are recorded and stored on the blockchain. As such, by studying this data, you get market updates in real time, providing you with an advantage over other traders. For instance, with this info, you can identify freshly minted coins, see what tokens are being bought by other traders, identify growing trading trends, understand market sentiment, and much more. However, you need a tool that effectively turns blockchain information into actionable token-related data, which is where Moralis Money enters the picture! Moralis Money stands out as the premier alternative among the industry’s best crypto trading tools. It leverages real-time, on-chain token data to give true market alpha. As such, with this tool, you can find new crypto projects early to maximize the return on your investments. Note: We’ll explore Moralis Money further in the ”The Ultimate Blockchain Analytics Tool for Traders – Moralis Money Explained” section below. Crypto teams and companies can leverage blockchain data for business intelligence, user/product analytics, and even to grow their ecosystem. This is possible as they can study the activity of current and potential users to get insight into their needs and habits. What’s more, with on-chain analysis, both teams and businesses can also get a comprehensive overview of the crypto market as a whole. And by studying the available blockchain data, they can use the information regarding, for instance, growing market trends to make more accurate business decisions. Law enforcement agencies were one of the early adopters of blockchain analytics. These organizations can use on-chain analytics to detect surges in illegal activities within the crypto space. Once detected, they can start investigating the matters and track down criminals on the blockchain. There are blockchain analytics tools and companies like Chainalysis specializing in these matters. For example, Chainalysis can identify wallets likely linked to illegal activity. As soon as a wallet is flagged as illicit, the information is given to authorities for investigation. Another prominent example of blockchain analytics use cases is Web3 development. To make Web3 development easier, programmers can leverage blockchain analytics tools when building decentralized applications (dapps) and other platforms. With an on-chain analytics tool, they can look up transactions to ensure they worked as intended, examine smart contracts, and much more. For instance, one such tool is Etherscan, a popular blockchain explorer for the Ethereum network. With this tool, developers can easily look up specific transactions, wallets, and smart contracts on both the Ethereum mainnet and testnets. Many organizations are currently experimenting with integrating blockchain technology into their supply chain practices. In doing so, they can replace manual record-keeping with automated smart contracts. In return, they lower the margin for human errors and unnecessary delays. However, for this to work effectively, they also need to implement blockchain analytics to effectively track items within their supply network. And with blockchain analytics, companies can more easily conduct detailed inspections at any time and reduce the risk of potential problems in the future.

When to Buy the Shido Blockchain Crypto","INTRO":"Shido, a prominent DeFi ecosystem, is experiencing continuous growth and has exciting product plans for 2023. The Shido ecosystem currently comprises the Shido blockchain, along with other products like the Shido DEX, Shido Wallet, Shido Card, and $SHIDO, the network’s native token. The SHIDO token serves as the backbone of the ecosystem, and Shido recently updated its contracts on both Ethereum and BSC Smart Chain. With the growing ecosystem and the redeployment of the token contracts, SHIDO may witness intriguing price developments. However, can the SHIDO token 100x? And, if so, when is the optimal time to invest in the Shido blockchain crypto? Join us as we explore Shido, helping you assess whether it presents an enticing investment opportunity or not!","DETAILED_CONTENT":"To kick things off, we’ll start by exploring the Shido ecosystem and blockchain. This will give you an overview of the network’s current state, which can be helpful in assessing the value of the SHIDO token. We’ll also cover on-chain analytics of the SHIDO token using Moralis Money – the industry-leading on-chain trading indicator. Lastly, to top things off, we’re also going to show you how to find the next 100x crypto using Moralis Money. For a sneak peek, here’s a quick demo showing you how easy it is to find new exciting coins with one of Moralis Money’s premade filters: Shido is a robust ecosystem with prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) utility. It was initially introduced on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) via a small and quiet launch. According to their website, there were no pre-sales or private sales, and all tokens were allocated to the liquidity pool. In April 2022, Shido also launched on the Ethereum network, along with an ETH bridge. This expansion to Ethereum opened the possibility for new investors and paved the way for Shido’s cross-chain ecosystem. Shido is looking to launch several DeFi platforms and utilities in 2023. Each utility will generate revenue independently. Furthermore, instead of the revenue going into wallets, the profits will be used for development and buy-backs of the native $SHIDO token. Nevertheless, the Shido ecosystem features several platforms and utilities. Some examples are the Shido blockchain, Shido DEX, Shido Wallet, and Shido Card. In the sections below, we’ll dive deeper into the Shido ecosystem and explore these products briefly, starting with the Shido blockchain! The Shido blockchain is a decentralized sharded L1 proof-of-stake (PoS) network. It combines the power of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the interoperability of Cosmos, letting developers choose the environment of their choice. The architecture of the Shido blockchain provides endless scalability and free value sharing between Shido and other prominent ecosystems within the industry. And it’s all powered by the Tendermint consensus engine. Furthermore, here are four core features of the Shido blockchain: The Shido ecosystem spans beyond its blockchain network, and below, you’ll find three additional products: The Shido DEX is a gateway to the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), and it features a DeFi aggregator, liquidity protocol, perpetual DEX, and cross-chain swap: Shido Wallet is a non-custodial decentralized Web3 wallet used for buying, storing, sending, and swapping cryptocurrencies and NFTs. It has the following three featured: The Shido Card \u0026 Bank is a debit card and banking service available on the Shido website and Shido Wallet. It has four core features: The SHIDO token is deployed on both Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain. On June 24th, 2023, Shido updated the contracts for the SHIDO token. Both the ERC-20 and BEP-20 SHIDO tokens are governance and utility tokens for all of the Shido ecosystem’s DeFi utilities. According to the Shido website, some of the profits from all DeFi products will be used for token buy-backs. This is what the SHIDO tokenomics looks like: Now, if you’re a crypto investor or trader, you might ask yourself: will the SHIDO token break out and moon? Answering the question above is easier said than done. However, unlike other altcoins and prominent meme coins, SHIDO has utility. The SHIDO token powers the network’s ecosystem, and if it continues to grow, it might perhaps reflect positively on the token. Unfortunately, only time will tell if Shido continues to expand and sees further success. And we can’t say for sure that it will positively affect the SHIDO token price. Nevertheless, in addition to closely following the development of the Shido ecosystem, another prominent method for determining whether or not the SHIDO token will continue to grow is to use on-chain analysis. With on-chain analysis, you can leverage irrefutable blockchain data and real-time market activity as a foundation for investment decisions. So, let’s take a closer look at the SHIDO token’s on-chain analytics! On-chain analysis is an altcoin trading strategy where you leverage the irrefutable and publicly available blockchain data to get valuable market insight. However, a challenging aspect of on-chain analysis is to get a hold of the information you’re after. And if you do, you also need to interpret the data to make it actionable. Querying blockchain data is hard, especially if you lack technical expertise. Luckily, this is where blockchain analytics tools like Moralis Money enters the equation. Moralis Money is a premier on-chain trading indicator. This tool leverages on-chain data in real-time, giving your true market alpha! One of Moralis Money’s most prominent features is the token pages. Each coin has its own dedicated token page, where you can find information based on on-chain data. This includes general stats such as a token’s market cap, holders, trading volume, and liquidity. But also price charts, security information, user ratings, etc. We can leverage this feature to study the on-chain metrics of the SHIDO token. You can find the data you’re looking for via the interactive widget down below: In the iframe above, you can find real-time, on-chain data for the SHIDO token. Moreover, it’s interactive, meaning you can change the timeframes for the metrics to see how the token has been performing over time. The information above lets you determine if the SHIDO token is an attractive investment opportunity or not. For instance, seeing a significant increase in experienced buyers might indicate that the token is on the rise. Unfortunately, we can’t give you a straightforward recommendation as this data is continuously changing, meaning that the SHIDO token might be an attractive investment today but not tomorrow. So, start by studying the on-chain metrics and continue to do your own research on the Shido ecosystem! Moralis Money is – in addition to providing the token pages – the industry-leading crypto scanner. It leverages real-time blockchain data to give you the latest market updates.

You can generate your first set of cryptocurrency trading signals by simply selecting one of the preset filters. Or, apply your unique combination of metrics and hit the “Run Query” button. Yes, it really is that simple! However, if you wish to learn more about what crypto signals are and how to use them, make sure to jump into the following sections. There, you’ll find all you need to know about Moralis Money’s powerful on-chain trading tool. Moving forward, we’ll first make sure you know what crypto signals are, and we’ll also explore the many forms they come in. However, since on-chain data gives you the upper hand, we’ll primarily focus on cryptocurrency trading signals related to that. As we do so, we’ll explore the dominating platform for crypto trading signals: Moralis Money Pro! In addition, by learning about the core Moralis Money features and how to use them with minimum fuss, you’ll be ready to make the most of any crypto market conditions. Now, without further ado, let’s dive in! Crypto signals typically refer to cryptocurrency trading signals that tell you either directly or indirectly what action to take. These types of crypto signals can come in many different forms. For example, they can be manually written or automated messages generated by experienced traders. Furthermore, these signals often include crucial information like the specific cryptocurrency to trade, the entry and exit points, stop-loss levels, and take-profit targets. Some cryptocurrency trading signals comes from trading tools. For example, a trading tool can include a special indicator that signals high-probability opportunities. Or, it can be as simple as the fear and greed index. Whether it’s a bot, an actual person, an indicator, or a special app signaling some sort of trading opportunity, all fall under the scope of crypto signals. However, the best crypto signal is the one that is based on reliable data requiring you to determine what to do with that data. After all, a clear buy signal for one trader may not be as clear for another. Thus, make sure to learn how to use these kinds of tools and use your own judgment to execute the best trades. We’ve pointed out previously that on-chain data precedes price action. That’s why cryptocurrency trading signals based on real-time, on-chain data are so valuable. They are the best way to help you position yourself properly before it’s too late. In other words, with a reliable on-chain trading signal, you can get your timing right. And making profitable trades is all about timing. When cryptocurrencies go on a rally, they tend to do it fast; thus, it’s quite easy to miss out on opportunities. Unless you are a super successful scalper or intra-day trader, the best chance of making huge gains in crypto is by entering your positions early. That is the key to making those 50x-plus gains without leverage trading! That is how we pocketed life-changing gains in the past cycle. Thanks to insights now at your disposal within Moralis Money, we spotted coins like EGLD and MATIC in their early accumulation phases. Let’s look at some cryptocurrency assets we found using Moralis Money’s crypto trading signals in the following section! MultiversX (EGLD) performed extremely well – its price increased by more than 8,900%: Polygon (MATIC) did even better – it enabled us to ride most of its 1000x-plus rally: Additionally, there were many other altcoin opportunities that traders with proper timing could capitalize on. For instance, Fantom (FTM) pulled off a 2000x-plus increase: Are you still not convinced how important it is to spot altcoin opportunities early? Just look at the PEPE token and its run that took place in the 2023 memecoin season. Its massive pump of more than 100,000x happened in 21 days! And that was outside the bull market: Of course, there were many other opportunities in 2023 so far. Moralis Money users – particularly those who locked in the Pro plan – were able to make some insane profits: Cryptocurrency trading signals based on real-time, on-chain data are the best. And thanks to Moralis Money, you can benefit from those like never before! However, before we take you through a Moralis Money quickstart guide, let’s look at the basics of this powerful yet simple-to-use tool. Unless you are completely new to the crypto space, you might have heard of other on-chain analytics tools. Moreover, if you’ve used any of those tools, you know how complicated they are. They normally provide a ton of advanced charts that cause information overload. So, using those tools as crypto signals typically requires a lot of time and effort on your end. The reason why most on-chain tools are so complicated lies in the fact that they are created by data scientists who have zero experience with crypto trading. That is not the case with Moralis Money! In fact, a team of seasoned altcoin traders and industry-leading Web3 developers created Moralis Money. As a result, you can now access on-chain cryptocurrency trading signals in just a few clicks. Essentially, Moralis Money combines the power of on-chain insights with user-friendliness! With Moralis Money, you can generate a list of the most bullish crypto coins at any given time in a matter of seconds. Or, you can use the filters in reverse and spot coins that are losing momentum. So, by focusing on increasing or decreasing momentum, you get bullish and bearish real-time crypto signals. This should also answer your “how to make money in a bear market?” question! Nonetheless, it’s important to note that Moralis Money helps casual traders overcome the three most common crypto-trading obstacles: FOMO, scams, and lack of time. How? Through the three core Moralis Money features. As the name suggests, the Token Explorer feature enables you to explore on-chain data by running unique queries. Token Explorer allows you to select among an array of metrics to use a wide range of search parameter combinations. Based on your search criteria, this feature returns a dynamic list of tokens that are gaining or losing on-chain momentum. That list and the details for each token on it then serve as crypto trading signals. Furthermore, you get to spot opportunities before price action takes place. In turn, you get to position yourself properly and timely. Hence, it helps you overcome FOMO. The Moralis Money Token Shield feature is all about helping you avoid scams. Unlike Token Explorer, Token Shield does its thing automatically. So, whenever you hit the “Run Query” button, this feature performs a security check for all tokens that match your parameters. This way, you can focus on crypto trading signals matching your risk. The higher the score, the lower the risk of it being a scam. So, if you wish to stay on the safe side, stick to tokens with green shields. Plus, you can automatically filter out tokens that do not match your risk tolerance by applying the Security Score filter. Here’s an example that displays only cryptos with security scores above 80: The Token Alerts feature allows you to set up email notifications for your saved on-chain queries. By doing so, you get to search for new opportunities on autopilot. Whenever a new crypto token that matches your search parameters emerges, you receive an email with that token’s blockchain address. So, this feature is a powerful time saver. With Token Alerts, you don’t have to go full-time crypto to detect incredible opportunities. The above-presented Moralis Money core features are your ticket to start generating on-chain trading signals. Its real-time results will tell you if individual markets are looking bearish or bullish. It’s only the question of focusing on an increasing or decreasing on-chain momentum. So, how to get going with Moralis Money? Well, you can generate your first dynamic list of tokens that may deserve your attention with a single click. As the animation below shows, you just need to select one of the preset Moralis Money filters on the homepage: While preset filters are the simplest and the fastest way to get going, they obviously do not provide the most unique results. After all, every Moralis Money user has access to the same presets. As such, you should get comfortable with applying unique combinations of search parameters sooner rather than later. Fortunately, applying custom search criteria is straightforward. It’s completely intuitive, and there’s no wrong approach. Simply select a metric and its filter option, enter a value, and select that value’s timeframe or unit: To help you get started, use this three-step sequence to easily generate the best crypto signals: The above three-step process could provide you with the best crypto signals the first time you run it – if you get the values right. However, as a beginner, you will probably need to tweak your search parameters a couple of times to spot the best opportunities. So, do not be afraid to play around with all the available filter options. Before you know it, you’ll be spotting the best Web3 coins to invest in. Of course, you can use these signals as part of any strategy, even for day trading crypto. Now, are you wondering how to make money in a bear market? First, decide which of the three main tactics you want to focus on for such market conditions. In case you want to make money when crypto goes down by shorting the markets, you will want to target tokens with decreasing momentum: The Moralis Money tool is free to use; however, if you are serious about your altcoin trading, you want to lock in the Pro plan. The latter gives you access to real-time, on-chain data on lower timeframes. Nonetheless, make sure to DYOR for every token before taking action. Simply click the token’s name and take it from there. Throughout the above sections, you learned that Moralis Money is the tool to generate ultimate cryptocurrency trading signals. It utilizes on-chain data to help you generate dynamic lists of tokens that are gaining or losing on-chain momentum. Based on that info, you can spot great opportunities before price action takes place. With the Moralis Money Pro plan, you’ll be able to use this powerful tool for any type of trading strategy. Start practicing the above-presented, three-step process today. Then, you’ll be able to spot bullish crypto trends and bearish ones. However, more importantly, if you start early (that is, before the next bull run), you’ll even be able to find the next 1000x crypto. Plus, once the altcoin season indicator starts flashing green, you’ll be ready to make the most of countless crypto signals!","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Matic Pirc","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Updated 18th May 2023 at 00:05"},{"LINK":"https://academy.moralis.io/blog/earn-passive-income-with-a-crypto-affiliate-marketing-side-hustle","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Academy Moralis","IMAGE":"https://academy.moralis.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Earn-Passive-Income-with-a-Crypto-Affiliate-Marketing-Side-Hustle-768x457.png","TYPE":"Blog","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Earn Passive Income with a Crypto Affiliate Marketing Side Hustle","INTRO":"Do you desire financial freedom?

Moralis Money is a premier on-chain trading indicator using real-time, on-chain data to give users true market alpha. With this tool, anyone can easily make $100 a day trading cryptocurrency!

However, you don’t have to take our word for it; check out some of our Twitter testimonials: So, if you want to start earning 30% lifetime commission on all brought-in revenue for a product basically selling itself, then join the Moralis Money Web3 affiliate program free of charge today. It’s the perfect affiliate marketing side hustle! Affiliate marketing is a strategy where companies partner up with content creators or publishers called affiliate partners. In doing so, companies leverage the reach of their affiliates to promote their brand, product, or service. As compensation for promoting a business, the affiliate receives a commission. When signing up for a program, the affiliate generally receives a code or link to share with their audience. Each program is different and has its own unique goal. Some programs reward affiliates for driving traffic to a platform or website. Others are more specific, trying to incentives a particular action and encourage the users to take a more active role. This can be everything from getting users to sign up for a free trial to subscribing to a service. Nonetheless, most programs require affiliates to bring in actual revenue, as this is usually what the commission is based on. So, how does this actually work? Affiliate partners promote a brand, product, or service on their platform. The platform can differ for each affiliate, but some prominent examples are social media, blogs, websites, podcasts, etc. In turn, the affiliate earns a commission whenever consumers make a purchase using their unique link or code. Let’s take a closer look at this process! The amount you get paid depends. The commission structure varies from program to program and on each company’s product offering. Some programs offer as little as 5% on each sale, while others offer up to 50% commission. Nevertheless, with a better understanding of how crypto affiliate marketing works, let’s take a closer look at the best crypto affiliate programs for 2023. There are hundreds and hundreds of programs you can join to start your affiliate marking side hustle. Unfortunately, we won’t be able to cover them all in this article. Instead, we will focus on three industry-leading programs: So, without further ado, let’s jump straight into our number one choice: Moralis Money! The Moralis Money affiliate program launched earlier this year, and there are already hundreds of affiliates making amazing monthly recurring income. As a Moralis Money affiliate, you’ll earn a whopping 30% lifetime commission while simultaneously helping your audience find the next 1000x crypto. As such, it’s a win-win for both you and your audience! For each paid user signup, you’ll make a minimum of about $59. Consequently, with only 500 active Moralis Money users who signed up via your affiliate link, you’ll have a monthly recurring commission of almost $30k. So, with this program, the route toward financial freedom is shorter than ever! Also, unlike the other alternatives on this list, there’re no requirements for becoming a Moralis Money affiliate. As such, this is the best and easiest way to start affiliate marketing with no money. Lastly, Moralis Money additionally features multi-level marketing (MLM) opportunities. So, if you recruit other affiliates, you’ll get a portion of their brought-in revenue alike. Nevertheless, an attractive commission structure, no signup requirements, and MLM opportunities are only a few reasons why the Moralis Money Web3 affiliate program tops the list! The Bybit affiliate program is another industry-leading program. Bybit offers a lucrative commission structure where affiliates get to enjoy 50% commission. However, this commission is for top-tier affiliates, and it’s based on the referrers’ trading fees. As such, as a Bybit affiliate, your commission is dependent on how much your users trade. In addition to this commission structure, Bybit also offers MLM opportunities. By promoting the affiliate program, you can earn a 10% commission from sub-affiliates. However, according to Bybit’s website, you must have a qualifying website, mobile app, or trading software to become eligible for the program. Or you can be a Bybit customer with an extensive network of traders. Even if you’re new to the crypto industry, you’ll most likely have heard of Binance. Binance is one of the most significant cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, but they also offer a popular affiliate program. Like Bybit, Binance also offers a 50% commission on referrers’ trading fees. Moreover, thanks to the wide range of products offered by Binance, you’ll likely get active users staying engaged, which is important for such a commission structure. However, becoming a Binance affiliate can be challenging as they require promoters to have at least 500 active traders in their community or 5,000 followers on social media. With an overview of three prominent crypto affiliate programs, you might be asking yourself, why should I go for Moralis Money for my affiliate marketing side hustle? To answer this, let’s compare the above programs’ similarities and differences in the table below: The crypto industry is growing rapidly, and more people are allocating funds toward crypto investments. With a rapidly expanding user base, you’ll have no trouble getting people to sign up for a killer product like Moralis Money. However, the same goes for other crypto affiliate programs.

However, successful traders can also profit even in a crypto bear market. In this article, we\u0026#8217;ll go over how to make money in a bear market by leveraging Moralis Money.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"If you wish to jump straight into exploring the opportunities that the current crypto market has to offer, use the interactive widget above. Simply select one of the preset filters or apply your search criteria. Depending on your search criteria/filters, the results will show you if cryptos are gaining or losing on-chain momentum. The former is an indication that it might be time to get in on a specific coin, while the latter may signal that now’s the time to take a short position. By using Moralis Money, you’ll be able to make gains regardless if the market is going up or down. After all, thanks to the Moralis Money Pro plan’s real-time, on-chain analytics, you can make gains both in a bull market as well as in a bear market! In the following sections, we’ll explore all there is to know about this tool. At the end of this article, you’ll know how to easily make money in a bear market! The above image speaks the truth that most casual traders do not consider. They typically enter the market when it’s already in the full swing of a bull run. Sure, you can make money in a bull run; however, to make life-changing gains, you must enter your bear market positions. So, if you’d like to know how to make money in a bear market, the short answer is: to buy tokens that show great potential before they go on the run when bulls enter the market. Traders following that simple tactic were able to pocket some insane profits. How do we know that? Well, we did precisely that in the past two crypto cycles. Thanks to our team of on-chain experts, we detected EGLD and MATIC early. Now, you can access the same sort of on-chain data as they used via Moralis Money. In case you don’t know what kind of gains altcoins offer, just look at the two charts below. MultiverseX (EGLD) performed a massive 90x rally: Polygon (MATIC) did even better. By entering this altcoin early (before the bull run), we were able to ride its 1000x-plus price appreciation: The above two coins are just two of countless examples. While 1000x gains may not be that common (also not too uncommon), you can easily catch 50x-70x moves. After all, that is the price increase that the average altcoin tends to offer from the bear market lows to the bull market highs. Even in a bear market, many tokens go parabolic. This brings us to the second way of how to make money in a bear market. By spotting altcoins that are gaining a lot of on-chain traction (which precedes price action), you can catch crypto before they go for local rallies. Moreover, there have already been a lot of those pumps lately. In fact, many Moralis Money Pro plan users have been pocketing some incredible gains in the past weeks. Even though crypto, as a whole, has been trading more or less sideways since the final third of March 2023, traders using Moralis Money have been able to identify some spectacular opportunities. After all, this period of what will turn out to be a reaccumulation or a redistribution phase also gave birth to the 2023 memecoin season. Thanks to Moralis Money’s on-chain insight, many Pro users spotted tokens like WOJAK, TURBO, and PEPE before they pumped hard. Shorting the market is another popular way to make money in a bear market. After all, trading basics tell you not to trade against the trend. So, in the part of the bear market when prices are on a downhill ride, taking short positions can be extremely profitable. However, to bet that the price of cryptos will go down, you need a “contract for difference” (CFD) trading account. This means you must use centralized exchanges (CEXs) instead of buying and selling tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). If you decide to explore this option, you need to understand the pulse of the crypto asset you want to short. Fortunately, on-chain data can help with that as well. So, instead of trying to spot tokens that are gaining on-chain momentum, you’d focus on the ones that are losing it. Unless you are coming into the crypto space with some experience from traditional markets, you might be confused by all this “bear” and “bull” talk. As such, make sure to have a look at the image below. The latter indicates the four typical stages of the market cycle. When the market is on a consistent rise – printing higher highs and higher lows – it is in a “bull” phase. On the other hand, when the prices are going down – charting lower highs and lower lows – it is the “bear” season. Of course, this is not applicable to all time frames. In the crypto markets, weekly and monthly timeframes are the ones to determine whether we are dealing with a bull or bear market. Looking at past cycles, it is usually quite easy to indicate the above-outlined phases. However, there can be one or even more additional accumulation phases (reaccumulation) and distribution phases (redistribution). On the other hand, when it comes to determining the exact phase of the ongoing market, things are a lot trickier. This is why you can see a lot of contradictory theories flooding crypto Twitter. As such, you must learn how to create your own conviction. That’s also why reliable real-time, on-chain data is so helpful. Nonetheless, make sure to check out our crypto trading for dummies guide to help you understand the crypto cycles and TA basics. If you’d like to learn more about the origins of the “bull” and “bear” terms, check out our article that teaches you how to spot bullish crypto trends.

By finding tokens that are gaining or losing momentum, you can spot opportunities in both bull and bear markets. First, let’s point out that Moralis Money is a free tool for anyone with internet access. However, free Moralis Money plan users are limited to larger timeframes (monthly and quarterly).

However, since they are available to all Moralis Money users, they don’t allow you to spot unique opportunities. As such, your goal should be to get comfortable applying unique combinations of search criteria. Fortunately, you can start finding your winning search criteria combo by applying the following three steps: If you get the values right, you may find the best opportunities on your first run. However, it may take some tweaking to find the best Web3 coins to invest in or to short. So, make sure to try out various combinations of search metrics and different values. Nonetheless, do not forget to DYOR for every token before taking your position in its market. Fortunately, you can start exploring every token with Moralis Money by simply clicking on the token’s name. You now know how to make money in a bear market. We pointed out the three main methods: buying alts early, buying tokens before their local pumps, and shorting the markets. If you want to implement either of the aforementioned tactics, you need to get your timing right. You also learned that you can detect altcoin opportunities by looking at real-time, on-chain data. This is where Moralis Money enters the scene. It is by far the best on-chain trading tool out there. By combining the power of on-chain insights and simplicity of use, Moralis Money enables you to time your trades (long-term and short-term ones) to a “T.,” especially if you opt for the Pro plan.

One of the first steps in day trading crypto is finding the right assets. Here, there are generally three vital factors to look at. Along with these three factors, you should also do further research regarding a token’s underlying project. For instance, you might want to look at what the protocol does, how it’s governed, the size, the currency’s role, etc. With a better understanding of crypto day trading, let’s look at the prerequisites for getting started with crypto trading in general. However, no matter what strategy you go for, the most challenging part is finding the right assets. This is why professional traders turn to tools like Moralis Money.

When it comes to crypto, 99% of traders generally struggle with one of three challenges: the fear of missing out (FOMO), time constraints, and cryptocurrency scams. However, with the three core features of Moralis, you can easily overcome these challenges! In a fast-moving market, where big opportunities come and go frequently, FOMO is a big struggle for many crypto traders. Most of us have heard of or read about someone making significant gains. For this reason, traders feel like they are continuously missing big opportunities. As a result, they trade emotionally and make investment decisions based on hype. Remember, once an altcoin reaches the masses, it’s often too late. However, you can now dodge this pitfall with Moralis Money and the Token Explorer feature. With Token Explorer, you can find new crypto coins before everyone else since Moralis Money provides true market alpha. As such, you’ll never again have to FOMO into an investment opportunity! The crypto market is fast-paced, and opportunities come and go in the blink of an eye. As such, from a conventional perspective, traders have generally needed to go full-time crypto to become successful and capitalize on these opportunities. Fortunately, with the Token Alerts feature, you can overcome time struggles and start trading like a professional, even if you aren’t full-time in crypto. With this feature, you can set up email notifications to get real-time alerts whenever a new opportunity arises.

Lastly, another prominent problem for crypto traders is cryptocurrency scams. There will always be bad-faith actors looking to scam traders, and in a fast-moving market, complete due diligence takes time. However, to protect you from scams, we built Token Shield! The Token Shield feature provides a security evaluation for all coins. As such, thanks to Moralis Money, you can now efficiently dodge scams! Nevertheless, let’s dive deeper into how these three features work, starting with how you can make $100 a day trading cryptocurrency with Token Explorer. In this section, we’ll demo the Token Explorer feature to illustrate how you can find new tokens to make $100 a day trading cryptocurrency. So, how does it work? With Token Explorer, you can combine various metrics to find specific coins you’re after. To show you how it works, we’ll set up a custom search query for finding tokens minted within the past month, currently gaining traction from other users, and that have seen a positive influx of liquidity recently. As such, to begin with, we’ll launch Token Explorer and apply the Coin Age filter: Next, we can add both the Experienced Buyers and Liquidity filters. With Experienced Buyers, we can filter for coins gaining traction from other crypto traders. With the Liquidity filter, we can search for coins that have increased in liquidity over the past month: From here, you can now combine these three metrics with any other options from the list to make your query even more unique. Also, if you’d like to trade like a professional, subscribe to the Moralis Money Pro plan. This will give you narrower timeframes for all metrics: With Token Alerts, you can now easily set up email notifications based on your custom search queries. In return, you’ll get email alerts whenever a new coin matching your filters emerges. Nevertheless, let’s show you how it works! First, go ahead and save your custom search query by hitting the ”Save Query” button: From there, you can set up an alert by going to the homepage. Next, locate the query in question, hit the bell button, and fill in the required information: As a result, you’ll now receive email notifications whenever a new token emerges based on your filter. With the last Token Shield feature, you can now stay safe from crypto scams. All you need to do is look for the shield symbol when using Token Explorer: This is each coin’s DEXT score, and it’s a measurement of the confidence of a project. The max DEXT score is 99; the closer a coin is to this number, the less likely it’s a scam. To learn more about the score and how it’s calculated, you can click on one of the shield symbols, and you’ll be taken to the following page: In addition to trading, there are other ways of earning $100 a day in crypto, and a great example is affiliate marketing. But what exactly is crypto affiliate marketing? Affiliate marketing is a performance-based strategy where so-called affiliates gain a commission as a reward for promoting a brand, product, or service. When joining an affiliate program, the content creator generally receives a unique code of link that they can share with their audience. If the audience uses the code/link to purchase a product, sign up for a service, or something similar, the affiliate often gets a commission based on brought-in revenue.

To do so, simply look for the shield symbol attached to each coin when using Token Explorer: Each coin has a shield symbol with a number. The number is each coin’s DEXT score, which is used to measure the confidence of a project. One is the lowest score, and 99 is the highest. If a coin’s score is 80 or higher, it’s considered to have a high score. As such, these tokens have a higher probability of being legitimate. What’s more, when using Token Explorer, you can apply the Security Score metric to filter for coins with a score higher than, for instance, 80: In today’s article, we explored two ways of earning passive income with crypto: trading and affiliate marketing.

However, most traders must usually go full-time crypto to capitalize on trading opportunities, and most aspiring traders don\u0026#8217;t have that luxury. Imagine if there was an on-chain trading bot indicator that could compile all the action happening on-chain. Then, anyone with access to that tool could get automatic trading signals for altcoins and access to unbiased on-chain information to understand when to invest in any given altcoin.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"This is why we developed our free on-chain trading indicator: Moralis Money. You can try Moralis Money for free using the interactive widget below. Apply a preset filter or create your own custom search query from scratch to find precisely the coins you’re after. What’s more, if you decide to upgrade to Moralis Money Pro, you get on-chain data in real-time, giving you access to powerful market alpha! However, you don’t need to take our word for it. Moralis Money users are already making serious gains trading crypto. Our users managed to identify explosive coins like the PEPE token, XEN crypto, the CHAD token, the WOJAK token, and others. Here’s a sample of some of our happy users: Also, did you know you can currently sign up for Moralis Money Pro at a discount? The offer stands until Bitcoin reaches $40k. But if you go for it now, we’ll honor the price for as long as you stay subscribed! Before diving into the ins and outs of on-chain trading signals, we briefly need to cover the basics of blockchain technology. So, what is a blockchain? In short, a blockchain is a digital and decentralized ledger. The main point of the ledger is to record, synchronize, and publicly share transaction data. This data is generally referred to as on-chain data. All the publicly available information makes up all the blocks in a blockchain network. Whenever a transaction takes place, data is recorded in this digital ledger. As such, each network holds an immutable public record of all transactions, and it’s updated in real-time. The information contained within each block reveals hints about all transactions. And this data can be used as on-chain trading signals. Some common data types are wallet addresses, block timestamps, transfer amounts, smart contract code, and more. As you can imagine, with this information, it’s possible to make all sorts of crypto predictions. You can even find new crypto coins before everyone else! However, the big question is, how do you leverage on-chain trading signals for altcoin gains? As you know by now, you can access transaction data directly from a blockchain network and use the information as on-chain trading signals. However, the difficult part is querying and understanding this data. This is precisely why you need to add an automated on-chain trading bot indicator like Moralis Money to supercharge your altcoin trading strategy! By using Moralis Money as an on-chain trading bot indicator, you can seamlessly access and understand on-chain data. As a result, you get access to real-time trading data, usually before the market even has time to “price it in.” As you can imagine, this is when you can make serious gains! Through on-chain data analysis, our team of experienced traders managed to identify both MATIC and EGLD before they broke out. If you’d also like to make similar gains, start preparing now with Moralis Money. For more information on how this works, join us in the next section as we’ll illustrate how to use Moralis Money as an on-chain trading bot indicator! If you’ve tried to find tokens before they pump, you know it can be a hassle without the proper tools. Simply looking at the market to identify new tokens isn’t always enough. It’s time-consuming and not something everyone has the luxury of doing. This is why you want to use an on-chain trading bot indicator like Moralis Money. Moralis Money automatically serves you with on-chain data in an actionable and understandable way. Moreover, by understanding how, e.g., buyers, experienced buyers, holders, liquidity, etc., fit together, you get unparalleled insight into how any token is doing. By using Moralis Money as an automated on-chain trading bot indicator, you’ll autonomously get informed about the latest coins to break out. You’ll get this information without having to go full-time crypto. So, what metrics and filters can you set up with Moralis Money to target specific coins? One of Moralis Money’s central features is its Token Explorer. With this feature, you can combine various metrics and filters to create custom search queries and get the coins you’re after. From there, you can use your custom filters to set up Moralis Money as an on-chain trading bot indicator to automatically get real-time, actionable on-chain data about the next big crypto! Here are the eight metrics you can filter by: So, how can you combine these filters to find the tokens you’re after? For the answer to this question, join us as we take a deep dive into Moralis Money’s three central features! In this section, we’ll cover Moralis Money in further detail and how you can use this tool and an on-chain trading bot indicator. More specifically, we’re going to cover Moralis Money’s three central features: Also, if you’d like to supercharge these features, you might want to check out the Moralis Money Pro plan. With the Pro plan, you can save more search queries, get shorter timeframes for your filters (weekly, daily, and hourly), collect more Moralis Money beans, and much more. Nevertheless, without further ado, let’s look at how you can use Token Explorer as a bot to inform your trades! With Token Explorer, you can now find crypto coins before everyone else. So, how does it work? Let us show you! When using Token Explorer, you have two primary options: preset or custom filters. Let’s look at how they both work, starting with the former. The preset filters are great for a quick start. However, the real magic of Moralis Money comes from custom queries, allowing you to target specific tokens you’re after! Step 1: To get newly minted tokens, let’s start by adding the Coin Age metric: Step 2: Combine the previous filter with the Experienced Buyers and Security Score metrics. With Experienced Buyers, we only get coins gaining traction from other buyers. Security Score ensures that we get tokens with a good security evaluation: Step 3: Add any additional filters to narrow the search even further! Also, if you’d like to take the Token Explorer feature to the next level, subscribe to the Moralis Money Pro plan immediately. With the Pro plan, you get more narrow timeframes for the metrics. This means you can get weekly, daily, and even hourly market activity updates: With Token Explorer, you’re automatically served with actionable and understandable on-chain data. With Token Alerts, you can effectively use your custom queries and Moralis Money as an on-chain trading bot indicator to get market alpha. Let’s show you how it works! Once you’re done creating your custom filters using Token Explorer, you can save your query. All you need to do is hit the “Save Query” button: With your query saved, the next step is to navigate to the ”Account” tab, where you’ll find your custom filters. To set up an alert and use Moralis Money as an on-chain trading bot indicator, click the bell button for the query in question. From there, all you need to do is check the ”Receive email alerts” box, enter your email address, specify how often you want to receive alerts, and click on ”Start Monitoring”: In return, you’ll receive real-time updates with market alpha. You’ll be pinged as soon as you have an investment opportunity that fits your preferences! If you’d like to use Token Alerts, you’ll need to sign up with the Moralis Money Pro plan. However, now is a better time than ever, as you can subscribe to the Pro plan at a discount. As we’re moving into another bullish market, the value of Moralis Money will increase 10x. So, as soon as Bitcoin hits 40k, the price will increase by almost 25%. Therefore, please take the opportunity now before it’s too late. Start using Token Alerts and Moralis Money as an on-chain trading bot indicator today! The second feature is Token Shield. And this feature provides a security evaluation for all coins. Just look for the shield symbol attached to all coins when using Token Explorer: The numbers on the shield are the coins’ DEXT scores. The DEXT score is a measurement of each coin’s confidence. The score is calculated using a number of different factors, including the number of holders, liquidity, social aspects, etc. By clicking on one of the shield symbols, you can get more information on what the score entails and how it is calculated. Nevertheless, the max score is 99, and the minimum score is one. The higher the score, the less likely the token is to be a scam. As such, it has never been easier to dodge potential scam coins. This article explored the ins and outs of on-chain trading bots. In doing so, we learned they could be leveraged to access on-chain data to understand trading signals.

The average altcoin performance during a bull market is around 50x, but the right altcoins can easily 100x or even 1000x during a bull run. For example, AAVE was trading at $0.32 in 2019. It then hit a high of $707.67 \u0026#8211; a 2211x increase.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Imagine if you found MATIC when it was trading at $0.016. Just a year later, MATIC was trading at $2.73 – a 171x increase. Imagine if you found Elrond (EGLD) in November of 2020 when it was trading for $7.06. A year later, Elrond was trading at $549.23 – a 78x increase. Investing $500 into these two projects at the right time could have netted you $124,500. We know, because we identified both MATIC and EGLD before they pumped. If you missed out on these opportunities, the coming bull market is your chance – but only if you start preparing now. Even in bull market conditions, most traders end up failing. Why? It all comes down to three main challenges why traders fail to make the most of altcoin opportunities: 1. FOMO – Many traders don’t have the proper tools for trading and lack a system. Instead, they let emotions guide their trading. They’re late into coins and FOMO in at the top, only in time for the price to dump. 2. Scams – Casual traders will get scammed by rug pulls and exit scams. Traders fail to identify sketchy-looking coins and fall victim to scams. 3. Time – Keeping track of different tokens is a full-time job. Crypto never sleeps, and the market is volatile – meaning opportunities will come and go fast. We built Moralis Money specifically to tackle these three challenges. Moralis Money is built by experienced traders, is free to try, and lets you get straight to the point in a few clicks. Moralis Money comes with three features specifically designed to help you unlock the opportunities of the altcoin space. These are the Token Explorer, Token Shield, and Token Alerts. Lets say you want to be early into new coins that may go 50-100x in the near future. 1st step – Open up the Token Explorer Just use the Coin Age filter to see ALL coins listed in the last 3 days. As you can see, this is so easy! But what if we want only new coins that actually are gaining traction? We don’t want any newly minted garbage coin! We want coins that are gaining momentum. To see them, we can simply add a Holders filter and see only the coins which are actually getting Holders: As you can see, this becomes very powerful and shortens your journey to finding the next pump by applying some simple filters. Find up-and-coming altcoins with our Token Explorer. Set your own filters to identify altcoins before they pump, or simply use our preset filters to learn which coins whales are buying. As you are getting raw, on-chain data with our Token Explorer, you’ll get this alpha before there’s any Twitter hype, and far before you can find the coins on other services like CoinGecko. Token Shield, on the other hand, keeps you safe from scams. Simply look for the green shield to get information about total liquidity locked in a token project. We’re also continuously adding more security information to the Token Shield to ensure you’re as safe as possible! Token Alerts allows you to stay up-to-date with everything relating to tokens. Set up customisable alerts over email to always be informed when new opportunities arise. Token Alerts allow you to trade with access to real-time information and opportunities without needing to be full-time in crypto. The best way to experience how easy Moralis Money makes it to find tokens before they pump is to use Moralis Money yourself: Moralis Money gives you access to unparalleled market alpha in just a few simple clicks. It’s never been so easy to find undervalued alts. Either use our preset filters, or create your own! Our team of experienced traders have created Moralis Money specifically for other traders to be able to detect token opportunities. Using Moralis Money is the best way to ensure you won’t be caught on the sidelines during the next bull run. So, let’s demonstrate just how easy Moralis Money makes it to find token before they pump. By following our step-by-step guide, you’ll be able to find up-and-coming tokens before they take Twitter by storm, or even before they show up on the likes of Coinpaprika and CoinGecko. We offer great premade filters so you can start exploring tokens straight away. However, we also allow you to set up your own, fully customisable filters. For example, you might want to sort coins by their “coin age”, to find fresh opportunities and newly released coins. In our example, we’re only going to look at coins less than 50 days. We’ll set our filter for this, and run the query. That will show you the coins matching your preferences. However, that’s not all. Moralis Money allows you to add more custom filters to find exactly the type of metrics you’re looking for. Perhaps you want to be more specific – such as only search for coins which have gotten at least 50 new “experienced buyers” in the past week. To ensure that the coin has positive liquidity, you can search for tokens that have increased by at least 1 in liquidity the past week. You can add both of these filters to your previous one about coin age. You can then save your query, which now shows you results only for coins minted within 50 days, with at least 50 experienced buyers, and with liquidity that has increased in the past week. This is a game-changer for traders. Moralis Money also allows you to save your queries, so you can keep a list of your favourite customised filters for finding tokens before they pump. Our team is working hard on adding even more filter metrics to Moralis Money. We are adding more functionality to Moralis each week. Here’s a overview of our current filter metrics to help you find tokens before they pump. Make sure to try Moralis Money yourself to see when we add new filter metrics! The “Coin Age” filter metric allows you to search for tokens based on when they were created. This is a powerful metric for finding new tokens and new opportunities. For example, in the following screenshot we’re searching for tokens created less than 25 days ago. You can also filter the coins according to “Liquidity”. Choose between specifying “Increased by at least” and “Decreased by at least” to discover tokens that have experienced recent liquidity change. Environments with rapidly changing liquidity hold a lot of opportunity. Monitor if there’s an increase or decrease in activity to find tokens before they pump or dump. With just a few clicks, Moralis Money lets you view e.g. coins which liquidity increased by over $1,000,000 last week: Moralis Money also lets you filter tokens based on who is buying. Find tokens whose number of “Holders” (addresses that hold the token) has increased or decreased in a specific time frame. Here’s an example that displays tokens that gained 1,000 or more new holders in the last week: You can also discover coins with an increase or decrease in “Buyers” in a specific time frame. Here’s an example that returns tokens that increased with at least 500 buyers during the last week: Finally, “Experienced Buyers” are buyers with proven address records. For example, here’s a search for coins where experienced buyers increased with at least 250 experienced buyers in the past week. Note: Our team of traders are constantly at work improving Moralis Money. Thus, expect new metrics \u0026 filter options to be added at short notice. Start using Moralis Money today to try them out first! Part of the magic of Moralis Money is that you can combine your own custom filters. This is a killer feature for identifying coins before their price skyrockets. Moralis Money users can even save their queries. This means you have your favourite filters just a click away. All user plans can save their favourite queries. For professional traders, though, they will likely want to upgrade to the Pro plan to be able to save up to 10 queries. Jumping into altcoins without the proper tools is a high-risk, high-reward venture. However, Moralis Money comes with Token Shield. Token Shield is another game-changer, that helps you avoid exit scams and rug pulls. With it, you can easily see a token’s total liquidity locked. When you find new tokens with a high percentage of their total liquidity locked, Token Shield marks them with a green shield to indicate that they’re “safer” than those with low liquidity locked. You simply hover over the shield icon to see the percentage of total liquidity locked. Note: Moralis Money continuously adds new Token Shields features to keep traders safe. At this point, you are already aware of the power of Moralis Money Token Explorer. However, you probably don’t want to spend your days stuck to your screen to find tokens before they pump. With Token Alerts, you don’t have to. Simply set up alerts for your saved queries and get notified whenever new tokens match your filters. Essentially, this feature enables you to set up on-chain listeners that let you know whenever new opportunities arise. Note: Token Alerts is launching to the public soon; sign up today to be among the first to use it! Moralis Money is built by traders, for traders. We know what traders want and need in order to get an edge, as we are traders ourselves. Moralis Money leverages the leading Web3 API provider (Moralis) to deliver actionable, on-chain data to help you find tokens before they pump.
