The report also came with a proposal for studying a central bank digital currency (CBDC), which seems like the direction the whole world is heading.Today, nearly every country with a central bank is studying or developing a CBDC, according to the Bank of International Settlements (BIS). At their best, CBDCs could advance certain national priorities like bolstering financial inclusion and simplifying tax collection.That’s what the BIS suggests. What the “central bank of central banks” is less likely to say, however, is that there are significant downsides to concentrating even more monetary power in the hands of institutions like the U.S. Federal Reserve.Cathy Yoon is the chief legal officer of MPCH Labs. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Crypto 2023.A CBDC, which can be but is not necessarily built on a blockchain, would differ drastically from other forms of crypto assets because they are inherently centralized and permissioned by design. If the government is going to get involved in the digital money race, it should do so on the principles of openness and transparency.The Biden White House’s proposed CBDC would likely be administered by the government and a coterie of banking partners in the old-fashioned, neoliberal tradition of public-private partnerships. Although CBDC boosters pay lip service to the ideal of “financial privacy,” there are still widespread and justified concerns over allowing the government to see the details of everyone’s finances on a minute-by-minute basis.And, yes, it is true that a U.S. dollar-based CBDC would likely promote the international use of the dollar – thereby strengthening the currency against the Chinese digital yuan, which is being piloted today in no small part to one day bolster the Chinese Communist Party’s international “soft power” – this also comes with concerns.To put it one way, CBDCs, at their core, are a tool that allows the government to fully politicize money. Today, no one can prevent you from spending the dollar bills in your pockets, because they are what’s known as a bearer instrument. A digital dollar would be programmable, meaning its functionality sits with those that can update the code.A government, for instance, might be able to use a CBDC to incentivize citizens to purchase certain products, ban the trade of others and cut off individuals or businesses from their funds on a whim (like how police seize websites). With this kind of power at their disposal, it’s hard to imagine it would be utilized.See also: Why Hong Kong Is Pushing for Its Own CBDC | Crypto 2023A CBDC would be a massive undertaking in the mold of Depression Era or post-war infrastructure projects. So-called megaprojects can be sources of national pride and catalysts of economic growth – like the interstate highway system. However, instead of developing a CBDC, it would be much more productive and impactful for the White House to focus on different kinds of financial initiatives to benefit the public good.I propose, instead of throwing resources and tax dollars at a CBDC project, the Biden administration should investigate a decentralized identification program and develop financial literacy programs for the general public.Currently, access to financial services is often limited by geographical location, onerous know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and the U.S.’ embarrassing history of class and racial inequality. A new digital identification system could go a long way in improving this situation.The idea of a digital identity (DID) is to allow for one’s identity to be proven and maintained in alternative ways. It could be a way to harmonize the hodgepodge of details that banks and financial institutions often require for setting up accounts, such as previous bank statements, proof of residency and utility bills – altogether known as personally identifiable information (PII).Further, blockchain-based DIDs bring with them the benefits of blockchain-guaranteed immutability and censorship-resistance. The concept of decentralized identity existed well before Web3, and is closely related to the dream of self-sovereign identity (SSI).At their core, DIDs and SSIs are about enabling citizens rather than centralized institutions to control their own information. What form they take is still being worked out (Jack Dorsey’s Block, for instance, wants to jump straight to “Web5” using non-blockchain “verified credentials”), but in either case would be a radical departure from the current record-keeping regime. Simplify identity management now!Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging alternative to traditional finance without the middlemen. It offers many of the same services as Wall Street, including lending, credit and brokerage, but when done right it ensures that transactions are verifiable and platforms open for all.While a number of of crypto’s centralized institutions disgraced the industry this year, DeFi proved its worth. None of the insider trading, theft of customer funds or preferential treatment seen at some crypto companies is possible when DeFi protocols are shipped correctly. Instead, these open financial platforms make everyone play by the same rules – and open the books for verification.Regulators should embrace emerging technologies as a means to better allow market participants to become more efficient, cost-effective and secure. Blockchain, in conjunction with other cryptographic layers such as multi-party computation, could allow financial institutions to improve internal process management while also leaving a transparent and auditable trail as a means to provide assurances to customers, investors and regulators.Regulators have a unique opportunity, working together with some of the brightest minds in the space to help steer technology that will inevitably help financial institutions, their customers and the economy become more streamlined and secure.By developing smart regulations for smart contracts (rather than quashing it), the government can help erect ecosystem guardrails to make these admittedly sometimes-complex systems safer to use for everyone.Considering the pace of digital adoption is not slowing, a digitally native and digitally secure financial system makes sense. More of the world’s assets will be tokenized. Regulators that nurture the development of new technologies will ultimately help the U.S. financial system become more prosperous than it has ever been.To some extent, the crypto industry is a mirror into the poor state of financial education. It’s a sad fact that scams proliferate across the industry, in no small part because many do not know basics of investing – and can be tricked into thinking an unsustainable yield farm is sound.If individuals are empowered with financial education at a young age, they can be in a position to think critically on their own. The government, like crypto itself, should encourage people to do their own research – something that would remove the need for the government to nuke all of Web3.Regulation and education have always walked together hand in hand: In just about every Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement action, for instance, the agency encourages people to think critically about what they invest in.Financial literacy puts financial liberation in the hands of each and every individual. It’s essential to the evolution and improvement of any society and ultimately benefits the economy by encouraging sustained growth from the ground up.See also: Rebuilding the Crypto Yield Market After the Meltdown | Crypto 2023If the Biden administration truly stands for making our financial system more secure and prosperous, it will shift its focus this coming year from creating a CBDC to realizing the massive potential that decentralized financial technology has today.By empowering people and institutions alike through thoughtful regulations, improved security, and individual empowerment, the federal government can foster a new wave of financial well-being that truly benefits us all.","TAGS":"CBDC, financial literacy, Blockchain Technology, DeFi, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/es/policy/2022/12/07/argentine-government-creates-a-national-blockchain-committee/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Eh4HYsOmBeerq233rZk25HPjQDI\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/O336N2JQ2ZBXTJMSECKIBFW4FA.jpeg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Argentine Government Creates National Blockchain Committee","INTRO":"The initiative seeks to promote the development of public policies and technological solutions based on blockchain technology.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The Argentine government has created a national committee to develop public policies and technological solutions based on blockchain technology.According to a decree published on Wednesday, the committee will bring together agencies and entities of the Argentine public sector that can help develop blockchain technology.The new committee will function under the Argentine secretariat of public innovation, an agency created in 2019 to design policies that promote openness and innovation and digital government.“Blockchain technologies have emerged as one of the greatest innovations in the field of information technologies, providing the effective possibility of optimizing public-sector processes and the traceability, transparency and efficiency of the services provided to citizens by recording transactions with higher levels of security,” the government said in the decree.Read more: Buenos Aires to Deploy Ethereum Validator Nodes in 2023","TAGS":"Argentina, Blockchain, Policy, Blockchain Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Andrés Engler","CATEGORY":"Regulación","CREATION_DATE":"Dec 7, 2022 at 1:59 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/05/bank-of-america-say-regulation-is-key-for-mainstream-adoption-of-crypto/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/OwIg4a_Jy9v_4wjM0ZBUnUv7kls\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/O2UE3KUKYVGQXKD62RUR2LMIBE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bank of America Says Regulation Is Key for Mainstream Adoption of Crypto","INTRO":"Despite the correction in cryptocurrency markets, the development of blockchain technology has accelerated, a report from the bank said.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The bankruptcies of crypto exchange FTX and its affiliated trading firm, Alameda Research, are major blows to the cryptocurrency industry’s credibility, but there are silver linings, Bank of America (BAC) said in a research report Friday.“An increased urgency for regulation may enable greater institutional engagement, and a shift in focus (and capital) from speculative trading to projects with real-world functionality and companies with road maps to profitability may accelerate industry maturity,” analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss wrote.Regulatory frameworks for the crypto industry are critical for mainstream adoption, the report said, and a coordinated global effort is required to discourage regulatory arbitrage and to safeguard consumers and investors.FTX’s collapse has refocused attention on the need for regulation that “creates a transparent legal framework for digital assets; fosters technological innovation; provides consumer and investor protections and mitigates financial stability risks,” the note said.The bank noted that the top 100 crypto tokens have fallen 64% year to date, but pointed out they are still up 2,175% since the end of 2016.

That system looks to give investors the ability to be exposed to separately managed accounts with multiple coins, such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).Of the conversations Johnson has had with advisers, she said they are most concerned about data as it relates to ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) issues, sustainability and understanding what opportunities exist within the space and how they can responsibly approach them.“One of the most difficult things for an investor who\u0027s trying to have a portfolio that takes into consideration those environmental, social and governance factors is that they don\u0027t have great data,” Johnson said.

As a teenager, D’Urso lost vision in both of his eyes due to a genetic eye condition. He later received a corneal transplant, which allowed him to regain 20/20 vision in one of his eyes. This event led him to switch majors from business to science, and he eventually received his Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics.During his years of research, he focused on understanding how genes and proteins work together and how they can be identified and cataloged. While many drug companies look at gene targets that have the potential to be effective, he believes that the way drugs are currently tested is often unsustainable and inefficient due to the failure rates and associated research costs.Gennaro D\u0027Urso is presenting at Investing in Digital Enterprises and Assets Summit (I.D.E.A.S.), CoinDesk\u0027s newest event revealing the most scalable marketplaces in the digital economy that will attract institutional capital in the years to come.Learn directly from entrepreneurs in leading innovation across digital assets, Web3, blockchain and the metaverse. Register here.“Genetic Networks was really driven by … the limitations I saw in the pharmaceutical industry and the way it approaches drug discovery,” D\u0027Urso told CoinDesk.D\u0027Urso decided that his drug-discovery technologies would better function outside of academia. So he created Genetic Networks, where he creates functional profiles of how genes and drugs work. Using applied modular biology and genome-wide analytics, he believes that drugs can be repurposed in a way that is faster, safer and cheaper.In 2021, a friend introduced him to Bitcoin. He later delved further into the world of blockchain and discovered decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO), which he believes have promising potential.Read More: DAOs Are the New Way of Impact Work“DAOs are not companies … A DAO can function as an accelerator, a catalyst,” D\u0027Urso told CoinDesk.While stressing that Genetic Networks is not currently associated with any DAO, he believes that the relationship between private companies and DAOs is at point that he has coined a “verge,” where they can function in tandem to discover promising drugs for those who desperately need them.He believes DAOs could be used to solve some of the world’s greatest problems (“food, water, medicine, shelter”), while still potentially allowing the DAO community as a whole to profit from fruitful discoveries. At a higher level, D’Urso thinks DAOs could enter into contracts with private companies that would allow the funding DAOs to receive a portion of associated royalties.Royalties in lieu of VC funding could be a promising alternative that gives founders more control, says D’Urso.“PharmaDAO is just a brainchild,” D\u0027Urso says, stressing that the blockchain world is not his wheelhouse. His primary domain is strictly off-chain, composed of Genetic Networks and the art/science of combining technology with drug discovery. Though newly introduced to the blockchain ecosystem, he has been reaching out to Web3 communities and experts to explain how he sees DAO structures as a good accompaniment and funding mechanism for his industry.In addition to the possibility of combining Genetic Networks’ systematic drug discovery with DAO structures, D\u0027Urso mentioned that big drug discoveries – and potentially big partnerships – may be on Genetic Networks’ horizon.Outside of the DAO paradigm, he finds it inspiring that those in the developing world can leverage blockchain technology to gain agency over their finances by controlling their own crypto wallets: “We [those in the developed world] don’t appreciate how blockchain can really change the lives of those who are less fortunate.”","TAGS":"IDEAS 2022, Blockchain Technology, Pharmaceuticals, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Kade Garrett  Kade Garrett","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Oct 10, 2022 at 12:41 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-mev-aka-maximal-extractable-value/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/MQ1tOAxtXjfVYuNJnhwyo4TqxpQ\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/636POARLZFHCJHCI63EU6YQVEQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"What Is MEV, aka Maximal Extractable Value?","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain technology is the driving force behind cryptocurrency, allowing transactions to take place between parties without the need for an intermediary. Depending on the blockchain and the consensus method used, cryptocurrency transactions can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours to process.In both proof-of-stake and proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, pending transactions are held in the network’s publicly visible waiting area called the \"mempool,\" where they will sit until a miner or validator selects them, orders them and creates a block out of the information. That block is then validated by nodes in a network and added to the official chain.But as a pending transaction sits in a mempool, miners and validators have found ways to profit from them by including, excluding or reordering transactions in a block. This strategy involves maximal (formerly miner) extractable value, or MEV.MEV is a relatively new phenomenon, and research and development groups like Flashbots are working to mitigate the risks associated with it. According to the Ethereum Foundation, some methods of MEV extraction are malicious and result in a worse experience for the user, while other methods can help fix network inefficiencies.While MEV is most commonly associated with Ethereum, because that is the second-largest blockchain, it’s important to note that it’s not an Ethereum-specific issue. MEV strategies are less lucrative on Bitcoin, the largest blockchain, because of its lack of smart contracts — a primary opportunity for MEV-extraction on Ethereum and similar blockchains.MEV is sometimes referred to as an “invisible tax” that miners can collect from users – essentially, the maximum value a miner can extract from moving around transactions when producing a block on a blockchain network.The activity was first predicted in 2014 by an algorithmic trader under the pseudonym Pmcgoohan, who warned that miners could quietly rearrange transactions in a mempool for personal gain.“Miners can see all the contract code they run (obviously) and the order in which transactions run is up to individual miners,” the trader wrote in a thread on Reddit. “What is to stop front running by a miner in any marketplace implementation by Ethereum?”Smart contract researcher Phil Daian and his colleagues expanded on this idea in a 2019 paper titled “Flash Boys 2.0,” coining the term “miner extractable value” (MEV) to refer “to the total amount of ETH miners can extract from manipulation of transactions within a given time frame.” The phenomenon gained popularity after researchers Dan Robinson and Georgios Konstantopoulos published a blog post in August 2020, describing Ethereum’s mempool as a “dark forest” because of the fierce competition and shadowy methods used to capture MEV.At the time of writing, Flashbots estimates that over $674 million has been extracted from transaction reordering on Ethereum since the beginning of 2020, though some researchers suggest it may be a lot more than that.There are different ways MEV can be extracted from block production on a network like Ethereum.MEV was first used in the context of proof-of-work, where miners control the order and inclusion of transactions in a block. Thus, the original abbreviation stood for “miner extractable value.”The Ethereum blockchain in late 2022 underwent a shift to proof-of-stake (a move referred to as “The Merge”) and value extraction methods will continue after that transition, leading to the more inclusive term “maximal extractable value” that is commonly used today.In theory, the Ethereum Foundation notes that network miners or validators should get the full MEV amount, because they are the only party that can guarantee a MEV extraction is successful. It notes, however, that a large portion of the MEV is retrieved by independent network participants called “searchers,” who run complex algorithms to detect profitable MEV opportunities and use bots to automate the process.“Miners/validators do get a portion of the full MEV amount anyway because searchers are willing to pay high gas fees (which go to the miner/validator) in exchange for a higher likelihood of inclusion of their profitable transactions in a block,” the foundations explains.Front-running: Some searchers will use bots called “generalized front-runners” to scan the mempool for profitable transactions. Once a profitable opportunity is detected, the bot will replicate a user’s transaction with a higher gas price so that miners will choose that transaction over others.Some groups are working to use this activity for good. Flashbots runs a service that allows Ethereum users and miners to communicate their preferred transaction order within a block. This is meant to be a “fair ecosystem for efficient MEV extraction” and has reduced the effectiveness of generalized front-runners, according to the Ethereum Foundation.Sandwich attack: The term refers to a malicious type of front-running that is often used to manipulate cryptocurrency prices. It occurs when a searcher detects a large pending trade on a decentralized exchange (DEX) and places a trade right before and right after it to benefit from an artificial price change.The sandwich attack will ultimately affect the amount of cryptocurrency the user who put in the initial transaction will receive, while the attacker will benefit from the price difference.Here’s an example to illustrate: Let’s say you place an order to buy $1,000 worth of APE on a decentralized exchange like Uniswap. Your pending transaction then goes into the mempool.Seeing that there’s an order to buy $APE, the MEV bot places two orders: one transaction that pays extra gas fees to buy $APE before your transaction, and another transaction to sell $APE after your transaction.How high the MEV victim will end up paying depends on the “slippage” they’ve entered – the percentage price difference they’re willing to accept between the time of trade order and execution.Dex arbitrage: Tokens will often have different prices on decentralized exchanges due to varying demand. When there’s a significant price difference across one exchange to another, MEV bots will buy lower-priced tokens to sell them on another exchange at a higher value. As a result, token prices across exchanges become more aligned, making the decentralized finance (DeFi) market more efficient.This method is competitive but can be lucrative. In August 2020, a trader exploited a temporary difference between the price of stablecoins on several different decentralized exchanges, resulting in a net profit of $40,000:Liquidation: DeFi lending protocols require users to deposit some cryptocurrency as collateral. When a user can’t repay his loans, the protocol typically allows anyone to liquidate the collateral and earn a liquidation fee from the borrower.MEV searchers will compete to determine which borrowers can be liquidated and collect the liquidation fee for themselves.Using methods of MEV extraction like front-running and sandwich attacks can be harmful and result in network congestion and high gas prices for other users. But methods like DEX arbitrage can result in users getting the most fair prices across exchanges.There are attempts to reduce the impact of malicious MEV, like Flashbots, and certain protocols search for the lowest prices for a trade across all exchanges and aggregators.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ekin Genç","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/10/huobi-enters-venture-capital-with-ivy-blocks/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/p1W3_QuxsUnrta5vCTEkbAqNU2Q\u003d/570x321/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/QIWW2JKMUVE7ZPXM3IGBNS6E6A.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Huobi Enters Venture Capital With Ivy Blocks","INTRO":"The exchange\u0027s newly formed investment arm will focus on DeFi and Web 3 ventures.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global launched Ivy Blocks with a \"multibillion-dollar war chest\" to invest in cryptocurrency projects globally.Read more: Huobi Global Acquires Latin American Crypto Exchange Bitex","TAGS":"Huobi, Web 3.0, DeFi, Blockchain Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Michael Bellusci","CATEGORY":"Finance","CREATION_DATE":"Jun 10, 2022 at 8:24 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/coindesks-money-reimagined/the-quantum-revolution-that-will-change-everything/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Iv4opeoRH15TZzB7lyjNKSpPVwI\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/XM35FFSDXJHX7J4V4IP3ILWWMM.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/19/number-of-active-blockchain-games-doubled-in-past-year-to-almost-400/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/KIBVxJ6V8Uq54UVG7I2UBNm-wdg\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/C5GUMQU7TNH47GR7EMKLKH6QOU.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Number of \u0027Active\u0027 Blockchain Games Doubled in Past Year to Almost 400","INTRO":"The prices of tokens for gaming projects like Axie Infinity have fallen recently, but user metrics in this subsector of cryptocurrencies are soaring.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"With broader cryptocurrency markets in the doldrums, at least one area of the digital-asset industry appears to be mostly unaffected and has continued to grow: blockchain-based gaming. Although token prices for leading blockchain games like Axie Infinity have fallen recently, the user metrics are up.There are now 398 active blockchain games, defined as having at least one active wallet in the past 24 hours within the game, according to the data tracker DappRadar. That\u0027s a 92% increase from a year ago. The total number of blockchain games, including those that are inactive, has climbed by 71% over the past year to 1,179.Modesta Massoit, finance director at DappRadar, said that the growth looked impressive given that “it takes time to build great games, and in traditional industries, it takes two to four years to build a great game.”User statistics show the rapid pace of adoption of blockchain gaming. According to Massoit, the number of daily unique wallets interacting with game-related smart contracts surged to 1.3 million last year, a 46-fold increase over the 28,000 at the end of 2020.Meanwhile, venture capital firms have invested $4 billion to support the development and creation of blockchain-based games and their underlying infrastructure, according to Massoit.And the fast expansion shows few signs of slowing: “2022 is going to be huge for crypto and gaming,\" says Gerald Votta, director of GameFi research for Quantum Economics. \"Look for the number of games in the space to more than double over the next few years.”Read more: Crypto VCs Are Making a Big Bet on Gaming Guilds. Why?The popularity of \"play-to-earn\" – gaming powered by cryptocurrency rewards – picked up in 2021 with the Pokémon-inspired Axie Infinity leading the way (and its AXS tokens racking up impressive gains). The play-to-earn game is ranked the second-largest game using blockchain technology on DappRadar by user base, becoming a hit among lower-income populations in the Philippines and Venezuela. It reached a record-high of $2.5 billion in trading volume in September and surpassed sales records of NBA Top Shot and CryptoPunks, according to a report by the Blockchain Gaming Alliance.Ranking first on transaction volume is DeFi Kingdoms, a play-to-earn, metaverse-based blockchain game. DappRadar data shows that the number of users on the game has nearly quadrupled just in the past two months.Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency markets in 2022 have suffered one of their worst-ever starts to a year and remain far off their all-time highs. Bitcoin is down 12% year to date and Ethereum\u0027s native cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), is down 15%.Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and gaming appear less affected by macroeconomic events and tend to trade more independently, according to a study by DappRadar. The firm attributes the sector\u0027s rising adoption and popularity over the past year to narratives like play-to-earn or the metaverse. (Remember Facebook\u0027s rebrand?)The trend has firmed as more traditional gaming companies like Ubisoft and EA Originals join the ranks of play-to-earn and NFT gaming, said Votta of Quantum Economics.Jeff Holmberg, head of investments at Yield Guild Games, a play-to-earn gaming guild, says adoption of blockchain games has been driven in part by the ability of players to have digital ownership over in-game assets.\"This is a huge shift away from the typical centralized Web 2 models that have dominated the industry to date,\" Holmberg said in an interview with CoinDesk. The most successful games are those with a strong community, robust play-to-earn mechanics and guild features, because they have higher chances of attracting players, he said.Sebastien Borget, co-founder and chief operating officer of The Sandbox who serves as president of the Blockchain Game Alliance, said that there\u0027s a growing diversity of games involving blockchain, NFTs and play-to-earn mechanisms.“This is a great indicator of the overall growing interest of the industry,” Borget said.One obstacle to further adoption: the reputation of cryptocurrencies among many traditional video game players.The blockchain gaming industry has faced criticism from traditional gamers, and many think that gameplay for these projects has a long way to go.Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, acknowledged that blockchain gaming has been one of the core themes of last year and thinks that will continue into 2022, but he noted that the next phase of growth might come only after existing games deliver and the infrastructure evolves further.The tokens of several play-to-earn games have suffered large price drops this year as broader cryptocurrency markets have trended downward. (Maybe they don\u0027t trade so independently after all.)AXS, an Ethereum-based token that powers Axie Infinity, is down 40% in the past three months, Yield Guild Games\u0027 YGG token is also down by 40%. The Sandbox (SAND) is down 16% over the past seven days, but is still up 400% over the past three months.","TAGS":"GameFi, Gaming, Blockchain Technology, Markets, Trading, Investing, Cryptocurrency Markets, Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Lyllah Ledesma","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jan 19, 2022 at 4:18 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/28/connext-launches-nxtp-protocol-to-improve-liquidity/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Vzt2mQCejiGVOooFVUNZMMqEMYU\u003d/570x570/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/K7XJAOEEJJGOZEON6DGIC47UQ4.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Connext Launches NXTP Protocol to Improve Liquidity","INTRO":"The Ethereum-based network is looking to expand its transaction capacity after a $12 million funding round.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Connext, a platform based on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to conduct transactions across different Ethereum-compatible networks, announced the launch of NXTP, a tool that allows communication between different blockchains and their offshoots, known as layer 2 systems and sidechains.The launch comes two months after Connext raised $12 million in a funding round.Ethereum’s capacity, or scalability, issues have prompted software developers to move their applications to layer 2 networks from the main Ethereum network, which is known as a mainnet, or a layer 1 system. The result is that users are interacting more with a mix of layer 2 networks that are built on top of Ethereum, sidechains and layer 1 networks that are compatible with Ethereum.The Connext network consists of a set of “nodes,” or people with routers who support the network and provide liquidity to it. The nodes pass data between the systems, earning fees in the process. The company launched its Vector protocol early this year, but that had difficulty handling transactions because of the complicated accounting those transactions required. NXTP was rolled out to fix those issues and boost the liquidity that’s needed to attract developers to the platform.The growing field of “cross-chain interoperability” networks also includes Hermez, Loopring and StarkEx. Connext says one big advantage of NXTP is that it doesn’t introduce third-party validators to control user funds, which can pose a security risk.Founded in 2017, Connext has now completed over $500 million in transactions across its network, according to the company. The $12 million funding round in July was co-led by investment firm 1kx and blockchain technology company ConsenSys and included more than 80 additional investors.“Our vision for NXTP is that it will become the internet protocol of the Ethereum multi-chain ecosystem,” Connext founder Arjun Bhuptani said in a press release, “Now that it’s live, our focus will be on growing liquidity within the system, rapidly adding support for new chains/L2s, and transitioning the protocol to becoming entirely owned and operated by the community.”In an interview with CoinDesk, Bhuptani laid out the company’s plans to increase liquidity. Bhuptani noted that the funding round in July included blockchain infrastructure providers like Stakefish that are capable of providing liquidity and have “great reputations in that space.”Connext also has a pipeline of about 260 more people who have signed up to operate routers.“The goal is to head towards making it as passive as possible to provide liquidity to the system,” Bhuptani said.","TAGS":"Ethereum, Blockchain Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brandy Betz","CATEGORY":"Technology","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 28, 2021 at 3:37 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/23/colnago-turns-to-blockchain-to-counter-bicycle-theft/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/AKRYmjy0sah5a7kYJROTAdhQSSc\u003d/570x285/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/Y2DY336765GL3KB3N7C257IRHA.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Colnago Turns to Blockchain to Counter Bicycle Theft","INTRO":"The bike manufacturer will use blockchain technology to combat theft and counterfeiting on all Colnago frames starting next year.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Bike manufacturer Colnago plans to use blockchain technology to counter theft and counterfeiting.Read more: $3M Was Stolen, but the Real Steal Is These Kia Sedonas, Say Anonymous Developers","TAGS":"Theft, Blockchain Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jamie Crawley","CATEGORY":"Technology","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 23, 2021 at 8:46 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/27/blockchain-role-playing-game-mir4-launches-in-170-countries-alongside-utility-coin/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/7Lj-zqE0aZvGxav6wudfZ5dm_qM\u003d/570x297/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/WM2JSLLR4BFAZAILDTJITZHDWI.jpeg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain Role Playing Game MIR4 Launches in 170 Countries Alongside Utility Coin","INTRO":"Gamers can “smelt” their utility coins to take advantage of MIR4′s in-game e-commerce to earn while they play.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"MIR4, a blockchain-based multiplayer online role-playing game that features a utility cryptocurrency, has completed testing and is now live, according to a press release.The video game, which was launched Thursday, allows players to gather utility coins known as DRACO.

Kenetic Capital led the capital raise, which also included Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Liberty City, with each of the three contributing $2 million. (DCG is CoinDesk’s parent company.) Sound Ventures, Deribit, Artist Capital, Deus and LionTree also participated in the round. New York-based Horizen said it would use the money to evolve its tools for developers and businesses to establish their own blockchains and decentralized applications (dapps). Toward that end, the company’s co-founder and CEO, Rob Viglione, told CoinDesk that he was looking “to double to triple” his current 25-person staff by adding at least 20 engineers in New York, expanding Horizen’s operations in Milan and opening a new office in Ukraine. “At this point, our biggest bottleneck is talent,” Viglione said. Horizen just released a decentralized, \"privacy preserving\" audit blockchain called zkAudit and counts crypto lender Celsius Network and blockchain-based supply chain platform Morpheus.Network among its early users. Separately, Horizen is banking on its Zendoo scalability protocol, still in testnet, to increase usage of its technology. Viglione said the company plans to move Zendoo to mainnet by the end of October. “Having that protocol is a necessary precursor for us,” he said. In a statement, Viglione said that \"the raise shows the faith being put into our company\" and that it would \"enable us to continue building out the tools and technology needed for fully programmable highly effective blockchains and decentralized applications.\" DCG and Liberty led Horizen’s $3.75 million seed funding round in 2019, the same year as Horizen’s founding. DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert said in a statement that he had been “consistently impressed\" by the project\u0027s development. “Horizen’s novel sidechain technology lets partners and projects harness decentralization to tackle real-world use cases,” Silbert said, adding that DCG expected demand for Horizen’s ZEN token to grow.

Blockchain technology has been touted by many in the community as a way to make the monetization of art and music fairer in the digital age by giving creators more ownership of their work, as well as by clarifying the licensing and metadata issues that cause music to be taken down from online platforms. Audius’ rapid expansion is a sign that artists and fans alike are increasingly finding value in blockchain-based streaming. According to Audius co-founders Roneil Rumburg and Forrest Browning, most of Audius’ approximately 100,000 artists have small and midsized audiences. But major players in the music industry such as Skrillex, deadmau5 and Weezer are also using Audius to get music – including works-in-progress and unreleased music – out to their fans. Audius, which launched in 2019, operates closer to a decentralized version of music streaming service SoundCloud than to Spotify, the world\u0027s largest music streaming company. Creators are not paid directly by Audius based on streams, but instead are given the infrastructure needed to monetize their work in the way they see fit, including through sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

The London-based company generated $9.8 million in revenue from April to June, which was also a whopping increase from the $274,718 it generated in the same period last year when the coronavirus pandemic kept people home. In the Q2 report, Travala also attributed the strong performance to \"strategic initiatives, optimisations and partnerships\" that have broadened its offerings and improved service. The Q2 result also signaled a wider embrace of the company\u0027s blockchain-based travel booking platform after Travala generated only $249,365 in revenue for Q2 2019, a year prior to the pandemic\u0027s onset. Co-founder and CEO Juan Otero told CoinDesk in an email that he was heartened by the improvement and expects 2021 revenue to be seven to eight times higher than last year\u0027s. Travala, which accepts over 40 cryptocurrencies, Binance Pay and fiat payment forms, allows guests to purchase hotel stays, flights and experiences directly through its platform.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u0027s government says the research will help ease regulatory compliance burdens, according to a press release on Monday. The government has invested roughly AU$5.6 million (US$4.1 million) into blockchain provenance startup Everledger and tech consultancy Convergence.Tech. Through its Blockchain Pilot Grants program, the government is hoping the companies will increase the productivity and competitiveness of Australia’s critical minerals and food and beverage sectors. Everledger has received AU$3 million (US$2.2 million) to look at blockchain\u0027s use in digital certification for critical minerals during the extraction and transportation phases. Morrison\u0027s government is hoping Everledger\u0027s pursuit will aid companies in the mining industry to adhere to compliance regulations while increasing demand for Australian products globally. Covergence.Tech has received AU$2.66 million (US$2 million) to help automate reporting processes under a commodity-based tax, which is an excise tax, on goods and services, including alcohol. Convergence is seeking to reduce compliance costs associated with the creation, storage, and transportation of products in the food and beverage industry, according to the press release. Christian Porter, Australia\u0027s minister for industry, science and technology, said the grants will show the potential for blockchain technology to assist businesses in cutting costs and red tape throughout the supply chain process. “These two successful projects will also highlight opportunities to improve the technical and regulatory environment for blockchain in Australia, bolster blockchain literacy and support collaboration between Australian governments, the private sector and blockchain companies,\" Porter said.

Those purchasing cocoa through Heifer Honduras\u0027 Chocolate4All project will be able to trace the provenance of goods using IBM\u0027s Food Trust, a network that uses blockchain technology to connect and validate participants in supply chains. The technology is designed to give buyers a way to reliably purchase beans through Copranil, one of the oldest coffee cooperatives in the western highlands of Honduras. In order to trace beans along a supply chain, users are given access to IBM\u0027s private blockchain, on which Food Trust is built. Users can then upload data onto the network. They can also access documents through the network. That is designed to ensure an equitable exchange of information. Heifer first uploads the information about plants that are shipped to farmers. Post-harvest, farmers are required to tag and ship their beans to Copranil processors. Additional data is then uploaded to the blockchain regarding the status of the beans, including how they were cleaned, dried and roasted under the framework of the Fair Trade coffee regulations. From there, corporate buyers can view all the information to understand the prices of the goods sold.

The Senate\u0027s Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade Committee report on Thursday made several recommendations intended to sharpen the focus of the country\u0027s customs bill. The committee, which was charged with examining the potency of Australia\u0027s Customs Amendment (Banning Goods Produced By Uyghur Forced Labor) Bill 2020, has made 14 recommendations ranging from broadening the legislation to empowering the country\u0027s border force. The report underscores the importance of investigating various technologies to track the provenance of goods along the supply chain in order to stop imports produced by slave labor. Blockchain, along with isotopic labeling and microbiome tracing, could \"empower\" companies and governments to more \"efficiently\" and \"effectively\" trace their supply chains, the report stated. The Customs Amendment, which was proposed in December by Independent Senator Rex Patrick, seeks to amend the country\u0027s Customs Act 1901. If passed, amendments to the bill would prohibit the import of \"slave labor\" goods arriving from the Xinjiang province and other parts of China. “I am very pleased with the outcome of this important inquiry which has delivered strong bipartisan recommendations for action to prevent the importation of goods produced using forced labor,\" Patrick said in a press statement on Thursday. \"Especially in regard to imports from China made using coerced Uyghur people.” Australia\u0027s relations with China have soured in recent years, because of allegations over the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19, Chinese-instituted tariffs on Australian exports and allegations over China\u0027s treatment of its ethnic Uyghur population. Patrick said given the emergency, the Australian government should move \"without delay\" to implement the Senate committee’s recommendation before years\u0027 end.

According to a report by the Economic Times on Tuesday, 10 private-sector banks, four public-sector banks and a foreign bank have forged the Indian Banks\u0027 Blockchain Infrastructure Company (IBBIC). The company\u0027s new system will verify the data for invoices on goods and services tax and \"e-way bills,\" eliminating paperwork and significantly reducing transaction times. E-way bills refer to electronic-way bills, which is a way to track the movement of goods and services electronically to make sure commerce complies with tax laws. Executing letters of credit on blockchain has been tested before, but IBBIC\u0027s move marks the first attempt for domestic trade finance, according to the report. Domestic letters of credit act as sureties for the seller that goods or services will be paid for when they eventually arrive. RBL Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, South Indian Bank, Federal Bank and IDFC First Bank are the 10 private banks. The four public sector banks include the State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and Indian Bank, while Standard Chartered is the foreign bank involved in the new company. \"Disbursements on domestic LCs, which used to take four to five days, can be done in four hours,\" said Varun Bakshi, head of products, transaction banking at RBL Bank. Bakshi also said a blockchain-based letter-of-credit system can eliminate fraud because of encryption and because no two letters of credits would be able to be issued for the same invoice, which \"sometimes happens\".

Think of supply chains orchestrated by smart contracts.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"We associate the concept of central planning with grim images of collapsing Soviet economies, but it turns out that central planning is also the main engine for how capitalist modern economies run – at least inside the enterprise, though with perhaps a slightly better track record. It turns out, whether it’s at the national level or inside the enterprise, that people do not like being told what to do or being guided by central planning. Despite that, since the 1960s, companies have been trying to make computerized top-down planning and scheduling work so that they can operate their business networks more efficiently. These central planning systems are costly and complex, and with the rise of blockchain-based industrial operations, there is an opportunity to put many of them out to pasture. Just like the real world, blockchains are decentralized systems where individual actors participate alongside others, but there is no centralized coordinating entity. In the place of top-down inventory planning and forecasting, smart contracts could be used to allow decentralized operations. Stores or locations that run out of inventory can then look around for potential suppliers – checking on the cost of buying replacement inventory from nearby stores, distributors or directly from the factory. Each local participant needs to focus only on setting their own rules to manage their replenishment plans and forecast. Crowdsourced services like ride sharing already do something like that. None of them directly tells drivers when to drive (or riders when to ride). Instead, they allow some form of supply and demand matching to occur directly in the market. Current systems are still highly centralized, with a lot of analytics and tools being used to nudge drivers and riders toward an equilibrium with things like bonuses and surge pricing. It is less hands-on than centralized planning, but still far from an entirely free market. These types of systems are still much more responsive than central planning systems, although that’s a low bar to hurdle. Planning has always been tough, and the gradual evolution of the process has taken decades. In the process, you take the material plan for a product and then backwards calculate how many should be ordered based on your production schedule. The result is, in theory, an orderly sequence of purchases that will refill your stocks in a timely manner. Once products are built, a separate plan, often known as the distribution plan, pushes them out into the sales channel. The theory sounds good. In reality, most enterprise supply chains are a dumpster fire of panic drills and frantic fulfillment efforts. No plan ever survives contact with reality and just about anything can go wrong, from errors in product design to giant container ships getting stuck in the Suez Canal. I once met an executive who supervised a network of private jets focused primarily on emergency supply chain runs. While spending $100,000 to ship $10,000 in plastic door handles might seem ridiculous, it’s cheaper than idling a $1 billion factory or making several thousand cars without door handles and then having staff manually attach them later. And all that has happened before we’ve dealt with sudden changes in supply or demand. Given all the things that can go wrong, the most successful companies make the coordination of business operations a strategic priority for their top executives and are very hands-on in managing the details of the supply chain. Early on in my career, I worked at a supply chain planning software vendor, and had the opportunity to watch the CEO of a major technology company preside over its sales and operations planning meeting. I was invited to attend the planning meeting as an observer to inform my work in process and system design. Once there, I was amazed to watch the CEO personally engage in the process. A shortage of parts from a key supplier meant that the company’s high end (and high margin) products that were key to the holiday season would be in short supply, and while that was far from ideal, there was still available capacity to increase production of the company’s lower margin products. In that meeting, they agreed to ramp up production of the lower margin items and change the advertising and sales emphasis to the products they would have in stock, not the ones they originally planned. The agility they showed in the planning process probably made the very best of a bad situation. That meeting set a benchmark of CEO-level engagement in supply chain management that I have never yet seen equaled. Although there aren’t yet any models for autonomous and decentralized supply chain planning, there is at least one centralized method that comes close, and it works very well: The Kanban system was originally developed by Toyota and executed in the early days without any software at all. Like many great ideas, the system is a perfect encapsulation of the philosophy that less can sometimes be more. Kanban systems eschew advanced planning software for physical cards. When inventory runs low (or out), a card is sent to the next level back in the supply chain requesting replenishment. Without regard to some grand plan, inventory flows through the system by a set of pull signals. The best feature of the Kanban system is that the “planning” signal comes all the way from the marketplace and the network responds to the demand signal directly, rather than pushing products forward based on a plan. Kanban systems are simple and efficient, and work well both in paper and digital versions. There remain significant limitations on these kinds of systems. They do not work well in “build-to-order” environments, where every product is customized or where there are frequent engineering changes. There are also big challenges for centralized systems. Want to make a supply chain planner cry? Tell them you have an engineering change order coming. For many cases, though, a blockchain-based autonomous supply chain network would bring big benefits. Smart contracts would be free to look at supply not just from the warehouse or factory, but perhaps also from nearby stores and other sources. Local smart contracts could get even smarter over time, developing unique, localized historical data of demand and an understanding of how to balance difference supply sources in time and money. To get to this future state, we still need to make dramatic progress in our ability to tokenize digital assets as they move through the supply chain. This data exists today, but it is rarely packaged in the form of digital tokens that can be seen and managed by smart contracts. As blockchain transaction capacity rises and more companies move their procurement and traceability activities on-chain, adding planning and shifting toward self-organizing networks looks more and more feasible. The future of planning is the rise of self-organizing systems over top-down planning. From ride sharing to vacation homes, we are already experiencing how systems that are driven by individual entities can be as responsive and effective as top-down models. It is only a matter of time before this approach moves into the industrial supply chain.

Big Time raised $10.3 million in a Series A funding round from such investors as North Island Ventures, Digital Currency Group (the owner of CoinDesk), OKEx\u0027s Blockdream Ventures, Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research, USDC builder Circle and Ashton Kutcher\u0027s Sound Ventures, according to an announcement on Wednesday. An additional $11 million in funding that will be used to invest in partner gaming companies is almost complete, the company said. Online video games have been around forever, but they tend to be \"Walled Gardens,\" which means they are enclosed so that the user is restricted to certain websites or online services. Thanks to crypto going mainstream, especially with all the interest around non-fungible tokens (NFTs), it’s time for the gaming world to break through its silos. Big Time CEO Ari Meilich, who was previously a co-founder and CEO at Decentraland, a virtual reality platform that is built on blockchain technology, says he plans to create the first \"AAA,\" or highly rated, action title that allows players to acquire, hold and trade NFT-based virtual items with ease. In 2018, Meilich organized “Nifty,” the first blockchain gaming and NFT conference, where he gained firsthand experience of the sort of complications users run into when they deal with blockchains, wallets, cryptocurrencies and NFTs. “We knew for a fact that this couldn’t scale in the short term to a mass market audience,” Meilich said in an interview, adding: Meilich said the project is being built on Ethereum but with “proprietary tech to scale off-chain.” Meilich is joined by former Decentraland compatriot Thor Alexander and a founding team that includes key players from games such as \"World of Warcraft,\" \"Call of Duty\" and \"League of Legends.\" “The market for in-game assets is massive, and yet in today’s world, players do not possess and usually cannot trade the items they purchase,” North Island Ventures managing partner Travis Scher said in a statement. “In-game NFTs can give players true ownership and their proliferation can bring the Metaverse one step closer to fruition.” ","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Digital Currency Group, Decentraland, video games, NFTs, Sam Bankman-Fried, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Finance","CREATION_DATE":"May 12, 2021 at 1:00 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/05/11/us-senator-proposes-making-distributed-ledgers-key-technology-focus/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Efcfo9VrIN-y7TnXLn_7VcDi1uI\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/3F73D3UWY5AVJNOUUHDFU2OJEQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"US Senator Proposes Making Distributed Ledgers ‘Key Technology Focus’","INTRO":"Wyoming\u0027s Cynthia Lummis wants the U.S. government to make blockchain a priority.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The U.S. government should add distributed ledger technology to its list of priorities, Sen.

Lummis is sponsoring an amendment to add blockchain to the “Endless Frontier Act,” a bipartisan bill that would create a Directorate for Technology and Innovation and set 10 “technology focus areas” for the new entity to evaluate and create a federal strategy to address. The bill will be marked up in committee on Wednesday, meaning the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation will vote on amendments and determine whether it will move to the full Senate for a vote. Lummis’s amendment would increase the number of focus areas to 11 to “add distributed ledger technologies to the initial list.” The current list of focus areas include artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, quantum computing, robotics, disaster prevention, communications technology, biotechnology, cybersecurity, energy and materials science. The list can be modified after three years, according to the current form of the bill. The Endless Frontier Act, which was originally introduced last year, aims to bolster the National Science Foundation, an independent government agency tasked with supporting research in science and engineering fields. The 2021 version would appropriate $100 billion to the new technology directorate, with $5 billion available in the 2022 fiscal year. “China is already rolling out a digital yuan in select cities, and they want to use it ultimately to undermine the position of the U.S. dollar in the financial world,” Lummis said in a statement. “This is a national security issue, and if the U.S. does not respond we will be left behind.

Self-titled as a “lightweight,” Mina has a fixed blockchain size of 22 kilobytes, which it maintains by discarding blocks as they elapse. Usually blockchains retain every block mined. Its unorthodox design employs a technology called “zk-SNARKS,” most widely known for its use by Zcash, to preserve its transaction record without saving every block. Through its SNARK-powered applications – or “Snapps” – Mina aims to “bring new possibilities for internet privacy and data security,” said O(1) Labs CEO Evan Shaprio in a statement. Mina boasts a long list of notable backers, including Three Arrows Capital, for whom the “lightweight” protocol is one of only four base-layer blockchain investments listed on its website, a group that also includes Bitcoin, Ethereum and Polkadot. Mina’s backers also include Polychain, Paradigm, Coinbase Ventures, Naval Ravikant and Bixin Ventures. Concurrent with its mainnet launch, Mina announced its partnership with CoinList for its upcoming token sale.

It depends on the use case, says a long-time observer and investor.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When predicting how the cryptocurrency economy will evolve, many people have looked to the start of the internet itself. They imagine certain standards or protocols becoming dominant, with value accruing in the application layers. But cryptocurrencies are different. Value is captured within a coin’s economy rather than just in its code and in the way an application is monetized. In addition, value (measured by price and market cap) keeps moving from layer one (L1), like Bitcoin and Ethereum, to layer two (L2) and application protocols that are being built on top of L1, such as Cosmos, Hiro and Uniswap. With full interoperability, and with blockchain agnostic protocols such as The Graph, L1 blockchains may become just rails with fees attached. Most value will move into agnostic protocols and use-specific blockchains. To understand where value is being captured and on what layer it is being created, it’s useful to review the evolution of L1 and L2 over the last decade. That was the approach of Bitcoiners in the early days, myself among them. There was one blockchain and one platform to power all digital asset use cases and applications. When people started to think about the technology beyond bitcoin as a currency, the first technologies to market were protocols developed on top of Bitcoin, such as Colored Coins, Counterparty and Mastercoin (Omni), then referred to as “Bitcoin 2.0.” In 2012, when I started working on Colored Coins with a group of early Bitcoiners (Vitalik Buterin among them), not many were thinking beyond building on top of Bitcoin. To me at least, it was 100% clear that Bitcoin would be the only significant platform, and that by using L2, it would create digital asset use cases leading to the decentralization of finance (DeFi). Others, such as the founders of Ethereum, Ripple and more, were confident that a second wave of innovation could evolve without building it on top of Bitcoin, given Bitcoin\u0027s limitations and governance principles. They were convinced that a better platform could be built to suit all kinds of use cases. Developers spent years trying to “solve” Bitcoin problems. But maybe people finally realized there is no problem to solve. Bitcoin is what it is. That phase of evolution envisioned a blockchain as a protocol standard, like the “TCP IP standard,” as a layer on top of Bitcoin. With the Bitcoin blockchain not able to satisfy the innovation needs of the use cases that had been built on Colored Coins and other Bitcoin 2.0 layers, and with the acceleration of Ethereum-based innovation, all the cool kids started to build on top of Ethereum. It was a much better platform for testing, scaling and creating far more complex use cases in one of the biggest financial sandboxes in the world. The ICO (initial coin offering) period of 2017–2018 saw funding for many different use cases, along with a growing community of developers and a critical mass using Metamask. It became clear that Ethereum was taking the lead, becoming the go-to place to build your blockchain dream use cases. The ERC-20 standard won. The Ethereum community invented DeFi and made it the killer real-life use case. With Bancor being one of the first, a full industry started to form, including alternatives for loans, flash loans, yield farming and more. It quickly became the go-to for building applications, while Bitcoin was left behind as a platform, becoming maybe what it was “only” supposed to be – new and better gold. At the same time, new generic sandbox platforms started to emerge, including Polkadot and Cardano created by Ethereum\u0027s founders. It is close to impossible to develop a blockchain that perfectly fits all use cases. For example, using blockchain for micropayments is different than using it for NFTs. You can still develop NFT applications and use them on top of Ethereum. But wouldn\u0027t you prefer a blockchain and an ecosystem of tools tailored for your specific use case? On the back of the painful gas fees attached to using Ethereum (which also proves an incredible market fit for DeFi), there are talented teams, such as Cardano and Polkadot, trying to build other sandbox blockchain approaches like ETH, adding better scale, interoperability and other features. See also: Cardano’s ADA Is Now the Third-Largest Cryptocurrency by Market Cap As we are still in an emerging technology phase, anything and everything can happen. But the question that is most interesting to investors is where most of the value will be captured in terms of layers? The answer, I believe, depends on the use case. I believe that in some use cases, value will be captured on L1, and with some use cases, value will be captured on L2. More blockchains are choosing a niche market, understanding they cannot win in the race of a “blockchain for everything,” and deciding to be the go-to blockchain for a specific market. This is where we will see value being captured on L1 being the “go to“ blockchain for a specific use case. I envision this trend will keep accelerating. Take the USDC stablecoin. Will you send your dollars on an expensive and slow blockchain, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum? Or will you use a fast and low fees- based network, such as Algorand, that is focusing its resources on building the financial rails? See also: NBA Top Shot Overwhelmed by Demand in Record $1M Pack Drop FLOW was built for the NFT market and developed by the leading team that had experienced the disadvantages of using Ethereum with CryptoKitties. In my opinion, FLOW is one of the most exciting consumer-based blockchains, working with the National Basketball Association and other big players. We used to think that L1 should always be more valuable than L2 as all L2 protocols are being built on the foundation of an L1. It’s kind of similar to thinking of an app (L2) being built only on top of IOS (L1) and being worth more than the Apple stock. While rarely possible in the centralized world with Apple owning the app store, this is easily possible in the crypto decentralized world. For example, The Graph is one of the projects that makes you question that assumption. Its agnostic approach creates value on top of different L1 chains as well as for users looking to index the different chains. In the long term, I foresee each blockchain L1 will be “tagged” with a specific market, becoming the “blockchain for...” Those with no specific identity, that are trying to be a bit “better,” might “lose” their value to L2 while being measured only by their fees, just like banks today.

The venture\u0027s objective was to bring the 200-year-old paper-based bank guarantee process \"into the digital era.\" Normally in a paper-based system, validations on bank guarantees can take anywhere from a few days to a month because the process relies on cross-checking information manually.

Here are some ideas that could get more bottom-up traction.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Revolutions are the product of the masses, not the elites. Accordingly, we need to update the blockchain narrative to something more easily palpable for the average consumer and get on a path of attracting the millions of users. Granted, the decentralized finance (DeFi) revolution is already on its way and poised to challenge traditional finance, but aside from DeFi what are some promising scenarios that could take the blockchain into mainstream experience? Let\u0027s flip blockchain’s promise on its head and think of mainstream users first. Here are four usage scenarios that have a chance of being understood and adopted by mainstream consumers. Who wouldn’t like to be rewarded or compensated for their time, knowledge, data or hard work, whether online or not? Today, we have all become self-service slaves to a variety of online activities. Over the course of the Web 2.0 era, value capture shifted to the landlords who presented users with a buffet of actions. While these central players gave users some satisfaction and benefits, they reaped a lot more than they sowed or gave back. Blockchains are money systems that transcend the real world. Of course, cryptocurrency is the perfect internet native currency, but cryptocurrency can also touch the physical world. It could usurp loyalty programs and provide users with a more fluid and universal currency. See also: William Mougayar – We Still Lack a Rational Way to Value Tokens Blockchains can reward people for taking actions just as consensus protocols reward computers for mining and validating transactions. Steemit (now called Hive) users have already received $60 million in rewards since 2016. The Kin ecosystem (where I am an investor) grants a variety of earnings to users and developers, and has already dispensed over $15 million in rewards to its ecosystem of mobile App developers in the past two years. Earning by doing will become a fundamental right. It is a general purpose capability, just as user-generated content was for Web 2.0. We are used to storing valuables at home such as money, jewelry or art. However, when the value of these goods exceed what we can insure, or what we feel safe in keeping at home, we usually turn to banks or special custodians as more convenient safeguards for storing our liquid assets. Cryptocurrency offers alternative storage options via personal wallets or easy on-ramps to exchanges or a new category of crypto custodians that possess their own secure vaults. Today, many self-custody wallets already exist, allowing users to experience the self-service option for assets storage. Those same wallets also enable the storage of another blockchain novelty: “digitally unique” artifacts also known as non-fungible tokens (or NFTs; think CryptoKitties). In the long term, banks and old-style physical storage services may not be the most popular or safest storage methods anymore. Being your own custodian is an attractive value proposition that comes with a degree of freedom and efficiency, as long as its relative ease of use and trust levels continue to improve. Many users will gradually de-bank their assets and move them into self-custody to take advantage of new services that are only available in the blockchain world. Our driver licenses give us an explicit permission to drive on public roads. A bank card allows us to withdraw money or initiate transactions. Our house key lets us inside our homes. You can’t fake one key for another just as you can’t use your friend’s driver license as a substitute for yours and you can’t access any one else’s account with your bank card. What if there was a solid equivalent to all these “access” options online? What if blockchain technology (combined with our smartphones and biometrics) could be used to grant us a wide array of access privileges, both in the physical and online worlds? See also: William Mougayar - For DeFi to Grow, CeFi Must Embrace It The equivalent to the physical keychain holder will be a smart wallet that contains a variety of “special keys,” also known as tokens, that open access to a mix of activities, web sites or actually places. The software just needs to check that you have the proper “access right” in your possession, in the same way as when you pull a token from your pocket to retrieve your garment at a coat check, or rely on the electronic device in your car to automatically calculate and grant your toll payment when your car passes through. Many of the same self-custody wallets will also allow us to vote on a variety of issues just as easily as opening a mobile app and posting a picture or sending a tweet. We live in an age of instant online connections, yet most of these interactions are optimized for the individual, not the group. We sign up individually to sites that recognize us as one unique person. What if communities of similar interests were able to govern and rule themselves via clear and enforceable procedures such as voting, decision making and operational executions? Today, we can do some of that via online community forums (e.g., Discord, Facebook Groups) or a variety of online chat platforms (e.g., Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal). But once these groups are formed, implementing governance and instilling enforceable systems that mirror the values of its participants is not so easily done. Blockchain is perfect for empowering online community governance. Early versions already exist within DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), but a lot of work is still required before getting close to mainstream adoption, because these early DAO-based versions are quite geeky and assume that participants are steeped in technical capabilities. Newer apps to turbo-charge online communities are on the horizon. The above four use-cases are lighthouse beacons from which we can seek guidance. They are not perfect, but they are acceptable entry points that will usher us into a Web 3.0 era that is more about mainstream usages, and less about technical infrastructure jargon. The blockchain world is full of big ideas. Beyond DeFi, the narrative needs to inspire a much wider segment of the population. What if we could start earning real value by being online while also able to safely store what we earn? What if we became more efficient at self-organizing, while being empowered to also collectively act soon after? These use cases already exist within several microcosms. Now the rest of the world must get inspired to move them into the mainstream.

According to the announcement, the National Qualifications Archive program will upload all certifications achieved by Vietnam’s high school and higher education students to the TomoChain public blockchain to create a transparent and immutable record. Qualifications are currently managed by educational and training institutions, resulting in delayed verification processes by recruitment agencies and human resources, the statement said. Record-keeping and identity verification are applications of blockchain technology that could be applied to public administration. Earlier this year, U.S. lawmakers called on President Trump’s administration to consider using blockchain technology to upgrade health care and supply registries, and to use the technology to speed up verifying identities of individuals due to receive government benefits. “Diploma and certificate management is an issue that needs to be resolved by technology, which is significant for the whole of society and also cost-efficient for the diploma management system in particular, and education in general,” Vietnam’s Deputy Minister of Education and Training Nguyen Van Phuc said in a press statement. The archive initiative is Vietnam\u0027s largest exploration of blockchain technology to date and marks the first instance of a public blockchain being adopted at the national level by a major government, the announcement said. A number of countries and educational institutions have tested blockchain-based registries to keep student records. In 2017, Malta’s Ministry of Education struck a deal with a blockchain startup to track student credentials and academic records on a blockchain. The same year, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) issued 100 diplomas on a blockchain as part of a pilot program. Headquartered in Singapore, TomoChain has additional offices in Vietnam and Japan. It has its own crypto exchange, TomoDEX, powered by a layer-one protocol TomoX, which launched earlier this year. In September 2020, TomoChain acquired Lition, a German firm that provides public and private blockchain solutions with deletable data features. After a trial in Vietnam, up to 1.5 million diplomas of all types granted by educational institutions under the MOET will be entered into the system. The nationwide system is set to be implemented for the 2020-2021 school year, TomoChain said.

Telokanda will use the Telos blockchain to help university students and farming communities record and share weather data with the goal of improving climate research, hurricane tracking and local weather forecasting, the companies said in a statement Tuesday. According to the announcement, the project was developed by a team in West Africa that includes former Boeing and NASA engineer Nicolas Lopez. High-altitude weather balloons, launched by citizens in West African countries, will carry lightweight devices called radiosondes into the air while beaming atmospheric data, including pressure, temperature and wind speed, back to Earth. The project hopes to motivate citizens to participate in weather data collection by developing a method of sending digital currency instantly to people who launch their weather balloons, incentivizing timely and consistent launches, the announcement said. The announcement said that once a weather balloon transmits data to the blockchain, a smart contract will trigger payments in telos tokens (TLOS) to the operators\u0027 digital wallets. Each reward of about $15 can be converted to local fiat currencies such as the Nigerian Naira or Ghanaian Cedis via the Sesacash app. A spokesperson for the project told CoinDesk via email that at first rewards will come from the Telos Worker Proposal System but in the future, the funds will come from NGOs that want to use the data for weather forecasting and research. So far Telokanda has partnered with the University of Uyo and Rivers State University in Nigeria, as well as Academic City where students will launch the balloons and track the data. “This project can quickly grow into one that will save lives and help prevent billions of dollars in weather damage while rewarding local participants for their efforts,” Douglas Horn, chief architect of the Telos blockchain, said in a statement to the press. The project has so far completed eight launches. Starting out, Telokanda plans to have each university launch one balloon per week, scaling up to daily launches by 2021, the spokesperson said.

The trial, which was partly funded by the Australia government, surveyed 48 households in Fremantle, Western Australia, and found blockchain energy peer-to-peer energy (P2P) trading delivered lower costs \"desired by consumers.\" “Power Ledger has demonstrated how peer-to-peer energy trading can incentivise the right outcomes for the grid in a more cost-effective way,” Power Ledger chairman Jemma Green said in a press release. The trial ran between December 2018 and January 2020 as part of the RENeW Nexus Project and used Power Ledger’s blockchain technology to trace the transactions of rooftop solar energy traded between households. RENeW is an Australian national not-for-profit organization advocating for sustainable living. See also: Power Ledger to Bring Blockchain Energy Trading to West Australian Housing Developments A report detailing the findings of the trial and published earlier this month in a joint effort between Power Ledger, Curtin and Murdoch Universities found energy trading could provide localized energy markets with the ability to deliver a more stable power grid, at lower costs. Other findings included how the Australian tariff structure needed an overhaul in order to make P2P energy trading more attractive to the consumer as well as making it more readily accessible to deal with excess solar energy (during the day) in the grid without the need for government subsidies. “Participants had a positive view of P2P energy trading and could see its benefits but stated that changes to the tariff structure would be required to make it attractive,” the report claimed. Additionally, the project included a study of a distributed Virtual Power Plant (VPP) as well as a microgrid with a 670kWh battery that is to service homes in the \"East Village development in Fremantle.\" The Village is a sustainable development initiative featuring smart homes powered by green renewable energy.

ABI, made up of over 700 Italian banking institutions, expressed its desire to help speed up the implementation of a digital currency backed by the European Central Bank (ECB) by participating in related projects and experiments. Last year, ABI set up a working group to research digital and crypto assets. The group shared 10 considerations for a digital euro in Thursday’s announcement, starting with, “Monetary stability and full compliance with the European regulatory framework must be preserved as a matter of priority.” The group prioritized the need for a digital currency framework to be fully compliant with European Union regulations to win the public’s trust, and said banks will play a critical role in upholding that trust. In its second guideline, the group said Italian banks are already working with distributed ledger technology, referencing the Spunta project. The project was an initiative by the ABI Lab to integrate blockchain to accelerate the processing of interbank settlements. According to the group, a central bank digital currency (CBDC) would lead to future innovations to the traditional banking system like P2P transactions, machine-to-machine transactions and the ability to manage exchange rate and interest rate risk thanks to the programmable capabilities of digital currencies. “A programmable digital currency represents an innovation in the financial field capable of profoundly revolutionizing money and exchange. This is a transformation capable of bringing significant potential added value, particularly in terms of the efficiency of the operating and management processes,” the announcement said. Italy is not the first nation to express an interest in experimenting with a digital euro. Earlier this year, France’s central bank sent out a call for proposals for CBDC experiments. The Dutch Central Bank also announced the Netherlands was willing to trial a digital euro. Last year, the head of Germany’s Central Bank, Jens Weidmann, in a speech, warned a CBDC could destabilize financial systems. Later in the year, the Association of German Banks made an announcement advocating for a programmable digital euro. The Italian Central Bank has yet to comment on ABI’s announcement.

The OOC\u0027s Oil and Gas Blockchain Consortium has completed its first pilot of a produced water haulage management system using blockchain technology. The pilot, the first industry-wide use of a blockchain-native network for produced water haulage, essentially tried to streamline the process of transporting wastewater byproducts collected during the extraction of oil and natural gas, referred to as produced water. The pilot automatically measured volume and generated invoices during the transportation process. Developed in partnership with Data Gumbo, a blockchain software company based in Houston, Texas, the pilot found the new tools reduced the amount of time it takes to transport produced water. The process also required less human intervention and reduced costs, the consortium said. Water logistics and transportation firm Nuverra Environmental Solutions, and an unnamed midstream disposal company worked on the pilot, which was used across five oil and gas wells in the Bakken field in North Dakota.

The consortium set out to study and define blockchain use cases across the industry value chain in order to solve common pain points. The initial pilot results saw a reduction in the process workflow from 90-120 days down to between one and seven days, and reduced 16 steps to seven that require no manual intervention. In addition, 85% of all volume measurements are now automatically validated against the data provided by the various parties involved, and this figure could climb close to 100%, the release said. Validations during the process automatically triggered the execution of related invoice transactions which reduced financial risk by giving peace of mind that payments matched up with certain field activity.

We may find out soon enough. Enterprise blockchain products have been designed mostly as private networks, limited to authorized parties. This is supposed to make them more efficient than public chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum because fewer computers have to reach agreement on who owns what, and in a sense safer because the participants know each other. These products apply technology originally developed for the Wild West of cryptocurrency to a range of unglamorous corporate activities, including cross-border transactions, storing records, and tracking goods and information. Their promise has attracted some of the world’s largest corporations and software vendors. But like any software, they can in theory be hacked, although how to prevent that hacking isn’t as well documented. “I can’t recall a single major company announcing a loss of any kind from a hack on a private blockchain,” says Paul Brody, global blockchain lead at consulting giant EY. Read more: Meet Red Date, the Little-Known Tech Firm Behind China’s Big Blockchain Vision That may change in the near future as companies start bringing these gated systems out of the lab and into real-world use. “Big companies have been working on blockchain apps for a couple years now,” said Pavel Pokrovsky, the blockchain lead at Kaspersky, the Moscow-based anti-virus software vendor. “Soon, they will start pushing those apps into production and might face new challenges in managing their risks. As more such solutions get deployed, attacks on them might become more frequent.” One problem is that private, permissioned systems are most vulnerable to insider threats, both Pokrovsky and Brody said. “Insider risk is particularly high in private blockchains because the work that is usually done to secure information within the private network is very low compared to public networks,” said EY’s Brody, who has been a rare voice among the Big Four professional-services firms in stumping for open systems. “On public networks, we make extensive use of zero-knowledge proofs and other tools to keep sensitive data off-chain.” Only one or two of EY’s corporate clients went to such lengths with private networks, he said. “As a result, if you can gain access to the network or you already have it as an insider, nearly all the critical data is actually visible to all the members.” In general, Pokrovsky said, the most common type of attack that can theoretically be employed against an enterprise blockchain network is a denial of service attack. This is different from a DDoS, or distributed denial of service, where a company’s servers are inundated with useless requests that overwhelm them. Read more: Miners Trick Stablecoin Protocol PegNet, Turning $11 Into Almost $7M Hoard Denial of service, on the other hand, is a focused attack that uses knowledge – perhaps an ex-employee - rather than electronic muscle power. “Let’s say an employee of a company gets fired and he’s angry at his ex-employer. He goes to the dark web and sells his knowledge of the vulnerabilities in the system to hackers,” Pokrovsky said. In the case of enterprise blockchains, an attacker would need to know the addresses of the nodes and what can put them offline. “An attacker can overwhelm the node’s data storage capacity, flood it with useless calculations,” Pokrovsky said. “For example, one of our clients’ nodes could not process very large numbers, say, 12 zeroes and more. They would just freeze.” The cure for that kind of attack is proper filtering of the data entering the nodes, he said: “It’s a very widespread mistake, not filtering the incoming data.” Exploiting such a vulnerability is easy when you know where the nodes are and, unlike DDoS, it does not require buying traffic in the form of bots that flood your target with garbage traffic, or deploying a lot of hardware to attack the server. “You just write a simple script and send it to the nodes,” Pokrovsky said. Then the nodes go offline. This can be utilized for criminal purposes from sabotaging a competitor to terrorist attacks, Pokrovsky said. The situation can be exacerbated by the fact that the most convenient way to set up nodes for a private blockchain is to use cloud infrastructure so companies don’t have to figure out how to set up a physical node in their office. “Most private blockchains have very few nodes and, in many cases, they all reside inside a single cloud infrastructure, creating a single point of failure,” Brody said. “That also means that far from being immutable stores of information, they are in fact easy to erase or shut down.” The risks can vary. For example, Masterchain, the enterprise blockchain for banks developed under the auspices of Russia’s central bank, is a fork, or modified copy, of the Ethereum blockchain, which uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Taking down nodes on such a network would lead to the consensus re-distributing among the remaining nodes, which would continue to validate transactions. However, if it turns out all the remaining nodes are controlled by the central bank, the network participants might argue, the transactions recorded while everyone else was down are not legitimate, Pokrovsky said. Read more: DeFi Project dForce Refunds All Affected Users After $25M Hack “DDoS is an attack easy and cheap to organize, but it’s also easy to prevent, and services like Cloudflare can identify and effectively prevent it. But the denial of service is not identifiable by the filters such services use,” Pokrovsky said, adding that sometimes attackers don’t even need an insider to locate the nodes – it’s possible to find such information via open source intelligence methods. “It’s very hard to fix such vulnerabilities as the attack is happening, when everything’s crashed, everyone’s running around and everything is on fire,” he said – it’s better to try to predict such situations in a testing environment. If a blockchain uses smart contracts, they can be attacked as well, Pokrovsky said. “For the enterprise blockchains, the typical attack is when a contract contains variables that can turn out different for each node, for example, timestamps or random numbers,” he said. “In this case, every node would execute the smart contract with a different result and the transaction will not be recorded into the blockchain as a result.” If a smart contract refers to documents, there is another possible way to attack it: inserting malicious code into the document. Read more: Hacker Exploits Flaw in Decentralized Bitcoin Exchange Bisq to Steal $250K “It’s the same as the SQL injection attack and to prevent it you need to filter the incoming data and limit the use of external data by the smart contract,” Pokrovsky said. The fact that most private blockchains don’t enjoy the attention of a broad blockchain community is also a weakness, Brody said. “Perhaps the biggest risk posed by private blockchains is the risk of complacency,” he said. “Open source code that isn’t widely used and doesn’t have a vigilant community testing and inspecting it is far less secure and reliable than systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are continuously hardened by nearly constant attack and public inspection.” With an eye perhaps toward broadening its revenue stream, Kaspersky moved into blockchain-oriented research and consulting in 2018, first focusing on public blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Kaspersky has been working with crypto exchanges and completed a security audit for the trading software company Merkeleon in October 2018. In October 2019, Kaspersky started working with enterprise blockchains, too. Pokrovsky told CoinDesk the company audited a number of such systems, only two of which he could name publicly: Russia-based blockchain startup Insolar and Waves, which has been re-focusing from public to private blockchains since last year. Kaspersky software has been listed among the top 10 antivirus products globally by PC Magazine in March but it has been banned from being installed on U.S. government computers since 2017 as part of the U.S. response to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. That ban caused sales to plunge in the U.S. and Europe but they have expanded in Russia as well as Africa. Kaspersky reported 4 percent revenue growth in 2018. Kaspersky’s Waves Enterprise audit took three months, from November 2019 to the end of January 2020. “The task was to check the security of the nodes, network infrastructure and nodes’ web interfaces,” Pokrovsky said. The security firm ran what it calls “grey box” testing, in which the tester does not have access to the blockchain platform’s full code, but does have administrator-level access to the system. This kind of testing would show possible insider threats, like an ex-employee going rogue. After the testing is over, Kaspersky presents the client with the list of vulnerabilities and the client fixes them. Then the testing is run again. Pokrovsky would not disclose what weaknesses had to be “fixed” on Waves Enterprise’ blockchain. (Waves confirmed it hired Kaspersky.)

Alex’s new book is Financial Services Revolution. Together they wrote the report Blockchain Solutions in Pandemics. This is one of those rare turning points in history. The COVID-19 pandemic will profoundly change our behavior and society. Many institutions will come under scrutiny and, we hope, change for the better. At the Blockchain Research Institute, we’re doing our part to facilitate positive change. Technologies like artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, augmented/virtual reality, and above all, blockchain are more relevant than ever – not just to business and the economy but to the future of public health and the safety of global populations. Traditional systems have failed us and it’s time for a new paradigm. To build on Victor Hugo, “Nothing is more powerful than an idea that has become a necessity.” Given the urgent need for global solutions, the Blockchain Research Institute convened a virtual roundtable of 30 experts from five continents. We discussed the challenges of COVID-19 and the possibilities of using blockchain in areas of need. In our special report, “Blockchain Solutions in Pandemics,” we developed a framework for facing pandemics together in these five areas. 1. Self-sovereign identity, health records and shared data Data is the most important asset in fighting pandemics. If any useful data exists now, it sits in institutional silos. We need better access to the data of entire populations and a speedy consent-based data sharing system. To accelerate discovery, the blockchain startup Shivom is working on a global project to collect and share virus host data in response to a call for action from the European Union’s Innovative Medicines Initiative. In Honduras, Civitas – an app developed by the start-up Emerge – is linking Hondurans\u0027 government-issued ID numbers with blockchain records used to track medical appointments. Doctors simply scan the app to review a patient\u0027s symptoms verified and recorded by telemedicine services. Dr. Raphael Yahalom of MIT and the Oxford-Hainan Research Institute is working on Trustup, a trust-reasoning framework that can systematically highlight the ways in which health data recorded on a blockchain ledger is more trustworthy than data stored in conventional databases. The trade-off between privacy and public safety need not be so stark. Through self-sovereign identities, where individuals own their health records and can freely volunteer it to researchers, we can achieve both. 2. Just-in-time supply chain solutions Supply chains are critical infrastructure for our globally connected economy, and COVID-19 has put them under tremendous strain, exposing potential weaknesses in their design. We must rebuild supply chains to be transparent, where users can access information quickly and trust that it’s accurate. The start-up RemediChain is doing just that for the pharmaceutical supply. One of its co-founders, Dr. Philip Baker, was interested in tracking down and recycling unused but still efficacious medications such as those used for cancer. He saw blockchain as means of recovering their chain of custody: Blockchain serves as a “state machine” that gives us visibility into the state of our suppliers as well as the assets themselves. When COVID-19 hit, the start-up VeriTX – a virtual marketplace for digital assets like patented design files – pivoted to medical supplies, so that medical facilities could print the parts needed at one of the 180 3D printing facilities in VeriTX’s network. VeriTX can reverse-engineer a part and then build it much faster and at a lower cost than getting it from the original manufacturer or replacing the equipment. 3. Sustaining the economy: How blockchain can help If supply chains are the machinery of global commerce, then money is its lubricant. Yet, money as a carrier of the disease has been a stressor during this pandemic. We highlight the what, why and how of digital cash as an alternative. Costs are also an issue. The Ethereum-based Solve.Care platform is dramatically lowering health-care administrative costs so that more of a patient’s medical budget goes directly to care. The health crisis has also become a financial crisis, closing off access to supply chain credit. We look at blockchain-based financing solutions such as Chained Finance and fundraising efforts like that of the Binance Charity Foundation. Finally, decentralized models of governance such as those created by blockchain startups Abridged and Aragon can transform how NGOs, governments, and communities respond to the crisis. 4. A rapid response registry for medical professionals Front-line medical professionals are the heroes and our last line of defense. Yet, hospitals can’t onboard people fast enough. This is not for lack of talent; it’s the inability to find those with proper credentials. Blockchain platforms such as Dock.io, ProCredEx and Zinc.work help to streamline coordination among different geographies, departments, and certification bodies so that supply and demand for healthcare workers – as well as the process for verifying their skills – becomes more efficient and transparent. 5. Incentive models to reward responsible behavior People respond to incentives. Blockchain serves as a mechanism to synch up the incentives of stakeholder groups around issues and activities, changing patterns of behavior in the process. For example, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada collaborated with Interac to micro-motivate healthy lifestyles, and Toronto’s University Health Network teamed up with IBM to put control over health records into patients’ hands. Many of these changes are beyond the timeframe of this round of COVID-19. But many can be implemented quickly. Governments must wake up to the blockchain opportunity. Every national government should create an emergency task force on medical data to start planning and implementing blockchain initiatives. They can stimulate the development of technology firms working on the solutions described here. They should partner with medical professional associations and other players to implement blockchain credential systems. The private sector affected by COVID-19 must still lead the way. They must start today by incorporating blockchain into their infrastructures. Companies need to continue their work on pilots framed around medical records, credentialing systems, incentive structures and other sovereign identity solutions. When designing these pilots, companies could consider embedding incentive systems for socially responsible behavior. Emergencies turbocharge the pace of historical progress. Businesses like Zoom, once used mostly by technology companies, have become ubiquitous tools of daily life. Meanwhile, 20th century titans are asking for bailouts. By necessity, human behavior – from where we work and when to how we socialize – changes overnight. Add to this mix the exponential properties of blockchain, and we’re setting ourselves up for a cataclysm of some kind. We anticipate a real crisis of leadership as the new digital-first and digital-only models conflict with the old industrial tried-and-true. Maybe this awful crisis will call forth a new generation of leaders who can help us finally get the digital age on track? Who among us will step up?

Led by the State Information Center, the Blockchain Service Network (BSN) is poised to launch for domestic commercial use Wednesday and globally on April 25. If it works as envisioned, companies and software developers will be able to plug into the BSN and build blockchain-based applications as easily as assembling Lego sets. But the ultimate goal may go well beyond technical support for coders. “As the BSN takes hold in worldwide countries, it will become the only global infrastructure network that is innovated by China, whose gateway access is controlled by China,” declares the latest white paper penned by the BSN Alliance, led by the government agency, several state-owned entities and blockchain firms. As such, the project has geopolitical and macroeconomic implications. “The move is very much like the ‘One Belt One Road Initiative’ in which China provides other countries with infrastructure and gains some first-mover advantage,” said James Cooper, a law professor and director of international legal studies at California Western School of Law. The project also reminds Cooper of \"Made in China 2025,\" a nationwide initiative to spearhead innovation in areas such as robotics and artificial intelligence, he said. The subtext is a desire to overcome China’s image as a copycat, reverse-engineering innovations from elsewhere. In the October announcement of the BSN\u0027s internal testing, the Chinese government envisioned a variety of use cases. These included smart city applications, which use sensors connected to the internet to collect data and glean insights for managing public resources; in particular, the alliance mentioned energy conservation. It also listed identity registration and data storage as opportunities for BSN. “China has the ambition to be the technology leader in the world. And I think they might have enough technology chops to pull this off, at least within the blockchain industry,” said Edith Yeung, managing partner at blockchain-focused venture capital firm Proof of Capital.

Hong Kong and Singapore are among the 56 cities where the alliance is testing the network first. “We have already deployed some international nodes in other countries, such as the U.S, Japan, Australia, Brazil, South Africa, Singapore and France,” Leon Li, CEO of crypto exchange operator Huobi Group, said through a spokesperson. His Singapore-based company’s blockchain development arm is a founding member of BSN. Other countries will have incentives to join the network, Yeung said, pointing to the BSN’s business-friendly priorities. “They get the selling point for enterprises right in their white paper,” she said. “For anyone to come on board, it needs to be low-cost, fast deployment and easy to manage.” The initiative – which is rolling out next week after a six-month internal test – is led by the State Information Center, a government agency under the National Development and Reform Commission, as well as state-owned telecommunication giants including China Telecom, China Unicom and payments firm China Union Pay. But the BSN itself is not a blockchain protocol. Rather, it’s a centralized platform that has done the heavy lifting for developers so they can plug in and code, choosing from several enterprise blockchain protocols or public chains. The goal is to reduce their operational costs, improve flexibility and provide better regulatory oversight, according to the white paper. “Designed to unify the fragmented market, BSN is a cross-cloud, cross-portal and cross-framework public network that enables developers to easily and affordably develop, deploy, operate and maintain permissioned ... and permissionless blockchain applications and nodes,” Li said. During the beta testing period that began on Oct. 15 of last year and ends Wednesday, more than 2,000 participants signed up. A third of them are enterprises while the rest are individual developers, Li said. One of the network’s advantages for BSN is its low price, which makes it accessible to a wider range of users compared to some of its prospective competitors, according to Li. “Deploying [distributed ledger technology] applications on major cloud services such as Ali Cloud and Huawei Cloud can cost developers tens of thousands of dollars per year,” he said. “To make it less cost-prohibitive for developers to deploy DLT applications, the minimal cost on BSN is only $300 per year.” Read more: Fintech Firm Joins Chinese Conglomerate to Build Blockchain Platform The low price will encourage a vast number of small and medium-sized enterprises and individuals, including students, to use the BSN to invent and innovate, thereby accelerating the rapid development and widespread use of blockchain technology, Li said. According to the white paper, there are two main parts to laying the groundwork. The first is deploying the so-called public city nodes, essentially data centers or cloud computing resources dedicated in certain cities to processing transactions. The white paper boasts that the BSN has signed up 100 city nodes via its telecom members and is hoping to deploy up to 200 more by the end of this year. The second part is the configuration and modification of several enterprise blockchain protocols to fit uniform standards, in areas such as cryptography and software development kits (SDKs), so these systems can work in conjunction with each other. So far, the BSN has configured and added several permissioned blockchain protocols to its pool including Hyperledger Fabric, the open-source software Walmart uses to track food along its supply chains. The network has done the same for China’s home-grown protocols such as internet giant Baidu’s Xuper Chain, and FISCO, developed by a consortium of China’s Shenzhen government agencies and local tech companies including Tencent, WeBank and Huawei. Most recently, CITA, the enterprise blockchain project initiated by developers at Cryptape, who backed the development of Nervos public chain, has also been added to the BSN. Once authorized by the alliance and given a standardized SDK, developers will be able to choose a protocol and rent computing resources in locations they need to deploy a blockchain application. Because the permissioned protocols are adapted to support interoperability, developers will have more flexibility to switch from one to the other, the whitepaper said. The top-down approach enables China to build a large-scale network quickly while avoiding regulatory red tape, Cooper said. “China has a national strategy.” In an initial BSN white paper published last year, the alliance only mentioned support for Hyperledger Fabric, the permissioned blockchain initiated by the Linux Foundation with contributions from tech giants including IBM. Unlike the public blockchains underpinning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which anyone with an internet connection can download and run, permissioned systems can only be used by approved parties. But the latest version of the white paper said it’s also including other permissioned blockchain frameworks. More surprisingly, it specifies the BSN will incorporate two public protocols: Ethereum and EOS. There are a few reasons why the Chinese government is wary of open networks. Numerous scammers in the country lacking any technical foundations have used “community-driven” public chain projects to raise money from investors via initial coin offerings (ICO). Even public chains with legitimate technology pose risks, as the Chinese government sees it. If widely adopted as currency, digital tokens could undermine the Chinese central bank’s monetary sovereignty, for instance. Still, while the Chinese government has predominantly focused its resources on private blockchain projects, it has been engaging in public blockchain projects cautiously and discreetly. The Shanghai government, for example, announced it would write grants and set up a research institute for Conflux, a public chain project founded by a group of top Chinese engineers. China Merchants Bank International (CMBI), whose major shareholders include entities partly or fully owned by the state, is working with Nervos, a public permissionless network, to develop blockchain-based financial applications. The logic behind the government’s (limited) involvement with public chains is that China needs to understand the technology, and it could have its own Ethereum-like networks if such systems succeed, said Omer Ozden, chairman of RockTree Capital. Yeung said the Chinese government is surprisingly savvy about grassroots developer communication. “If you look at their website and WeChat channel, they are now hosting their second developer competition,” she said. According to Li, BSN doesn’t support public chains in China, but it will support Ethereum and EOS nodes outside China after the international beta testing phase ends in July. Such a change attests to China’s complicated relationship with public blockchains. Such networks underpin major cryptocurrency assets that are seen by the authorities as a source of speculation and systemic risk. But they arguably inspired the country’s pursuit of a central bank digital currency (CBDC). In the early days of its CBDC development, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) considered distributed ledger technology but has pivoted to exploring a sort of middle ground between decentralization and centralization. “China is doing what they say they would do,” Yeung said. “Their virtual currency may be rolled out within a year. And they are doing it, at least the infrastructure piece, even with everyone locked up during COVID time for the past 90 days.” The BSN white paper spells out the thinking of the state-sponsored group that the “complete decentralization” and “libertarian” nature of public blockchains make them ungovernable. “Many countries are able to formulate their own regulatory policies in relation to the Libra consortium blockchain founded by Facebook but are powerless over the permissionless blockchain framework of bitcoin,” the white paper said. Therefore, even though the BSN will support Ethereum and EOS, “it is not allowed to deploy and operate public blockchain nodes on BSN portals and city nodes that are within China.” The logic behind the digital yuan and BSN could be that China has to study these technologies to prevent a company like Facebook or another country from gaining a monopoly on digital currency, Cooper said. “I think the irony is that a highly centralized system is embracing a distributed ledger or a decentralized technology,” he said. As China aims to expand its network of its city nodes worldwide to create a global infrastructure, it’s unclear how well it will be received if the state controls the access points. A recent article in engineering publication IEEE Spectrum suggested BSN’s global partners, such as overseas developers or data center providers, may balk since holding the BSN’s root key – a unique passcode that’s generated to secure server interaction with a network – would allow the State Information Center to view transactions made on the platform. The white paper did not specify whether the authority could monitor transactions, only that transactions made within an application will be kept private from each other. However, Yeung believes the Chinese government wants to be able to track everything with the network. “There is nothing decentralized about BSN,” she said, arguing the setup will help the government to fight fraud. “If the government has access to everything via handpicked nodes, everything is developed and maintained by the government, no more cash,” Yeung said. ”It\u0027s hard to have any fraud if all telco, banks, transportation, Alipay or WeChat is part of the government network.” ","TAGS":"China, Blockchain Technology, Blockchain, Blockchain Applications, central bank digital currency, Evergreen, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Policy","CREATION_DATE":"Apr 14, 2020 at 7:30 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/04/08/power-ledger-inks-deal-to-allow-french-consumers-to-customize-green-energy-mix/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/rSsJC_nifbTcAnCdoVsKrmvxgR4\u003d/570x405/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/3R3I3MNQTFGXPEESLATXPWUQBI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Power Ledger Inks Deal to Allow French Consumers to Customize Green Energy Mix","INTRO":"The Australian firm is breaking into the European market with a new partnership that enhances the tracking and certification of green energy.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Power Ledger is moving into the French power market with a partnership that enables the tracking and certification of green energy supplies on the blockchain.

OneConnect Financial Technology, which is the fintech arm of China’s largest insurance company, Ping An Insurance, has entered into a joint program with the China Merchants Port Group (CMPort) to build a logistics system based on blockchain for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, according to a March 31 report by the China News Service, a state media publication. “Since the central government’s directive to develop blockchain technology from last year, Shenzhen customs, China Merchants Group and Ping An have started to work together to study blockchain applications in cross-border logistics,” Xiaoying Chen, director of Shenzhen Customs said in the report. The platform will include information from Chinese custom services, port operators, logistics companies, financial institutions and export and import firms in one single system via shared databases on chain. One of its goals is to offer a more efficient tracking system at a lower cost. Financial services will also be more accessible to the trade companies.

It could help government agencies to better supervise international trade and reduce processing time for financial institutions to provide export and import firms with trade finance services. OneConnect is one of the four “fintech unicorns” groomed by the state-backed Ping An group. One of its focuses is to apply blockchain to traditional financial services through its cloud technology. SoftBank led a Series A round in OneConnect with a valuation of $7.5 billion in 2018. The firm went public on the New York Stock Exchange in November last year. However, the initial public offering raised $359 million at a market value of $3.63 billion as of its first trading day on Dec. 13. The China Construction Bank – a national commercial bank – also invested in a blockchain-based trade finance platform where exporters and importers can connect with banks and lending agencies for short-term financing. The bank said last October trading volume on the platform had exceeded $53 billion since its 2018 launch.

Leveraging blockchain’s ability to process information transparently and efficiently, insurance service providers are relying on the technology to speed claims payouts in over 27 coronavirus affected Chinese cities, as well as Hong Kong, according to a report by South China Morning Post on Sunday. Xiang Hu Bao, a Chinese online mutual aid platform owned by Ant Financial, has added the coronavirus to its list of eligible claims, enabling a one-time payout of 100,000 yuan (US$14,320) for those affected by the virus. The claims-sharing platform was built on a blockchain network, leveraging the technology to service its 104 million users by speeding settlement claims and reducing fraud. The service has been made available on Alipay, the most used mobile payments app in China and globally. An Ant Financial spokesman in Beijing told the South China Morning Post that due to blockchain’s “trust-free nature,” Xiang Hu Bao has been able to process claims and conduct payouts at a much faster rate than with traditional methods. The move also increases transparency in a claimant’s process once the documentation has been submitted, as all parties involved can view the entire process on-chain within 24-hours of a patient visiting a clinic or hospital.

However, data availability is set to decline over the same period due to blockchain technology replacing traditional business processes. By initiating smart contracts and eliminating all access to data otherwise available from third-party intermediaries it would remove those third parties from the transaction. “This variable could leave participants in a worse position than if they did not participate in the blockchain smart contract process. As such, an organization’s overall data asset availability would decrease by 30 percent by 2023,” added Jones. Gartner’s recent report, “Predicts 2020: Data and Analytics Strategies — Invest, Influence and Impact” (paywalled), also said smart contract technology remains very much in its infancy, with globalized organizations slow to adopt it. The net impact, however, is a positive result for data and analytics return on investment (ROI), the report noted. Smart contracts are programs or protocols operating on a blockchain that facilitate, verify or execute business processes triggered by events as well as on-chain transactions or interactions with other smart contracts.

Avivah Litan, an IT industry analyst at Gartner, said in a survey, said that“75 [percent] of IoT technology adopters in the U.S. have already adopted blockchain or are planning to adopt it by the end of 2020 out of more than 500 U.S. companies.” Blockchain technologies can create a trusted environment for data transmissions between virtual networks or devices while increasing efficiency of such exchanges, according to the survey. According to Litan, of the 75 percent of blockchain adopters, 86 percent are implementing both IoT and blockchain in various projects. The IoT companies aim to integrate computing devices with digital and mechanical machines to avoid human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. For example, Apple Watch and Amazon Alexa are using these technologies in consumer goods. The technologies can also be used in the healthcare, industrial and military sectors. Increased security and trust in shared multiparty transactions are the top benefits when the companies combine blockchain and IoT technologies, according to 63 percent of the survey respondents, while 56 percent said the top benefit is an increase in business efficiency and lower costs. However, Litan cautioned that blockchain implementations related to protocol changes could be difficult for long-lived IoT devices due to its relatively high volatility. “Some blockchain implementations struggle to scale to the transaction rates that can be generated by large numbers of connected things,” Litan said, expecting the necessary evolution in both blockchain and IoT to mature in five to 10 years.

Only five companies are authorized Hyperledger Certified Service Providers (HCSP), allowed to offer support, consulting, training and professional services, including installation, configuration and troubleshooting, to other enterprises exploring blockchain technologies, Hyperledger said. The three U.S. members are IBM, Accenture and Chainyard, while the two from China are Ant Financial, formerly known as Alibaba’s Alipay, and Beijing Peersafe Technology. Four months before the Hyperledger announcement, Peersafe raised a series C funding from Shanghai Civil Military Integration Development Fund, which invests in dual-use technologies that could be used for both civilian and military purposes. As the fund injected cash in the firm, Peersafe has fully embraced that partnership which could foster a deeper connection with its clients in the military and government agencies. Founded in 2014 and one of the top three firms in terms of blockchain patents, with 14 approved and 55 pending as of June 2019, Peersafe provides infrastructure for blockchain-based platforms across China, including those created for the government. Peersafe claims to be the only Chinese firm that has all three government-issued qualifications: the Commercial Cryptography Product Category Certificate, Sales Permit of Information Security Products for the Ministry of Public Security and Software Supplier for Central Government Agencies. But its involvement in the military side has been largely unexplored until now. The new certification program has qualified Peersafe for Hyperledger Fabric, a distributed ledger technology intended as a foundation for developing applications such as a logistics tracking platform and a secured information system. Peersafe helped revamp a blockchain-based trade finance platform that has more than $53 billion transaction volume since its launch in January 2018 for China Construction Bank, one of the four major state-owned banks in the country. But its biggest applications for China could be for strengthening government control of the military. The official mouthpiece for the military, PLA Daily, detailed a plan in how to leverage blockchain technologies to enhance military management and national defence. According to a report published this month, the Chinese armed forces would use blockchain technologies to secure classified information and communications, evaluate military training performances and monitor logistics. For example, the system could be used to automatically submit shooting records onto a blockchain along with each soldier’s identity and timestamp of the training, and increase the reliability of the results. Citing IBM and Samsung’s blockchain-based logistics platform, the PLA Daily report said the army could also better manage its logistics with lower cost on a blockchain-based platform. The smart contract protocol could build “technical trust” and secure peer-to-peer communications where people from different departments can collaborate without approvals from higher levels, the report said. Adding to the military blockchain projects now being undertaken globally, Peersafe’s alliance with the Chinese army and security apparatus is likely to deepen as more applications of the technology are developed and applied to its use cases. The private equity fund that bought into Peersafe is part of Shanghai Guosheng Group, a state-owned investment company with over $7 billion assets under management. The state-owned investment giant set up the fund in 2017 amid Chinese president Jinping Xi’s push for civil-military technology integrations after he established and took the helm of the Central Civil-Military Integration Development Committee. One of the committee’s goals is to look for technologies that could be used for national defense and information security services in the military, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). According to a report from the National Defense University titled Chairman Xi Remakes the PLA: Assessing Chinese Military Reforms: “China’s impetus for pursuing CMI (Civil-Military Integrations) as a core component of its PLA reforms is in large part a result of its reckoning with modern technology-driven warfare.” The report indicated the civil-military integration initiatives could reduce China’s military budget as the nation is challenged by the recent slowing economic growth. When announcing the Shanghai Guosheng Group investment in June, Peersafe’ CEO Ting Yan said, “Existing use cases across different sectors and special qualifications in the industry have laid a solid foundation for the firm to expand into the military security industry.” “The fund will bring Peersafe a range of resources, including use cases for the military and state-owned enterprises,” Yan said. “Peersafe and the fund can benefit from shared brand effect, technologies, distribution networks and client base.” The extent of the blockchain universe opening up to Peersafe via the Chinese army is evidenced by the case of the printer toner cartridges developed through cryptography that’s led a merger of what could be the first profitable blockchain developer in the country. Hengjiu Technology, a toner cartridge producer for printers, has a long-running partnership with the PLA to prevent eavesdropping bugs from entering this overlooked backdoor. Hengjiu borrowed heavily to pay $20 million for 71% of Minbo Information Technology, an information security and cryptography firm that’s been serving the Chinese army and other government security agencies for a decade, according to an equity transfer announcement filed with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Military and government will be two of the driving forces for information security industry, Minbo said in its recent annual reports. In its 2016 annual report, Minbo said it was certified to build a quality control platform from military weapons and, according to its 2017 annual report, by the Fujian National Administration for Protection of State Secrets to repair or destroy computers and paper-based medium. Mionbo is applying to serve the government and military projects that include higher levels of classified information, according to Chinese news reports, as well as already holding top qualifications from government authorities including the State Cryptography Administration. In the acquisition filing, Minbo said it aims to make over $28 million net profit in the next six years, with at least $2 million net profit for 2019. According to a Chinese media report, it could become the first firm that makes a profit in that range in the blockchain industry as military contracts boost the bottom line. Blockchain for military uses is not spoken about loudly, but already pervasive outside China. The U.S. and Russia are also on the lookout for such technologies to improve their armies’ capabilities. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the research arm of the U.S. Department of Defense, said in July it was starting to experiment with blockchain to secure communications and personnel data. DARPA aims to create a more efficient and secure platform to allow personnel from anywhere to transmit messages or process transactions that can be traced through numerous channels of a decentralized ledger. The application would be used in different ways, including facilitating communication between units and headquarters, and transmitting information between intelligence officers and the Pentagon, the agency said. DARPA also has been trying to develop an unhackable code—which blockchain could facilitate—because the technology offers intelligence on hackers who try to break into secure databases, it added. According to a March blog post by blockchain software company ConsenSys, the Russian Ministry of Defense is launching a research lab to analyze how blockchain technology can be used to mitigate cybersecurity attacks and support military operations. One of the priorities of the lab is the development of an intelligent system to detect and prevent cyber-attacks on important databases and weapons systems, the report said, citing the Russian daily newspaper Izvestia. The report warned the U.S. and other western militaries about the rise of blockchain adoptions in the Chinese and Russian armies. “It is critical for the future integrity of our key weapons systems and national security assets that we act now rather than waiting for a crisis to alert us to the dangers of cyber-attack on non-blockchain defended systems.” ","TAGS":"China, Blockchain Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Finance","CREATION_DATE":"Nov 18, 2019 at 12:25 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/16/blockchain-for-ethical-practices-raises-4-million-in-seed-funding/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/dGwsER-OhwG-dDExNddrvKreEO0\u003d/570x381/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/Y7WIJEWRDBHRVHOF3J5CTMRCFE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain for Ethical Practices Raises $4 Million in Seed Funding","INTRO":"A blockchain startup for ethical supply chain management just raised $4 million in seed money.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A blockchain startup for ethical supply chain management just raised $4 million in seed money.OpenSC, a joint venture of the BCG Digital Ventures and environmental protection group the World Wide Fund, announced today $4 million in seed funding from investors Christian Wenger and venture fund Working Capital.

It’s the “V” or ‘verifiable’ in VDF that makes the approach so unique.\"“It’s trustless,” according to Drake. “For the first time, it adds this notion of time with which you can build all these cool things.”Included in the \"cool things\" promised by VDF tech is \"unbiased proof of randomness.\" Effectively, it could enable trustless, truly random number generators on blockchains. Currently, these are pseudo-random and can be exploited by bad actors by effectively being able to guess the number. With true randomness, that wouldn\u0027t be possible.If the tech can be advanced sufficiently it could help to move blockchain such as ethereum from the energy-intensive and hence costly proof-of-work algorithm to one called proof-of-stake.“The Ethereum ecosystem alone currently uses on the order of 850 megawatts to extend blocks. That’s about $460 million in running costs per year,” said Tim Boeckmann, senior startup business development manager for AWS in the U.K. “With VDFs in Ethereum, there is an opportunity to bring down that cost to less than $0.13 million for the 0.25 megawatts of energy to power the hardware random beacons.\"In fact, the competition is being held in partnership with the Ethereum Foundation, as well as other alliance members, the Interchain Foundation, Protocol Labs, Supranational, Synopsys, and Xilinx, which are sponsoring the event \"with support from AWS.\"As reported by CoinDesk previously, the Ethereum Foundation is already working on the VDF problem, revealing in February that it was considering spending $7.5 million in the search for true randomness.VDFs are envisioned for use in ethereum\u0027s much-anticipated proof-of-stake system called Serenity, to which the ethereum network will migrate in the next few years.The first round of the competition will run till the end of September, and will award prize money to the fastest design that solves the problem at the top of this article.In the initial round of the competition, successful entrants will be awarded $3,000 for every nanosecond improvement. Full details can be found here.Drakes suggests that those entering will need a blend of skills.“You are going to need people who are really good at hardware design, but also people with algorithmic skills,” he said. “My guess is the winning team will have a combination of that expertise.”AWS image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Ethereum, News, Competitions, AWS, other-public-protocols, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Aug 2, 2019 at 12:30 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2019/07/31/nba-and-cryptokitties-creator-team-up-to-launch-in-game-collectables/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Fme4nBuLMjC-YnYZBIs4UQ4SV4Y\u003d/570x340/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/ONMUQGHFQNDFRBCWIKKBE63FZY.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"NBA and \u0027CryptoKitties\u0027 Creator Team Up to Launch In-Game Collectables","INTRO":"You can now buy in-season highlights from the NBA\u0027s biggest stars via the creators of CryptoKitties.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The National Basketball Association (NBA) and Dapper Labs are teaming up to announce the launch of a digital platform for blockchain-based collectables, NBA Top Shot.According to the companies, fans of the game can buy, sell, and trade digitally collectable in-season moves like “Kevin Durant’s 3-point shot or Joel Embiid’s dunk.” Digital collectables can be used for on-chain games or tournaments.Similar to current products like NBA 2K, Dapper’s NBA Top Shot allows users to acquire players and build rosters with an additional hook: purchasing specific moves from the prior season.Dapper Labs next product comes two years after the launch of CryptoKitties, the number one blockchain-based game, and months after a pre-sale and of its second major game, Cheese Wizardz.The National Basketball Association is joined by the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), a player’s union founded in 1954.

First, our existence is framed by a never-ending race for efficiency and productivity, or in the case of the crypto community, for the perfect model, for perfect consensus. But this clashes with the human search for a purpose and meaning, whose discoveries often invalidate applications of technology that otherwise seem perfect on paper.It’s in this context that the broad concept of “blockchain” matters. Since my very first encounter with it in 2011, and over the course of my experience as an investor, entrepreneur and corporate executive in this space, I have come to this realization: blockchain is not a technology. In isolation, as a model, it will not be the solution to all our problems as propagated by innumerable hyped-up articles. “Blockchain” as a concept has the potential to be extraordinarily powerful if and only if, we as a society are willing to change our own direction and purpose.The core characteristics of blockchain, with its intent to generate an ostensibly immutable record of history, a commonly shared “truth,” offer us a fresh opportunity to re-think and re-design our behavior, to organize our decision-making and to reach the heart of our existence. It forces transparency while highlighting human inefficiencies, bringing to light our propensity to deceive in order to usurp power. And it highlights that it is we, the humans in the middle, who stand as the principle obstacles to our efforts to build the best version of our societies, our companies and our world.In short, the principles that underpin blockchain point to a potential resolution of the conflict that technological change imposes on our search for meaning. The irony is that if that potential is to be realized, we must also embark on some deep soul-searching and enact change from within.On can be forgiven for concluding that those with the power to organize modern society have imbued it with a kind of melancholy meaninglessness. We take on jobs that do little else but shuffle papers, or we move financial line items from one place to another, often without adding any productivity or positive outcomes.We complicate things, we create charts and models and presentations to uphold our smarts, our egos and most importantly, our power. Having lived and worked in 14 different places around the world, I can vouch for the fact that this power-driven structure, a system that thrives on fear, is universal. Human society itself needs to change before technologies and new ideas can have a meaningful impact we seek.Without that, “blockchain” will be nothing but a buzzword.We’re all aware of the resistance to innovation that exists within companies and other organizations, but we tend to describe it in clinical, structural terms and so miss the bigger picture. We need to go deeper.We must address the underlying fears that guard against meaningful change. Unless we stop being avaricious, this hype of “blockchain” will only have random impact in random places. We will be back to “shuffling,” and this time not of paper but of exabytes and exabytes of data controlled and manipulated by an exclusive few.The limits to blockchain realizing its potential are typically described by computer scientists in terms of the “scaling problem:” that it is too costly to amass the massive amount of computational power needed to replicate the processing of all the world’stransactions “on chain” across multiple nodes. This is indeed a problem, but it’s one that some very smart people are striving to overcome.I believe a far greater obstacle to blockchain’s success lies in our collective lack of imagination and in a generalized unwillingness to create models that do not feed into the current capitalist system. The success or otherwise of blockchain solutions is too often framed in terms of the quarterly results expected by shareholders and by a blind adherence to the incumbent mode of operation.All of that puts a block on true innovation.A small example: When I was at GE, we explored ways to better utilize the large amounts of electricity that’s generated when the aviation division conducts legally mandated test of its customers’ engines. Most of that electricity is grounded and left unused. So, we proposed using that excess power to mine cryptocurrencies as an alternative means of financing the aviation division. The CEO of that division nixed the idea. It was too much of a change.This resistance to change is not just present in the corporate culture of established incumbents. After leaving GE, I entered the startup crypto world, and there I found that similar barriers to open, peer-to-peer collaboration exist within crypto developer communities.Power, competition and profit motives create these barriers and lead to a waste of resources, ideas and time. The central issue of self-interest results in a duplication of work. Ten different companies will tackle the same problem, each developing their own“best versions of blockchain.” They compete for dominance when a collaborative approach could better solve the problem at hand.Technology is not the obstacle here. If blockchain is to scale to the point where it can be relevant to the existing economy, then, we also need to change the mindset and motives that drive the crypto startup community. Harnessing the potential of blockchain is not technology problem, but a human one.All is not lost, though.There is a demand for change swelling in the general public, one to which all organizations, big and small, must respond. A zeitgeist against surveillance capitalism is going to demand that organizations relinquish centralized control over data and assets, re-empowering users. This will both force and enable companies to embrace aspects of decentralization. Evidence of this shift is already emerging in the rhetoric, if not yet the actions, of social media companies such as Twitter and Facebook, which are talking of promoting decentralized control of assets and identities, of privacy, and of peer-to-peer transactions.The right to privacy is a basic human right. We are the creators of data that is exploited and owned by corporate giants and the government. In the next generation of the Internet, we need to shift power from these centralized systems to we who reside attheir edges, so that we protect our data and self-monetize the assets that arise from it. Blockchain potentially has a role to play in this, but only if its own ego-driven fiefdoms can step aside and collectively work on standards and systems that are in the common good.We need to foster the development of a systemized collaborative community to bring about the change we need. What does that look like in practice? It means we must create pan-company consortia to develop reliable standards and scaling solutions that aren\u0027t hijacked by special interests inside either corporate incumbents or dominant crypto startups.It means we must define a role for government and civil society in setting the right legal and self-regulatory framework within which blockchain technology can develop in the common interest. It means educational programs to enable thought-leaders and doers who demonstrate an openness and willingness to utilize this technology in creative solutions with a real purpose. And it means exercising agility, not only in the workspace but also in our mindsets – to continuously bend, and not break.It is our responsibility to inspire this ideological change, to break free of models that optimize only to the demands of the existing capitalist system, It’s difficult, but it’s doable.People, technology image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, GE, Features, business news, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"May 12, 2019 at 1:59 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/11/the-fallacy-that-blockchain-is-stuck-in-one-place/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/ZdCeKO-8fJYtzi_M-bGnH3mgErI\u003d/570x393/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/DCYGLWKERNGXLJ4AVQHJOHW2HY.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The Fallacy That Blockchain Is Stuck in One Place","INTRO":"Blockchain skeptics wrongly assume that the technology is in stasis, writes Michael J. Casey.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.___________ One of the biggest rhetorical challenges blockchain advocates confront is something I’ll call “stasism:” their critics’ false assumption that the technology is in stasis, that it will never reach its potential because, in its current state, it’s too cumbersome, expensive or inefficient.This, I believe, is one of two flaws in a widely circulated anti-blockchain screed by Bruce Schneier, who made no reference to the ongoing work of engineers, regulators, and business leaders who are constantly improving this new value exchange system so it can eventually work at scale in the real world. (The other flaw is that in attacking the myth of a “trustless” world where “math is law,” he created a straw man, since only the most naïve proponents of this technology share that nightmare vision of a system devoid of human authority.)But the purpose of this column is not to pick a fight with Schneier, one of the smartest, most respected minds in IT security. That strikes me as a risky undertaking.Instead, I want to point out a few breakthroughs from the past couple of weeks that have reinforced my belief in the ongoing inventiveness of the people working in this industry and, by extension, in the technology’s vast potential. This is not, by any means, an industry in stasis.There are no doubt countless other new ideas and breakthroughs worthy of attention that won’t get a mention here. (I’m quite certain my Twitter mentions will again fill up with people accusing me of bias for not including their favorite new coin project.) So treat these merely as examples of a much wider creative process.What I can say is that these ones stood out to me because they come from outside the box. This is how challenges faced by new technologies are always solved: by looking at the problem differently.Consider Abra’s new product offering: a non-custodial wallet that uses the bitcoin blockchain to allow investors to get fractionalized exposure to the price movements of real-world capital market assets such as stocks, bonds and ETFs, all with as little as $5 down.The service combines smart contracts, price feeds, and automated, on-chain execution to allow short-term price bets to be rolled over or settled in bitcoin without Abra taking custody of private keys or assets, according to the company. The model opens a host of new possibilities for disintermediated investment markets.We’ll have to see how regulators react if this product takes off, but for now it looks as if Abra’s design has done an ingenious runaround of existing commodity and swaps trading rules. Abra is working under legal guidance that, because contracts created using its app will be rolled over or settled with “physical” delivery of bitcoin, and because the company has no role in that clearing process or in the custody of a customers’ keys, it is exempt from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u0027s registration requirements.Why this idea most matters, I believe, is that it leverages the power of bitcoin, not as a currency per se, but as an immutable, decentralized settlement system. The bearer instrument aspect of bitcoin is integral to the design, as it becomes the “commodity” being delivered, but it’s the prospect of decentralized, smart contract-executed settlement that contains the real power of this idea.All the legal, regulatory and intermediation costs that go into protecting people’s rights in existing derivatives contracts, with multiple middlemen, lawyers and compliance officers taking their cut, are absorbed instead by the consensus-driven decentralized network running the blockchain.It’s an outside-the-box model that opens up many possibilities.The combination of the Internet of Things and non-fungible tokens means that a wider array of assets, whether physical goods or digital products, will soon be given tradable digital representation. Abra-style contracts could allow efficient hedging mechanisms and synthetic investment strategies to evolve around what is an almost endless array of assets.What you still need, of course, are exchanges that match buyers and sellers of the underlying assets so that they enjoy efficient and effective price discovery (the price signal upon which Abra’s model depends). In essence, markets need a “place” for investors to meet and trade and a trustworthy means of broadcasting the price they agree to.The problem is that investors have until now had to trust retail exchanges with custody of their crypto assets. These have been frequently hacked or subject to double-spends, creating a security hole that Schneier cited as a core reason people can’t trust public blockchains. This risk was also spectacularly brought home by the stunning story of QuadrigaCX’s failure following the reported death of its CEO.So, what if investors could tap an exchange’s much-needed capacity for “matching” but retain full custody of their assets until they’re transferred to a buyer? That’s what Arwen, formerly known as Commonwealth Crypto, is aiming to achieve with the testnet release of its technology, now being used in beta form by crypto exchange KuCoin.Arwen’s tech offers further validation for the development of “Layer 2” solutions that revolve around the combination of smart contracts, multi-signature lock-ups of assets, and “atomic swaps.” Other ideas for decentralized asset trading are being developed on top the Lightning Network and by projects such as the Komodo Platform.Add to these advances the work on security token offerings, or STOs, by the likes of Polymath, Swarm and Securrency and we can start to imagine a future in which fractionalized claims of any size on mainstream, real-world assets are traded in a peer-to-peer manner and settled in real-time with very low risk.Yes, there’s a lot of work that needs to go into all these projects to make them viable. And, yes, we still need to achieve scalability of the underlying functionality of blockchains, which involves some trade-offs. And, yes, there is a tendency among some crypto zealots to hype the ideas spawned by this technology in utopian terms.But the people who will change the world are focused on building, not hyping. And they’re working on top of mostly open-source software that lets them collaborate, iterate, test and constantly improve their ideas.Those are the people making progress in scaling challenges, with both on- and off-chain solutions, and they are the people who are thinking outside the box to build exciting new trading applications such those highlighted here.If such work weren’t being done, well, sure, you could dismiss this field as an over-hyped, impractical solution in search of a problem.But, just as it would have been wrong to assume that the Internet’s usability would forever be confined by the snail pace of 14.4 kbps dial-up modems, so too is it misguided to assume that blockchain technology is stuck in one place.Onward.Chewing gumimage via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Token Economy, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/03/thai-government-agency-develops-blockchain-tech-for-elections-voting/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/nI-0k1-gBoejPpOlKgvPQKjQhIo\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/WEHCKMCB7RBPVMFZSVCZ2MJD2Q.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Thai Government Agency Develops Blockchain Tech for Elections Voting","INTRO":"A Thailand government agency has developed a blockchain-based solution that\u0027s set to digitalize elections voting in the country.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A Thailand government agency has developed a blockchain-based solution that\u0027s set to digitalize elections voting in the country.According to a report from Bangkok Post on Thursday, Thailand\u0027s National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC), a unit of the Ministry of Science and Technology, has already completed the development of the system for blockchain-based voting and is looking for trial partners.Chalee Vorakulpipat, head of the cybersecurity laboratory at NECTEC, was quoted as saying in the report:At this stage, the agency is looking to test the blockchain system on a smaller scale, such as for elections in universities, provinces and communities, and is seeking partners for the test.For large-scale implementation, such as for general elections, the agency will require more time as \"every voter needs to have an affordable mobile internet connection and identity verification,\" Vorakulpipat said in the report.Several countries have been looking to use blockchain technology for more efficient voting processes.

Backers include venture capital firms Sequoia China, crypto mining firm F2Pool and exchange Huobi, as well as Metastable and IMO Ventures.With the new capital, the foundation said it’s now looking to expand its 10-person development team. The goal: roll out a testing environment in February and officially launch a new public blockchain around the third quarter of next year.The project was co-founded by scholars from the University of Toronto and China’s Tsinghua University, including Dr. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, a Turing Award winner and an information sciences professor at Tsinghua. Named for renowned mathematician Alan Turing, the Turing award is given out yearly by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and is considered a kind of Nobel prize for computer science.According to an academic paper published in May, the group conducted a month-long experiment for the Conflux prototype late last year. Their efforts utilized the code of the bitcoin blockchain but changed the protocol from the Nakamoto consensus model, named for bitcoin\u0027s creator, to Conflux’s own design.\"We implemented a prototype of Conflux and evaluated Conflux by deploying up to 20k Conflux full nodes on 800 Amazon EC2 virtual machines,\" the paper stated. \"The throughput is equivalent to 6,400 transactions per second for typical bitcoin transactions.\"In an interview with CoinDesk, Dr. Fan Long, a co-founder of the project and an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Toronto, said the key design decision that he believes could help to scale public blockchains is to change the way blocks are ordered.Currently, most blockchains work in a rather linear way in that only one block can be produced at a time and added to the end of a chain. In the event of two blocks being created at the same time, the network relies on nodes to agree on which one will continue the chain.Long said this feature of blockchain results in a bottleneck that is problematic for most public networks, especially those like ethereum that aim to power smart contracts and decentralized applications.\"Some may have a higher scalability, but to some extent at the expense of a complete decentralization,\" Long said.The Conflux protocol, however, is designed to allow blocks to be produced concurrently to boost the volume of transactions.But to avoid forks, or the emergence of two competing versions of the ledger, Long said the group designed an ordering algorithm based on the concept of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that is able to make sure every block will be eventually arranged in a sequence by the network.According to Long, while the foundation utilized most of the original bitcoin blockchain code during its lab experiment, it will develop its own infrastructure for the public launch next year as the team hopes to include smart contract features.Further, the foundation said its investors will commit to using the network for future development.Long went on to say that the end goal is to create a scalable public blockchain with smart contracts that can deliver decentralized applications – and he made a sly dig at ethereum, whose scaling challenges were laid bare a year ago when CryptoKitties clogged that public blockchain network.\"That goal sounds easy and similar to what every other project is saying. But it\u0027s actually really difficult,\" Long said, concluding:Andrew Yao image courtesy of Conflux Foundation","TAGS":"Venture Capital, Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Protocol, News, Scalability, investments, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Dec 4, 2018 at 12:59 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/10/08/seoul-mayor-plans-100-million-fund-to-build-blockchain-smart-city/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/iZbFYdC79KokyODAQtOdz-ELtnA\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/MOUD2MXQ4RGFRPI7SS5FTU6I6U.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Seoul Mayor Plans $100 Million Fund to Build Blockchain Smart City","INTRO":"The mayor of Seoul plans to invest $100 million over the next five years to develop the South Korean capital as a smart city powered by blockchain.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Park Won-soon, the mayor of Seoul, has revealed a five-year plan to invest $108 million to develop the South Korean capital as a smart city powered by blockchain.In a speech during his visit to Zurich, Park announced last week that his Blockchain Urban Plan for 2018–2022 will cover 14 public services in five areas, with a government budget totaling 123.3 billion Korean won (around $108 million), according to a CoinDesk Korea report on Thursday.Park added that major public services that will adopt blockchain include labor welfare, vehicle history management, certification issuance, donation management and elections voting.The mayor explained, for instance, the Seoul Metropolitan Government will use the technology to protect part-time workers who don\u0027t have labor contracts or are not covered by employment insurance.These workers will be able to register via a blockchain application that will be developed as part of the plan. After that, labor welfare organizations and insurance companies, which participate as running nodes, could share workers\u0027 information over a distributed network and decide on insurance schemes, the report said.Park also indicated his administration aims to spend another 60 billion won, or about $53 million, building two complexes by 2021 to house 200 blockchain startups by utilizing parts of the Gaepo Digital Innovation Park and Mapo Seoul Startup Hub.The plan comes just months after Park won the re-election campaign as Seoul\u0027s mayor in June.

The research further explains that this issue largely arises from limited access to credit and loans for SMEs that are looking to expand their businesses. The researchers argue, however, that this missing funding can be reduced by $1 trillion if blockchain \"is used more broadly,\" since distributed networks are able to share business records across financial institutions along the supply chain and bring transparency to businesses\u0027 credibility. \"They would help mitigate credit risk, lower fees and remove barriers to trade,\" the researchers write, adding: \"If implemented, the main beneficiaries are set to be SMEs and emerging markets, which suffer most from a lack of access to credit and have ample room to grow trade.\" The researchers further added that a blockchain-based trade finance system would be particularly beneficial to Asian economies as they account for 7 percent ($105 billion) of the trade finance gap, with 75 percent of the global document-based transactions across supply chains. CoinDesk previously reported that authorities in mainland China and Hong Kong have both moved to launch blockchain-based trade finance systems in an effort to help SMEs gain more access to financing tools and to prevent fraud.WEF image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Research, Blockchain Technology, News, Trade Finance, capital markets, World Economic Forum, Supply Chain, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 13, 2018 at 8:20 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/09/11/major-french-soccer-club-plans-to-launch-its-own-cryptocurrency/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/zqB32Cv5qExwvbjEmF3UDLgMGK8\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/77BWGY4LGFFTNC3LR65YH5JOBE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Major French Soccer Club Plans to Launch Its Own Cryptocurrency","INTRO":"French soccer club Paris Saint-Germain is planning to issue its own cryptocurrency as a way to incentivize participation from its international fans.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), a major French soccer team in the country\u0027s top league, is planning to issue its own cryptocurrency as a way to incentivize participation from its fans around the world.PSG, which boasts prominent players including Brazil star Neymar, announced a multi-year partnership on Tuesday with a Malta-based blockchain startup called Socios that will tackle on the technology for the so-called Fan Token Offering.According to a French news site, PSG is now eyeing a deadline of spring 2019 to start issuing its proprietary tokens, making it potentially one of the first soccer clubs anywhere to do so.Rather than a monetary role for PSG\u0027s coin however, the goal is to allow fans who hold the token to be able to vote for and decide on less strategic matters, such as team jersey choices or opponents in friendly matches, the report said.Token ownership will further give fans access to more exclusive offers such as meeting with players or participating in certain matches, the report added.By adopting blockchain as the underlying technology for the issuance, PSG said the hope is to make the polling process more secure and transparent, with transactions being publicly visible.PSG\u0027s chief partnership officer Marc Armstrong commented in the announcement:With the news, PSG follows other European soccer clubs into embracing the idea of blockchain and cryptocurrency.CoinDesk reported last month that seven major clubs in the U.K.\u0027s Premier League including Newcastle United, Crystal Palace, and Leicester City inked a deal with online investment firm eToro to allow sponsorship payments in bitcoin.And, in August, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) said it had completed a \"successful\" trial of a blockchain-based ticketing application for a match between two top Spanish clubs.PSG jersey image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, France, Sport, Soccer, Voting, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 11, 2018 at 12:30 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/09/10/australian-state-pilot-puts-drivers-licenses-on-a-blockchain/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/VxNuO13MHSM_Gp9rvgoCv_EPLII\u003d/570x393/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/SZ7AOMSVQZENDLZMOGJ6NEMMW4.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Australian State Pilot Puts Driver\u0027s Licenses on a Blockchain","INTRO":"Australia\u0027s New South Wales government is turning to blockchain for a state-wide test of a driver license digitization program slated for November.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Australia\u0027s New South Wales (NSW) government is turning to blockchain for a state-wide test of its driver license digitization program scheduled for November.In an announcement on Aug. 20, the NSW government said it will conduct the pilot for 140,000 license holders in the state prior to a formal roll-out in 2019.

As such, the company hopes its system will eventually find use in streamlining and hastening the expense reimbursement process, while also reducing the prevalence of falsified receipts.Currently, China employs a somewhat complex system whereby merchants issue different payment receipts for individuals and firms. When staff need to be reimbursed for dining expenses, for instance, they must request a receipt for companies listing the exact taxpayer number of their employer.In order to do that, employees need to have the merchant manually type in the taxpayer number on the receipt in every instance. Furthermore, that process is typically followed by additional manual tasks, such as collecting receipts and filing a claim before they can receive a refund.The first batch of merchants to have integrated the system for the trial also include a parking lot at Shenzhen\u0027s Bao\u0027An Stadium, an automobile repair center and a restaurant owned by Tencent.Tackling a related issue in a different project, Tencent has also partnered with the Shenzhen government to battle tax evasion.In China, merchants are required to purchase a number of receipts – known as fapiao – from the authorities to act as advance tax payments prior to any sales. As they issue receipts to customers, merchants must calculate the difference between the prepaid amount and the actual tax arising from sales to provide a basis for the next round of tax payments. However, falsified receipts are common in China as a means of tax evasion.Tencent said that, by putting the issuance process on a traceable blockchain, it would provide tax authorities with a paperless taxation system via which it can track the circulation of receipts.WeChat image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Merchants, News, Tencent, republished, use-cases-verticals, business news, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Aug 10, 2018 at 9:31 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/08/10/world-bank-taps-australias-commbank-to-issue-its-first-blockchain-bond/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/qYnjP25gT8efbiNTGTfxfXHxCSI\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/VGSKCBQ5AJERLLW77AHHZ32F54.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"World Bank Taps Australia\u0027s CommBank to Issue Its First Blockchain Bond","INTRO":"The Commonwealth Bank of Australia has been chosen by the World Bank Group to help issue a bond over a blockchain.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The World Bank Group has partnered with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CommBank) to issue a bond over a blockchain.CommBank, one of the \"Big Four\" commercial banks in Australia, said in a release on Friday that it had won a mandate from the World Bank to arrange the issuance of the bond, which will be created, transferred and managed via a blockchain platform.The technology, already developed by CommBank\u0027s in-house blockchain lab, aims to have key parties in a bond issuance process such as investors and banks to be participating nodes in a distributed network.

It further facilitates the trading of corporate loans and letters of credit.While it\u0027s so far unclear if the firm plans a blockchain product based on the patent application, it notably comes a month after the Chongqing city government revealed its plan to create a \"blockchain digital asset exchange.\"As previously reported by CoinDesk, the news initially caused confusion in the Chinese cryptocurrency community, which speculated that it could mean a government-backed cryptocurrency trading platform.A government officially reportedly clarified later that the platform is focused on facilitating exchanges of \"non-standard assets\" such as credit loans and letter of credit,CQFAE Patent by CoinDesk on Scribd Auction bid image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"China, Blockchain Technology, News, Trading, Assets, Original, Bidding, use-cases-verticals, business news, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jul 20, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/07/19/barclays-seeks-twin-blockchain-patents-for-banking-services/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/cYbpW6ctQwGzCYR2sq3DWhFE63g\u003d/570x412/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/EZSJK4F7ANEPDGCMJK3ZB453MA.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Barclays Seeks Twin Blockchain Patents for Banking Services","INTRO":"Barclays Bank proposed using blockchain to make various banking processes more efficient in a pair of patent applications.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Barclays Bank may be looking to blockchain to streamline fund transfers and know-your-customer processes, according to newly-released patent applications.The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office published two applications by the U.K.\u0027s second-largest bank Thursday, both of which revolve around account security.

Previously, Huatai Yimei had encoded the images, website sources codes and other evidence through a third-party site named baoquan.com – a blockchain-based evidence deposition platform – and attempted to use that evidence in the proceedings.A primary question in the case, according to the judgement, had been whether blockchain can be used as a legal method to determine the authenticity of an item of evidence, similarly to a traditional notarization service.According to the judgement, Baoquan uses the bitcoin and factom blockchains to hash provided content and store it on a distributed network.Even if the disputed media assets should be taken down at a later stage, the court decided that evidence stored on the blockchain is sufficient to be legally accepted by the court. As such, the judge ruled in favor of the plaintiff.The decision marks one of the first officially sanctioned use cases for blockchain in legal proceedings.Formally incorporated in August 2017, the Hangzhou Internet Court is one of the first in China that processes cases purely through the web and has a responsibility to rule on disputes over internet-related intellectual property.According to the court\u0027s website, it has also launched a dedicated e-evidence platform that offers access to both traditional notarization services and authorized third parties, including blockchain-based evidence deposition platforms.Chinese yuan image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"China, Law, Blockchain Technology, Intellectual Property, News, Asia Pacific, Legal, Original, Evidence, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jun 28, 2018 at 12:35 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/06/25/spains-securities-market-watchdog-completes-blockchain-test/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/XPZl2MDweHuMlTodzC55eiLEbHk\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/FC64AH2FB5BBVBFTC2CYERXCYM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Spain\u0027s Securities Market Watchdog Completes Blockchain Test","INTRO":"A pilot test was successfully conducted for a Spanish-backed blockchain project to increase the efficiency of registering issuances.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Spain\u0027s securities markets watchdog and a group of financial institutions including Banco Santander have completed a blockchain pilot aimed at testing the tech for registering stock warrant issuances.The year-long Fast Track Listing (FTL) project saw participation from the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) as well as banks such as Banco Santander, BBVA, BNP Paribas, CaixaBank, Commerzbank and Société Générale.The idea is that shared databases can be used to more effectively register information about the issuance of warrants – contracts bearing the right to purchase new shares at a certain price before they expire – and filter that data to all parties.

show.According to a patent application filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and released on Thursday, Mastercard has come up with a conveyance and retrieval processes to verify users\u0027 payment credentials over a \"publicly accessible blockchain.\"The document explains that the two-way method first encodes an image of a payment card and then stores it on the blockchain after encryption with a public and private key. Upon a retrieval request when a payment is being made, the system will use the provided private keys to decrypt the image so it can be verified.By integrating this system with point-of-sale devices, Mastercard says that transactions would be secure, as the card need not be physically presented, and users need not be concerned about their payment credentials being \"skimmed\" from the payment device.Mastercard stated in the document:Although whether an actual product will arise from the concept, the work marks a notable effort by Mastercard to utilize a public blockchain to potentially improve a common issue with its core card business. According to some sources, card skimming at ATMs and point-of-sale across all providers sees around $2 billion stolen per year globally.In addition, another blockchain-related exploration by Mastercard was also revealed in yesterday\u0027s patent update, which seeks to build a blockchain to allow consumers to broadcast their travel itineraries and reservation requests to merchants.Since the broadcasted information will remain visible to the public, it gives merchants the chance to bid for potential customers over the blockchain, potentially changing the existing model of hotel and air ticket aggregators.Mastercard image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, payments, Mastercard, Merchants, News, Patents, use-cases-verticals, business news, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jun 8, 2018 at 11:25 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/06/07/dutch-central-bank-blockchain-promising-but-inefficient-in-payments/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/y4-rHRx55u0-HxnrjC2po5NUrZc\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/WLZQBMBISRDQZJR2UC6ZNJE2CQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Dutch Central Bank: Blockchain \u0027Promising But Inefficient\u0027 in Payments","INTRO":"Blockchain technology isn\u0027t yet a beneficial addition to the payment system in the Netherlands, according to the country\u0027s central bank.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain technology isn\u0027t a beneficial addition to the payment system in the Netherlands – at least not yet, according to the country\u0027s central bank.In a blog post published Thursday, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) came to the conclusion that distributed ledger technology (DLT) is not suitable for its existing financial payment infrastructure due to its insufficient ability to scale for large volumes of transactions and other issues.The DNB offered the opinion based on the results of a project called Dukaton, which conducted a series of experiments that has tested four DLT prototypes over the past three years.Dukaton set out to conduct research in a bid to understand how much value the nascent technology can bring to the country\u0027s existing payment system. Basing its first prototype on the source code of the bitcoin blockchain, the team applied different consensus algorithms and validation mechanisms in later stages.Following the tests, the central bank acknowledges that blockchain can increase the resilience of financial infrastructure against external attacks, however, this benefit comes at the expense of \"scalability, capacity and efficiency,\" it said.The bank wrote in the post:That said, the DNB does not rule out the possibility that, as the blockchain industry moves forward, a better designed algorithm would be able to meet all the technological thresholds required by the Dutch financial system.To that effort, the central bank said it will continue investing in further application development and conducting experiments with blockchain technology.In similar work, South Africa\u0027s central bank yesterday announced positive results for its trial of its blockchain-based system for interbank clearance and settlement.The South Africa Reserve Bank said it had completed a 14-week \"realistic\" proof-of-concept that settled the country\u0027s typical 70,000 daily payment transactions within two hours, while preserving full confidentiality.That platform was built on top of Quorum, the enterprise blockchain platform developed by investment bank JPMorganDNB image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, payments, News, central banks, The Netherlands, DNB, use-cases-verticals, business news, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jun 7, 2018 at 10:35 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/06/07/software-giant-sap-launches-blockchain-as-a-service-platform/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/otKRYLpwAtJZGKrfpEPAgHF4WnA\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/VOF4SNNRGRD6ZCJXKBUS47DZVM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Software Giant SAP Launches Blockchain-as-a-Service Platform","INTRO":"SAP is the latest tech giant to have rolled out a technology framework aimed to let enterprise build blockchain-based applications.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Multinational enterprise software giant SAP has launched a cloud platform that is dedicated to helping corporates develop blockchain applications.Announced during an SAP event Wednesday, the cloud-based solution aims to provide enterprises with a framework to build business applications on top of blockchain systems such as Hyperledger Fabric, the blockchain platform launched by the Linux Foundation, of which SAP is also a contributor.The company said in the announcement that the work is being formally rolled out after it has worked with 65 companies within its Blockchain Co-Innovation Initiative that trialed blockchain applications in various industries such as supply chain, manufacturing, transportation, food and pharmaceuticals.Earlier last month, CoinDesk reported that the company is working with the U.S. sausage maker Johnsonville, as well as Naturipe Farms and Maple Leaf, to pilot a project that tracks the origin of food products across the supply chain as a part of its Farm to Consumer initiative.In addition to its co-innovation program, SAP has also announced it is forming a blockchain consortium, members of which are entitled to use tech developed by the group.

security and scalability, adding that it is still \"not mature.\"According to a report translated from Russian, she said:Skorobogatova added that the lack of large-scale adoption is partly due to the fact that enterprise executives do not yet understand the value of the technology.Still, there are two different areas in which the technology that might be of benefit, she argued, where one is well suited for online operations such as electronic letters of credit – she provided the examples of Ripple and R3\u0027s Corda platform – and the other involves working offline and with smart contracts – Ethereum and Hyperledger were cited in this case.But technology for technology\u0027s sake is \"pointless,\" the offical continued, predicting that, this year, the world will come to a greater understanding of blockchain and can then come to better anticipate how the technology will be of use within industrial-scale applications.Despite Skorobogatova\u0027s comments, the Bank of Russia has

In this way, the system would provide an immutable copy of the data, as well as who initiated the transaction and the time and date it occurred.Although the technology described in the application doesn\u0027t appear to be entirely novel, given it largely reflects the basic mechanisms of standard blockchains, it still marks a notable use case exploration by one of the 26 cabinet-level ministries of China\u0027s State Council.Further, the Ministry of Public Security is not the only Chinese government agency that is interested in taking advantages of blockchain technology.As reported previously by CoinDesk, China\u0027s National Audit Office, another cabinet-level ministry and also the government\u0027s official auditing authority, is also looking at blockchain solutions for storing audit data it gathers from provincial and local level bureaus.See the full patent application below:China police image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"China, Blockchain Technology, Cloud, News, Law Enforcement, Patents, Police, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"May 9, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/08/facebooks-david-marcus-to-lead-new-blockchain-research-unit/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/iev_b2WmHUz5In8DEc_l16s30G0\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/CY2JGGLYQZACFOHARUBKUUWF7Q.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Facebook\u0027s David Marcus to Lead New Blockchain Research Unit","INTRO":"Facebook is reportedly launching a team dedicated to blockchain technology, which will be spearheaded by Messenger\u0027s vice president David Marcus.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Social media giant Facebook is launching a team dedicated to exploring blockchain technology.The initiative will be spearheaded David Marcus, who has served as the company\u0027s vice president for its Messenger app division.

At the time, users could obtain LinkTokens by purchasing Xunlei\u0027s then-new cloud storage device – called the OneThing Cloud – to share their spare broadband bandwidth.The announcement initially caused the company\u0027s stock price to skyrocket from $4 to over $20 in November of last year, but it dropped again to around $10 in January following a Chinese financial self-regulator\u0027s accusation that the product launch was, in effect, an \"initial miner offering.\"The agency, China\u0027s National Internet Finance Association, issued a statement in January, warning residents over activities that require users to purchase hardware in order to participate in a token-generation process and have the substance of an ICO – a fundraising method explicitly banned by the Chinese authorities.As a result, Xunlei investors formed two class action lawsuits against the firm, alleging it knowingly conducting an unlawful and disguised ICO.However, in response to CoinDesk and comments seen on various media outlets, Xunlei has, on several occasions, firmly denied the accusations.“We have been very straight on our business practices – we do not sell tokens,” Chen Lei, CEO of Xunlei and a defendant in the two lawsuits, told the South China Morning Post earlier this month.Chen Lei at event via Xunlei","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Regulation, News, Distributed Ledger Technology, Asia Pacific, ICOs, Legal, lawsuits, xunlei, use-cases-verticals, business news, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Apr 20, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/04/09/salesforce-working-on-blockchain-product-says-ceo-benioff/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/tB-Xe-jYua9JAniYIKRZd-uwOO4\u003d/570x570/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/3UTBLGFDXJBK3AFH2BFSWPODZQ.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Salesforce Working on Blockchain Product, Says CEO Benioff","INTRO":"Salesforce is working on a product based on blockchain and cryptocurrency, the cloud computing company\u0027s CEO has revealed.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Salesforce is working on a product based on blockchain technology, the cloud computing company\u0027s CEO has revealed.Marc Benioff, who founded the company in 1999, revealed the news when speaking to Business Insider\u0027s Julie Bort at the TrailheaDX Salesforce Developer Conference on March 28 (check out the video below).Benioff said he\u0027d begun to hone in on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency after an encounter at a hotel bar in Davos, Switzerland, in January.

Therefore, the company said, its financial status cannot be determined based solely on the miners.This acquisition may help boost Riot Blockchain’s reputation. Logical Brokerage, a member of the National Futures Association, is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Critics had previously accused the company, formerly known as Bioptix Inc, of capitalizing on blockchain hype when the price of its stock shot up from $8 a share to roughly $40 after its rebranding.

Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Warning: Blockchain Could Rot Your Brain","INTRO":"As we move toward trusting everything recorded in a blockchain, consider the societal impact, e.g. on our ability to think critically and skeptically.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Alice Ko is a Canadian CPA, a finance professional turned business consultant, and the founder of a marketing agency, Pivot Six. She holds a small cryptocurrency collection. Follow Alice: @thisisalicekoAdvancements in technology may be transformational. However we cannot forget that they also create adjunct problems.For instance, social media addiction is a serious issue, the Internet spawned the need for instant gratification, and artificial intelligence has many of us worried about technological unemployment.Unfortunately, blockchain is no exception. And yet, everybody wants a piece of the pie, and people are already pouring their life savings into cryptocurrency investments. Should we take a step back and reconsider?Proponents everywhere tout that blockchain will make the world more productive. I’ve even made the argument that blockchain will force auditors and accountants out of glorified administrative work so they can produce more value for society.Whether it’s in banking, logistics, or advertising, on the surface, it may seem logical that any technological change will create “productivity gains.” But before we convince ourselves that blockchain will be a time saver, consider the Solow Paradox.Also known as the Productivity Paradox, this is the observation that “... as more investment is made in information technology, worker productivity may go down instead of up.”I’ve witnessed the Solow Paradox in action while working in different offices alongside C-Suite executives and other consultants. I’ve seen working professionals barely able to work an Excel spreadsheet, let alone utilize the countless Excel formulas that could have made their work output more productive and efficient.While some will argue that the technical incompetencies I describe above are the result of poor training and weak hiring practices. Shouldn’t the concern of the Solow Paradox be seriously considered if blockchain technologies are destined to have a stake in all industries?It’s certainly possible that the misunderstanding of technology may very well add hours to our workdays, rather than subtract them.So before we get excited and confident about so-called productivity gains, due care and strategic planning should be top of mind to ensure that workers and organizations are adequately prepared for the next shift in the technological revolution.If new technologies are thrown at workers without adequate understanding of and training on the tools at hand, this may cause further declines in productivity, elevated stress levels in the workplace (and stress leads to health problems), and ultimately risk creating even more work.Blockchain allows for the validation of transactions through an automatically verified, tamper-resistant system. This causes many to dream of the days where middlemen (and their fees) will be gone, and when tasks like verification and audit will be obsolete. All data recorded in a blockchain will be trustworthy since transactions cannot be altered.Sounds utopian – and yet, reliance on technology has been shown to negatively impact human performance. The Google Effect (not committing facts to memory because we know everything is on Google) is alive and rampant. In fact, recent studies show that 90% of people suffer from this digital amnesia.So as we move toward trusting everything recorded in a blockchain, let’s consider what might happen to society’s ability to be healthily skeptical and to critically think for ourselves outside of a blockchain.For instance, I still know many finance professionals who are quick to pull out the calculator function on their phones rather than crunching the numbers in their heads. Is it really because it’s more convenient, or have they simply lost the ability to do the math?While some studies show that society is at risk of become less intelligent with its increasing reliance on technology, these studies should simply be a red flag. Maintenance of brain health and increasing use of brain power is necessary as our species collectively continue to solve problems around the world.Scientific American puts it perfectly: “As we are freed from the necessity of remembering facts, we may be able as individuals to use our newly available mental resources for ambitious undertakings.”So how do we guarantee this is the direction we are heading in with blockchain? Instead of relying on blockchain technology as the “be all end all,” we could consider blockchain as a type of backup validation tool to leverage our current systems rather than a complete replacement.To ensure our critical thinking skills remain top-notch, let’s also retain the skill set to perform transactions ourselves despite technologies that can automate tasks for us (like calculators). Technology should support us, not replace us.I started my career in auditing so I tend to have a pretty skeptical mindset. Whenever I read a metric or statistic, I’m quick to validate the source. Transactions within a blockchain network inherently create trust, but I think the automated “trustworthiness” of these transactions will negatively impact social skills and human behavior.How? We were taught to be skeptical about certain things growing up (e.g. always count your change), and depending on where you lived, you were probably taught early to trust certain organizations like the bank and the government. Now as adults, we inherently trust that our technology is reliable (when was the last time your phone alarm let you down?).My concern is the impact of a future blockchain-driven trust economy on social cues. Will people still trust transactions outside of a blockchain network? Will blockchain become the primary validation method of all data? Will society become more or less trusting in general? Will a transaction or agreement made outside of a blockchain be legitimate?If we do eventually rely on blockchain to validate and manage tasks and transactions, I foresee the decline of underrated skill sets and important social behaviors. With the loss of middlemen (think brokers, agencies, auditors), our mediary, negotiation, and project management skills might also deteriorate. With this in mind, now is a crucial time to start planning for this and figure out ways to mitigate it.After all, we know from experience that new technologies dissolve existing problems, but will also create new ones in passing. Let’s prepare accordingly this time.Brain MRI image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Society, Culture, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/22/british-charity-aims-to-improve-maritime-safety-with-new-blockchain-lab/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/1gPSWYHS9XrEQ2ZJ7OWqOoA7k-s\u003d/570x379/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/E6U2NO4ZORAYBBSLJTPXUJCH6E.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"British Charity Aims to Improve Maritime Safety with New Blockchain Lab","INTRO":"British non-profit Lloyd’s Register Foundation is teaming up with BLOC on a blockchain initiative aimed to improve safety on the high seas.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The Lloyd’s Register Foundation, a British non-profit, has announced a new initiative that aims to use blockchain tech to improve safety on the high seas.Dubbed Maritime Blockchain Labs (MBL) and announced Thursday, the project is being founded in partnership with Denmark-based Blockchain Labs for Open Collaboration (BLOC).

P. Box to describe probabilistic models, but it also perfectly encapsulates all the mental models we use to make sense of the world around us.Human time and attention are scarce, and the universe is extraordinarily complex. As a result, we are forced to operate under imperfect mental models, also known in psychology as \"heuristics.\" Regardless of our level of understanding of any given subject, these models and ideas are necessarily erroneous or incomplete. The deeper one dives into any one subject, the more obvious George Box’s aphorism becomes.Perhaps nowhere is this more readily evident than programming, where one of the most foundational principles is that of abstraction. To the visitor of a website, no knowledge of code is required to click links and input information, just as one doesn’t need to understand combustion engines to drive a car. We might have an approximate mental model of how they work but not an accurate one.Similarly, web developers themselves need not understand the intimate workings of TCP/IP and the other core protocols on which the internet is built in order to build applications on them. We regularly use and incorporate software written by others in our own applications without ever knowing how they actually work. Software development, and technological advancement more generally, can thus be thought of as building on top of a series of these nested “black boxes,\" with each box containing an even more abstracted-away mystery.To those who haven’t invested the time to truly master the innerworkings of a particular technology, it might as well work by magic. The deeper you dive, however, the more the magic falls away.This is what Jimmy Song did for me and the various other students of his workshop, Programming Blockchain: strip away the magic.As a contributor to the Bitcoin Core repository and former vice president of engineering for the early bitcoin wallet software Armory, Jimmy Song is well known in the cryptocurrency space.Through his regular written and video content, he’s established himself as a vocal figure in crypto, one who is passionate about improving bitcoin.He also isn’t shy about sharing his opinions on what’s needed to do that:Enter Programming Blockchain, Song’s flagship effort to give interested developers a deep crash course into the fundamentals of how the magic behind bitcoin and the blockchain actually work. Finite fields, elliptic curve cryptography, transaction parsing and validating proof of work are just some of the topics covered.“It’s like a water hose of information for two straight days,” explained Song.As a web developer fascinated with the wider implications of cryptocurrency for the last several years, I couldn’t resist.Since blockchain is a global technology and phenomenon, it’s fitting that such an ambitious endeavor to demystify it is itself global in scope. The locations for Programming Blockchain vary widely, having been held and scheduled for areas as disparate as China, California, North Carolina and Israel.“If the idea is to make more developers, I want to do this in as many jurisdictions as possible.” explained Song. “By doing this in different areas of the world, I am hoping developers in different areas of the world create more things. Having more businesses start in different jurisdictions reduces risk for bitcoin.”The latest iteration of the workshop took place in Tampa, Florida. While not the most internationally recognized city, Tampa is home to a vibrant cryptocurrency community and the newly opened BlockSpaces, a co-working space dedicated to blockchain projects which played host to Programming Blockchain.Choosing Tampa as a location paid off. This latest iteration of Song’s in-person instruction was his largest yet with 30 students. While some of these developers naturally hailed from the Sunshine State like myself, others had flown in from various locations including Washington D.C., California, and Brazil.Blockchain is the hottest buzzword in tech, one that’s being thrown at everything. Surveying the ICO and blockchain landscape, you can find a project or startup for every use case from health data to banana tracking. No matter your problem, blockchain is the solution to your ills.But what actually is it, how does it work, and what makes it so special?It’s common to hear that blockchain is \"the technology behind bitcoin,\" a distributed and tamper-proof database which could be leveraged in many other applications. It’s also common to hear that like AOL or MySpace, bitcoin could quickly be overtaken by competitors who better leverage this technology.But blockchain is so new and inherently different that all analogies aimed at simplifying it or the crypto ecosystem quickly fall apart in their usefulness.Blockchain’s uniqueness makes it exceptionally difficult to understand because try as we might, we possess no preexisting conceptual pigeonhole to fit it into. By extension, it is exceptionally easy and tempting to project upon it a panacea for every problem without any clear idea of how it will help.We take descriptions of the blockchain’s emergent properties such as “immutability” and “decentralization,\" and often seem to conclude these are magical passive properties of blockchain which can be dragged and dropped onto any application. But there is no such thing as magic, and even the most seemingly benign assumptions made when thinking about cryptocurrencies and blockchain can be surprisingly off.Take even the very concept of a bitcoin, which is itself nothing more than an abstraction. The bitcoin protocol tracks units of value only in satoshis, not in bitcoins. What many know as the “smallest” unit is actually the only unit in the protocol.It was simply an arbitrary decision on the part of Satoshi to make a “bitcoin” equivalent to 100 million of these units, which subsequently became standard notation for all wallet software built on top of the protocol. But even the concept of some kind of “coin” or “token” itself is a total abstraction. The structure of bitcoin transactions has a surprising detail brought to our attention by Song that showed this to be the case.When it comes to monetary transfers one thinks of X unit of value being sent to the address or account of a recipient. In a raw bitcoin transaction, however, nowhere is the amount of satoshis being “transferred” specified. There is simply a reference to the unspent transaction output, or UTXO, with which the transaction is being funded. A UTXO can be thought of as debit entry on the blockchain ledger. The total amount of bitcoin displayed on a wallet is the aggregate of all the UTXO it controls rather than a single account which holds funds.Additionally, if the value represented by a single UTXO is less than that which a user attempts to spend, multiple UTXOs must be included in the transaction to provide the liquidity. However, a UTXO must also be spent completely, meaning that by spending an amount smaller than that represented by a single UTXO, your wallet software must actually generate a “change” address to send itself the difference.As Jimmy Song demonstrated to us, there are no tokens being sent back and forth, even digitally. Rather it’s a conceptual metaphor. All there is is simply a quirky accounting ledger, the particulars of which are of course abstracted away completely by basic wallet software.“Once you understand these raw transactions, it’s like reading the Matrix,” Jimmy said.Many abstractions, like easily understood currency denominations, are obviously useful. They are necessary for operating in a vastly complex world, yet they can still introduce intellectual pitfalls.Take unit bias, which is when a cryptocurrency seems like a better buy relative to a more “expensive” coin, despite the fact that the unit price of a coin is irrelevant in this context.If two cryptocurrencies possess the exact same market cap, but their supply and denomination is such that you are capable of purchasing a “whole” cryptocurrency A over a “fraction” of cryptocurrency B, we are predisposed to own a whole of something rather than a part. Yet the denominations of these cryptocurrencies are, necessarily, totally arbitrary.Unit bias is a fairly benign mental error. When it comes to simplifying details for the sake of explanation, however, other pitfalls can be much more dangerous.For example, bitcoin’s so-called “immutability” isn’t the result of some special line of code which can simply be copied and pasted into any application. It is the result of the ongoing interplay of incredibly intricate mathematics and economic incentives. The structure of the blockchain is rooted in a type of computation known as hashing. It is easy for a computer to verify if the answer to a hash is correct but difficult for it to find the answer itself from scratch, though far from impossible.Miners, however, create a hashing arms race, where reproducing their total and ongoing sum of computations in order to make changes to the blockchain is exceedingly expensive, rendering it all but impractical the more that time passes. This is only possible because the miners have a powerful profit motive: the reward of bitcoins themselves.Thus it’s not even accurate to think of the bitcoin blockchain as perfectly immutable. It most certainly could be tampered with, under certain conditions like 51% attacks. But neither is it possible for any blockchain to promise even practical immutability without a native and valued token with which to reward those who secure it.“Bitcoin is the technology that powers blockchain, not the other way around,” summarized fellow student Nick Baldwin.The more deeply you delve into blockchain, the more the magic falls away. You realize that like all things, there are no true mysteries. Only that which we haven’t taken sufficient time to understand.As our simplistic and flawed models are replaced by more sophisticated ones, there are interesting ramifications. You may think your sense of wonder fades along with the magic. Sometimes it does. You become acutely aware of how little you actually know and how much there is left to solve and build. A sense of disillusionment can be the natural reaction.But by pressing on you earn something much more valuable than naive wonder: a sense of perspective. The work left to do is immense, but the work that has already been done by those who have come before us is just as terrifyingly intimidating.It stands testament to the fact that we already stand on the shoulders of giants, and all the challenges ahead of us can be conquered, just as those before us were.With this knowledge and shift in perspective comes a sense of focus. All we can do is solve the next problem. Take the next step. All else is noise.As Song imparted to us as our impactful workshop came to an end:Astrological image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Developers, Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin, Coding, Jimmy Song, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/13/china-it-ministry-to-create-official-blockchain-standards/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/pcbcaqb-Q4nvYlbtdkvJ6Pwo7jI\u003d/570x377/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/TUXTMSJFWFAWXMKYO25JTFYLMA.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"China IT Ministry to Create Official Blockchain Standards","INTRO":"China\u0027s information and technology ministry aims to establish a standards committee to boost the development of blockchain in the country.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A Chinese government body is considering creating national standards to boost the development of blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) in the country.According to an announcement released yesterday, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has already, as a first step, hosted a research seminar recently to discuss how such standards frameworks might be built.The effort, proposed by the China Electronics Standardization Institute under the guidance of the ministry, now aims to form a committee to lead the effortThe ministry indicated that, currently, major international standards organizations in China have already been weighing in on the topic of DLT, signaling the country\u0027s dedication to keeping the country ahead of the curve with blockchain technology.While China is already participating in the TC 307 commission under the International Organization for Standardization, which focuses on framework for blockchain use in authentication and smart contracts, the IT agency said it is now eying the country\u0027s own dedicated initiative.The plan is also in line with China\u0027s positive public stance on blockchain adoption, even though authorities have clamped down cryptocurrency-related investment activities including initial coin offerings and trading over the last year.The announcement comes just days after China\u0027s biggest annual political conference, which saw various policy advisors proposing that the nation should form guidance and regulations to ease the development of blockchain technology.China flag image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"China, Identity, Blockchain Technology, News, Standards, Asia Pacific, dlt, cryptocurrencies, business news, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Mar 13, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/09/cannabis-publication-to-launch-on-civils-decentralized-news-platform/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/vgi3x_9ItE_QAOD2a-uXgiDmrT8\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/OLOI7X2RDZBKBJVN7Z7L5XTOYA.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Cannabis Publication to Launch on Civil\u0027s Decentralized News Platform","INTRO":"Cannabis Wire, a trade publication dedicated marijuana industry coverage, is launching a newsroom on blockchain-based journalism platform Civil.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Cannabis Wire, a trade publication dedicated marijuana industry coverage, is to launch a newsroom on blockchain-based journalism platform Civil.According to an announcement from Civil, Cannabis Wire\u0027s newsroom is targeted at offering different types of content for both individual consumers and larger organizations such as farms, lawmakers and lobbyists.“We’re promoting a more objective standard for responsibly covering the cannabis industry.

Cardozo School of Law and co-director of its Blockchain Project.He later elaborated:The hearing pointedly sought to avoid a topic that has been a hot one, both in and outside of Washington, D.C.: regulation. While it was a subject that came up through witness testimony, chair Ralph Abraham (R-LA) said he wanted to focus on what he described as a potentially \"transformative\" technology.To that end, the hearing called for examples of how the technology can be used, both in the private sector and by the federal government.Representative Barbara Comstock (R.-VA) started listing use cases by noting that her personal information was likely stolen or compromised by a data breach at the Office of Personnel Management. As a result, she said she was “pleased” to hear about efforts to create more secure identity management platforms that uses blockchain as a means to encrypt data.One notable topic of exploration came through Chris Jaikaran, a cybersecurity analyst from the Congressional Research Office, who discussed the tech\u0027s use for underpinning voting systems.\"The blockchain doesn’t record the vote, it records the person, the identity, the voting. The vote itself is stored on another secure system,\" he explained.Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety, Walmart Inc., detailed his company\u0027s work with blockchain to the subcommittee members, explaining how the retail giant is using the tech to track food shipments.Yiannas spoke on the pilot projects the retail giant had concluded already, explaining that blockchain has already seen success in helping track food supply chains.He explained:While committee members seemed enthused on the idea of private-sector blockchains helping businesses solve problems, they shared concerns about using similar platforms to share government-related information. Representatives Clay Higgins (R-LA) and Ed Perlmutter (D-CO) in particular asked for clarification on how distributed ledgers would be secured from potential attackers.Charles Romine, director of the Information Technology Lab at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), noted that 51 percent attacks and compromised computers could both disrupt a blockchain, but that these types of attacks would be less dangerous for large – and therefore powerful – networks.One particular area that was honed in on is quantum computing, which some have warned could undermine the security of blockchain systems.These concerns are being considered but are at least 15 to 30 years away from becoming a reality, Romine explained.\"If there is a concerted effort to develop quantum computing, I believe we have a number of years before it reaches maturity – what we refer to as being cryptographically relevant.\"As with any hearing before Congress, the natural question becomes: what comes next?Prior to the hearing, aides to the committee downplayed the prospects of immediate action, though they floated the idea that the testimony on Wednesday could form the basis of work toward some kind of legislation around blockchain.IBM\u0027s Jerry Cuomo prepared a list of potential actions Congress could take in order to provide more support for blockchain research. First and foremost, he recommended that the government should encourage projects which can directly impact the U.S.Cuomo argued in favor of a \"thoughtful\" approach to legislation.Ultimately, it\u0027s tough to say whether Congress will move on such legislation anytime soon – especially considering the current political climate in the U.S. today – but the process likely moved one step closer through today\u0027s testimony.Panel image via YouTube","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Walmart, IBM, Blockchain, Regulation, News, Legal, NIST, hearing, Beyond Bitcoin, business news, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 14, 2018 at 9:20 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2018/01/30/another-blockchain-etf-has-launched/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/emEtlxxDzWo94dTCE9hjMv9tTfU\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/KSNYC6ZUOBFBPMX57L4DVXY7YU.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Another Blockchain ETF Has Launched","INTRO":"Innovation Shares announced that it will launch a NextGen Protocol ETF that uses AI to identify and invest in blockchain innovators.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"An exchange-traded fund focused on companies that are working with blockchain or are eyeing applications of the tech has launched today.Innovation Shares LLC\u0027s NextGen Protocol ETF (ticker symbol: KOIN) went live on the NYSE Arca exchange this morning.

A blockchain is a tangible thing, not a practice, a process or a field of interest.)But thinking about the etymology of these words is more than just an academic exercise. It helps us understand the motives and interests that fuel subtle but important changes in meaning. For example, recognizing that detaching the word \"bitcoin\" from \"blockchain\" works to neuter the former helps us see how those most threatened by cryptocurrency are trying to shape the debate.By the same token (no pun intended), if you don\u0027t understand why \"blockchain,\" expressed as an uncountable noun, means something different from \"a blockchain\" or \"the [bitcoin] blockchain,\" you could fall into a trap. It means you probably don\u0027t understand the technology you\u0027re dealing with and that someone could take advantage of you.So, when Christian Smith, a colleague from the MIT Media Lab, gave an impassioned speech last week condemning the widespread use of \"the blockchain,\" it irked me. Not only did he dis the definite-article form on which I\u0027d cut my cryptocurrency teeth, he happily used the uncountable noun form. To be fair, he was speaking at the MIT Legal Forum on AI \u0026 Blockchain. Perhaps I have to accept this increasingly ubiquitous usage as an unavoidable fact of life? Like taxes.Still, Smith raised some good points. He rightly observed that there is now a plethora of distributed ledgers carrying the label \"blockchain,\" and thus that there is no monolithic single chain to which we all must adhere. And I fully share the disdain he expressed for that aggravating phrase, \"just hash it and put it on the blockchain.\"But to banish the definite article seemed to me to deny the word\u0027s roots.I tend to view \"the blockchain\" as a nod to bitcoin\u0027s catalytic role in fostering wider interest in \"blockchain technology.\" (Pro tip: if you want to talk about \"blockchain\" as a field of interest, use it as a modifier to a word like \"technology\"; it can also modify other words, like \"pedant.\") We still say \"the wheel\" to talk about other the starting point of that world-changing invention, don\u0027t we?Hardcore bitcoin enthusiasts, those who have been in the space from the beginning, sometimes scoff at the newfound ubiquity of the word \"blockchain.\"Back in the day, no one really thought of the blockchain as being especially significant, other than that it described the particular transaction recording system that bitcoin used, one that happened to be arranged into a cryptographically linked chain of blocks.\"Blockchain\" didn’t appear in Satoshi Nakamoto\u0027s initial white paper. It has been suggested the first usage came from Satoshi\u0027s early collaborator, Hal Finney, and even then in a less iconic, two-word construction – \"block chain\" – which Satoshi and others later picked up and used.Once blockchain explorers were created, allowing people to more easily search the ledger, the single word started to gain significance. No doubt, its growing popularity was helped by the fact that the most popular of those software tools belonged to the startup named Blockchain – typically expressed with its URL extension \".info\" to distinguish it from the bitcoin ledger. (One mark of the confusion around all this is now found in how Blockchain.info\u0027s original logo is frequently used in slide decks by speakers seeking to illustrate a generic technology they call \"blockchain.\")Dedicated bitcoin developers still don\u0027t really talk about the blockchain as an isolated thing of any great importance. They view bitcoin as an all-encompassing technology, within which the chain-of-blocks ledger is just one part.I personally think the blockchain deserves to be recognized on its own. It\u0027s what gives bitcoin its immutable time-stamping capacity, allowing tricks like Julian Assange\u0027s \"proof of life\" and it lets us forecast when each halving will occur.It also encapsulates the principle of the \"longest chain\" – contested as it may be – and, when the community is divided over a contentious hard fork proposal, as it was until recently, it\u0027s the blockchain that literally manifests that division. Still, core devs have a point: it\u0027s not entirely accurate to describe the blockchain, as many do, as the \"technology underpinning bitcoin.\"Things got confusing when Wall Street banks got interested in distributed ledgers.They used the phrase \"blockchain without bitcoin,\" which misleadingly suggested that blockchains were not only important but more important than cryptocurrencies – even though, without the latter, it was impossible to have the groundbreaking permissionless, fully censorship-resistant, record of transactions that bitcoin introduced.This new usage had a purpose, of course. It allowed the newcomers in suits to strip the technology of its most disruptive characteristic – the fact that no one could control it – and impose their own control over it. It was a subtle but powerful act of appropriation.Should we care about this? Well, yes, and no.As anyone with teenagers knows, language, especially English, is always evolving. And it needs to. Language imposes rules on social interaction. It constrains what we can and can\u0027t do with expression. This helps us make sense of each other, but if the rules are overly inflexible, they limit our imagination and our capacity for innovation.There is a cultural zeitgeist underway in the \"blockchain space,\" a Cambrian explosion of ideas. We can do our part to try to steer the evolution of the language associated with that, but preventing change and new forms of expression is as difficult as stopping biological evolution.What we must demand is awareness of why we use the words we use and why others choose theirs. (I\u0027ll begrudgingly accept \"blockchain\" as an uncountable noun if others will understand why my co-author Paul Vigna and I put \"The Blockchain\" into the title of our new book to acknowledge the technology\u0027s bitcoin-rooted history.)With awareness hopefully comes consistency of usage. That\u0027s vital if we are to develop this technology and its applications. We need precision in communication if we are to come together and collaborate on the same ideas.If we are at least thinking, reading and educating ourselves about such matters, we can be more accepting of the fluidity of word usages. That way, we avoid the harmful, confining effects of political correctness for blockchain. (See what I just did there.)I only have one demand: don\u0027t, whatever you do, start using \"blockchain\" as a verb.Pom pom image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin, Token Economy, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/11/14/hong-kong-official-touts-blockchain-for-chinas-belt-and-road-plan/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/ce9gbZQZwycZK4dhOsj6wasLsug\u003d/570x333/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/C43IB3HROVABDGXNOGABD4FMGY.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Hong Kong Official Touts Blockchain for China\u0027s \u0027Belt and Road\u0027 Plan","INTRO":"A senior Hong Kong treasury official has said blockchain could bolster China\u0027s ongoing efforts to significantly expand its trade capabilities.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A senior official for the government of Hong Kong has said blockchain could bolster China\u0027s ongoing efforts to significantly expand its trade capabilities.According to Chinese news service Caixin, James Lau, Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury, touted the technology during a forum appearance on Friday.

It\u0027s economics. Inventing your own word is just an excuse to ignore well-understood concepts.\"The term \"cryptoeconomics\" causes a lot of confusion and people are often unclear on what it is supposed to mean. The word itself can be misleading, as it suggests that there is a parallel \"crypto\" version of the whole of economics. This is wrong, and Parker is right to mock such a generalization.In simple terms, cryptoeconomics is the use of incentives and cryptography to design new kinds of systems, applications, and networks. Cryptoeconomics is specifically about building things, and has most in common with mechanism design – an area of mathematics and economic theory.Cryptoeconomics is not a subfield of economics, but rather an area of applied cryptography that takes economic incentives and economic theory into account. Bitcoin, ethereum, zcash and all other public blockchains are products of cryptoeconomics.Cryptoeconomics is what makes blockchains interesting, what makes them different from other technologies. As a result of Satoshi\u0027s white paper, we have learned that through the clever combination of cryptography, networking theory, computer science and economic incentives that we can build new kinds of technologies. These new cryptoeconomic systems can accomplish things that these disciplines could not achieve on their own. Blockchains are just one product of this new practical science.This article aims to explain cryptoeconomics in clear, simple terms. First, we examine bitcoin as an example of cryptoeconomic design. Second, we consider how cryptoeconomics relates to economic theory in general. Third, we look at three different areas of cryptoeconomic design and research that are active today.Bitcoin is a product of cryptoeconomics.Bitcoin\u0027s innovation is that it allows many entities who do not know one another to reliably reach consensus about the state of the bitcoin blockchain. This is achieved using a combination of economic incentives and basic cryptographic tools.Bitcoin\u0027s design relies on economic incentives and penalties. Economic rewards are used to enlist miners to support the network. Miners contribute their hardware and electricity because if they produce new blocks, they are rewarded with amounts of bitcoin.Second, economic costs or penalties are part of bitcoin’s security model. The most obvious way to attack the bitcoin blockchain would be to gain control of a majority of the network\u0027s hashing power – a so-called 51 percent attack – which would let an attacker reliably censor transactions and even change the past state of the blockchain.But gaining control of hashing power costs money, in the form of hardware and electricity. Bitcoin’s protocol intentionally makes mining difficult, meaning that gaining control of a majority of the network is extremely expensive – enough that it would be hard to profit from the attack. As of August 16, 2017, the cost of a 51 percent attack on bitcoin would be around $1.88 billion in hardware and $3.4 million in electricity every day.Without these carefully calibrated economic incentives, bitcoin wouldn’t work. If mining did not come with a high cost, it would be easy to launch a 51 percent attack. If there were no mining reward, there would be no industry of people who buy hardware and pay for electricity to contribute to the network.Bitcoin also relies on cryptographic protocols. Public-private key cryptography is used to give individuals safe, exclusive control of their bitcoin. Hash functions are used to \"link\" each block in the bitcoin blockchain, proving an order of events and the integrity of past data.Cryptographic protocols like these give us the basic tools necessary to build reliable, secure systems like Bitcoin. Without something like public-private key infrastructure, we could not guarantee to a user that they have exclusive control over their bitcoin. Without something like hashing functions, nodes would not be able to guarantee the integrity of the history of bitcoin transactions contained in Bitcoin’s blockchain.Without the hardness of cryptographic protocols like hashing functions or public-private key cryptography, we would have no secure unit of account with which to reward miners - no confidence that our record of past accounts was authentic and exclusively controlled by a rightful owner. Without a carefully calibrated set of incentives to reward an industry of miners, that unit of account could have no market value because there would be no confidence that the system could persist into the future.In this way, bitcoin\u0027s design requires an understanding of both cryptography and how incentives affect the security properties and functionality of systems built with cryptography. Cryptoeconomics is strange and counterintuitive. Most of us are not used to thinking of money as a design or engineering problem, nor are we used to economic incentive design being an essential component of a new technology. Cryptoeconomics requires us to think about information security problems in economic terms.One of the most common mistakes in this industry is made by those who view blockchains only through a lens of computer science or applied cryptography. We have a strong tendency to prioritize the things we are most comfortable with, and see things outside of our domain of expertise as less important.In blockchain technology, this leads many people to assume or abstract away the crucial role of economic incentives. This is one reason we see meaningless phrases like \"blockchains are trustless,\" \"bitcoin is backed only by math\" or \"blockchains are immutable.\" These are all wrong in their own way, but all have the effect of obfuscating the essential role of a large network of people whose necessary participation in the network is maintained through economic incentives.Cryptoeconomic systems like bitcoin feel like magic to someone who views them only as a product of computer science, because bitcoin can do things that computer-science alone could never accomplish. Cryptoeconomics isn’t magic – it’s just interdisciplinary.The term cryptoeconomics can be misleading because it suggests a comparison to economics as a whole. This is part of what leads people like Parker to dismiss the term. Economics is the study of choice: how people and groups of people respond to incentives. The invention of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology does not require a new theory of human choice – the humans haven’t changed. Cryptoeconomics is not the application of macroeconomic and microeconomic theory to cryptocurrency or token markets.Cryptoeconomics has most in common with mechanism design, a field related to game theory. In game theory, we look at a given strategic interaction (a \"game\") and then try to understand the best strategies for each player, and the likely outcome if both players follow those strategies. For instance, we might use game theory to look at a negotiation between two firms, relations between countries or even evolutionary biology.Mechanism design is often referred to as reverse game theory because we start with a desired outcome and then work backwards to design a game that, if players pursue their own self interest, will produce the outcome we want. For instance, imagine we are responsible for designing the rules of an auction. We have an objective that we want bidders to actually bid the real value they place on an item. To achieve this, we apply economic theory to design the auction as a game where the dominant strategy for any player is to always bid their true value. One solution to this problem is called a Vickrey auction, where bids are secret and the winner of the auction (defined as the player with the highest bid) only pays the second highest amount that was bid.Cryptoeconomics, like mechanism design, focuses on designing and creating systems. Like in our auction example, we use economic theory to design \"rules\" or mechanisms that produce a certain equilibrium outcome. But in cryptoeconomics, the mechanisms used to create economic incentives are built using cryptography and software and the systems we are designing are almost always distributed or decentralized.Bitcoin is a product of this approach. Satoshi wanted bitcoin to have certain properties – for instance, that it be able to reach consensus about its internal state and that it be censorship-resistant. Then, Satoshi set out to design a system that would achieve those properties, assuming people responded in rational ways to economic incentives.Most often, cryptoeconomics is used to provide a security guarantee about a distributed system. For instance, we have a cryptoeconomic security guarantee that the bitcoin blockchain is secure against a 51 percent attack unless someone is willing to spend a few billion dollars. Or, in a state channel – a topic we discuss later – we can have a cryptoeconomic security guarantee that an off-chain process is nearly as secure and final as an on-chain transaction.It is worth noting that mechanism design is not a panacea. There is a limit to how much we can rely on incentives to predictably shape future behaviour. As Nick Szabo rightly points out, ultimately we are speculating about people\u0027s future mental states and making assumptions about how they react to certain incentives. A cryptoeconomic system\u0027s security guarantee depends in part on the strength of its assumptions about how people react to economic incentives.There are at least three different kinds of systems being designed today that could be called “cryptoeconomic”.Blockchains are able to reach reliable consensus without having to rely on a central trusted party – a product of cryptoeconomic design. Bitcoin\u0027s solution, which we surveyed above, is called \"proof-of-work\" consensus because miners must commit work – in the form of hardware and electricity – in order to be participate in the network and receive mining rewards.Improving proof-of-work systems and designing alternatives to them is one active area of cryptoeconomic research and design. Ethereum’s current proof-of-work consensus mechanism includes many variations and improvements on the original design, enabling faster block times and being more resistant to the mining centralization that can result from ASICs.In the near future, ethereum plans to migrate to a \"proof-of-stake\" consensus protocol called Casper. This is an alternative to proof-of-work that does not require \"mining\" in the usual sense: there is no need for specialized mining hardware or huge expenditures of electricity.Remember that the whole point of requiring miners to buy hardware and spend electricity is to impose a cost on miners, as a way of raising the cumulative cost of attempting a 51 percent attack sufficiently high that it becomes too expensive. The idea behind proof-of-stake systems is to use deposits of cryptocurrency to create the same disincentive, rather than real-world investments like hardware and electricity.In order to mine in a proof-of-stake system, you must commit a certain amount of ether into a smart contract \"bond.\" Just like in proof-of-work, this raises the cost of a 51 percent attack – an attacker would have to commit a very large amount of ether to successfully attack the network, which they would then lose forever.Casper is being designed by Vlad Zamfir, Vitalik Buterin, and others at the Ethereum Foundation. You can read more about the history of Casper\u0027s design in this series of posts by Zamfir or hear him talk about it on a recent podcast. Buterin wrote a long post about Casper\u0027s design philosophy here, and there is a useful FAQ on the ethereum GitHub wiki here.Once we have solved the fundamental problem of blockchain consensus, we are able to build applications that sit \"on top\" of a blockchain like ethereum. The underlying blockchain gives us (1) a unit of value that can be used to create incentives and penalties, and (2) a toolkit with which we can design conditional logic in the form of \"smart contract code.\" The applications we build with these tools can also be a product of cryptoeconomic design.For instance, the prediction market Augur requires cryptoeconomic mechanisms in order to function. Using its native token REP, Augur creates a system of incentives that rewards users for reporting the \"truth\" to the application, which is then used to settle bets in the prediction market. This is the innovation that makes a decentralized prediction market possible. Another prediction market, Gnosis, uses a similar method, though also lets users specify other mechanisms for determining true outcomes (commonly called \"oracles\").Cryptoeconomics is also applied to design token sales or ICOs. Gnosis, for instance, used a \"Dutch auction\" as a model for its token auction, on the theory that this would result in a more fair distribution (an experiment that had mixed results). We mentioned earlier that one area where mechanism design has been applied is in the design of auctions, and token sales gives us a new opportunity to apply some of that theory.These are a different kind of problem than building the underlying consensus protocols, but they share enough similarities that both can be fairly seen as cryptoeconomic. Building these applications requires an understanding of how incentives shape users\u0027 behaviour and careful design of economic mechanisms that can reliably produce a certain result. They also require an understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the underlying blockchain on which the application is built.Many blockchain applications are not products of cryptoeconomics; for instance, applications like Status and Metamask – wallets or platforms that let users interact with the ethereum blockchain. These do not involve any additional cryptoeconomic mechanisms beyond those that are already part of the underlying blockchain.Cryptoeconomics also includes the practice of designing much smaller sets of interactions between individuals. The most notable of these are state channels. State channels are not an application but a valuable technique that can be used by most blockchain applications to become more efficient.A fundamental limitation of blockchain applications is that blockchains are expensive. Sending transactions requires fees, and using ethereum to run smart-contract code is comparatively costly to other kinds of computation. The idea behind state channels is that we can make blockchains more efficient by moving many processes off-chain, while still retaining a blockchain\u0027s characteristic trustworthiness, through the use of cryptoeconomic design.Imagine Alice and Bob want to exchange a large number of small payments of cryptocurrency. The normal way for them to do this would be to send transactions to the blockchain. This is inefficient – it requires paying transaction fees and waiting for the confirmation of new blocks.Instead, imagine that Alice and Bob sign transactions that could be submitted to the blockchain, but are not. They pass these back and forth between one another, as fast as they want – there are no fees, because nothing is actually hitting the blockchain yet. Each update \"trumps\" the last one, updating the balance between the parties.When Alice and Bob have finished exchanging small payments, they \"close out\" the channel by submitting the final state (i.e. the most recent signed transaction) to the blockchain, paying only a single transaction fee for an unlimited number of transactions between themselves. They can trust this process because both Alice and Bob know that each update passed between them could be sent to the blockchain. If the channel is properly designed, there is no way to cheat – say, by trying to submit a previous update as though it were the most recent – since recourse to the blockchain is always available.For illustrative purposes, you can think of this as similar to how we interact with other trusted sources, like a legal system. When two parties sign a contract, most of the time they never need to take that contract to court and ask a judge to interpret and enforce it. If the contract is properly designed, both parties simply do what they promised to do, and never interact with the courts at all. The fact that either party could go to the court and have the contract enforced is enough to make the contract useful.This technique is not just useful for payments, but for any update to the state of an ethereum program – hence the more general term \"state channel\" rather than the narrow \"payment channel.\" Instead of sending payments back and forth, we can send updates to a smart contract back and forth. We can even send entire ethereum smart contracts that, if needed, will be sent to the blockchain and executed. These programs never have to be executed to be useful. All that is needed is a sufficiently high guarantee that they could be executed if necessary.In the future, most blockchain applications will use state channels in some form. It is almost always a strict improvement to require less on-chain operation, and many things done on-chain today can be moved into state channels while still preserving a sufficiently high guarantee to be useful.The description above skips over many important details and nuances of how state channels work. For a more detailed description, Ledger Labs built a toy implementation last summer that demonstrates the basic concept.Thinking about the blockchain space through the lens of cryptoeconomics is helpful. Once you understand the idea, it helps to clarify many of the controversies and debates in our industry.For instance, \"permissioned\" blockchains that are centrally managed and do not use proof-of-work have been a source of constant controversy since they were first proposed. This area of work is often referred to as \"distributed ledger technology\" and is focused on financial and enterprise use cases. Many partisans of blockchain technology dislike them – they may be blockchains in the literal sense, but there is something about them that feels wrong. They seem to reject the thing that many people see as the whole point of blockchain technology: being able to produce consensus without relying on a central party or traditional financial systems.A cleaner way to make this distinction is between blockchains that are products of cryptoeconomics and blockchains that are not. Blockchains that are simply distributed ledgers and do not rely on cryptoeconomic design to produce consensus or align incentives might be useful for some applications. But they are distinct from blockchains whose whole purpose is to use cryptography and economic incentives to produce consensus that could not exist before, like bitcoin and ethereum. These are two different technologies, and the clearest way of distinguishing between them is whether or not they are products of cryptoeconomics.Secondly, we should expect that there will be cryptoeconomic consensus protocols that do not rely on a literal chain of blocks. Obviously, such a technology would have something in common with blockchain technology as we call it today, but labelling them blockchains would be inaccurate. Again, the relevant organizing concept is whether such a protocol is the product of cryptoeconomics, not whether it is a blockchain.The ICO craze has also focused attention on this distinction, though few have articulated it clearly. Many people independently identified that one of the strongest signs of a token\u0027s value is whether it forms a necessary component of the application to which it is connected. To put this in clearer terms, the question should be: is the token part of a necessary cryptoeconomic mechanism in the application? Understanding the mechanism design of a project holding an ICO is an essential tool in determining that token\u0027s utility and likely value.In the past years, we\u0027ve moved from thinking about this new field solely through the lens of one application (bitcoin), to thinking about it in terms of one underlying technology (blockchains). What needs to happen now is to step back once again and view this industry in terms of a unifying approach to solving problems: cryptoeconomics.Thanks to Jeff Coleman, Ethan Wilding, and Vlad Zamfir for their comments on an earlier draft of this article.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zerocoin Electric Coin Company, developer of zcash.Understanding economics image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Ethereum, Bitcoin, Cryptoeconomics, Features, other-public-protocols, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/06/22/whats-blockchain-hsbc-survey-finds-59-of-consumers-dont-know/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/UsI8diHhAPPdWGYiio9cru0MY70\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/ABM36BYPTZGKTPAE4CQCFC4BBI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"What\u0027s Blockchain?

These platforms shouldn\u0027t develop in a vacuum,\" she said.Johnson went on to tell attendees:Johnson also revealed information about her company\u0027s partners on its journey, naming blockchain startup Axoni, investment firm Boost VC and university initiatives based out of MIT, University College London and Cornell.To date, Johnson explained that Fidelity Labs, its internal R\u0026D division has also set up experiments for bitcoin micropayments and even run bitcoin and ethereum mining operations in the spirit of learning more about the technology.Further, she revealed that Fidelity will be taking some conservative steps to expose Fidelity\u0027s customers more to the industry, announcing that customers will soon be able to see Coinbase holdings on Fidelity.com. Already, she said, this feature is available to employees who own digital currencies available through the startup\u0027s services.Speaking to this coming together of both existing finance and startups, Johnson said:Johnson further detailed Fidelity\u0027s research strategy for blockchain, noting the education difficulties that have thus far made adoption difficult.She said that, at this stage, most potential users attempt to compare it to older technologies, or they simply never adopt due to the time and patience it takes to master new concepts such as having passwords for money.\"Some users treated the recovery phrase like a password. They also expected to be able to click a \u0027Forgot My Password\u0027 button if they ever lost it – definitely not the ideal mental model,\" she said.Johnson also spoke to the larger ideological changes that have happened as the world has begun to better understand open, public blockchain technology, and how that is reshaping how industries are seeking to apply it to business models.\"If you are looking for bitcoin to beat Visa at the point-of-sale today, you are going to be disappointed,\" she remarked.Johnson\u0027s talk also covered other problems in how blockchain technology is being applied in the enterprise – specifically, regulation, scalability and privacy.\"Regulators will go through the same growing pains. And, in order for this technology to reach its true potential, we need solutions that protect customer interests,\" she said.Notably, Johnson also addressed that her passion for open-source blockchain technologies is also hitting governance roadblocks that limit their utility for enterprises.\"Companies that build products on these platforms don’t have clarity about the future path they might take – or how to influence these communities,\" she said.Still, she cautioned that the traditional financial world – despite its consortiums – hasn\u0027t quite figured it out either, remarking:Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase and Axoni.Image via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Fidelity, Markets, Consensus 2017, business news, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"May 23, 2017 at 2:07 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/03/05/the-trouble-with-fintech-or-why-now-is-the-time-for-dlt/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/rRH3ThmYfrdk42QhJVC7Ew5C2Yo\u003d/570x328/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/KU7JHTBLNRD4JOXLRKU5TFV7MU.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The Trouble With Fintech (Or Why \u0027Now\u0027 is the Time for DLT)","INTRO":"A critical look at the reasons behind the change in dialogue surrounding blockchain and distributed ledger tech.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Chris DeRose is a software developer, bitcoin evangelist and the controversial co-host of the podcast Bitcoin Uncensored.In this opinion piece, DeRose looks at the promotion of blockchain and distributed ledger solutions, arguing that, in many cases, they\u0027re simply a smokescreen for the shallow repurposing of existing ideas.In 2013, \u0027fintech\u0027 gained serious steam.With the rise of the \u0027bitcoin bubble\u0027, Silicon Valley began paying attention to finance technology in a new way. An army of talking heads and oracles quickly declared the state of finance technology to be a world of \u0027broken\u0027 business models and antiquated ideas \u0027ripe for innovation\u0027.What followed next should come as no surprise: venture capitalists began their plans for \u0027disruption\u0027 through the dot-com model of funding aggressive development teams with esoteric company names, and they went full steam for projects such as \u0027Ripple\u0027 and \u0027Digital Asset Holdings\u0027 – all of which were designed to lubricate the wheels of interbank financial systems.Two years in, what have we got to show for this exuberance? I would argue not much.Finance is a difficult industry to disrupt. For one, it\u0027s a highly regulated, and some of the world\u0027s best and brightest minds are working hard to keep the wheels of our world\u0027s financial systems humming along as is.Unlike the small- and medium-sized business industries that we typically see Silicon Valley tackling, fintech \u0027customers\u0027 have generally included a comparatively small number of large institutions with long sales cycles and few incentives to aggressively pursue new technology.The Silicon Valley formula is supposed to work like this: \u0027runway\u0027 capital is allocated to a venture for the purpose of maintaining operations and with the hopes that the venture \u0027takes off\u0027. The venture burns that capital while acquiring customers, and as the company grows, either more cash is raised, or the company switches fully to customer-funded operational support.But, that model doesn\u0027t apply well for products for whom customer purchase life cycles are inordinately long, and where regulatory encumbrances are high.The runway period becomes too long, and the risks grow commensurately larger. So, in the case of today\u0027s fintech startups, something unusual has started to happen.Without many exceptions, as the fintech customers have failed to arrive, startups have begun to abandon much of the pretense of customer acquisition, and have instead focused heavily on winning investors.As traditional VC\u0027s have begun to abandon these startups, the companies have instead designed their marketing initiatives to cater toward a more diverse range of unspecialized investors. As such, in 2015 \u0027buzzword compliance\u0027 became the new modus operandi for many of these companies as they pivoted toward a nebulous pursuit of \u0027blockchain\u0027. (Whatever that word may mean.)At the start of 2017, it would appear that blockchain compliance is out, and having still not attracted capital inflow from paying customers, these companies are now ready to solicit a new round of investors under the newest buzzword: \u0027distributed ledger technology\u0027 (DLT).Well, much like with the term \u0027blockchain\u0027, the answers are… vague.\u0027DLT\u0027 appears to be rooted in the notion that \u0027the technology behind bitcoin\u0027 (still the biggest success in the fintech sector, at least as measured by market cap) is seemingly found in the process of \u0027ledger reconciliation\u0027. But, is now really the time to revisit this age-old function?With distributed ledger technology, the pitch appears to be that transactions will be sent to all parties on the network, instead of just the involved banking institutions. By using cryptography to automate and increase the sharing of data, it is argued we will find increased reconciliation accuracy and cost reduction from regulatory compliance.How is this different than blockchain? Well, the \u0027blocks\u0027 (folders of transactions) of blockchain are no longer in vogue, and thus we\u0027re back to sending transactions \u0027unbatched\u0027.For some, DLTs are a triple-ledger accounting system, whereby debits are accounted from individual deposit transactions, in lieu of accounts. For others, DLTs are merely the syndication of data between all parties in the system, instead of the direct participants of a transaction.But for most, DLTs merely exists to represent and facilitate \u0027The Next Big Thing\u0027 in the previously uninteresting world of financial ledger and accounting technology.Rarely found in any discussion of a new technology is the examination of their opportunity costs. And, in the case of DLT, these costs aren\u0027t terribly different than the costs preventing \u0027blockchain\u0027 uptake.Chiefly, sharing data with one\u0027s competitors is a tough pitch – it removes the proprietary \u0027edge\u0027 that banks use to form the basis of their competitive advantage. Further, requiring cooperation amongst these institutions is a tougher pitch still, when even trusting their own employees is difficult.But concerns over sharing aren\u0027t the only thorn in the DLT pitch: most of the supposed advantages for these platform can only come to fruition if all vendors and customers of an institution (and in turn, their customers and vendors) use the same software.This all-or-nothing proposition isn\u0027t an easy hurdle to surmount.In an attempt at tackling these roadblocks, distributed ledger and blockchain startups have taken to the aggressive pursuit of acquiring high-profile talent to lead their ventures. This comes at stark contrast to the usual Silicon Valley playbook, which is more often defined by previously-unknown whizz-kids at the helm of their technology.This conspicuous hire phenomenon was very evident for the case of bitcoin wallet firm Blockchain\u0027s acquisition of ex-Barclay\u0027s CEO \u0027Antony Jenkins\u0027, and Digital Asset Holdings\u0027s acquisition of the \u0027credit default swap\u0027 progenitor \u0027Blythe Masters\u0027.In all cases, the companies\u0027 history of press releases would suggest that the acquisition of a strong \u0027brand\u0027 was more important than any announcement of actual growth or traction.Though the relationship between these hires and prospective clients may very well help with the sales processes for these endeavors, it may simply be that the purpose of these hires has more to do with securing additional funding from investors – particularly since these hires generally have very little to do with the actual specialization of message-passing architectures which these systems seek to replace.The last notable and successful modern renovation in financial-message passing may very well be Swift\u0027s transition away from directly connected data lines to the public TCP/IP network.This transition was performed in the early part of the 21st century over a four year period ending in 2005. During this migration, the upgrade was made by incumbent institutions at a slow and prudent pace, involving all existing members of an incumbent interbank messaging standard.Standards bodies and committees were formed within Swift, and all institutions ratified proposed changes with a prolonged discussion.It\u0027s worth noting that such changes in interbank message routing, though rare, are well precedented. And have never been defined by the quick and risky paths typically taken via venture capital investment programs.Banks are necessarily incrementalist institutions. And \u0027disruption\u0027 in incremental institutions is nothing more than a representation of risk.As such, these changes are ill-suited for a non-incumbent intermediary to tackle. The non-regulatory costs of moving data is already very low – and often \u0027free\u0027. This leaves little to no chance of profitability, in exchange for the expansion of risk.Such a poor revenue outlook is quickly evident amongst DLT startups upon even a cursory examination of their business models. Most companies in the DLT space have already made their efforts free to all by open-sourcing their project code in full.The path to revenue growth would appear to be, at best, \u0027consulting\u0027 contracts. This isn\u0027t exactly the glamorous growth model that propels Silicon Valley expectations.So what\u0027s the future of distributed ledger technology startups?Probably not much. There\u0027s no customer capture or network effect that would prevent incumbent providers such as Swift and ACH from merely incorporating any of the innovations that could conceivably be uncovered into their existing offerings.Should the push for DLT be that we can finally remove the process of specialized reporting, then the question should be asked as to why these functions existed in the first place. The answer will likely suggest that mere databases and standardized message passing formats can already provide the technical solutions needed with less overhead than replacing the entirety of the incumbent software architectures.If \u0027standardization\u0027 is the pitch of DLT proponents, who better to accomplish this task then the institutions that have specialized in such relationships for the decades that have brought us here?As fintech businesses are quickly whitewashing yesterday\u0027s big thing, \u0027blockchain\u0027 – will the new branding finally add customer revenue to these operations? Or will it merely carry these unprofitable enterprises into the newest round of fundraising?This brings us to the difficult truth of fintech\u0027s results up to the year 2017. Namely, there\u0027s a long list of idealistic goals that have met with profitless, regulatory encumbered failures.Balloon and tack image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Fintech, Distributed Ledgers, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/02/24/do-you-believe-in-blockchain-magic/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/EX2TZiBc8Gbk0ETL_GuJUq13qno\u003d/570x429/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/XKI3G4W4ZRBWNJKXWY2ZN3IFRQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Do You Believe in Blockchain Magic?","INTRO":"Many optimistic claims are made for applications of blockchain, but hyping the tech is not the best way forward, argues Sebastien Meunier.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Sebastien Meunier is a financial services advisor and startup mentor with 15 years of experience in business transformation and innovation in finance.In this opinion piece, Meunier takes a look at the many optimistic claims made for applications of blockchain, arguing that over-promising on the tech is not the best way forward.Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that is a force for good.You probably heard that it can help solve problems in charity. But did you know that you can end homeless hunger with blockchain? Actually it could help end poverty in all its forms, including solving the child poverty issues!Blockchain is unbelievably powerful. Bitcoin, the first blockchain system, launched in 2009, can help end war, which is already something. But blockchain technology is even stronger: it will make guns smarter, preventing gun deaths, and save the world from nuclear holocaust. Boom.Let’s be clear, blockchain will completely revolutionize how we run the world. It will undo populism bigly, stop climate change, prevent the next financial crisis, disrupt Uber, give us control of our data, and transform everything from banking to government to our identities.The democracy will be on a blockchain. Your company will be on a blockchain. Even Chinese pork will be on a blockchain!No industry shall be immune to the blockchain revolution:Imagine!

Congratulations!_______________________________________ The section above was made from actual headlines.At this point you probably understand that there is too much hype around blockchain or \u0027distributed ledger\u0027 technology.Readers: learn how to recognize snake oil, avoid ecstatic articles and white papers and preferably read and share balanced ones.Blockchain technology is complex. Business problems are complex. An article about blockchain for business should be measured and not straightforward.Writers: resist the temptation of sensational headlines for \u0027clicks\u0027. Control your excitement and present all aspects of a story, not only the concept (we could trade loans and securities without intermediaries!), but also the reality (regulation, legacy, etc).Publishers: prioritize balanced articles, challenge the writers, and if you publish opinion pieces, make sure you give voice to a variety of experts on your platform.Blockchain technology is no magic, it is basically a combination of two existing technologies: public key infrastructure and protocols.Immutable databases already exist (eg HDFS, couchDB). PKI systems (signature, encryption, etc) already exist. P2P systems already exist. Consensus protocols already exist (eg paxos, raft).You don’t necessarily need \u0027blockchain\u0027 to implement these features. The two differentiators of DLT are, in my opinion: (a) the control of the read/write access is truly decentralized and not logically centralized as for other distributed databases, and corollary (b) the ability to secure transactions in competing environments, without trusted third parties.Blockchain is not a general-purpose solution for everything. It should be considered as an enabler to creating new decentralized services and solving specific business problems (such as the double-spend problem in trustless P2P environments for the brilliant bitcoin).That said, many business processes are inefficient and heavily centralized.Blockchain technology could be a solution for some of them, but other technologies could be as well – for instance, I can think of several ways to optimize a claim management process without using blockchain.That being said, I do believe that blockchain technology can be very powerful for some specific use-cases. I have met promising startups and seen advanced proofs of concept at the banks I work with.Now let’s keep in mind that change is not only about technology: If you want to revolutionize financial services, you have to turn everything around from market regulations, organization and governance, to business models and operational processes!It may happen, but it won’t happen overnight.In the meantime, you can still use cryptography and data replication protocols to develop incremental innovation – that’s perfectly fine as long as you don\u0027t over-promise.\"A dream doesn\u0027t become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work.\"– Colin Powell.

All of this is part of the growing pains of a new technology, one in which the first projects are run by enthusiasts and aren\u0027t part of the discussion at a boardroom or even industry level.And the latter is important as blockchain technology is a foundational technology that can solve some complex issues. Like my good friend Bart Suichies once said: \"Blockchain is not the thing, it is the thing that enables the thing\".What does this mean? Well, for most enterprise applications, blockchain is only a small part of a full stack. That\u0027s where many projects go wrong.They start with the question: \"What business problem does blockchain technology solve?\" In most cases, the answer will be \"none\", for the simple reason that current problems exist specifically because of the current design and architecture of legacy systems.Trying to solve that with a blockchain solution will lead nowhere or at best to suboptimal results.To determine the potential value of blockchain technology, you need to rethink what a decentralized approach means in your business, in your industry, how it affects a value chain and what it enables that was formerly not possible.Let\u0027s apply this to a specific example.Most people rightfully say that blockchain could enable portability of data across the healthcare system and pave the way for a new approach to electronic health records (EHR).It\u0027s a nice idea, but blockchain is never going to become the new underlying technology of EHRs within the current setup of healthcare IT. This is because the system was built around the healthcare organization and its processes, and was never designed for connecting with other healthcare entities – let alone data from your Fitbit or Philips watch.The only way a blockchain integration will truly will happen is when we redesign healthcare IT with the patient at the heart of solutions, as that is the central point of the required data. This is what blockchain can enable as a very small but important part of a much larger architecture.The challenge here is that the discussion needs to be led at a strategic and industry level, rather than in an architecture meeting. It requires a fundamental change in the design of, not only an IT solution, but a complete different view on processes, patients and organizations.This different view means shifting from a process-centric view to a patient-centric view. It also needs a rethink about the role and value of a particular healthcare provider in the overall healthcare system, alongside a remake of incentive systems.As such, the most difficult question in an established healthcare system will be where to start. I do believe that some initiatives taken by, for example, Gem in cooperation with Capital One to redefine claims management can lead not only to immediate results, but also the start of a systemic shift.But you have to understand that Estonia was able to start with a blank slate – a \u0027luxury\u0027 that well established markets in Western Europe and the US don\u0027t have. This blank sheet requires the absence of a legacy system and the willingness of a government to enforce a new approach, forming the most fertile ground to build blockchain solutions.I predict that fundamental innovations using blockchain technology will come first from the Middle East, Africa and Asia.In the rest of the world, we can wait for that to happen and be taken by surprise, or we can start having a grown-up discussion about blockchain and strategy at the right level in the organization and with others in our industry and politics.Seems difficult? It is. But even though these days some think otherwise, complex challenges cannot be solved by simple solutions.Broken lightbulb image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Healthcare, Banking, Enterprises, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/02/16/state-bank-of-india-launches-new-blockchain-finance-consortium/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/ocFKxBCROa7gLwbA4_UGHv9rcUw\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/RMGCGCVRPBHCTH7EM2FGFBK3FA.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"State Bank of India Launches New Blockchain Finance Consortium","INTRO":"India’s largest bank is spearheading \u0027Bankchain\u0027 – a newly unveiled consortium focused on blockchain applications.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"India’s largest bank is spearheading a newly unveiled consortium focused on blockchain applications.According to local news outlets, the State Bank of India – which Fortune says held nearly $450bn in assets as of last year – is partnering with several technology firms and a group of domestic commercial banks on a new initiative dubbed ‘Bankchain’.IBM and Microsoft will reportedly be providing technical assistance for the group as it explores ways to leverage blockchain to reduce fraud and improve operational efficiency.IBM has previously announced partnerships with Indian companies focused on blockchain development.

While Swift\u0027s service is aimed at making it cheaper for banks, rivals are looking to blockchain to help cut the banks out altogether.At stake is nothing less than a slice of global remittance market estimated by the World Bank to be worth $552bn for the past two years.To capture a piece of that transaction volume, some well-funded bitcoin startups have set their sights square on cross-border payments, including Align Commerce and Abra, two startups that have raised $20.25m and $14m, respectively.But perhaps no blockchain startup has more at stake than Ripple, which has raised $93m from Standard Chartered, Accenture Ventures and others to streamline cross-border payments.But even as Raymaekers positions his technology as a means to modernize cross-border payments without blockchain, he said Swift is looking to see how the system might further explore the technology.This October, as part of Swift\u0027s annual Sibos conference, blockchain developers will be given access directly to the GPI as part of a hackathon, Raymaekers revealed to CoinDesk.\"We\u0027re going to open those APIs for fintech and blockchain designers to come up with ... new ideas,\" he said.By the time the hackathon kicks off, Raymaekers expects that more of the 100 banks that have so far signed up for GPI will go live with real transactions, some as early as May. Further, he indicated that if the nostro-vostro blockchain PoC is successful, it is scheduled to go live sometime in 2019.Overall, while Raymaekers is optimistic about the possibility that blockchain might improve some products, he ultimately sees the need for the tech as limited.He concluded:Images via Swift","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, payments, SWIFT, Banking, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 16, 2017 at 12:30 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/02/16/dubai-innovation-office-seeking-startups-for-20k-blockchain-contest/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/9k8ePeMeBMjT_KWQjMg3DwgQljg\u003d/570x374/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/SD2UOSXSPZFX5NS35CLA4LQQMI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Dubai Innovation Office Seeking Startups for $20k Blockchain Contest","INTRO":"The Smart Dubai initiative is on the hunt for startups to take part in a new blockchain contest, offering prizes of up to $20,000 for the winner.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Dubai’s government is on the hunt for startups to take part in a new blockchain contest, offering prizes of up to $20,000 for the winning projects.In a statement, SDO director general Dr Aisha Bin Bishr said her office hopes to use the contest to identify companies with solutions that could have an impact on Dubai’s plans for modernization.She said of the initiative:To attract startups to the competition, the SDO is offering tens of thousands of dollars in cash for the best projects.

Instead, it\u0027s about entering the fray by implementing real-world blockchain solutions.Treat said:In Accenture\u0027s Thales integration, private keys essential for conducting transactions are stored within nShield hardware certified by the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) in conjunction with the Canadian Communications Security Establishment.Developed in London with support from Accenture’s team in Rome, the security system is initially based on the Hyperledger Fabric platform and integrated with Thales’ nShield HSM, already being used by the French company to protect UK tax payers, Samsung cellphones and fighter jets.The as-yet unbranded blockchain integration is expected to be formally named later this week, alongside the launch of a new website designed to integrate with any number of distributed ledgers, blockchains and competing HSMs.Treat positions the hardware as part of blockchain’s natural evolution, as regulators, existing financial infrastructure providers and banks move to capitalize on the faster settlement times and easier auditability of shared, trusted ledgers, but hesitate out of a number of security and privacy concerns.Instead of storing private keys that are essential to confirming identity within the application layer of the protocol, the Accenture solution is designed to keep them in a physical HSM architecture.\"It’s eliminating that part of the debate of how secure are the keys,” Treat said. \"It comes as a much simpler answer if you see we are adhering to the high level of standards associated with the current certification of security infrastructure.\"Exactly how Accenture will market this \u0027blockchain agnostic\u0027 integration layer has yet to be determined, or at least publicized. But, much can be learned by taking a closer look at the burgeoning blockchain hardware ecosystem.Among the unknowns at Accenture, are whether the integration layer will be sold through a subscription model or flat rate offering. However, the customers Accenture will be marketing to are more certain.Treat told CoinDesk that customers who already have their own HSM solution will be able to hire Accenture to integrate it to their blockchain, or blockchains, of choice. New customers, on the other hand, or those with a \"heightened need for security\" would go to Thales or another HSM provider to buy their hardware stack \"and come to us to install our integration layer on top of it\".Accenture distinguishes itself from the recent proliferation of consulting firms offering blockchain services by being among the first to also join the rapidly growing blockchain hardware industry.So far, blockchain infrastructure providers have tended to lease services for periodic fees, while cryptocurrency companies charge based on transaction size.For example, IBM currently charges $10,000 a month to give blockchain users high-security access to its HSM network, whereas venture-backed Xapo offers its customers free access to its \u0027vaults\u0027 stored offline and \"deep underground in geographically dispersed locations\", in exchange for charging various fees to move the funds associated with an account.But perhaps the most informative example of the young industry is Intel’s software guard extensions (SGX) – hardware designed to isolate keys and other valuable information. SGX has been proposed for use in both more general blockchain applications and a cryptocurrency-specific use case.In each case, concerns over using hardware quickly became apparent.Last year, when Intel proposed using SGX at the core of its Sawtooth Lake blockchain implementation, it sparked a heated debate over using trusted hardware to run a network with the potential to run without a trust. Then, weeks later, the Initiative For CryptoCurrencies \u0026 Contracts (IC3) proposed using SGX to help scale bitcoin, setting off similar disputes.Accenture\u0027s David Treat is joined by Thales CTO Jon Geater in arguing that the limits of blockchain aren’t in the technology itself, but in the way it is implemented.In interview, Treat highlighted exchanges such as Mt Gox and Bitfinex, which were hacked through poor key management practices, as evidence of such concerns.But Geater, who helped integrate Accenture’s software into his company’s hardware, focused more on potential limitations of smaller private networks when creating more sophisticated assets than cryptocurrency.Further, for private networks that have fewer nodes than the 5,800 nodes live at any given time on the public bitcoin network, Geater argues the ability to protect each node from a wide variety of potential attack vectors is exponentially more important.\"When you’ve got a very small population,\" he told CoinDesk, \"some of these threats become much more real, and so having trustworthy hardware underpinning is clearly more valuable for peace of mind, for speed of adoption and for business agility.\"Couple that with concerns Geater has over highly regulated digital assets, and certified hardware becomes essential to widespread industry adoption, he said.Not everyone agrees, however. The movement to push blockchain security into hardware owned by third parties is part of Accenture’s broader, and controversial, push to make distributed ledgers more appetizing to legacy financial infrastructure providers and other organizations held accountable to regulators.In December, Accenture published an article in the New York Times relaying its vision for \u0027redactable blockchains\u0027 that, instead of relying on a consensus-driven hard fork like the one experienced by ethereum to undo transactions, relies on the ability to edit their history using highly protected private keys.While critics have jumped on the idea as contrary to the underlying benefits of a distributed network, Geater argued that blockchain redaction accompanied by certified, secure hardware is the only way to get the current financial leaders to truly buy into the technology.\"In the real world, you have overrides and you have lawyers. You have disputes, and you need to code all of that kind of process and authority into the system,\" he said.The debate over whether hardware, hard fork or another solution is more desirable remains unresolved, with pre-emptive solutions around standards also springing up.But, according to Treat, the ability to edit a blockchain and the hardware to protect the keys to those crucial editing rights are inevitable.\"A part of our answer in designing solutions,\" he said. \"we would absolutely store the sharded copies of those keys in HSMs as a further ability to allow people to trust that system.”Geater concluded that more sophisticated implementations of blockchain than cryptocurrency require more imaginitive solutions:Featured servers image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, Technology, Accenture, Hardware, Companies, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 14, 2017 at 12:00 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/02/14/arizonas-proposed-blockchain-gun-tracking-ban-pushes-ahead/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/5Me_F7N03vFOqhl63uL5Q_gMWZc\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/5M25VBHEQBFTZIKTF23EWCYLLQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Arizona’s Proposed Blockchain Gun Tracking Ban Pushes Ahead","INTRO":"An effort to prohibit the tracking of firearms with distributed ledgers has progressed to the state\u0027s Senate.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"An effort by Arizona lawmakers to prohibit the tracking of guns using blockchain technology has now progressed to the Senate.As CoinDesk reported earlier this month, a proposed new bill would prevent the use distributed ledgers in firearm tracking, with the exception of law-enforcement applications.The concept, put forward by technologists in the blockchain space, is that such a system could create an immutable history of transactions that records every time a gun is fired, for example.The proposed bill, HB 2216, has now cleared the Arizona House of Representatives by a 34-25 vote, with one no-vote and no abstentions, and has since moved to the Senate, where it awaits further consideration.While the Senate is a separate legislative entity, its makeup – with a Republican majority, like the House – perhaps indicates that the measure will continue to garner support among lawmakers.The advancement of the measure further demonstrates a growing trend within US state legislatures to act on bitcoin and blockchain issues.Lawmakers in North Dakota and New Hampshire are weighing changes to their respective state statutes.

Among the valuable data about how leading investors were betting against companies, were a number of decisions by legendary investor George Soros.Had the trading data been stored on a blockchain, however, the leak likely would have never happened, according to the analyst, Jamal Simpson.Simpson told CoinDesk:As a result of the mistake (which briefly published hundreds of short sells that are required to be reported, but are visible only to the regulator), that information was made public, leading to potentially valuable insight into the investing decisions of a number of investors, including Soros.While the regulator was quick to remove the data, the potential damage was already done. Among the shorts revealed were bets against multiple Dutch banks and the positions of Renaissance Technologies’ exclusive Medallion fund.To give an idea of the potential value of Soros\u0027 investing decisions, Forbes estimates the US investor currently has a net worth of $25.2bn.\"I’m pretty sure, if anyone’s gotten wind of that now,\" said Simpson, sharing his personal views. \"They’re able to build a better picture of who owns what, who owns which share, and may be able to trade or move very strategically against positions like that.\"The potential of moving financial transactions to a shared distributed ledger has been frequently discussed by members of the industry who advocate for the creation of so-called \u0027regulatory nodes\u0027 that could give government agencies real-time access to data.But Simpson’s comments reveal the potential benefits of the tech to investors, too. Effectively, putting the information on a blockchain could have minimized the chance of a leak by protecting the data in transit.Concerns over the safety of moving financial transactions to a shared ledger are common among institutions exploring the technology. But Simpson says the Soros leaks reveal the risk inherent in the current system.Simpson was also quick to point out that such public disclosures as are required by law could also be automated. For example, last June, Soros himself also shorted Deutsche Bank in the fallout surrounding the UK\u0027s exit from the European Union.In that instance, Soros\u0027 investment was over the minimum amount required to demand public disclosure, another example of how both investor protections and disclosure requirements could be encoded into self-executing contracts on a blockchain.To skeptics of the potential of blockchain tech in financial transactions, Simpson said:George Soros image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"investment, Venture Capital, Blockchain Technology, Trading, investments, George Soros, Data Security, investors, Features, Markets News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 13, 2017 at 1:00 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/02/13/blockchain-firms-aim-for-hedge-funds-but-is-there-a-better-target/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/O6WNLrFLNXpCNDjxTxjX8hmi2a8\u003d/570x346/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/DUWUOKKRGNDLBELBSE7GUKMRQU.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain Firms Aim For Hedge Funds, But is There a Better Target?","INTRO":"While blockchain startups are targeting the hedge fund industry, venture capital may be a better place to focus efforts, says Noelle Acheson.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and is a member of CoinDesk\u0027s product team.The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.The concept of using blockchain technology to retool the hedge fund industry is gaining traction.At least that\u0027s the message conveyed in a report CoinDesk published last week on Melonport. The startup’s idea is to counter the high costs and onerous requirements of hedge funds, and make it easier to set up and manage portfolios.Melonport is not alone. Several companies are taking a run at this space, from a range of angles. Some focus on the underlying platform; others focus on the returns, offering access to a managed selection of digital assets. Most seem to regard the hedge fund industry as their target.But, I would argue the real target is elsewhere.On the surface, blockchains and hedge funds seem made for each other. Setting up a hedge fund is expensive, not just because of the upfront legal and administrative costs, but also because of the amount of money needed to break even ($300m is considered \u0027small\u0027).Furthermore, that amount is increasing, as rising regulatory costs, pressure on fees and lackluster performance are encouraging a consolidation of the industry. Times are tough – the first three quarters of 2016 saw the highest number of closures since 2008.However, on a blockchain platform, the costs would be lower due to enhanced transparency, smoother data flows, efficiencies in custodianship and more automated compliance.And the assets currently available, with their \u0027alternative\u0027 structures and relatively high risk profiles, seem to be right up a hedge fund manager’s alley: digitized representations of real-world assets, cryptocurrencies with no tangible value, digital \u0027coins\u0027 promising a share in future dividends, tokens granting holders access to a service, derivatives based on any of the above.Yet while the proposals may make sense, it’s unlikely that this new type of hedge fund management will make a dent in its target sector.Although consolidating, the hedge fund industry is still huge: approximately $3tn under management. With US President Donald Trump vowing to reduce financial industry regulations, managers have reason to be more cheerful. And hedge funds tend to love turbulent and inefficient markets.Rather than fear the potential competition, it’s more likely that hedge funds will incorporate blockchain technology into their operations, improving the sector’s outlook even more.That’s hardly \u0027taking on\u0027 the sector.Where the blockchain asset management startups will make a difference is in another field entirely: venture capital.Much has been written on initial coin offerings (ICOs) as an increasingly popular funding method for new companies, albeit one with unregulated risks and strategic disadvantages. Instead of having to undergo stressful rounds of presentations and negotiations, often giving up decision-making freedom, blockchain businesses can issue digital tokens that either represent a future utility or a participation in the earnings of the company.At the moment, it is not simple for venture capital firms to invest in this new type of asset. Some have invested in digital token hedge funds, but that’s not the same as vetting and backing blockchain startups.If the blockchain businesses working in the fund management space are able to launch solid platforms that make it easy to set up and manage a portfolio of digital assets, we could well see venture capital firms setting up their own ICO funds.This would allow them to participate in this new funding trend, while still capitalizing on their expertise and vision.In the process, they would add liquidity and respectability to a young asset class, while actually participating in the innovation and technological progress that they profess to actively seek.In summary, the hedge fund industry will probably end up being supported by the blockchain.But its overall structure and purpose are unlikely to change. Where we will see a greater impact, in processes and objectives, is in venture capital. This in turn could end up stimulating a new breed of startup, and encourage the growth of a new asset class that manages to both harness and promote the technology.Image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Venture Capital, Blockchain Technology, startups, Technology, hedge funds, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/02/11/whats-in-a-name-from-bitcoin-to-blockchain-to-distributed-ledgers/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/1sJP-ysXUFu4pEoOU643R_wjj1s\u003d/570x364/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/77PBO4YTFVGTPABO2HIZBU2HEU.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"What’s in a Name? From Bitcoin to Blockchain to Distributed Ledgers","INTRO":"Nelson Rosario ponders why we have developed so many terms for what is effectively the same technology – bitcoin.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Nelson M Rosario is an intellectual property attorney working as an associate at Marshall, Gerstein \u0026 Borun in Chicago. He has years of experience working on patent prosecution matters in bitcoin/blockchain and fintech, as well as other areas.In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Rosario ponders why we have developed so many terms for what is effectively the same technology – bitcoin.– William \u0027Satoshi\u0027 Shakespeare (probably) In the beginning, there was \u0027bitcoin\u0027, and it was good. But, bitcoin would end up bearing a nomenclature fruit salad that tests mortal comprehension. Perhaps, that is the natural way of things.As a new technology develops, the number of people exposed to that new technology increases, and the language used to describe the new technology evolves.Initially, the language was limited to bitcoin. Now a person is liable to see any of the following words or phrases that theoretically all mean different things: bitcoin, Bitcoin, block chain, blockchain, Blockchain, private blockchain, public blockchain, distributed ledger technology, distributed asset ledgers, decentralized ledger technology, shared ledgers, et al.Further confusing the matter, the term bitcoin may not always mean the same thing to different people. What happened? Why the change in language?First, bitcoin has the word \u0027coin\u0027 right in it. This naturally makes people think of currency. Not surprisingly, bitcoin use as a currency is far and away the most successful iteration of bitcoin. The applications for bitcoin are not, however, limited to currency.This is where much of the confusion arises. Intuitively, the currency implementation for bitcoin (with the word coin in it) makes sense. Trying to convince someone that bitcoin can also be used for purposes as diverse as asset transfers, escrow services, or logistics management is not so straightforward.Bitcoin also suffers from an image problem. The early publicity surrounding bitcoin included scandals, thefts, a euphoria akin to the Tulip bubble, and in general, bad press. \u0027Fake internet money\u0027, as some people called bitcoin, did not inspire confidence amongst the masses.Additionally, the main advocates for the new technology were unpolished and unproven. Often if someone had heard of bitcoin they had heard of the failed Mt Gox exchange, or they assumed bitcoin was something a person used to buy illicit drugs or hire a hitman. The reality was not that far off.How do you get people to forget about the failed exchanges, drugs, and hitmen? Get them to focus on \u0027the technology underlying bitcoin\u0027, and get them to think about the other potential implementations. Once the conversation moved beyond currency, people started searching for a new word. That search led them to the blockchain.Negative publicity and conceptual confusion laid the groundwork for people to begin to refer to the blockchain as the real innovation to come out of the bitcoin phenomenon.The blockchain is a chain of transactions that makes bitcoin possible. The term refers to a collection of bitcoin transactions grouped together into blocks and linked through cryptography. This linkage is part of what makes it virtually impossible to fake bitcoin transactions.In a sense, the blockchain provides true decentralized trust and distributed consensus, but the rebranding, or reorienting of people’s attention, to the blockchain and away from bitcoin may be just a clever marketing trick.Many people argue that you cannot separate the blockchain from bitcoin. The thinking is that you cannot break up bitcoin into its component parts because the parts by themselves will not work the same way independent of each other. In other words, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Regardless of whether this is correct, that is precisely what people have done.Once the power of bitcoin became apparent, we started to see article after article touting the \u0027real innovation\u0027 behind bitcoin. Respectable and well-established firms began developing blockchain solutions to their problems.People consistently discredited bitcoin as boring, while extolling the virtues of the multifaceted blockchain. Large banks, financial exchanges, and the \u0027Big Four\u0027 consultancies all rushed to publish reports on blockchain technology. The hype train that left the station heading to Bitcoinland was diverted to Blockchainville.There are now hundreds of blockchain startups. Problems related to back end services for large institutions, digital identity, asset transfer, escrow, and logistics, are all being tackled by blockchain solutions. Even tracking pork along a blockchain has been proposed. These companies are doing truly innovative work.However, to many observers the term \u0027blockchain\u0027 is still conceptually associated with bitcoin. So, if a company describes an innovation that leverages a type of blockchain they have to distinguish it from bitcoin and the bitcoin blockchain. How do blockchain companies talk about what they are doing without referencing bitcoin, or other blockchains? The solution is to talk about ledgers.A ledger can record transactions between multiple parties. The ledger concept is a main building block of bitcoin and any blockchain. Ledgers also benefit from the fact that they are commonly thought of as boring, safe, and dependable tools in an accountant’s toolbox, as opposed to the technological innovation that makes bitcoin possible.What better way to put thoughts of bitcoin and blockchain out of people’s minds than insisting that you are only talking about ledger technology? Thus, the conceptual chain to bitcoin was broken.However, there remains considerable debate over whether this is feasible or even desirable. To early adopters, bitcoin is a monolith that cannot exist without distributed trust, consensus, and immutability, but many new industry entrants view the technology as an a la carte buffet. They are free to decide between many concepts including: permissioned vs permissionless, public vs private, tokenized vs no token, etc.Today any institution or organization that refers to ledgers is free to discuss bitcoin or blockchain related concepts, without the supposed taint of bitcoin. Even the Federal Reserve Board (of Federal Reserve Bank fame), has touted ledgers in their recent report on “Distributed Ledger Technology.”Over the past two years, hundreds of new blockchains and ledgers have been created. They all draw on the root concepts of bitcoin, but their purposes and the lingo used to describe them have diverged widely. This conceptual repackaging, and public relations approved language replacement, is likely to continue for some time.This story has gone from bitcoin to blockchain to distributed ledger technology. There are companies that operate in all of these spaces, or only one of them.Outside observers are forgiven if they struggle to keep up with all the different terms. Yet, through all of this evolution and upheaval, bitcoin has remained central to the discussion. Whether bitcoin, the blockchain, and distributed ledgers will be adopted and thrive or consigned to the ash heap of history remains to be seen.The fact that bitcoin has undergone repeated repackaging is a testament to the strength of the technology. Other blockchains or related technologies may rise and fall, but bitcoin’s inertia and first-mover advantage will continue to make it the most relevant cryptocurrency, blockchain, and ledger.Evolution image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin, Distributed Ledger Technology, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/02/10/bitcoin-blockchain-and-trump-where-do-we-go-from-here/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/UsntCW2IJzL8d1KAKRJP6xjXQyE\u003d/570x374/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/7CBZ6B2UQ5EEXJV6I56XRACATY.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin, Blockchain and Trump: Where Do We Go From Here?","INTRO":"As US President Donald Trump\u0027s administration begins to gather momentum, what lies in store for blockchain and bitcoin regulation?","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Former counsel to bitcoin exchange Gemini, David Brill, is a fintech lawyer with more than 20 years of experience.In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Brill shares his insights from the American Bar Association (ABA) Conference on Derivatives and Futures Law, at which he spoke in January.The regulatory environment for blockchain and bitcoin (as well as the overall securities environment) is in flux as US President Donald Trump\u0027s administration begins to gather momentum.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have already been working for several years on various digital currency-related policies, and now it appears the organizations\u0027 to-do lists are about to grow.Trump has an ambitious agenda when it comes to financial regulations, including repealing parts of the Dodd-Frank Act and Volcker Rule, while implementing the Federal CHOICE Act. But the regulatory bodies will likely need to figure out ways to implement a wide variety of changes, with a static or smaller budget than previous years.Recently, I spoke at The American Bar Association Business Law Section, Derivatives and Futures Conference where the impact of Trump was top of many of the attendees\u0027 minds. Hosted in Naples, Florida, by the ABA, the goal of the conference was to have an open dialogue between business lawyers in private practice, senior in-house counsel and various federal agencies.Attendees of the event included the acting chairman of the CFTC, J Christopher Giancarlo (via teleconference), who has embraced Trump’s \u0027Make America Great Again\u0027 slogan as part of his own agency agenda. Also there were a number of lawyers from the SEC, the National Futures Association and representatives from large law firms and investment banks.Fresh off the inauguration of President Trump, the sentiment of the attendees generally speaking was hopeful that the new administration would be favorable to the business community.Pointing to a number of statements made by President Trump, there was optimism that some of the more burdensome financial laws passed in the prior administration would be scaled back or repealed, enabling banks to more efficiently conduct their operations.However, over the course of the event, it also became very clear to me that funding constraints will potentially play a major role in what regulation we will see in the blockchain and bitcoin space.Given President Trump\u0027s ambitious agenda (which includes rolling back major pieces of Dodd-Frank, eliminating two regulations for every new regulation enacted and keeping a potentially static budget for the SEC and the CFTC), the agencies seemingly will need to be judicious in how they use their resources.What does this mean for blockchain and bitcoin?Since the CFTC is currently working with only three of five commissioners, and acting chairman Christopher Giancarlo is awaiting confirmation, it will take time to assess and implement any changes.Giancarlo has a background in markets, and has publicly embraced a more collaborative approach to blockchain. He has spoken about his willingness to leverage technology and supports having \"savvy teams\" work with fintech companies.With resources at a premium, the CFTC may need to employ a cost benefit analysis on any additional regulation. With this pragmatic view in mind, it seems likely in the short term that the CFTC won\u0027t have the bandwidth to focus much on blockchain and bitcoin.In this scenario, I see blockchain being supported by the CFTC in various forms, including dedicated support, collaboration and perhaps the creation of a regulatory sandbox, akin to what is in place in the UK.For bitcoin, any scarce resources will likely be for enforcement actions and to ensure certain types of impermissible options and futures trading are prevented.The populist movement that led to the \u0027Brexit\u0027 and President Trump will also have an effect on how blockchain is regulated overseas. The result could be a realignment of regulatory strategy in other regions.In Europe, amid the uncertainty over the exit of the UK from the EU, fintech companies, including those focused on blockchain and bitcoin, will have to recalibrate their approach to doing business in Europe.A number of companies that were planing to passport their business into the EU through Luxembourg or other fintech-friendly jurisdictions will also now need to work directly with the UK.The UK, with its fintech-friendly regulatory sandbox, and Ireland, seem to have the most to gain in this regulatory realignment. We may see a number of blockchain companies move their headquarters or significant operations to London and pursue opening offices in Ireland as a passport into the EU.Major changes in the political landscape are likely to affect how blockchain and bitcoin companies do business going forward.In the US, we have witnessed a number of cross-currents on what financial regulation will look like going forward.With President Trump’s ambitious agenda and focus on deregulation and federal hiring freezes, will the regulatory environment keep up with rapid changes to blockchain and bitcoin? Will we see companies apply for and receive fintech charters? Is a regulatory sandbox for blockchain companies in the US on the horizon? Will a bitcoin ETF be approved?Only time will tell – but 2017 is shaping up to be a very interesting year.Donald Trump image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Law, Blockchain Technology, Regulation, Fintech, Donald Trump, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/02/09/qiwis-ceo-will-head-up-russias-distributed-ledger-efforts/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/wv6si5RdgZbosBnzpH059UpzpZw\u003d/570x363/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/3PNDTEXJRNAQVK32ZDFLD7I66Q.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Qiwi\u0027s CEO Will Head Up Russia\u0027s Distributed Ledger Efforts","INTRO":"A Russian fintech association tasked in part with exploring distributed ledgers has appointed a CEO.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Russia\u0027s FinTech Association, established in part to encourage wider exploration of distributed ledger tech, has appointed Qiwi chief Sergey Solonin as its new CEO.Solonin will now lead the consortium effort, a role that will find him coordinating R\u0026D efforts with the Bank of Russia, Sberbank, VTB Bank, Alfa Bank, Gazprombank, Bank Otkritie and the National System of Payment Cards (NSPK).According to a release from the group, the consortium members will explore applications including digital identity, distributed ledgers and open APIs.Solonin said in the statement:For Qiwi, one of Russia\u0027s largest payment firms, the move marks a milestone in its efforts to launch a blockchain and distributed ledger working group in the country, which began in April 2016.The firm is also now a member of R3CEV, a global banking consortium focused on blockchain and distributed ledger efforts.To date, Qiwi has been among the more active firms in its efforts to explore blockchain, building a processing system based on the technology and experimenting with its own digital currencies as early as 2015.Qiwi app image via Facebook","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Russia, startups, Qiwi, Banking, News, Consortia, Executive Appointments, Companies, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 9, 2017 at 11:00 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/02/03/major-uk-telecom-seeks-blockchain-security-patent/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/nanJOAAna4nk_aVyP0X4vx4Yb58\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/YEYFSFYHVVCCVDW2O7ATKSQBKQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Major UK Telecom Seeks Blockchain Security Patent","INTRO":"One of the UK\u0027s largest telecoms, BT, is seeking a patent for a security system aimed at preventing malicious attacks on blockchains.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"One of the UK\u0027s largest telecoms is seeking a patent for a security system aimed at preventing malicious attacks on blockchains.British Telecommunications (BT) PLC submitted a patent application last July for “Mitigating Blockchain Attacks” to the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).

The patent also represents BT’s first known involvement with the tech.While the application doesn’t detail which blockchain is addressed by the patent – whether bitcoin, ethereum or some kind of private ledger – it does directly reference mining, or the energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to the chain.The proposed system, according to BT, could be used to create a “a transaction creation profile”, suggesting that it would be applied to a permissioned network in which only certain participants are allowed to submit transactions.As the application notes:Other threats identified in the application include 51% attacks, through which an entity controlling a majority of hashing power has the theoretical power to start reordering transactions.\"Other attacks also pose a threat to the blockchain and its users, including: the Sybil attack in which an entity attempts to fill a miner network with clients controlled centrally or pseudonymous miners; and various denial of service attacks such as sending excessive data to a miner to overwhelm the miner such that it cannot process normal blockchaintransactions,\" the application goes on to state.BT isn\u0027t the first telecom to attempt to patent a blockchain-related technology.

Here\u0027s a Blueprint","INTRO":"William Mougayar examines what it would take to introduce technologies and standards that make blockchain as ubiquitous and user-friendly as the Web.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"William Mougayar is the author of \"The Business Blockchain\" and a board advisor to, and investor in, various blockchain projects and startups (see: disclosures).In this opinion piece, Mougayar examines what it would take to introduce technologies and standards that make blockchain as ubiquitous and user-friendly as the Web.The blockchain landscape is still very technical. Aside from the early enthusiasts and pioneers, it is hardly comprehensible to the masses, and it will continue to be that way, unless it breaks out of its technical shell.This isn’t unlike the predicament the Internet was stuck in, prior to the Web.So, what if blockchain technology is more like the Internet, which means that we are still waiting for its Web layers to emerge, in order to fully exploit its capabilities?Today, blockchain protocols, solutions or platforms are not straightforward to work with. At least, they require a good degree of technical know-how that far exceeds what an average Web developer or savvy semi-technical business person can do with the Web today.But does it have to be that way forever?If you examine the variety of available blockchains, many of them handle the same few basic functions, centered around recording (digital) value without requiring a third party to move it.Outside of this core capability, a number of additional functions and features are typically found:If this set of functionality is generic in multiple blockchain platforms, why do we need many ways to call them up? Why not institute a common way to check identity, asset ownerships, time-stamping, etc, across any blockchain?Note that I didn’t include cryptocurrencies, shared distributed ledgers, or even decentralized protocols in these layers because they are applications and outcomes of blockchains.If you stand back from the nitty gritty of these layers, you will realize a key abstraction that is common to most blockchains: how they shatter the intermediary trust paradigm by enabling transactions to occur at the peer-to-peer level, without the necessity of central choke or delay points.Since there is so much homogeneity in functionality intent, then why are there so many different and incompatible blockchain technologies and software? That’s because each blockchain implements these basic features and interaction layers in its own way.This scenario is not unlike the position the Internet was in, prior to the Web.Tim Berners-Lee described that period well, circa 1989:Since millions of computers were already being connected to a fast growing Internet, Tim figured the way to solve this problem was to have them share information via an emerging technology he proposed, called hypertext (structured text that uses logical links between nodes containing text) that he described in a seminal 1989 document called “Information Management: A Proposal”.The following extract is from WWWF\u0027s \"History of the Web\":\"By October of 1990, Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s web (and which you may have seen appear on parts of your web browser):As a footnote to this backdrop, Tim’s boss originally gave a lukewarm response to the paper, handwriting on it, “Vague, but exciting”. In truth, some vagueness in a protocol is a good feature, because it implies that its scope is widely encompassing, without being too restrictive.One could argue that Satoshi Nakamoto’s paper was also vague, pertaining to the fullness of its targeted applications beyond the peer-to-peer exchange of electronic money. Ethereum, for example, was built specifically as a general-purpose blockchain platform environment, and didn’t want to be specific, as an original design objective.Since their early days, the Internet and the Web have matured nicely, and today they both rely on close to 200 standards, categorized along the following segments:[Derived from: Internet protocol suite.]These standards are what make the Web work so well. When you are developing Web applications, setting up an infrastructure, or building new products, you interact (directly or indirectly) with these standards, knowing exactly what to expect.Unfortunately, blockchains don’t have that luxury yet, as each platform is made up of its own set of technologies and methods to work with it, resulting in a Balkanized learning curve and adoption behavior for software developers and architects.Each blockchain has its own set of technology tools, middleware and API’s that applications developers need to contend with. An engineer that knows how to program bitcoin needs to relearn what they know, in order to develop on other blockchains. For example, exchanges that support multiple cryptocurrencies have to deal with different integration technologies for each implementation.It is true that each blockchain platform has developed its own technology stacks and interaction methods, but these are vertically integrated to themselves, and for their own ecosystem. In fact, most blockchain platforms don’t share that much in common, resulting in choice lock-ins, lack of interoperability and potentially dead ends that are hard to untangle.The state of collaboration between blockchains is even worse, and plagued by timid efforts for building bridges and lateral co-operative capabilities. One day, it shouldn’t be inconceivable to have technology that crawls entire blockchains, in the same way that search crawlers spider websites to index or categorize vast content.Of course, many technologies start by being proprietary. What follows is that some of them get adopted widely, and they become de-facto standards. In other cases, groups get together and agree to support a given standard, to serve everybody.Today, not enough of the latter is taking place, although many leading blockchain technologies are hoping to gain enough market klout that would let them become that de-facto choice.In hindsight, I wished we didn’t give up on bitcoin APIs so quickly. Two years ago, bitcoin APIs were all the rage with more than a dozen companies vying for that space, as the entry point to develop bitcoin applications. Then, the majority of them slowly opted out of that business, or stopped highlighting it as a key offering.Today, we still have several (bitcoin) API-based offerings from companies like Factom, Tierion, Gem, Colu, BlockCypher, Neuroware, and Coinbase (to name a few). There are benefits to seeing a multitude of APIs take hold and get adopted. Even if some of them overlap in functionality, at least they will point to the need for an eventual standardization.Bitcoin is making progress at its own pace, via technology releases aimed primarily at solidifying its own ecosystem. Although they have the largest cryptocurrency footprint, that doesn’t negate the need for their technology to also work with other parts of the overall crypto-tech ecosystem.In order to grow up, blockchains will eventually need a lot of standards that are vendor and solutions agnostic.So many areas are ripe for standards developments: smart contracts, tokens, security, storage, messaging, identities, naming, record-keeping, and more.The Internet and the Web have their standards. Where are the blockchain equivalent?A standard set of middleware interfaces would insulate participants from the hardest parts of the technology, and expose more succinctly its utilitarian features. Lowering the barriers of entries would empower more developers to enter the blockchain, similar to the roles that HTML, HTTP, URLs and Java played for the Web.Distributed applications that run on a blockchain infrastructure are architected differently than applications that were built for the Web’s architecture.In a traditional Web application, you have client-side Javascript code that is run by users inside their browsers and server-side code that is run by a host or company. By contrast, in a distributed application, you have smart logic running on a virtual network of computers (the peer-to-peer network), and client-side code running in a special browser (or client), with the blockchain ledger acting as a shared resource.With this new type of rewiring, comes the need to also rewire a variety of blockchain standards and technology layers.Conceivably, blockchains could rely on a number of standards above the Internet’s existing standards, to allow a smooth bridging from one layer to another. That would be a breakthrough.A blockchain universal stack could resemble something like this (basically, we would add three layers on top of the Internet):Blockchain browsers (B-Browsers) are going to be important, as we will start to see them in 2017. They will be used to launch blockchain applications, and might look like normal applications we are familiar with, except that they will carry with them some new features that are enabled by blockchain back ends (instead of databases).Some of the exciting new blockchain browsers to watch include MetaMask, Blockstack and Mist. These currently have a technical slant, and they are not yet geared at the casual end-user, but they will eventually evolve to become more end-user friendly.A new breed of blockchain applications will come in the form of peer-to-peer browser experiences (eg: OpenBazaar), while another type will be bolted straight on the current Web, but with a blockchain back end (eg: Steemit).A trust services layer could be that API veneer that homogenizes how we create, move, check states, inspect proofs, follow historical paths, etc: that is, perform the functions that blockchains handle well.Blockchains interoperability is inevitable, but we don’t know exactly yet at what levels, unless we get closer by iterating near the real friction points.Nothing great has ever been adopted widely all over the world, unless it was somehow homogenized to make it easily assimilated by the masses.We need universal tools that no one owns, but that benefit everybody, similar to the Web technologies that liberated the Internet.Tim Berners-Lee explained why this was so important for the Web:There are promising examples of blockchain related standards, and we need to see more of them.In the de-facto category, two notable mentions are IPFS (Inter Planetary File System), and an Ethereum-led token issuance standard, labelled ERC20 (which is becoming a de-facto standard in Initial Cryptocurrency Offerings).IPFS is not just focused on the blockchain, although they are a good match, as IPFS has proven to be popular with blockchain applications (eg: OpenBazaar), where permanent IPFS links get placed into a blockchain transaction.A few consortiums have also placed blockchain standards on their working agenda, and I enumerated them in my \"State of Global Blockchain Consortia\" article.In the industry-led camp, we will need to follow the ISO/TC 307 Blockchain and electronic distributed ledger technologies technical committee who has stated their serious intentions by partaking in the blockchain standards roll call.On the enterprise-side, the jury is still out, as vendors place their software in open source repositories, or declare an open standard with a handful of their customers, in the hopes of letting this work become a real standard via sheer adoption – eg: Hyperledger, Digital Assets, Chain, and R3.Placing software in the open source realm is a good practice, but there is a difference when it starts that way from Day 1 (eg: bitcoin, ethereum) versus doing it a posteriori to gain more market acceptance.Furthermore, I am a firm believer that private and public blockchains need to also share common standards. It would be inconceivable that the Internet and private intranets wouldn’t interoperate or interconnect at the very least; yet, we are building private and public blockchain technologies and applications without due regard to the inevitability of that intersection.Yes, I am seriously talking about standards. It is not too early, even if I thought last year that we shouldn’t rush blockchain standards before their time. In 2017, we will need to start seeing serious discussions about universal standards, along with real intentions from industry participants to work together for that aim to materialize.We need to realize that, in addition to competing in the marketplace, we have to also cooperate on common technical objectives.In an ideal world, the blockchain field would produce an orderly architecture stack that carries popular standards, commonly used by all of its participants. It would be the resulting mix of de-facto and industry-led standards.As a side benefit, the existence of standards could also lubricate network effects, a much needed success characteristic. In turn, that would entice new marketplace entrants to focus on their differentiation, instead of building the same overlapping technology pieces.You don’t typically win by competing on standards, yet you don’t know what is a standard initially, so you might start by competing on everything. A sign of industry maturity will be seen when we hear of companies dropping certain proprietary technologies in favor of cooperative efforts.That said, we shouldn’t suspend everything in order to just work on standards in a vacuum. Vendors and blockchain core developers must continue to work on their own technologies while closely monitoring adoption, and always being sensitive about opportunities for industry collaboration. We can’t force standards on the market, but the market will need to embrace standards over time.If blockchain technologies ignore the eventuality of standards, we are going to see less adoption.Maybe we should think of the blockchain as a public good utility, and encourage an evolution that is not unlike the Internet’s, in terms of openness and neutrality of access.Will the collection of blockchain technologies turn into another giant Internet, or will their journey unfold into a messy and fragmented evolution, like the database market, prior to its consolidation?We have had the blockchain for a while, and it is gaining adoption. New and exciting applications are being built on blockchain technologies. Now is the time to realize that the blockchain’s best future days ahead will depend on how well we expose its capabilities more universally, and more openly.

This can take the form of a \"Wall with Mexico\" (US), a \"We\u0027re fed up with experts\" (Brexit) or a \"Gutmensch\" during the refugee crisis in Germany.In this new world, the elite is the enemy. Simplifications and buzzwords are the new 140-characters-style manifestations of politics.So, where does \u0027blockchain\u0027 fit into all of this?As a very complicated, technical topic, there are also signs it could become something of a political football. Permissioned or permissionless, there are lots of different transformational and creative blockchain applications, but confusion is still widespread.In Italy, the Five Star Movement political party led by Beppe Grillo, a former comedian, has started to use blockchain as a buzzword for its purposes.As he commented humorously in an interview on the suspension of Federico Pizzarotti:OK, this was a joke by the (former) comedian, but it still sounds rather frightening.So, where is blockchain as a buzzword in all of this? And what does it mean for the future development of blockchain? Ironically, it is the Trump presidency that may have the most impact on the dialogue surrounding the technology.Donald Trump and his team just appointed a major advocate of bitcoin and blockchain, Mick Mulvaney, as the US Budget Director.The statement on this appointment is remarkable from a blockchain point of view.Trump has even said in a statement:Of course, it is not clear if Trump actually wants to provide clarity on how public money is actually being spent.To think he intends to track taxpayer money on a blockchain may be just a naive wish (remember, he doesn\u0027t even want the public to see the finances of his own charity or company).Yet, it is an interesting signal to the industry.While this may signal signs of optimism, it seems obvious that Donald Trump will certainly not list blockchain technology as one of his priorities.Here, however, there is a large \u0027BUT\u0027.Trump is a big fan of cutting regulations in the financial sector. During the election campaign, he made an almost utopian promise to abolish 70% of federal regulations.Even if this figure comes to only 10% (as his adviser Anthony Scaramucci implies) this would be a significant step towards simplifying financial transactions and giving more freedom for cryptocurrency entrepreneurs.Mulvaney himself has already established a blockchain caucus in the congress last September.Of course, there is no guarantee that this caucus will lead to concrete results and promotion of blockchain projects. However, it increases the likelihood that blockchain projects can get in touch with government and potential investors.This could be the beginning of real progress.Another reason blockchain could flourish under Trump has to do with capital flight.Bitcoin, after all, invented blockchain technology, and although its blockchain involves a lot more features than financial transactions may want, it is still important for the image of blockchain projects – especially from the perspective of the public opinion.A Trump presidency, as mentioned above, involves a great deal of uncertainty for many parties in economic terms, and this uncertainty could lead to interest in alternative assets.The majority might consider gold as a safe harbor for their money, but many speculative investors could begin to pay close attention to bitcoin.An asset that is (still) independent from specific countries and their policy, and which is outside of a possible political and economic ice age of the US with other countries (for example, China).What can we conclude from these indicators?For one, populism creates the conditions for repeatable buzzwords to propogate. As a movement, it tends to favor this ideology over more complex processes, and it can be difficult to tell if the users of these buzzwords want real change.In the case of blockchain, however, this is irrelevant, since any discussion about it is likely to lead to development and change.As you are likely to remember, the more you talk about blockchain, the more it encourages thought and development.The irony in the end is, that the decentralized approach and the philosophy behind blockchain could also make it easier to verify and confirm the truth.On a long enough timeline, it could even help bring an end to populism, fake news and half-truths.In this light, I say let the populists use blockchain as a buzzword, if it means their own end. (Maybe, though, let\u0027s not tell Trump what it\u0027s really all about).Strong man illustration via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Politics, Blockchain Technology, Regulation, Donald Trump, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/01/13/blockchains-r-word-and-3-other-trends-for-2017/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/4NYVMniYuvMtpTTbXfXYzJmUSw4\u003d/570x214/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/ELBGNBCH7RDQJEV6L2X6PSQ6X4.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain\u0027s R-Word (And 3 Other Trends for 2017)","INTRO":"FinTech expert Simon Taylor discusses what he sees as the challenges (and opportunities) ahead for enterprise applications of distributed ledger tech.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Simon Taylor is co-founder and director at 11:FS, a FinTech advisory firm, and the former vice president of entrepreneurial partnerships at Barclays. In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Taylor discusses what he sees as the challenges (and opportunities) ahead for enterprise applications of distributed ledger tech. 2016 has been a rollercoaster year for those of us following blockchain and distributed ledger tech.Whether it was bitcoin pushing toward $1,000, a consortium of banks open-sourcing software with R3\u0027s Corda, or government and central banks supporting blockchain experimentations, you can\u0027t deny the subject has been everywhere.While some have grown tired of the endless press releases and bickering about ledger designs, in the background, real progress is being made, and major organizations are already placing their bets.In 2017, I’m watching for maturity in the active projects both from startups and blockchain communities, as well as the incumbent financial services companies. Evolution and revolution are necessary, and I believe we can learn from both.But, if you\u0027re new to this space, it may not be obvious where you should invest your time or resources.To help you make those decisions, I\u0027ve identified four macro trends I see happening in 2017.\"Where is the end product?\"My projection is, this will be a common question this year as executives and mainstream media look but fail to see the traction being made.But for the first time, 2017 might see it answered as the launch of the first real distributed ledger products go live, likely with a focus on gold trading. Right when you think you don\u0027t have to do anything, real-world, scalable financial products hit the financial markets.So while the \u0027end product\u0027 question will emerge (and go away), others will debut.As 2017 is unlikely to be the year DLT scales for corporates, many will begin to ask, \u0027Where\u0027s the revenue?\u0027 The business cases are out there, they’re just not obvious from 30,000 ft.While everyone is obsessed with who\u0027s in what consortium, what\u0027s more interesting is what systems people are building and what that will mean.We\u0027re seeing the beginnings of real structural change in financial markets.If you imagine financial markets today as being 100% centralized, with bitcoin being 100% decentralized, then financial markets are taking baby steps away from centralised power.Over time, any shift in the first number is significant.My guess is that as banks talk more about \"smart contracts\" and DLT instead of \"blockchain\", the market will recognize that these corporate things are neither shared databases nor blockchains, but some new interesting thing.For now, this has been given the label \"DLT\", but likely needs a more accurate one.Yet, in financial markets, where new asset classes or financial agreements become revenue opportunities for banks and financial market participants, a new narrative must emerge. One that moves away from \"cost and efficiency\" only.I’ve long been an advocate of mainstreaming bitcoin and (outside of rising interest in DLT) I predict mainstream attitudes are starting to change about bitcoin.Companies like PwC, Deloitte and others are making major plays in bitcoin and ethereum, and companies like Bloq and Blockstream have started to resemble the early days of Linux enterprise companies, making open-source \"wild\" software tame and consumable for large corporates.In this environment, institutional investors may start to leverage bitcoin’s infrastructure and even go deeper into bitcoin investing.Given that the line between the bitcoin world and the banking world could start blurring (as new business models emerge beyond payments and remittances, and wallets are released) this seems even more likely to occur.It will be very small at first, but projects like t0 are the types of things we may look back on in 25 years as a watershed moment.The current experimentation environment is super interesting to watch, and new business models will emerge. However, there will be failures, as well.We might have one, maybe two, smaller DAO-like failures in the public blockchain space. As we go through this learning and experimentation, a more useable, more robust framework for token or smart contract-based businesses compatible with local laws will start to emerge.There is no good reason why you couldn’t build a business this way now, it’s just much harder than a bog-standard token sale.There has been some good legal advice on how to do token sales well, but the idea that these “products” should be pre-sold to fund these efforts needs rethinking.My guess is we\u0027ll begin to see more creativity beyond the ICO as we know it today.Revenue image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Banking, Fintech, 2016 Review, 2016 in Review, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/01/10/national-science-foundation-to-fund-blockchain-security-research/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/gLHuEGDom4j7CsYOngmqIAPm_jA\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/KBKYP47GFNDSNDFAWIEPJOVB7E.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"National Science Foundation to Fund Blockchain Security Research","INTRO":"The National Science Foundation is seeking to fund research into how technologies like blockchain can improve cyberinfrastructure resilience.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The National Science Foundation (NSF) is seeking to fund research into how technologies like blockchain can improve the resiliency of cyber-infrastructure.According to a grant proposal solicitation initially released last year and updated at the start of 2017, the NSF is looking to fund research to the tune of $8.5m.

If significant headway isn\u0027t made – or real value delivered, whether in cost savings or new revenue generation – by the end of 2017, I suspect the technology will risk developing fatigue in executive suites.A key part of the issue is that while progress has been made, the technology has not yet reached widespread adoption – the market is crowded with proofs-of-concept (PoCs), but not enough live implementations.And while some successes have been achieved, nothing with significant volume, staying power or appropriate scalability has emerged. As a result, the small size of existing applications means that the cost of running blockchain platforms might still be greater than the value derived from them.Urgency and progress, rather than more of the same, will be essential to move forward.Yet, it\u0027s not all doom and gloom. 2017 will potentially be a banner year for blockchain. In fact, we at Deloitte are quite bullish on our outlook.Why? Financial institutions have the power and ability to move blockchain to the next level. To get there, companies will likely need to do two key things.First, they will need to move away from churning out proofs-of-concept, shifting instead toward full-blown solutions.Second, it will be critical for them to come together and further form industry consortiums to unlock mass-scale value. For blockchain to remain relevant, the entire industry should come together.And, with more than 20 consortia in place already, we are on our way to success.So, how do we ensure a successful future for blockchain? There are two main factors that can help propel blockchain forward in 2017.First, the industry needs to show that real-world implementation. That can help avoid this proof-of-concept stagnation, while also getting firms excited about blockchain and its actual uses. This is easier said than done and it requires to think differently about blockchain. The proof-of-concept is not the endgame anymore!The second critical success factor is for firms to come together to form smaller blockchain consortia specific to relevant use cases. These smaller consortia are critical for one simple reason: if you are on your own in blockchain, the value is extremely limited.They should include a small subset of key players at first, what we call the \"minimal viable ecosystem\". These players should represent all key functions and be represented by financial institutions, technology companies, regulators and consultancies to make them real.In addition to moving on from PoCs to real-world implementations and fostering industry partnerships, there are a few additional hurdles for blockchain in 2017.These include:Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

Yet all hope is not lost, says Peernova\u0027s Dave Hudson.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Dave Hudson is the author of the Hashingit.com blog. He is also the VP of software architecture at immutable ledger firm Peernova, and a long-time designer of operating systems, distributed systems, network stacks, compilers and databases.In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Hudson reviews the various struggles Internet of Things (IoT) innovators have faced since the 1990s – a cautionary tale of what might be in store for blockchain.2009 saw Satoshi Nakamoto deploy the first bitcoin node, and within five years its blockchain had become a large-scale industry.But while new applications and commercial opportunities seemed only a short step away, in 2016, we realized that industrial blockchains weren\u0027t going to be so straightforward.Early enthusiasm for new technologies is nothing new. With most, an initial wave of excitement sees new ideas touted as solutions to a huge range of problems, the hype fades, gives way to skepticism, and ultimately, real applications.In the late 1990s, the idea of Internet-connecting every electronic device seemed inescapable.Every vending machine, coffee pot, toaster, refrigerator, microwave, and TV, would be cabled to the \"net\", and a utopian sharing of data would improve life for everyone.The reality for what we now term the \"Internet of Things\", or IoT, was a little different.The original theory of IoT was that data would make everything better.Microwave ovens might scan cooking instructions and thus not make mistakes, refrigerators might reorder milk, etc. Automation would liberate users of these appliances, and give them time for other things.Unfortunately, the theory hadn\u0027t been worked out fully.Adding Internet connectivity to a device is never free-of-charge. In most cases this was a realm of small, low-CPU-powered devices, with no connectivity, so making them Internet-connected was going to cost money.In the 20 years since those original ideas, little has changed.Let\u0027s consider the microwave oven example. A microwave would need a pretty simple IoT hardware design, so perhaps $5 in parts cost. The first problem is that the $5 turns into nearer $15 by the time we add the margins for the company making the circuit boards, the company building the product and the retailer that sells it.Our next problem is that just having the hardware in our microwave oven isn’t sufficient. We need to make it communicate with servers that know how long, and at what power level, each new type of frozen pizza needs to cook. That implies servers, it implies dev-ops teams, it implies software engineers, and it implies business development people who persuade pizza manufacturers to provide cooking details for each new product they design.The infrastructure side has perhaps cost us another $10 per unit.Smart devices are a little like smart contracts.They\u0027re great when they \"just work\", but not so great when people make mistakes. The 1990s vision of IoT involved lots of network cables, but then we got Wi-Fi, and the wires could go away.Anyone who knows the technology understands that microwave ovens and 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi don\u0027t play nicely together. Similarly, 5 GHz Wi-Fi and solid walls don\u0027t play nicely together.While our IoT microwave oven might connect to a home router just fine in 95% of homes, the other 5% wouldn’t work reliably, if at all. Unlike software that tends to be notoriously unreliable, microwave ovens pretty much just work.If they don’t, then customers get irate and phone the manufacturer (more costs), they return \"faulty\" devices, they leave bad reviews on Amazon and they vow never to buy that brand again.The idea of a smart microwave might still look great on a PowerPoint slide, but the niggling details turn an interesting concept into a liability. It isn\u0027t worth the setup time and $50 to a customer, and the trouble isn\u0027t worth it for the manufacturer.We have the same challenges when thinking about uses for blockchains.Not every problem needs a blockchain as a solution. Blockchains cost money in terms of processing, storage and replication technology. In the case of a decentralized cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin, the blockchain-like concept is an essential characteristic to build a viable design, but for other problems we need to ask if the blockchain features are doing something valuable.If domestic microwaves aren\u0027t an option, then maybe refrigerators might be? Domestic ones have many of the same problems as microwaves, but how about commercial refrigeration? What if we could connect these devices so that if they broke down we could avoid expensive losses?A large industrial cold store might contain hundreds of thousands of dollars of refrigerated products, so signaling breakdowns and avoiding stock losses must be a valuable problem to solve?The maths is compelling, but the problem is that it was 25 years ago, too.While they might not have matched our IoT vision, many companies already found approaches to network these devices a long time ago.This example has another subtlety. Food storage is generally subject to regulations, and many countries require that records are kept of the temperatures at which products were stored.Without networking, there would be a need for someone to manually record temperatures every few hours, and this is both expensive and error-prone. Commercial refrigeration equipment also involves service companies and manufacturers providing on-site repairs, so we have more stakeholders for whom access to data is important.A naïve view of the problem might well have ignored them. Unexpected stakeholders introduce unexpected costs, and may resist changes that do not also offer them substantial benefits.The implications for blockchains are very similar.If a problem is already being solved, then, even if a blockchain might be useful, we need to ask if it offers enough incremental advantages? Do we know what all the problems are, including the ones that might not be obvious unless we were domain experts? Are there stakeholders, such as network architects, security experts, data architects, dev-ops teams, etc, who must change existing systems to adopt a new one? Are there analytical needs that require big-data, relational, graph, or time-series, views of any data that is being processed?Leaving aside specific uses of IoT for a moment, it\u0027s worth considering an important characteristic of the devices that were supposed to become smart and connected. These devices don’t get replaced very quickly.Most of our connected devices get replaced quite quickly. Vendors provide support for a few years but then expect users to discard them and buy new ones.The problem is we don\u0027t do this with most of our electrical items. We typically only replace them when they fail. By making them connected we introduce entirely new modes of failure.One such problem is how do we keep older devices working? Typically, manufacturers don\u0027t receive any form of revenue once a device is sold, so what is the incentive to keep providing software updates once those devices are out of warranty?Another problem is that, even if we might want to pay for updates and bug fixes, it may not be economically feasible to provide them. Older devices will have less powerful hardware that may not lend itself to new features.A final problem is that our manufacturer may not have considered the possibility of a device becoming compromised.The recent Mirai botnet has undoubtedly highlighted these issues, but how many toaster manufacturers have the level of security engineering skill to secure, and continue to secure, an IoT device against advanced adversaries?These are all governance problems. How will our IoT device, once installed, continue to function, and avoid becoming a problem?The parallels for blockchains are, again, striking.We have seen major concerns about the governance of the bitcoin and ethereum networks throughout 2016, with both having problems in terms defining operational rules in the face of users pushing the boundaries of the installed designs.With bitcoin, the block size has seen miners incentivized to restrict block expansion to maximize mining rewards, while The DAO hack incentivized users to want their coins back.When we consider the deployment of blockchains into other types of applications, then how are these sorts of governance issues to be reviewed and resolved? If we consider systems that might potentially operate for many years, then what does it mean to have immutable storage indefinitely? How will the inevitable mistakes of various human users be corrected? What are the incentives for participants to keep systems running correctly?In the case of commercial deployments, what are the implications for rolling out updates and upgrades across organizations that have different priorities?Our journey through the history of IoT has been somewhat cautionary, and there are many unanswered questions, but this is not the story of a lost war.Twenty years ago, Internet radio stations had barely surfaced, TiVo had yet to produce a set-top box, and ideas of 4k video on-demand streaming were distant science fiction.Fast forward 20 years later, and designers have leveraged advances in processing, power management, wide-area networking, wireless networking, storage, display technologies and distributed cloud storage, to construct new end-user experiences.Smart TVs and smartphones are barely recognizable from earlier CRT TVs and crude mobile phones, and yet both have a clear lineage to the original idea of connected things.IoT arrived but not quite as expected.Business empires based on the concepts of VHS tapes and DVDs were displaced. Users gained access to far more content, with lower costs and dramatically improved convenience. IoT technologies were not used in isolation, but were combined to solve real problems for the people who ultimately pay for the solutions, customers.This, then, is part of the challenge for blockchains.The commercial refrigeration systems slowly changed too. Internet connectivity was a better approach than the ad-hoc methods used 20 years ago, and so replaced earlier designs when they reached natural replacement cycles. Likewise, mature and more capable blockchain designs may well have opportunities to replace other technologies in the future.Bitcoin stands as the first example of a viable blockchain solution to a well-defined problem. As with many first-generation designs it has also served to highlight challenges, and its ultimate success or failure will depend on its ability to see them resolved.The challenge for other blockchains might be similar, but won’t be the same.Blockchain technology will be well served by recognizing, and confronting the hardest problems that we know about, rather than imagining that we can resolve them later. We know that issues such as security, privacy, deployment and governance need to be addressed.At the same time, we must avoid the temptation to use blockchains, and blockchain ideas, where they are not the best solutions, and champion those where they are.If we do these things, then 2017 should be a year where blockchain hype gives way to blockchain hope.Cave paintings image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Ethereum, Internet of Things, 2016 Review, 2016 in Review, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/01/05/what-is-enterprise-ethereum-details-emerge-on-secret-blockchain-project/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/XOpi_x-HPetWUiQD0mcCL9X8XOw\u003d/570x390/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/Y5FKMKJSDVGPLDYY2WSU5NH4F4.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"What is \u0027Enterprise Ethereum\u0027? Details Emerge on Secret Blockchain Project","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A secretive project that would aim to make ethereum more suitable for corporate users is taking shape, according to multiple sources familiar with the project.Rumored to be called Enterprise Ethereum, the exact nature of the effort remains veiled behind an unusual degree of privacy – especially so for participants who are better known for their work in more transparent open-source communities.Based on comments from sources, the group – which has the appearance of a broad consortium – intends to remain quiet until it is ready for a forthcoming public launch. Yet, word is already beginning to leak out.On Thursday, 15th December, a group of startup founders and representatives from some of the world\u0027s largest financial institutions reportedly gathered in New York to discuss the common problems they face when building enterprise applications on ethereum.On site at the undisclosed location appears to have been several bulge bracket banks, including at least one who was in the past involved with R3CEV, a stock exchange and a major software provider, among others.Independently confirmed attendees include Deloitte blockchain spin-off Nuco, Taiwanese blockchain consortium Amis and ConsenSys, an ethereum platform known for working closely with major tech firms including Red Hat and Microsoft.Though all the parties involved were discreet, a few additional details have begun to take shape.ConsenSys chief of staff Jeremy Millar, who previously worked at Goldman Sachs and Barclays, described the secretive project to CoinDesk, stating:According to Millar, who joined ConsenSys after founding enterprise blockchain consulting firm Ledger Partners LLP, the work is being done in partnership with multiple Ethereum Foundation members and core contributors.Present at the meeting was Alex Liu, founder of blockchain consortium Amis.A former employee of Qualcomm and Samsung, Liu indicated that the Enterprise Ethereum project would consist of an \"enterprise-grade stack\" and provide tools for users with demands to ensure the privacy of transactions – a major pain point for institutions today.But, he added that the technology would leverage the strengths of ethereum’s public blockchain.\"The scalability, security, privacy that any enterprise blockchain will want, those are being added or addressed,\" Liu told CoinDesk, adding:In the days following the Ethereum Enterprise meeting, Nuco co-founder Matthew Spoke confirmed he was in New York City to participate in the event.So far, the reason for the secrecy appears to be concerns about the competition coming from other sectors of the blockchain industry. But, there\u0027s reason to be skeptical about this possible reasoning for the group\u0027s launch.Former IBM blockchain developer Henning Diedrich, who left the company last year to work on his own smart contract language, contends that ethereum\u0027s software is already suitable for private blockchains that he tested at IBM.However, he noted that the relatively nascent state of enterprise products like Hyperledger and R3CEV\u0027s Corda platform may be forcing enterprise interest in a more robust offering from ethereum, a comparatively more tested alternative.Though Diedrich argued that ethereum developers still have room to improve the product, he remains skeptical that a large-scale ethereum consortium is even necessary.\"Sure you can always make it easier,\" he said. \"But the limits are being tackled.\"Regardless of who else might be involved, blockchain consortia have already proven their ability to help organizers recruit high-profile participants.Ethereum users are no different, according to Hudson Jameson, a former lead blockchain researcher at USAA, and now a member of the Ethereum Foundation.Jameson told CoinDesk that he believes \"2017 is going to have a number of consortiums, primarily between banks that are all testing on ethereum or ethereum derivatives.\"But, to his knowledge, not a single one of his peers at the Ethereum Foundation was at that secretive meeting in New York City on 15th December.As for Alex Liu, he’s not surprised in the least that little is known about \"Ethereum Enterprise\", if it exists.Liu indicated the secrecy is part of the plan, but only for the short term.He said:Industrial manufacturing image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Technology, Ethereum, Banking, Consortia, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Jan 5, 2017 at 3:05 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/01/04/why-2017-will-prove-blockchain-was-a-bad-idea/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/rZsRi1c7rS-a8E0OR9S23lmJBtU\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/ZJZBVQQ6I5CDLPPZQLYA6MKLOM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Why 2017 Will Prove \u0027Blockchain\u0027 Was a Bad Idea","INTRO":"Despite the hype around enterprise blockchain technologies, achievements in the bitcoin community have been greater, argues Ferdinando Ametrano.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ferdinando Ametrano teaches Bitcoin and Blockchain Technologies at Politecnico di Milano and Milano Bicocca University. He was chairman of Scaling Bitcoin 2016 and is also former Head of Blockchain and Virtual Currencies at Intesa Sanpaolo bank.In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Ametrano argues that, despite the hype around enterprise blockchain technologies, achievements in the bitcoin community have been greater.Another year goes by, another intense chapter in the history of the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem.There has been no shortage of folklore and drama: 2016 started with the \"whiny ragequit\" of Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn, who shortly after joining banking consortium R3CEV declared bitcoin a failure and sold all his coins.It\u0027s worth noting the price of bitcoin has now ended 2016 near a three-year high.Elsewhere, the con artist Craig Wright claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, providing laughable cryptographic proofs to bamboozle and discredit reputable people. The unmissable yearly exchange heist this time hit Bitfinex, its $66m theft becoming notable also for the lengths it went to to avoid bankruptcy.Major consortia competed for the membership of financial institutions and technological players, with Hyperledger beating R3 100 to 70 – numbers implausible for any kind of sensible action plan but representative of the overblown blockchain hype and the widespread fear of missing out.People have been advocating blockchain as a magic wand to solve many global problems (like securing nuclear weapons and managing the power grid); I have been compelled to humbly add that its potential at scrambling eggs should not be underestimated.Actually, as knowledgeable people are fully aware, blockchain has not been really cool in 2016. The 2014 champion, bitcoin was dethroned by blockchain in 2015, but this year the debate has crowned distributed ledger technology (DLT) as the relevant topic.Instead of pondering why blockchain without bitcoin (or another native token) made no sense (and admitting that blockchain was just abused as a snake-oil marketing buzzword), many of the projects originally touted to \"bring blockchain to finance\" flippantly shifted to DLT.Nobody has really figured out what this DLT chimera is about or which problem it should solve. (Yet, we have been told it could reduce banks\u0027 infrastructural costs by $20bn). Even the European Securities Market Authorities (ESMA) wonders about its applicability.The ESMA consultation paper issued in June posed many sensible specific questions: unfortunately most of the answers received were generic rhetoric exercises. Adding insult to injury, even when it comes to derivatives trading and clearing (where ESMA is confident DLT cannot be applied), unfunded claims about interest rate swaps as smart contracts on DLT obfuscate the debate.Last but not least, no DLT proposal has really delved into how to implement cash-on-the-ledger for effective delivery vs payment or, even more crucially, how to reach decentralized consensus.Bitcoin and blockchain is more a cultural paradigm shift than just a technology. It is all about decentralization, so the attempt of intermediaries to repurpose it appears quite ludicrous.As pointed out by Mainelli and Milne:Given that bitcoin and blockchain is at the crossroads of game theory, cryptography, data networking, and monetary theory, a proper understanding of the subject is in fact quite rare.One can consider the blockchain as the auditable immutable log of database updates: it can be used to reach the current database consensus state starting from an empty state (the UTXO database in the bitcoin case).But how to make this log at least tamper-evident in a distributed network has often been neglected, and sometimes stultified, as with the proposal to make the blockchain rewritable. Decentralized consensus seems so far very hard to reach without the economic incentives provided by a blockchain native digital asset like bitcoin.Partial solutions have been proposed in some special configurations of DLT – eg: by Digital Asset for the Australian Stock Exchange post-trade system.Here a shared ledger registering the log of (the hash values of) all trades is generated, updated and cryptographically signed by a central counterparty in a distributed, but by no means decentralized, environment. The notary service of the central counterparty can hardly be generalized to a decentralized framework, unless ironically resorting to the bitcoin blockchain (the most secure one, since the effort and cost for its manipulation is prohibitive) as notary.We are back now to the most notable application of blockchain beyond bitcoin: timestamping, anchoring and notarization.A generic data set (a file, a database, the status of a transaction network) can be hashed to produce a short unique identifier. Such a digital fingerprint can be associated to a bitcoin transaction and hence registered on the blockchain. The blockchain immutability then provides robust non-repudiable timestamping that can always prove, without doubt, the existence of that data set in that specific status at that precise moment in time.We are touching the crucial point here: How can so many miss the point about the importance of bitcoin as digital gold?For the first time, we have a scarce digital asset which can be transmitted, but not duplicated (ie: spent, not double-spent): this is the groundbreaking achievement by Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin could prove to be digital gold: as relevant as physical gold has been in human history and in the development of trade, money and finance.It has already realized a resilient permissionless transaction network and has appreciated more than 900x in less than six years.How can people possibly care more for the sub-par append-only sequential data structure known as blockchain instead?This year, central bankers at least have been better at recognizing bitcoin\u0027s relevance.Sheng Songcheng, member of the National People\u0027s Congress and Director of the Investigation and Statistics Department of the People’s Bank of China, recently issued similar remarks.Songcheng said:It seems like they are scared by the likelihood of the scenario where private money competes with fiat money; the dream illustrated by Nobel laureate Friedrich von Hayek in \"Denationalisation of Money\" finally becomes true, breaking the millenary government monopoly of money.Through market competition, better money will eventually prevail, but the Emperor is mad at the idea of money without his stamp of approval.In 2016, private cryptocurrencies have been vying for the top spot, with ethereum establishing itself as the most plausible bitcoin alternative.This Hayekian scenario is to be loved, and indeed a lot has been learned by this fierce competition. Yet, I believe the only conclusion is that bitcoin has come out on top.The frequent ethereum network outages (provoked by DDoS attacks) have proved how brilliant the bitcoin development team has been in managing its network for eight years without similar problems.Further, the disagreement between alternative ethereum implementations has forked the ethereum blockchain, proving how essential it is for a cryptocurrency to have just one reference implementation. The DAO hack proved how Turing completeness is excessive hubris and how wise it was for bitcoin to be conservative when it comes to its scripting language.In my view, the subsequent split between ethereum (ETH) and ethereum classic (ETC) weakened ETH and proved how dangerous it is to have a contentious hard fork, and how healthy it is for bitcoin development not to be driven by any “benevolent dictator”.The ethereum failures have contributed in some fashion to lessen the bitcoin debate about a hard fork for bigger block size.While still supported by a significant vocal minority, the issue is not as rampant as it was at the end of 2015. Especially now that Segregated Witness (SegWit, the soft-fork aimed at fixing the malleability problem and providing many other improvements) could be activated, allowing also for an effective block size increase.SegWitis crucial for many possible future developments and its adoption would mark a turning point in the bitcoin history.Nonetheless, even if the bigger-block minority will stop it, some celebration should be in order because bitcoin is proving once again how resilient it is to manipulation attempts, even one advocated by a core development team with a brilliant track record.That\u0027s not to say bitcoin doesn\u0027t have big issues ahead.As noted during the 2016 developer conference in Milan, this year has been mostly about two issues: the off-chain scaling approach proposed by Lightning Network and the fungibility and privacy issue.Lightning Networkavoids the extreme security of having all nodes validating all transactions: it secures off-chain transactions with a cryptographic smart contract that relies on the main blockchain for dispute resolution.Fungibility is the requirement for all bitcoin to be equal: an atom of physical gold is indistinguishable from any other gold atom, whatever its history. Unfortunately this is not really true for bitcoin, allowing for bitcoin of different value and legitimacy depending on their pedigree.While often underappreciated, this is probably the most relevant limit in the current bitcoin implementation, but it can be mitigated through mixing techniques (in my view Joinmarket and TumbleBit are promising approaches that might lead to effective improvement).It is evident here that the obfuscation needed for transaction privacy would ensure fungibility and vice versa.It is again the Hayekian scenario of competing currencies, this time the rise of Monero and ZCash (and of the MimbleWimble idea), that has proven how relevant the demand for fungibility and privacy is. Indeed, how crucial the privacy debate has been represented by the FBI and Apple\u0027s encryption dispute, the Yahoo mass surveillance incident, the UK Investigatory Powers Act, the IRS\u0027s Coinbase data request, etc.This mass surveillance approach is really despicable: on one hand, it is ineffective because criminals will be able to patch cryptographic backdoors adopting a second-layer robust encryption; on the other hand, it will put at risks everybody’s privacy, allowing criminals to use the backdoor to spy on the honest people.Bitcoin will now have to prove its ability to grant financial privacy.Yet, all in all, 2017 might be the final year in the pump-and-dump scheme of blockchain-without-bitcoin , the last-ditch effort to prove the marginal utility of databases on crypto-steroids.Probably some smart contract hype will clutter the debate, thanks to the smartest ones among the fools trying to outsmart even the smart contract inventor.But most of this fuss will finally leave center stage, allowing for the 2018 return of (a hopefully more fungible) bitcoin.Digital gold effective in the defence of privacy and at freeing money from state and central banks monopoly, bitcoin might bootstrap new monetary systems: it might be surpassed by more advanced forms of money, as happened to physical gold, without becoming obsolete. And it will ignite new economic and trade systems: for the first time really global, borderless, and inclusive.In the meantime, please fasten your seatbelt for another rollercoaster of a year.

Cryptiv\u0027s CEO argues the two might be more intertwined than one might think.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Mat Cybula is the CEO of Cryptiv Inc, a Toronto-based startup that provides enterprise-grade blockchain wallet systems that enable private-key and employee-access management. In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Cybula discusses why he believes the current political environment is priming the world for blockchain-based change. 2016 has been a year of full of surprises. Unexpected events like the rise of Donald Trump and the victory of the \u0027Brexit\u0027 supporters in the UK have left a trail of baffled \"experts\" and commentators in their wake.The scaffolding that has held the global order in place for the past 20 years has taken a string of unanticipated hits from unlikely sources, and the powers that be have looked clumsy as they have tried to adapt.It is difficult to pin down, but it feels like something big is changing in our world.Now, as blockchains stand poised to impact the world of protocols, this may really only just be the beginning of more change to come.Before we explore how the power structures of the world may be changing, let us take a careful look at these things we call \"protocols\". The word \"protocol\" has a certain cross-disciplinary characteristic that is quite interesting and relevant to current events.A protocol, by definition, refers to a set of rules and procedures that govern a given system.This can refer to social systems, like one\u0027s expected behavior in a certain situation amongst a group of people. Many of us may remember feeling a social sting when we were judged to be in violation of accepted social norms by your peers.  That was you breaching protocol.Within the corridors of power, protocols are very important indeed.Diplomats, politicians, and CEOs all have to abide by these protocols if they want to be part of the game. And when protocols are breached, even in subtle ways, it usually means that there are tensions below the surface.One thing that seems certain is that something profound has changed.The election of Donald Trump and the \u0027Brexit\u0027 referendum have altered the norms and protocols that many smart people previously took for granted.Whether one thinks that Trump is a con artist, a neo-Reaganite messiah or a disciple of the dark art of non-linear warfare (developed by Putin’s propaganda chief Vladislav Surkov), it is undeniable that he has just rewritten a lot of rules.The common thread is a feeling that the old rules must change at all costs because those in power have failed us. And this suspicion of the elites and of globalization\u0027s benefits make sense when viewed through the lens of inequality.Voters want new protocols to replace a status quo they feel is rigged in favor of those with wealth and power. But, why has this populist demand for change seemingly come out of nowhere in 2016?What may have changed is that these arrangements are getting harder to cloak in their traditional veil of secrecy. Partly, this is due to the fact that there is now a digital paper trail that has allowed hackers like Guccifer 2.0 and whistle-blowers like Snowden to spring \"leaks\" and allow us to peer behind the curtain.Leaked emails and documents, like the Panama Papers, have provided a glimpse into the messy details of how the world really works at the top levels.What they have revealed confirms the suspicions of the most cynical amongst us.This sentiment now seems on the verge of spilling over into the world of finance, with monetary experiments and unexpected shocks coming from multiple sources.In China, the year began with state interventions designed to reverse a collapse in Chinese stock market, which was followed by a persistent flight of capital, reserve depletion and currency devaluation.Europe faced its own set of challenges, with the UK choosing to leave the political union, while the euro currency project braces for challenges from populist parties in Italy and France. Despite all this turmoil and the unexpected election of Donald Trump, stock indexes are flirting with the record-breaking levels.The year has also seen the evolution of a number of unorthodox monetary policies being carried out and some that are winding down.India\u0027s Prime Minister Narendra Modi shocked his country, and its economy, with an unexpected ban on the two highest currency notes in circulation.This move, which some view as an escalation in the \"war on cash\", is a bold monetary experiment on a massive scale that aims to strengthen central controls over their currency. Meanwhile, another monetary experiment – named quantitative easing, a policy that has been in place since 2008 – has begun to unwind with the Federal Reserve raising rates for the first time since the financial crisis.Equally notable have been the monetary experiments that are being conducted on public blockchains.These projects have come a long way in 2016 and are beginning to carve out an important niche within the world’s financial system.A year ago, the price of bitcoin was a lowly $400 and the ethereum network was an upstart altcoin that was worth barely $1 and had yet to prove itself. Granted, both projects have had their issues, bitcoin is still seemingly stuck in a civil war over scaling plans, and ethereum had to deal with the repercussions of the DAO hack and DDOS attacks on their network which led to some unplanned hard forks.Not to be outdone, the financial industry has collectively awoken to the potential for blockchain technologies in 2016 and has spent the year investing heavily in the industry, forming coalitions and generally trying to figure out a way to leverage this new technology.The word protocol can also refer to something a bit more technical, like a set of rules that allow a computer to interact with a given network.Packet-switching protocols, a brilliant idea developed by Paul Baran to create nuke-resistant communications, are about as integral to our daily lives, and the economy, as electricity or central heating.After all, that is all these blockchain networks really are – a clever arrangement of a new set of technical protocols that allow peers to move \"value\" between one another.Given the uncertainty in geopolitics, the fragility of legacy financial infrastructure and the potential for blockchain technology to address these issues, it looks like a number of new technical protocols may be on the horizon in 2017.On the public side, bitcoin continues to appeal to those seeking shelter from monetary chaos and capital controls, while the ethereum network has enabled a new wave of innovative projects. Ethereum now serves as a platform for decentralized implementations of everything from predictions markets and fund management to P2P cloud computing and corporate governance.Meanwhile, bitcoin is being used as a remittance alternative and a store of value in countries like Venezuela, India and China.Public-ledger advocates believe that the open-sourced and permissionless nature of these systems, combined with network effects and a genuine demand for stateless and secure P2P money make change inevitable.In the corporate world, blockchain technologies are viewed as a solution to help re-engineer the existing financial system that is desperate to modernize. From this perspective, blockchain is an incredible technology that can be leveraged by the world\u0027s existing financial institutions to clear transactions faster, reduce overhead and replace legacy systems that are long overdue for an expensive upgrade.This could create a financial system that is safer, more transparent and affordable.Achieving this has nonetheless proven difficult as blockchain technologies don’t fit well within existing regulatory paradigms and technological hurdles like scalability and privacy still pose obstacles.The financial industry is highly competitive and attempting to get financial institutions to collaborate is no easy task. This has stemmed the ability for network effects to take hold as we see startups, consortiums and banks trying to build permissioned blockchains.It is evident that we are beginning to pass through the peak of Gartner\u0027s hype cycle.As the excitement settles down and many come to terms with the limitations of blockchain technologies, we will begin to see some proof of concepts die off and the more promising ones go into production. Incumbents will go after the low-hanging fruit where blockchain technologies can provide real solutions in the near-term.They will continue to use this technology to sustain and strengthen their existing business models. In the meantime, we will likely see more ICOs and the development of applications on both the bitcoin and ethereum networks.These applications will come to represent a growing threat to the incumbents as they provide alternative financial services and products to a developing niche market of early crypto-adopters. We will begin to see mainstream adoption of these applications from financial institutions like hedge funds and other fund managers.Likely, the predominant use cases of public blockchains will continue to be for financial speculation and as an alternative store of value.What is so fascinating about blockchain technologies, however, is that they combine powerful forces – peer-to-peer cryptography, financial markets and network effects – to achieve disruptive ends. The thing about disruptive change is that it is scary and difficult to predict.People have trouble dealing with uncertainty and we generally avoid it.But, in 2016, we witnessed a tide of uncertainty being unleashed deliberately by voters who are increasingly willing to gamble on an uncertain future because they feel like they have little to lose.By all accounts, 2017 could prove to be even more unpredictable. Scary as this may be, it also means that there will be ample opportunity to make a positive impact in a world yearning for change.Under these uncertain conditions, blockchain technologies of all flavors have the potential to be transformative in the coming year – it is exciting to be a part of it.Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

It had just gone through one of its most tumultuous whipsaw rides, starting 2013 at $13 before skyrocketing to $233, then dropping quickly to $50.By the time we started, the price had recovered to $120, and there was excitement in the air that by year\u0027s end the price would rebound. One investor who attended our first meeting, Vinny Lingham (now CEO of blockchain startup Civic), made the outrageous prediction bitcoin would hit $1,000 by December. He was right.Flash forward to December 2016, and there has been another breathless run-up, one that prompts comparisons to 2013.Long-time investors in bitcoin have seen this all before, but from my perspective, the ecosystem is much improved.While the pure supply-demand equilibrium that generally causes market manias still applies, gone is the reliance on one exchange, Mt Gox. Exaggerated pricing is far less likely today with dozens of independent exchanges backed by VCs and compliant with regulators.The big trends of 2017 from my perspective in bitcoin will be the following:1. The 1% will finally get in on the actionKnowledgable family offices invested in bitcoin as early as 2013, when Barry Silbert offered his Bitcoin Investment Trust vehicle for accredited investors (when the price of bitcoin was barely over $100).This vehicle went public as GBTC, which isn\u0027t technically an ETF, but it does rely upon its underlying holdings of bitcoin and, in fact, trades at a premium to them (one share is backed by 0.1 BTC).SeekingAlpha called it the \"dumb investment of the week\" in March. Both the price of bitcoin and GBTC have more than doubled since.2.The first mainstream bitcoin ETF will come to marketI predicted on a panel in January, 2014, that one of the three things bitcoin needed to move into the mainstream was an ETF on NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), so any stock investor could profit as easily as they can buy a gold or silver ETF. (The other two needs I listed, bitcoin debit cards and a bitcoin exchange that can be used in all 50 states, both took place within that year).It now appears likely that the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust (COIN) will finally be listed on NASDAQ this year.3. The price will go higher in direct correlation to the war on cashIndia, Venezuela, now Pakistan – as each new country\u0027s government made its larger bills (in the case of India, \u0027large\u0027 is only $7 and it\u0027s much less in Venezuela), the citizenry looks for ways to put cash into hard assets: gold, silver, and bitcoin (the only hard asset that’s also digital).While not as extreme as banning cash, clamping down on moving funds out of the country (China) and hyperinflation (Venezuela and much of Africa) leaves citizens without the ability to buy euros or USD looking for anything that will depreciate slower than its currency.For a while in Argentina, people bought stereo equipment as a store of value.Unlike used consumer products, however, bitcoin actually has the ability to appreciate and is a much more liquid asset than a DVD player.4. Bitcoin will continue to climbMy personal prediction is that bitcoin will reach $2,200 by the end of 2017, but it could be higher if certain currencies collapse and there is any significant move toward bitcoin in those markets; lower if those markets stabilize.I see very few scenarios where the price is lower 12 months from now than it is today.There has been some confusion among some investors and business users about the difference between public and private blockchains.Ethereum, for example, has been referred to as a blockchain solution without the baggage and regulation of bitcoin – yet as a public blockchain (ie: one that is not privately controlled and that has an asset value that typically trades on public exchanges), it faces the exact same regulatory issues that bitcoin does as a virtual currency (KYC, AML, MTL, etc).Only privately held software that does not trade as a commodity anywhere is exempt, but that category faces other issues, such as security and trust.Here are the trends I see in public blockchains this year:1. ICOs will continue, increase and diversifyToken crowdsales (also referred to by everyone but attorneys as \u0027initial coin offerings\u0027 or ICOs) first began about two years after the initial \u0027altcoins\u0027 appeared. (BitAngels was the largest investor in the original ICO, Mastercoin (now called OMNI), which raised $600,000 in August, 2013).Ethereum, in June, 2014, was the first big winner in the ICO marketplace, both in terms of funds raised ($18m, when bitcoin was $600) and appreciation (peaking at nearly 70x the ICO price of 0.0005 BTC).Maidsafe, Factom and Storj also had successful ICOs in 2014. Augur was one of the few big winners to do an ICO in 2015 (a down year for both bitcoin and ICOs).2016 saw large amounts raised for The DAO (more on that in the next bullet point), Waves, Lisk, FirstBlood, Golem Network and Iconomi. A few of these, but not most, had nice returns over the ICO (Lisk and Augur had the best appreciation from their ICOs when they started trading in 2016).This momentum will continue and accelerate as long as:As we enter 2017, there are at least 35 pending or current projects listed on ICO-List.com, and I could envision there being at least 200 ICOs launched in 2017 – once again raising a total in the low nine figures and with the top 10 taking the bulk of the funds.2. Innovation will be offset by cautionFear and greed are the two main drivers of any market. With The DAO\u0027s infamous ICO, an unbelievable $160m (nearly 9x the amount raised by ethereum) was stoked by FOMO and a too-good-to-be-true narrative that one could take one\u0027s money back.Then came the hack, which led to the split, and not only did The DAO die before its first deal, but ethereum itself still has never quite recovered.In 2017, there will be a handful of exciting, innovative uses of public blockchains that use the ICO process to raise awareness and funding.Some will succeed in fundraising, but the bar will be set higher, with a premium placed on teams with track records of the founders (no more anonymous developers).3. Not every blockchain will raise through an ICOZcash became the year’s most frenzied listing, yet it was funded by private sources and continues to have mining as a large part of its distribution strategy. Other leading privacy coins, Dash and Monero, operated similarly when they launched.Steem, a cryptocurrency tied to a social media network, also became a top 10 trading token without an ICO in 2016.Private blockchains will also continue to evolve in 2017, both as part of consortia like the Linux Foundation\u0027s HyperLedger, as well as VC-backed private companies targeting regulated industries such as banking, medical, insurance and real estate.A big question in 2017 will be to what extent any of these private blockchains can succeed given the lack of available talent in the industry. Public blockchains have already recruited small armies of developers to innovate on already popular code.It’s my opinion that angel investors will typically stay away from private blockchains (other than funds that are prohibited in investing in public blockchains) for this reason.Disclosures: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.

Tierion\u0027s CEO pens a measured look at how open-source projects achieve this feat so businesses can make better decisions.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Wayne Vaughan is the CEO of Tierion, a proof engine that lets you prove the integrity of any data, file, or business process. He is the co-author of Chainpoint, a standard for linking data to the blockchain.In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Wayne encourages buyers of blockchain technology to ask if their blockchain of choice is backed by stable ecosystem and ready for mission critical applications.2016 saw the rise of the blockchain evangelist.Not since the heady dotcom days have we seen so many experts hyping a new technology. But, amid the hype, little attention has been paid to an important question. Who pays for the blockchain?This consideration is especially important to anyone evaluating blockchain technology for their organization.The blockchain buzz began in 2015. Bitcoin’s association with illegal activities earned it a bad reputation. This led startups to brand themselves as blockchain companies. They promised to deliver the benefits of the \"technology behind bitcoin\" without the undesirable baggage. Most didn’t understand that the technology behind bitcoin has existed for years.Bitcoin\u0027s success is a result of the network’s economic incentives.This fundamental misunderstanding has led to much confusion and misinformation, including the popular notion that blockchain is a new type of distributed database where information persists forever and cannot be changed.Data can\u0027t live forever if no one pays the bills. Before you blockchain your business, let\u0027s examine who pays for three popular blockchain platforms.Bitcoin is primarily used to route and store value.Bitcoin works because miners earn money for running the network infrastructure. Remove this incentive and everything falls apart.Most bitcoin developers own bitcoin, and thus have a stake in the network\u0027s success. Over $1bn in venture capital has been invested in bitcoin companies to date, which subsidizes platform development.Most importantly, a complex circular economy has evolved over the past eight years that involves thousands of businesses all over the globe.While some of bitcoin\u0027s $15bn market cap remains driven by speculation, much of it now comes from the people and businesses using bitcoin. Each of these participants bears a share of the cost of securing the bitcoin network.Ethereum is a blockchain mainframe.The network behaves as single computer. Anyone can rent, compute and store data on ethereum by paying for it in its native token, ether. Miners that maintain the network infrastructure are rewarded in ether, which can be exchanged for bitcoin and ultimately converted to fiat currency.As with bitcoin, many ethereum developers own ether and have an interest in evangelizing the technology. Ethereum startups have received little funding from professional VCs relative to bitcoin startups.Instead, the ethereum ecosystem has relied on speculation of the ether token and crowdfunding to finance projects.So far, no circular economy has evolved around ethereum, but that’s to be expected since the network is just over one year old.Ethereum\u0027s long-term growth is dependent on developing an ecosystem where companies consume ether at a rate that exceeds the cost of running the network.I think of Hyperledger as a new brand of enterprise software platform that shares design characteristics with bitcoin.Its development is guided by group of companies that includes IBM, Intel and Airbus. The Hyperledger network infrastructure is paid for by customers in a traditional enterprise software licensing model.The costs of running Hyperledger are likely similar to the costs of running a cloud application.No surprises here.There\u0027s a lot to consider before buying a blockchain.Developers with blockchain expertise are rare and developer tools are immature. These factors increase security risks and make the cost of developing with blockchain higher than more mature technology stacks.Smart companies clearly define the problem they\u0027re trying to solve before approaching blockchain vendors. When you do talk to vendors, you’ll likely be faced with unfamiliar jargon and grandiose promises.Be sure to evaluate non-blockchain solutions. Ask if blockchain technology can enhance your existing technology stack.And don’t forget to ask \"Who pays for the blockchain?\" Is it supported by a stable ecosystem and ready for mission critical applications? A clear understanding of the incentives and economy behind the blockchain can save you a lot of trouble.Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016? A prediction for 2017?

Earlier this month, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan announced a joint research effort into the potential use of blockchain tech, while the US Federal Reserve has released its findings into researching the risks and rewards of using distributed ledgers.While no central bank has taken definitive action, the rhetoric continues to suggest experimentations at these organizations are ongoing – and that central bank blockchains could soon migrate out of the lab.The fourth-largest software producer in 2016and the third-largest server manufacturer, IBM has distinguished itself as the fount for innovation, holding the record for most patents received for the year for the 23rd consecutive year.So, it was shocking to many when IBM announced in February that the 105-year-old company had come up with a blockchain strategy for the delivery of its cloud-based business solutions (given that businesses seemed largely reluctant to aggressively back blockchain in years past).Still, that didn\u0027t stop IBM from revealing an ambitious multi-year plan that incorporated existing assets such as IBM zSystems – the principal IT system for the world’s top banks, the Watson Internet of Things (IoT) platform and Bluemix Garage into a blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) offering.As the year went on, there would prove no shortage of announcements from IBM, both as a company, and as a leading member of the Hyperledger blockchain project, which swelled to 100 global members.Following its inaugural release – Frontier – in 2015, the blockchain platform ethereum released its first production version, dubbed Homestead, in March of this year.Prior to the release, ethereum had largely gained notoriety and mainstream recognition due to the success of its crowdsale of ether tokens, but with Homestead, the platform emerged as a technology to watch.Amid a surge in market cap and value growth, major companies began branding ethereum \"bitcoin 2.0\", embracing the technology with a rare enthusiasm.Yet, the Homestead announcement was also notable for the outsized introductory statements by ethereum\u0027s enthusiasts.\"Homestead\u0027s arrival will begin to demonstrate the next generation of blockchain technology, whereby anything we can dream of, can be accomplished in a decentralized manner using ethereum,\" Andrew Keys, co-founder of ConsenSys Enterprises, told CoinDesk at the time.Such statements would set the stage for difficulties in late 2016 as ethereum hit a series of public growing pains.But even as open-source efforts progressed, businesses seemed more interested in alternative solutions.Soon after ethereum\u0027s big debut, New York-based startup R3CEV announced in April that it was working on a decentralized platform specifically designed for financial institutions. But while Corda offered a more private version of blockchain technology, its aims were similarly ambitious.\"Our conclusion is that distributed ledger and blockchain technology represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform the economics of data management across the financial industry,\" wrote Richard Gendal Brown, chief technology officer at R3, on his blog about this project.Other differences between the platform and competing solutions were more notable.Building a theoretical system that can respect and work around the reporting obligations and inter-organizational relationships that define modern finance, R3 revealed it was seeking to create a network that would provide both \"supervisory observer nodes\" (which could be used to oversee the system) and selectively include data (ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data).More could be in store for the tech in 2017, however.Since the announcement, R3 has shared its open-sourced Corda code to the HyperLedger project and revealed a roadmap for its work in 2017.Since the creation of bitcoin, questions have persisted about the identity of the anonymous author of its white paper.Yet, Satoshi Nakamoto did leave clues. In written posts, his (or her) grasp of English and use of British idioms and metaphors led many to believe that Nakamoto was not the Japanese man the name suggested.In December 2015, this piece of the puzzle seemed to fall into place when Wired and Gizmodo published reports alleging that the creator of bitcoin may be Craig Steven Wright, an Australian entrepreneur and former academic who has worked with K-Mart and the Australian Security Exchange.The reports also alleged that Dave Kleiman, a computer forensics expert, may have played a significant role, though the authors were not convinced at the time that they had the right men.Then, on 2nd May, Wright publicly declared that he was, indeed, Nakamoto.Making a claim that was validated by Bitcoin Foundation founding director Jon Matonis and Bitcoin Core developer Gavin Andresen, Wright sent a message – the validity of which was refuted by many in the community.Though Wright would give up on defending his claim, the drama nonetheless served to stoke mainstream interest in bitcoin as a technology.Faced with the possibility of having too many cooks in the kitchen, the Hyperledger project set the tone for its management in May by appointing Brian Behlendorf as its inaugural executive director.The founder of the Apache Software Foundation, Behlendorf quickly interpreted his primary role as being to streamline the new members\u0027 onboarding process.Stating at the time that, \"It shouldn’t take three weeks to make your first pull request,\" Behlendorf sought to create a system so that new members could start contributing to the fabric immediately, and work soon began.Over the course of 2016, the project would develop a thriving mailing list and hold a seemingly never-ending schedule of open hackathons.But at the center of this effort was Behlendorf, who, while new to the industry, wasn\u0027t quiet about extending support to other open-source projects or his desire to solve big problems.\"I’ve been as frustrated as anybody in technology about how broken the world seems,\" Behlendorf said to the MIT Technology Review in November. \"Corruption or bureaucracy or inefficiency are in some ways technology problems. Couldn’t this just be fixed?\"For more than a year, the bitcoin community anticipated, fretted and speculated on what \"the halving\", or the scheduled reduction of the reward given to bitcoin miners, would mean for the health of the network.Some speculated that the halving would lead to a decline in the price of bitcoin (as it would scare off speculative buyers), while others predicted a long-term hike in prices (based on the fact that new supply would shrink).Despite all the theories, however, the halving ultimately had little effect on the market (other than to serve as a cause for celebration among bitcoiners).Indeed, in an industry fraught with excessive drama, it was oddly unifying event.Bitcoin prices may have dropped 10% immediately after the halving, but as the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index shows, this was a mere speed bump in a banner year for the digital currency.If ethereum sparked initial interest, its first decentralized app (The DAO) would give the business world a glimpse of what a blockchain could do beyond cryptocurrency.Core to its impact was the notion that smart contracts could become powerful business tools, potentially redefining how we understand data storage and data sharing. Suffice to say, when The DAO\u0027s developers admitted to being hacked, it set off warning bells.The incident would lead to a massive sell-off on ether and the controversial forking of the ethereum blockchain to restore the lost ethers to the DAO.All told, The DAO\u0027s hack set the stage for major controversy, leading to the original unforked ethereum blockchain to be preserved and maintained as ethereum classic – a wholly separate cryptocurrency network.Months later, the event continues to provide fodder for analysis.While some may see it as a cautionary tale, others believe The DAO provided just a preview of the disruptive power blockchain (and ethereum in particular) could have at scale.Summer, it seemed, was the time for bad news.Not long after The DAO\u0027s struggles, another cryptocurrency hack saw more than $60m in bitcoin stolen from Bitfinex, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The incident represented the largest single loss of bitcoins since the 2014 collapse of Mt Gox, which saw 744,408 bitcoins disappear.Flustering an already declining bitcoin market, bitcoin prices dropped from $560.16 to $480 in a single day, with Bitfinex’s decision to halt trading following the breach directly contributing to this drop.Months later, the event would still have an impact on markets, with traders reporting the loss of liquidity in the ecosystem as a key contributor.However, bitcoin prices would recover in light of growing international economic instability, with prices reaching a 34-month high as the year came to a close.Even as bitcoin and blockchain cultures clashed in 2016, common problems did emerge, and none may have been more prevalent than privacy.The announcement of Zcash in October sought to change that.Using a cryptographic tool that does not requires the exchanging of information between the parties engaged in a transaction, the Zcash blockchain promised a level of anonymity that had not been seen before with distributed ledgers.To vet this claim, Zcash launched a beta in September to not only shake out any bugs that would impair its public launch, but also to test the anonymity of its system (the company spent $250,000 on an audit alone).The possibility of a hack-resilient, anonymous blockchain stirred up investor enthusiasm, with Zcash futures contracts spiking from $18 in September to $261 ahead of the blockchain’s launch.Months later, though, Zcash has largely failed to deliver on anything other than speculation.Despite briefly reaching outlandish price highs of millions of dollars per coin at launch, the price has dropped dramatically to less than $50.In what seems to be a possible worse-case scenario for bitcoin privacy advocates, the IRS dropped a bombshell in November when it requested the records of bitcoin users held by Coinbase in November.Referring to a group of \"John Does\", the government is now seeking information on a group of bitcoin users that allegedly avoided or failed to pay taxes on cryptocurrency transactions.Said the US government: \"The \u0027John Doe\u0027 summons relates to the investigation of an ascertainable group or class of persons, that is, United States taxpayers who, at any time during the years ended December 31, 2013, through December 31, 2015, conducted transactions in a convertible virtual currency as defined in IRS Notice 2014-21.\"This investigation indicates a new interest from regulators in policing cryptocurrency use and comes two years after the IRS declared cryptocurrency to be a taxable tradable commodity and not a virtual currency.Early signs are this won\u0027t be the last of the case, either.Besides the “John Does,” the IRS is seeking information on two cases concerning \"corporate entities with annual revenues of several million dollars.”Long the bulwark of blockchain projects, the first defection from banking consortium R3CEV sent shockwaves through the industry when Goldman Sachs opted not to renew its membership in November.Adding to the perceived impact was the fact that Goldman was one of the nine original founding members of the consortium, and the company declared at the time that it would continue to develop blockchain projects on its own.Revelations that Santander had also dropped out of the consortium and rumors of funding difficulties only added to the drama.Still, the importance of the event might have been oversold. The majority of member banks have reportedly agreed to participate in R3\u0027s funding round, which could become the largest in industry history.Further, in hindsight, difficulties among the more than 50 members was likely to be expected.\"Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time,\" said a R3CEV spokesperson to the Wall Street Journal in response to the departure.The event that perhaps best exemplifies bitcoin\u0027s struggles on the business side, Circle announced in December that it would no longer offer bitcoin exchange services.Further, it revealed its newest product, Spark, would be a smart contracts platform allowing users to use networks other than bitcoin to settle bitcoin transactions (this could include other blockchain networks or a traditional payment settlement network like ACH).Making the anouncement, Circle argued (and many agreed) that bitcoin technology was no longer central to its mission.“We have never been focused on convincing consumers to replace their familiar native currencies with bitcoin, but instead wanted to bring the benefits of public blockchains and digital assets to consumers without requiring them to know the technical details,” read the Circle blog post.Whether Circle\u0027s move comes in isolation or it\u0027s the harbinger of a trend for 2017, however, is still in question.Notably, Circle\u0027s announcement came just weeks before a strong uptick in the price of bitcoin that still continues, an event that did much to suggest interest in the digital asset remains alive and well.Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

They move in new directions, raise investment from unexpected sources and find new user bases. It\u0027s proof that this technology is truly a worldwide phenomenon, and those interested should watch all regions for inspiration.As 2016 comes to a close, I\u0027d like to highlight what I consider the year\u0027s three most significant blockchain-related events in the South Korean market – and make three more predictions for 2017.First, here\u0027s the good news from the last year:South Korea\u0027s Financial Services Committee (FSC) announced its two-step FinTech Development Roadmap in October 2016.The roadmap comprises two steps: eliminating irrational regulation and improving FinTech industry systems. Notably, the roadmap includes the creation of the Bank Joint Blockchain Consortium and the institutionalization of digital currencies such as bitcoin, as well as establishing a finance test bed for new FinTech services.With its roadmap, the government is trying to remove hurdles that may obstruct the \u0027Fourth Industrial Revolution\u0027 in South Korea, as well as nurture an environment for FinTech companies to develop their business more freely.The Bank of Korea conducted a joint research project specifically focusing on blockchain technology.This initiative looked at several aspects of blockchain technology, including current industry issues, technical and political challenges for blockchain adoption in the financial system.Blockchain applications in the Bank of Korea’s payment and settlement system were a major focus and, of course, blockchain-based digital currency was also explored.A number of financial institutions have realized blockchain technology\u0027s potential and have developed several use cases, as well as announcing a plan called the ‘Starting point of the Blockchain Movement’ within the last year.As examples of those projects, KB Kookmin Card and KB Savings Bank launched a private blockchain-based identity authentication platform, and KB Kookmin bank developed an overseas remittance platform.Further, the Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation (KOMSCO) has started working to develop a blockchain-based digital asset platform. Coinplug played a role in developing many of these use cases and platforms.Furthermore, Korea’s five largest banks – KEB Hana, Shinhan, Kookmin, Woori, IBK – also joined the R3 consortium, while three Korean institutions – Coinplug, Samsung SDS, and Korea Securities Depository – became members of the Hyperledger project.Such moves reflect just how seriously financial institutions in Korea are taking this new technology.And now, my predictions for 2017:The FSC roadmap focuses on deregulating the financial industry and supporting FinTech companies.Since the biggest hurdle for the FinTech industry is constrictive regulation, the roadmap\u0027s focus on deregulation should encourage financial institutions to adopt blockchain technology and develop even more use cases.In 2017, I predict that financial institutions will go beyond joining global consortia, and start to create their own combined blockchain inititives in Korea.A fundamental aspect of the FSC roadmap is the creation of the Bank Joint Blockchain Consortium, which is expected to be finalised by the end of this year and commence activities in January.Additionally, there have been discussions regarding another blockchain consortium for capital markets, with an effort to launch next year. The capital market consortium will seek to develop blockchain use cases such as authentication services, document storage, OTC market exchange platforms, and clearing and settlement systems.Each consortium will test blockchain in its own market, develop business use cases and, ultimately, produce a joint blockchain platform.Financial institutions in Korea regularly update their IT infrastructure, and 2017 happens to be a major update planning year for designing next-generation platforms.Many of these institutions are now considering blockchain as one of their options. Furthermore, financial institutions are anticipating the time when smart contracts are fully commercialized and combined with private blockchains. This technology has the potential to create an enormous synergy effect with almost limitless use cases.I believe 2017 will be the year Korea\u0027s financial institutions actively adopt private blockchains for their main services and systems, and investigate what else the tech can do.

He joined Markit in 2013 after three years at UBS, where he focused on managing operational risk in derivatives trading.In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review feature, Billingham recaps a year spent working on smart contract applications, detailing the successes and tribulations his team experienced in that time.Sure, many are tired of the hype and prolonged implementation timelines, but changing how the industry thinks about money and agreements deserves time to grow and develop. Thus, we’re long all things DLT in the year ahead. But first, a few thoughts on lessons learned in 2016.Without a doubt, smart contracts have dominated most DLT conversations in financial services.My firm’s public projects focused on building smart contract networks for OTC markets. Our goal was simple: identify asynchronous contract workflows and perform those workflows synchronously across a network of provisioned peers.In two proofs-of-concept (PoCs), we commoditized authentication, warehousing and basic event processing for credit default swaps and equity swaps. Our success was driven by close collaboration with industry participants.Admittedly, the path to completing the PoCs was not as succinct as those few sentences above.We started scoping our smart contract efforts in the summer of 2015, a time when the mantra was, “I blockchain, therefore I smart contract”.At that point, most enthusiasts were coming to terms with all the shortcomings of bitcoin-esque models (colored coins, “tokenization”, etc). Ethereum, still finding its way, was considered the progressive alternative and logical next step for industry-wide blockchain projects. Self-executing agreement terms seemed appealing (if a tad ominous sounding?) in that they captured the most basic desire in financial services: make banking operations as highly efficient as possible.Smart contract projects operated under the premise that counterparties simply needed to encode: a) the circumstances under which each party should be paid, b) the information that changes the payment amount, and c) the times at which these payments will be completed. Put it all on a blockchain and problem solved.This premise wasn’t entirely untrue, and the derivatives world seemed a perfect testing ground given the focus on better managing a), b) and c) via clearing and margining rules.But, as is always the case, the devil is in the details. Scoping these proofs-of-concept proved tedious. In hindsight, the scoping exercise alone was valuable because it brought multiple industry participants around one table to collectively realize that smart contracting is hard.We learned three important things:What we learned helps temper our itch to boil the ocean. Nevertheless, in the spirit of the holidays, the industry should be grateful for the progress it has made – let’s use these lessons to propel us forward.2017 will see peer-to-peer contract management systems in production. For use cases that were borne out of successful proofs-of-concept, development should move at a healthy clip. New use cases for different asset classes and more bespoke contracts will not be without their unique set of challenges.The ability for smart contract providers to distinguish the processing elements (ie: smart contract components) of a contract from the bargaining elements (ie: discretionary and human components) of a contract will determine the adoption curve in capital markets.Beyond smart contracts, we should expect to see renewed interest in the creation of digital assets. Every asset that is committed to paper can exist in a natively digital world. Legal and regulatory ramifications of such a development aside, digital assets can shift the conversation beyond cost savings and into new revenue opportunities and new markets.Last but certainly not least, we should all keep an eye on “public” blockchain networks.Bitcoin is still moving value across the world without a hiccup. While bitcoin, ethereum and new networks that develop in the years ahead may not be purpose-built for financial services, the assets and agreements they maintain are new markets and new business opportunities.Take advantage – the sky\u0027s the limit.Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

He oversees the development and delivery of potential products that use emerging technologies like blockchain, including the BlockOne ID authentication service.In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review feature, Collin advocates for collaboration among developers, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders in the blockchain space as the industry heads into 2017.Close collaboration continues to be the absolute necessity for blockchain success.The closer the collaboration between developers and commercial organizations, the better the results that emerge. And the closer everybody works with consumers, the more likely it is that the result will be something attractive to them.This technology is young: the tools to interact with it are designed largely for developers. Creating experiences for consumers is hard, and allowing consumers to interact with it directly can be even harder.An example: every action on public blockchains requires a transaction fee in a cryptocurrency. It is a small fee, but it is greater than zero. That was acceptable when blockchains were used solely for financial transactions, but today’s use cases have expanded to include complex transactions with smart contracts that may have nothing to do with money transfers.Solving this problem requires technical expertise from the developer community and a clear understanding of user experience which will attract consumers to use the blockchain.And there is a potential answer – more importantly, it has been shared. Deep in an ethereum GitHub repository lies a solution which could potentially allow service providers to pay for mining costs without affecting the integrity of the transaction.Consumers will no longer need cryptocurrency to participate, bringing us closer to a user experience which consumers will recognize.It is this focus on discussion and on sharing which is the key to the future success of this technology.Developers, of course, already know this. What is really exciting is that the companies that stand to gain the most from the application of this new technology now know it too. They are rethinking the way they work: rather than developing their services in closed, proprietary silos they too are throwing open their doors to developers and other innovators to build the future.Organizations are hosting conferences, round-tables, panel discussions and hackathons to make the necessary connections and to pool resources together. Companies are forging partnerships with developer communities.This is the unique genius of blockchain: it encourages collaboration. Companies as well as developers need to contribute their ideas and enabling technologies in order for them both to succeed.We saw the benefits of this approach for ourselves at Thomson Reuters earlier this year, when we hosted a hackathon with ethereum to test our enabling technology BlockOne ID, which we then put online in beta for further development. It is a service that helps developers to perform diligence on their users – another recognized challenge when consumers directly interact with blockchains – and the results of this approach have been encouraging.Developers have been very positive: they told us they appreciated a strong brand clearly working to enable them, to help them address a problem close to both of our hearts. They have risen to the challenge and engaged imaginatively with our shared purpose: to make the blockchain work for organizations and their customers.Solving these problems creates the opportunity to build familiar consumer experiences and bridge the old world of the Web with newer blockchain-enabled services. Look to see this materialize in 2017.So I would like to end 2016 and begin 2017 with a call to action.Developers and commercial organizations are working more closely together than ever before to realize the potential of blockchain technology.

Going forward, though, Liu hopes the shared ledger will be employed for business-to-business products, including cross-border transactions.Increasingly, Taiwan is part of an apparent global push to give financial technology innovators, including those building with blockchain, a safe way to experiment with less of the usual concerns over regulatory implications.Yesterday, Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission took steps toward molding eight existing laws into a body that is more conducive to creating new financial products, according to a local report.In particular, the so-called “regulatory sandbox” was renamed “Financial Innovation in Science and Technology” and a path forward was established to give authorities the ability to halt financial experiments deemed a danger to the “rights and interests” of financial consumers, according to the report.Liu said:In addition to plans to join the Taiwanese regulatory sandbox, Liu is part of an early stage effort by some members of the ethereum community to resolve a number of common issues being encountered with implementation.On Thursday, 15th December, Liu met in New York with a group of blockchain companies, also including Deloitte spin-off Nuco, to address the concerns.Though little is known about the details of the \"impromptu\" meeting, Liu said \"the most exciting thing to come out of it was a series of events over the next month or two months that will become successively more formal\".\"Given the multitude of ethereum-based offerings,\" he said, \"we’re looking forward to working with our peers in North America to converge on what would eventually be known as an ethereum enterprise-grade stack.\"With the prospect of increased cooperation between companies building enterprise-grade products on the ethereum blockchain, Liu indicated that Amis could one day expand beyond the borders of Taiwan.2016 has certainly been the year of the blockchain consortium, with large-scale operations like R3CEV and Hyperledger each making inroads in their common goal of creating distributed-ledger solutions for businesses.But, in the coming year, Liu believes his group of banks\u0027 strategy to start local with a single use case could one day pay off with a more global scope.Liu concluded:Taiwan image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Taiwan, Banking, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Dec 21, 2016 at 1:26 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/12/21/towards-a-clearer-understanding-of-blockchains-true-value/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/L6wJHnY6EDL1u7innP3taEkB3pY\u003d/570x379/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/ATIJ4N2ES5BETDCMD6L33M4APE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Towards a Clearer Understanding of Blockchain\u0027s True Value","INTRO":"NRI\u0027s Takeo Nishikata examines some of the discussion around blockchain, seeking to \"clarify all the misunderstandings\" around the technology.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Takeo Nishikata joined Nomura Research Institute (NRI) in 2008 and works on investigative research of advanced financial technology including blockchain and digital currency, as well as on development of innovative solutions. He is currently a technical lead for a proof of concept being developed with Japanese financial institutions.In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review feature, Nishikata takes an expansive look at some of the discussion around blockchain, seeking to navigate and \"clarify all the misunderstandings\" around the tech at the close of the year.According to a recent report from Gartner, blockchain is currently at the peak of a hype cycle.At NRI, we have witnessed how this technology is misunderstood, and how it is at times either overestimated or underestimated. We have seen this during our continued investigative research on blockchain technology in the Japanese domestic securities field since the end of 2015.It’s about time to clarify all the misunderstandings around blockchain and its future.I would like to suggest how such misunderstandings can be effectively addressed, based on my extensive experience as a researcher at a financial IT service provider, and hope we can do away with any confusion and move on to produce true innovation in 2017 and onwards.The first set of misunderstandings concerns the characteristics and value of blockchain.One of many is that, if blockchain is applied to business systems, it will – compared with existing technology – have greater resistance to tampering, offer higher availability and enable the same data and processes to be shared.Contrary to general understanding, these are things which can already be achieved with existing technology, and are not uniquely achievable with blockchain.Another common misunderstanding is that \u0027blockchain has problems with scalability and finality, and these can be solved through centralization\u0027.Trying to obtain scalability and finality through centralization weakens the unique characteristics of blockchain and makes it harder to distinguish from existing technologies. It is necessary to find an optimal balance and design, while making use of the unique value of blockchain without losing its benefits.That the technology should be used either with a single participant or with a specified small number is another misunderstanding.The value of blockchain increases through the network effect, and so it is my view that one should aim to expand the structure of decentralized rights as a whole – even if part of that structured is centralized – by ensuring the expansion and diversification of participants or compatibility with other blockchains.This is just like how the Internet creates value by being formed from multiple Local Area Networks (LANs).The unique characteristic of blockchain is that it grants decentralized rights – or to put it more accurately, it has “opened up possibilities” by enabling the creation of records of value or exchanges of value between counterparties who cannot be trusted without the existence of a single third party.While information systems are based on trade-offs between various system characteristics, blockchain is a system which chooses the creation of decentralized rights at the expense of scalability and finality.The true value created by decentralized rights is that, in the same way as the Internet, the free participation of many different parties creates a network effect as the number of participants increases. This leads to the formation of a resilient system as a whole, and also increases the benefit obtained by its participants through the value created by the participants.Two misconceptions about the maturity level of blockchain technology exist – one that overestimates it, and one which underestimates it.The DAO may be an example of the overestimation of the maturity level of blockchain. The DAO was an extremely pioneering and novel initiative as an investment fund without managers leveraging the characteristic of blockchain.Despite its progressive approach, the DAO was recognized by many as taking too much risk in regards to the maturity of the current infrastructure.On the other hand, there is also a trend towards underestimating the level of maturity of blockchain technology. In particular, it feels that since it occurred, the DAO \u0027incident\u0027 has often been used as a case study for the immaturity of the community and technology, yet many fail to perform a proper review of the cause of the incident or its countermeasures.While there are big differences in blockchain technology according to the software used, it can generally be thought of as currently an immature technology from the following points of view:1. There has not been sufficient discussion of infrastructure requirements according to the relevant application. For example, the infrastructure requirements for supporting bitcoin are likely different from those for supporting securities settlement systems. Issues and constraints can only be isolated once the relevant requirements are first clarified. Currently, such issues and constraints are being debated and the use of technology is being considered without having any clear requirements in place. For example, while issues such as scalability and finality are, as mentioned before, system characteristics which are sacrificed, the question of whether or not this is regarded as an issue or constraint will surely depend on the relevant requirements. Going forward, it is likely that there is a need for further discussion between the business side and the technical side. 2. Issues caused by the difference from existing systems are not clear. Because blockchain is a system with different characteristics from existing systems, it is necessary to repeatedly perform investigative research and validations in a step-by-step process – such as on function layer units including applications and networks, phase units from design through to operation, and underlying technology units – while bringing together specialisms from a diverse range of fields such as cryptography, security, networks, distributed systems, game theory, and trust. 3. There is a lack of quality assurance. Undefined requirements and issues mean quality assurance is insufficient. It is necessary to ensure quality after first clarifying these points. The current situation where both overestimation and underestimation of the maturity level exist could damage the health of the ecosystem and possibly obstruct future innovation. What is needed going forward is a shared understanding concerning the level of maturity by firming up infrastructure requirement. Also needed is the visualization of both the newly assumed issues and risks, as well as the quality standards and level of completion for those requirements.Also, for blockchain to spread as a form of financial infrastructure – which demands a high level of reliability, availability and maintainability – each of these factors must be carefully progressed to a high level.Quality assurance for financial infrastructure is not something which can be done overnight, but rather requires one to craft quality with care and construct assurance processes, make continual improvements and build up one’s experience.Lastly, there are misunderstandings concerning the kind of future which blockchain technology will bring.For me, the ultimate scenario would be the realization of an \u0027Internet of Value\u0027, in which anyone can trade all kinds of assets through the Internet without depending on third parties.Once this Internet of Value is realized, the world will be filled with borderless transactions (for example, online concert tickets issued by an artist in one country that can be freely traded all over the world), and with transactions between all kinds of assets, such as exchanges of financial instruments for loyalty points.The opposite end-game to this is a world flooded with siloed systems that have no superiority to existing ones.We are currently at an important crossroads, where we are able to decide which of these scenarios we will head towards. I believe our future depends on the question of whether or not an open standard beyond national and organizational borders can be created under the appropriate governance. This open standard needs to be simple and have a high level of usability.From a technical point of view, it’s a question of whether or not a protocol like TCP/IP can be created for blockchain. While at the present point in time it is not certain whether or not a single standard specification can be created, interoperability as discussed by ISO (International Organization for Standardization) will likely be a key driver to achieve a standard specification.From a legal point of view, and to give an example for securities settlements, it is a question of whether guidance on requirements for distributed ledgers based on PFMIs (the CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures) can be presented, as discussed by the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority).There are points of contention which are unique to distributed ledgers, such as the finality of settlements on distributed ledger and arbitration where unlawful transactions occur.Unfortunately, the current discussions appear to be stuck with more petty debates of short-term and local reductions to the cost of business systems or with fantastical scenarios where all the central institutions of the world will be disrupted by the technology. These discussions would not lead to an accurate view of the future.What many corporations need to be thinking about now is what role they will play and what kind of added value they will provide in a future in which this Internet of Value might be realized. If finance were to be opened up to individuals, it may become necessary for financial institutions to shift to providing new offerings such as advisory services with greater added value or higher credibility via a track record of performance.It is not easy to paint a picture of the future. In the early days of the Internet, who would have imagined the appearance of the cloud and social networking services we have today?Furthermore, we live in the world in which new technology develops with astonishing speed, and so one must consider the impact of the combination of new technologies which might affect the future of blockchain. Just as it was for the Internet, I expect that the situation will become gradually clearer going forwards.NRI would like to paint a picture of this future together with our clients and partners, and walk forward towards its realization.NRI has a number of functions. It acts as a think tank, which depicts and conveys a vision of the future of society based on its corporate philosophy of “Dream up the future\".We also act as a financial IT services provider as well as an advanced information security solutions provider. We believe that, through unifying these functions, we can contribute to the future of blockchain as a new financial infrastructure.Until now, we have steadily advanced our understanding and evaluation of technologies, through joint research with financial institutions, collaborations with startup companies, and cooperation with academic institutions.Going forward, we both wish to continue these activities, as well as convey and co-create a vision of the future which blockchain will bring, and to proactively contribute to the cultivation of technologies and ecosystems which make use of our insight and experience.Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

By contrast, this was mostly a forbidden topic a couple of years ago.Well, if 2015 was a year of discovery for banks, 2016 has been a year of experimentation, where we have seen proofs-of-concept all over the place for many kinds of use case – be it payments, trade finance or capital markets. This broad testing has taken place within smaller banking groups, bilaterally or multilaterally within a number of industry consortia.As such, it looks like blockchain is not a technology looking for a problem anymore, as there seems to be a decent number of applications where it can really make a difference, as the experiments conducted have shown.Following this logic, the challenge for 2017 will be to make all this real.What does this mean? To start, it involves crossing the chasm from PoC to pilot, to then committing meaningful resources to take it to production. And in order to succeed at this, it is key to recognize and address the challenges derived from the need to integrate blockchain platforms with existing banking systems, which are often overlooked as we all get carried away by the excitement produced by the amazing possibilities that this technology brings to us.In essence, the key use of blockchains, distributed ledgers and smart contracts in enterprise settings – and within banks in particular – is based on the idea of using cryptographic objects (cryptocurrencies, IoUs or data structures in smart contracts) not as stores of value per se, but as representations of “real” value assets which are kept under custody within a trusted entity, eg: a bank.I realize this may not be the end-game scenario here, since at some point all value assets could be natively issued on distributed ledgers – but hey, we need to start somewhere and move on in an incremental fashion, since money and property are rather serious things and mistakes can have very severe consequences.This construct is rather interesting for banks in particular, as it effectively opens a new innovation paradigm.Indeed, banks’ core banking systems are not well thought out for innovation, and this is more of a requirement than an outcome. Banking is a heavily regulated activity, and the fact that banks are the ultimate source of trust (as they keep our account balances current and safe) forces them to safeguard their ledgers very jealously, so it becomes really difficult to compromise them.The result is a situation in which banking systems are buried in firewalls, with amazingly cumbersome operational procedures required to make any changes, and with ledger technologies designed for security and scalability at the expense of development agility and innovation.And, you know what, I am happy they are this way, since it is our money that we are talking about here. But the beauty of distributed ledgers is that, suddenly, they give us a way to transact safely outside of these (very expensive) super-secure but cumbersome core banking systems, and this is not only because of the use of cryptography, but because of their distributed nature.If only we could make a good connection between bank ledgers and the blockchain distributed ledger, we could then step up our innovation efforts on top of the latter, instead of stubbornly trying to do it on top of our existing core banking systems, which as I have argued are not fit for this purpose.The key benefit is that, in the cryptographic world, we can innovate in an allegedly more agile fashion, using modern programming technology, and elegantly and safely describing business logic through the use of simple smart contracts, often with just hundreds lines of code.And this is orders of magnitude cheaper, faster to develop, and much more universally accessible when it comes to collaborative efforts between all kinds of actors.And so, we argue on the capital importance of what I will call the “tokenization” of assets, which is the process by which an asset (eg: some amount of money) is locked under custody within a bank’s system and, as atomically as possible, gets represented in the cryptographic world, be it through a cryptographic token (an \"IoU\" in the Ripple terminology) or as a data structure in a smart contract.Conversely, the reverse process can take place by which the user redeems this “token” to recover the value which is sitting within the bank in an omnibus account or custody deposit of some sort.These two processes do require an integration effort with the bank’s core banking system, and it is crucial to show that this effort is not insurmountable – at least not in the same order of magnitude of the one required to develop new things on top of the existing core technology.Otherwise, it would just defeat the purpose of all this in the first place.Early indications show that these integrations should be easy to implement, as they only need a few API calls to: 1) detect the tokenization requests coming from the bank systems (eg: a transfer into an omnibus account), and 2) initiate a transfer to the beneficiary when the redemption process is triggered from the distributed ledger.Of course, the difficulty varies depending on the degree of availability of bank APIs, but at least, in our experience, these integration processes can be achieved in as little as a few weeks.Conversely, blockchain technologies need to be better fit for this purpose as well, which I believe will also be a major topic next year.Besides the obvious topics of privacy, scalability and performance (including transaction speed and latency) – which are being enthusiastically addressed both by the ethereum communit, the Hyperledger framework and Ripple’s Interledger Protocol methodology – there is a particularly important topic about stability and immutability of the distributed ledger.In the tokenization construct, a synchronization problem in the ledger becomes a true catastrophe, and it is crucial to ensure that forks do not exist or are kept very much under control – indeed, rewriting the recent history of the ledger can produce inconsistencies with the banking ledgers, which could be severe and would be extremely difficult to reconcile.Going forward, and in order to start “making blockchain real” in the coming year, financial players will do well in collaborating with specialized blockchain startups to jointly solve these issues.Specifically, work should be done on the issues related to the integrations with the banking system which will require extensive experience in both worlds – blockchain and core banking technology – with the ultimate goal of getting the tech ready to be used in enterprise settings to serve customers at scale.Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

Christopher Giancarlo, commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), gave numerous speeches focusing on blockchain technology; and even the Department of Health and Human Services sought white papers exploring how blockchain technology could be leveraged for healthcare purposes.In Europe, the Bank of England launched a FinTech accelerator to, among other things, explore how blockchain could be utilized in central banking, and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) disclosed that it was working on issues relating to blockchain.In addition, in May, the UK launched a “regulatory sandbox” whereby a FinTech company could roll out a new business, with regulatory oversight but with relaxed restrictions, to a limited number of customers on a test basis.Other regulators, including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, have followed that lead and developed sandboxes of their own.There was even action among elected lawmakers and in private-public sector partnerships. A bill was proposed in the US House of Representatives that would require certain regulatory agencies to provide a similar sandbox. But, to date, no official measure has been passed.Further, Estonia has developed an e-residency program based on blockchain technology. Georgia, Ghana and Sweden began work on projects to implement blockchain land title registries, and Singapore developed a system to eliminate invoice fraud through the use of blockchain.Nonetheless, so far, regulators have taken a decidedly laissez-faire approach to the space. For a number of interrelated reasons, that is likely to change in 2017.Some regulators have already intimated that they will be more active in respect of distributed ledger technology.In the US, the Federal Reserve recently released a research paper focusing on distributed ledger technology in which it stated, among other things, that analysis needs to be done to determine whether new laws and regulations are required to accommodate the technology.In addition, in early December, the US Treasury Department\u0027s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced that it would offer national charters for FinTech firms, opening up its proposal to public comment.Elsewhere, South Korea’s Financial Services Commission and Switzerland’s Federal Department of Finance (FDF) have explicitly stated that they will introduce new regulation in 2017.To be clear, regulation is not necessarily a bad thing for an industry – operating within so-called regulatory “safe harbors”, or within a licensing framework, provides companies with a certain level of comfort.And some regulations are enabling. The FDF has made it clear that it will be attempting to reduce the barriers to entry for FinTech startups and to provide clarity as to the treatment of digital assets.These will clearly be positive developments, at least for the Swiss.We are nearing the point at which the real-world application of blockchain is not limited to digital currencies.As the technology moves from proof-of-concept to production of practical applications, blockchain will begin to impact more industries and affect more people. This means that more businesses – and more people – will have something (whether it be money, privacy, data or something other) to lose if and when things go awry.Regulators do not like things to go wrong. In particular, they do not like things to go wrong in developing areas that, while unregulated at the time, are viewed by them as within the purview of their regulatory mandate.Many regulators have the express purpose of providing transparency into the markets that they oversee. So, when things go wrong in an unregulated area that a regulator views as being opaque (such as digital currency markets), that regulator is likely to become engaged.If 2017 is the year where real-world distributed ledger technology applications become prevalent, we can expect the regulators to begin promulgating applicable rules and regulations.On a related note, people across the globe and in varying industries are becoming more aware of the technology (even if not its underpinnings or the enormity of its promise).This is not to suggest that blockchain technology will sink beneath its own weight, but rather that mass awareness is likely to bring with it more concerns about the security and privacy of applications running on a blockchain.Regulators are unlikely to sit idly if such concerns are borne out in any real-world scenario.Another potential rationale for more regulatory engagement in 2017 is unique to the US, where the election of Donald Trump as the next president means that there will be some turnover in the leadership of various regulatory agencies.For example, Mary Jo White, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has announced that she will step down in January of 2017. Timothy Massad, the chairman of the CFTC, is also expected to vacate his position around the same time.The top positions at other agencies, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, are also expected to turn over in 2017.In light of Trump’s campaign platform and rhetoric, it seems likely that the new regime of regulators will be more friendly to “Wall Street” – and traditional financial institutions – than is the current regime, and it is at least feasible that this will result in a less “do no harm” regulatory model in the blockchain space.Similarly, it is possible that the new chiefs will want to make their mark in a visible way – the blockchain space is for the most part a clean slate on which a regulator may write his or her regulatory raison d’être.Finally, if the oft-recited decline of blockchain into what Gartner refers to as “trough of disillusionment” materializes in 2017, it is likely to be driven (or at least accompanied) by the failure by many startups in the space to deliver on the lofty promises they made in earlier years.The failure of those startups may exacerbate the impact of certain points mentioned earlier in this article. For example, a regulator that is more friendly to the traditional financial institutions could seize on such failures as a rationale to make it more difficult for distributed ledger technology to be utilized in the banking industry.In conclusion, for a variety of reasons – from the election of Donald Trump to the establishment of in-production applications of blockchain – expect the regulators to be engaged in 2017.To clarify once more, engagement by the regulators is not necessarily a bad thing, and may not result in a bunch of restrictive regulations.Regulators have been engaging with the industry to develop a better understanding of distributed ledger technology, its promise and limitations, and the ways in which it fits – or does not fit – within existing legal and regulatory frameworks.In many circumstances – such as with the licensing proposal issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency – new regulation will benefit businesses by providing some level of regulatory certainty, eliminating overlapping clarity and reducing the cost and complexity of doing business.Much regulatory engagement in 2017 is likely be in the form of “guiding principles”, clarifications and other pronouncements as to how certain use cases fit within existing regulatory frameworks.In certain industries, such as the financial services industry, distributed ledger technology is essentially dead on arrival without the involvement of the regulators in its development, adaptation and rollout.However, blockchain companies in most industries will benefit from the certainty that will be afforded when regulation arrives.Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

The below is not meant to be construed as legal or financial advice.ICOs, or initial coin offerings, have garnered substantial attention in the past few months and unsurprisingly the majority of the analysis to date has centered on the debate over whether a particular coin or token should be considered a security, and the technical considerations for setting up such an investment vehicle.In the midst of this, notably absent are the regulatory bodies to provide appropriate guidance in demystifying the treatment of ICOs and carrying out their role as stewards of the public interest.Here\u0027s the simple explanation as to why this topic should be at the forefront of regulatory discussions: ICOs allow anyone in the world with a computer and an Internet connection to invest in projects, initiatives or ventures anywhere in the world by means of digital token purchases.This is fundamentally disruptive and a tremendous feat to bring much needed innovation to the world of traditional investment vehicles; the closest analogy to existing financial mechanisms would be a blend between an IPO and an equity crowd-funding raise.The ICO process brings up more questions that are not being adequately covered:These are all questions the regulators should be asking, although there are no clear answers since it’s neither an IPO nor an equity crowd-funding raise, and it may or may not be a security.In fact, there may not even be an active role for the regulator to play in a world where the ICO phenomenon is occurring in a completely decentralized fashion outside of the traditional jurisdictional boundaries and prior financial infrastructures.What is clear is that ICOs introduce complexities for three distinct groups of stakeholders:IssuersAs an issuer, the onus is there to be proactive in understanding the few rules that do exist and self-comply with emerging best practices.From a technology perspective, open-source guidance such as ERC 20 provide the basis for standardizing key token functions; these guidelines are focused more on aligning on interfaces and software security, not necessarily with end-investor protection in mind.In the absence of regulator input, industry players Coinbase and others have taken the initiative to create a legal framework to catalogue the main considerations that issuers should be aware of to help them determine if their token is likely to be treated as a security.The goal behind the framework was to create a decision matrix to help developers incorporate design decisions that are less likely to land them in legal trouble down the line.InvestorsAs an investor, caveat emptor is still in effect – significant research and taking on the risk of failure are still required.The role that VCs typically play in vetting and reviewing startups or projects is now in the hands of the retail investor. And unlike traditional investments available to consumers, there are no existing safeguards.For the time being, the old words of wisdom still apply: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is; if you can’t afford to lose all of that money tomorrow, don’t invest.RegulatorsRegulators certainly have their work cut out for them. What’s perhaps most unsettling from their perspective is that with or without their active involvement, ICOs have proven a new model that will continue to evolve and perhaps outside of the regulatory reach to a certain extent.Yet the implications for consumer protection, and the broader market stability implications are too significant to ignore; another DAO-style raise of $160 million and subsequent hack could shake the trust in the blockchain ecosystem, hindering future investments while also having a devastating effect on consumers.The precarious legal position of the issuers and the potential exposure to risk of the retail investor is precisely the reason that this needs to be a priority on the regulatory agenda.To their credit, regulators worldwide are taking steps in the right direction. The UK, Singapore, and Hong Kong have all moved to set up sandboxed environments for blockchain-based companies to experiment.The state of Delaware and the state of Illinois have both been pro-active in declaring their jurisdictions as forward-looking to promote blockchain adoption, having taken a close look at the lessons learned from the New York State Department of Financial Services BitLicense regulatory framework from 2015.Despite these positive developments, very little is publicly available as it pertains to the view of the regulators on the ICO subject specifically. I suspect that’s in part due to the overwhelming challenge of staying on top of the rapid pace of change in the blockchain space.For the regulators tasked with overseeing a diverse number of portfolios or potential issues at a 30,000-foot view, it’s possible that the ICO wave has yet to hit their radar.As much as the blockchain community can be portrayed as relying solely on the decentralized nature of the technology and proclaiming that the future lies in self-governing smart contract code, the reality is that code is not yet considered to be law, VCs are waiting for this technology to leave the grey zone of ambiguity, and consumers may in fact need and want additional protection.In an ideal world, all would end well if:Unfortunately, the reality is that this is unchartered territory. And if we use the example of the DAO, there are over 20,000 investors, at least a fraction of whom would have arguably been unfamiliar with the nuances of wallets, key management best practices, how to convert out of the DAO holdings, and so on.In fact, the only way that an investor would become aware that anything was wrong with The DAO was through the media coverage. For the blockchain community, which has already gotten into the daily habit of catching up on all crypto-news from a few sources, this may appear to be a non-issue.Yet traditional investors have grown to rely on the intermediaries that manage their portfolios for them, making changes in holdings as new information becomes available, and sending alerts as appropriate – all under the auspice of a watchful regulator making sure that the rights of the investors are held up as being of paramount importance.The risks of blockchain investments are magnified for newcomers to the blockchain space who have a hard time deciphering important nuances that should in fact drive their decisions.As it relates to this specific topic, there are a few suggested courses of action:As an example, a few weeks ago, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) ran the first ever hackathon by a Canadian regulator.The problem statement was simple:And the OSC encouraged the use of blockchain technology to address some of these issues, going as far as to include a blockchain SME, Ethan Wilding, on the judging panel.The results must have been surprising to the organizers, given that more than half of the teams ultimately pitched blockchain-affiliated solutions and two of the teams introduced the ICO concept. The first team suggested that the role of the OSC could evolve to provide technology reviews and automated testing of ICO code, potentially taking on some of the responsibilities that a VC would typically perform as part of a technical due diligence.The team I was on built a prototype for a voluntary registration program for ICO issuers, a smart contract template for issuers to implement a hypothetical OSC-standard ICO, leading to an OSC-branded investor portal to help consumers compare multiple ICOs and select from a list curated by a neutral party that has no vested financial interest in promoting a specific investment.In both of the previous scenarios, the traditional role of a regulator such as the OSC would evolve to undertake functions not typically in their purview.Also likely is that regulators will be required to create new standards and issue new guidance, ideally preceded with close collaboration with the ecosystem players who would be impacted. Even if this topic is on their radar, the software at hand is very low-level and it’s not obvious how a non-specialist would figure out what’s going on in isolation.This brings us to the second point of what the regulators could be doing...I think the regulators will be pleasantly surprised to find that embedded in the ethos of the blockchain community is the desire to self-regulate and achieve consensus in community-driven ways.That has given rise to the efforts already underway to create technology standards and best practices that many ICO issuers are keen to abide by, and the guidance issued by prominent investors in this space outlining key things to consider in evaluating ICOs.Yet industry observer William Mougayar made the sensible comment:When it comes to ICOs, it will take time to see how these various initiatives will go, and we can only hope to avoid another DAO-scale breakdown. But, in the meanwhile, I think that regulators would be well advised to take steps to investigate ways to improve the protection of the investing public.In anticipation of the counter argument that the rights and obligations of the investors or shareholders are included in the underlying code of the project and therefore regulator involvement is not needed, my take is that it’s only consolation if the investors at hand are both:That’s a high bar to set, given that with any new technology there will be asymmetric knowledge and varying levels of understanding, and, in the blockchain world specifically, there is a disconnect between the “business level” explanations behind how something works and the ability to appreciate the complex technical workings under the hood at the developer level.Until such time that issuers and curators of ICO projects and investors have applied tried and true information sharing, risk management and governance models that evolve to capture all sorts of edge-cases, there will continue to be a knowledge gap.And that’s where regulators typically step in – to protect consumers and provide operational certainty to the ecosystem of participants to facilitate efficient markets.Yet the fact that ICOs do not neatly fall into any of the traditional categories of investments, will make the process of expanding the regulatory parameter to include ICOs and token trading, and applying measured regulation inherently difficult.On the bright side, this provides an opportunity for the blockchain community to come together with the regulatory world and flex some critical thinking muscles, keeping in mind that we’re at a crossroads and should look at this as a chance to think about the “spirit” of the law, when the letter of the law is not applicable.And the first step to accomplishing that must be the acknowledgement that technology cannot and should not exist in a vacuum.Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

Thinkers 50 ranks him as the No. 4 most important living business thinker.Alex Tapscott is founder and CEO of Northwest Passage Ventures, an advisory firm in Toronto helping fund and accelerate new companies in the blockchain space. They are the authors of \"Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business and the World\" (Portfolio, 2016).In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Don and Alex chart a broad overview of blockchain in 2016, with an eye to what is to come in the year ahead. Notably, they argue that 2016 was the most important year for the tech since the debut of Satoshi Nakamoto\u0027s bitcoin white paper.2016 was a critical year, the most important since Satoshi Nakamoto published “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” in 2008.When we wrote \"Blockchain Revolution\", many were speculating on what this technology could achieve. We did our best to capture those possibilities – for the economy, government, and society –and have been surprised by the breadth of innovation underway.For example, central banks have emerged as powerful forces in the future of cryptocurrencies and are gaining momentum. The Bank of England and others are already exploring blockchain-enabled fiat currencies to reduce friction, cost, and risk, increase transparency and accountability, and improve oversight of the financial system.Healthcare has emerged, in earnest, as one of the most exciting areas. Companies are working to unclog bottlenecks in the system, from clinical trial data to personal health records.2016 was the year that many bank CEOs woke up to both the threat and the opportunity of the blockchain. At a meeting of 50 CEOs of the 50 largest banks back in January, most were skeptical. Now most are investigating how this technology might transform their companies and industry services.We wrote about the blockchain as the big enabler for reimagining every aspect of the industry – from payments to investment banking, insurance and accounting. Some observers have been surprised to see banks opening to blockchain when they’ve not typically been hotbeds of technology innovation.What’s driving this growing interest is the blockchain’s once-in-a-generation potential for fixing problems, improving efficiencies and reducing risk – and disintermediating incumbents in the process.The departure of several large financial institutions from the R3 blockchain consortium is not surprising. We would expect such a large group of institutions to face some collaborative challenges: many of them are competitors, each at different levels of development in different areas of the business.Consortia will be critical to reinventing financial services and other industries. To effect change, they need well defined goals with tangible objectives. If anything, the shake-up is a sign of a maturing industry.When it comes to blockchain investment, the money keeps flowing! 2016 was a major year for investment, with $387m being directed into blockchain startups.But the nature of these investments has shifted. From 2012 to 2014, primarily venture capitalists were funding business-to-consumer bitcoin-enabled solutions for common banking problems such as cross-border money transfer or retail payments. In 2015 and 2016, we saw money flowing into private blockchain opportunities addressing corporate issues, from asset tracking, to wholesale banking, insurance, accounting, risk management and more.That investment will continue in 2017, but the pendulum will swing back somewhat to the public blockchain space. If the bitcoin community can get its act together and solve some basic governance issues, investors will again see it as an attractive play – and with good reason. Bitcoin is still the biggest, most secure, most liquid blockchain to date. Ethereum has similar governance issues, which limit its credibility for big corporate investors, but we think ethereum will get through those too.Prosperity – rather, the lack thereof – was behind the anger that led to the \u0027Brexit\u0027 vote, the Trump election, and extreme populism in countries almost everywhere. The paradox is that there is wealth creation but declining prosperity, the gutting of the middle class and, in the USA, the end of the American dream.Presidential runner up Hillary Clinton proposed to tax the rich, a plan to redistribute wealth. US President-elect Trump proposed to cut social services, lower taxes for business, restrict trade and resurrect industries like coal mining from the first industrial revolution – a plan to restore prosperity to those who had it in the early 1800s.In 2015 and 2016, we saw how such blockchain startups like Abra and the not-for-profit Stellar created mobile applications that ended the remittance rip-off, enabled entrepreneurs to pool their resources, and onboarded the unbanked to the global financial system.Inspired by these social entrepreneurs, we had an idea for a third plan, one that pre-distributed wealth, where the billions of people who currently operate outside the formal economy would own their own data and could begin monetizing it at birth.In 2017, we expect to see not only applications for establishing individual identity and protecting property rights through immutable records, but platforms for creating a true sharing economy and a government by the people for the people – all on blockchain technology.To be sure, blockchain innovators face barriers: legacy culture, bureaucracy, regulations and more than a few entrenched and deep-pocketed incumbents unable or unwilling to change. These barriers will slow progress down, but only to a degree. Satoshi has unleashed the genie from the bottle, and no one can stuff her back in.As noted, there are many impediments to the blockchain and cryptocurrency revolution. None is more important than the immaturity of the ecosystem.Blockchain technology has emerged globally as the second generation of the Internet. However, its nascent ecosystem lacks the frameworks, language, and processes required for effective stewardship of this critical resource. For example, the bitcoin community has been unable to increase block size, and the ethereum community debated for a long while how to handle the impending removal of tens of millions of dollars from the ethereum distributed autonomous organization (The DAO).This lack of governance is in stark contrast to the first era, the Internet of Information, which had – and still has – a vast multi-stakeholder network of networks to govern the resource. This bottom-up leadership ensures that states, corporations and state-based institutions like the United Nations cannot control this new global resource.Instead, the Internet is a self-organizing set of communities.Several years ago, we studied the Internet governance network and identified 10 types of networks that keep it working. One of the most extraordinary outcomes of the digital revolution, the rise of the global civil society, and the emergence of business as a pillar of society, is that multi-stakeholder networks can help solve global problems and even govern global resources.We launched the Global Solution Networks (GSNs) Program five years ago to explore this gap in knowledge and to study the definition, differentiation, and impact of these emerging multi-stakeholder networks for solving global problems. These non-government, Internet-enabled collaborations of companies, states, non-government organizations and social stakeholders are using the Web for good, and demonstrating the power of networks to solve problems too intractable for traditional institutions.GSNs are global experts and network leaders who developed a taxonomy of 10 essential network types and studied the technologies, stakeholders, and governance of hundreds of these networks and the orchestrators driving them. The program documented new models of governance and problem solving that were impacting global challenges including climate change, pandemics, depleted natural resources, violence, and income inequality – problems that transcend national boundaries. We conducted 40 projects overall.Ten Types of Global Solution Networks We need an ecosystem like this to steward the blockchain as a resource. Although blockchain technology emerged from the open source community, it quickly attracted many stakeholders, each with different backgrounds, interests and motives. Developers, industry players, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, governments, NGOs and other civil societies have their own perspectives, and each has a role to play. There are early signs that many of the core stakeholders see the need for leadership and are taking steps to address it.Until now, industry players have focused largely on building their own companies. Context has become critical.Many factors can slow, impede and derail this revolution: governments can mess it up; we may fail to come up with sensible standards; we may fail to do the research needed to ensure deep penetration of this technology into various industries; repressive regimes may ban the technology altogether.In 2017, we need to get our act together. Decentralization is critical to this technology and to the future of civilization. But decentralization does not mean disorganization. So we resolve to focus on governance in the new year. We achieved this for the Internet’s first era. Now is the time to steward the second era effectively. Nothing so powerful as an idea whose time has come (again)!Notwithstanding our admonitions in \"Blockchain Revolution\" that “the future is not something to be predicted but something to be achieved,” here is what we think will happen in blockchain in 2017:We\u0027ll close with our resolutions:In January, we are launching what we hope will be the definitive research study on the impact of blockchain on business. We are staffing up our team with the world’s leading thinkers and tackling seven verticals: financial services, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, telecommunications and media, technology, and government. We are also looking horizontally at the functions of the enterprise, from supply chain management and human resources, to marketing and information technology. Look for more announcements soon.Also in January, Alex’s company, Northwest Passage Ventures, is launching its first blockchain fund.We both continue to do our part to move this ecosystem forward.In 2016, we launched the Muskoka Group with the mission of promoting ecosystem health and empowering the nascent governance ecosystem.We are currently conducting a project to outline some sensible steps forward. We are inventorying the players, categorizing them according to the GSN Hub (see graphic), and identifying deficiencies in the ecosystem.In March, we will be releasing our findings and making recommendations to all stakeholders about how to overcome these deficiencies and build an effective ecosystem. Also in March, we will launch an online Blockchain Ecosystem Hub sponsored by some of the most important international organizations. The hub will provide important governance know-how for the Internet’s second era.In addition, Alex will continue to contribute as a member of the World Economic Forum’s Global Future Council on Blockchain.And of course, we will both be on the road in 2017 launching into new exciting markets such as Korea, Thailand, Japan and several new European and Latin American countries.Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

Part therapy, part philosophy, it is a psychological state of mind that carries with it several benefits. For one, the more you know about yourself, the better you are at adapting to changes.The blockchain is no different. Left to its own devices, the blockchain space has plenty of reality distortions.To kick-off this year-end series, I\u0027m going to try and provide a balanced reality check about where we are in the blockchain’s evolution, as I ask a simple, yet inquisitive question:As we enter 2017, do we know what we don’t know about the blockchain?No predictions. Just reflections.To answer the above question, I will highlight a few areas while categorizing topics along two dimensions: the strategic and the tactical.Pick your flavor of cycle theories- Gartner’s hype cycle, Carlota Perez’s theory of economic development, or Geoffrey Moore’s crossing the chasm. There is no disputing we are in the formative years of any one of these cycles, but where exactly?When will blockchain adoption take off in terms of users, applications variety, steadiness and predictability of growth patterns? From my vantage point, we haven’t crossed the chasm, nor are we in the wide installation phase of the technology, and we aren’t even past the peak of inflated expectations.To be more accurate, where we are exactly will be visible only in the rear-view mirror, when we’ll be able to look back. In the meantime, we’ll need to keep plowing, knocking every obstacle, and picking ourselves up at every seemingly failing moment.If the Internet is a precursor of blockchain history, the year 2000 crash was a momentous event because it flushed out what was hyped, reset expectations, and allowed cool heads to prevail during a new and renewed phase that ensued.That new phase was dubbed Web 2.0 and appeared around 2003, ushering an ever-lasting phase of Web prosperity and growth thereafter. In retrospect, that was about seven years into the Web’s 1993 real appearance.With the blockchain, some have already started using the label Crypto 2.0, but that might be a premature moniker for where we are in the blockchain’s life.I firmly believe we are still exploiting a Blockchain 1.0 era of sorts, despite the nuances of its own evolution. Perhaps only a real crash would shake things up enough and substantiate a real entry into the new phase of Blockchain 2.0.Do we know where the blockchain will apply and where it won\u0027t? What will work and what will never work? We really don’t know, but we need to keep pushing the envelope and going off the edges in order to realize where the limits are.I am seeing many cases where the blockchain is being thought of, but it looks like a solution waiting for a problem that is not there.For example, the healthcare field as a whole has been touted as a perfect sector for the blockchain, but we have not seen real progress or practical blockchain implementations.Specifically, I often hear that the blockchain is going to solve the synchronization issues in the patient medical record, yet there is little realization that solving the medical record puzzle has other non-blockchain related issues that must be addressed first.Distributed Autonomous Organizations (DAO’s) put into question our traditional thinking about managing organizations, but we still don’t know if these early implementations could propagate into any traditional organization, or if they would remain in the domain of blockchain-based businesses.Will the concept of decentralized organizations that are tied to blockchain technology influence how a firm is organized? And to what degree? We haven’t yet totally figured out blockchain governance, yet we want these early examples to model how the firm needs to be run.Automating governance and automating operations are not the same thing, but in both cases, we need more experience in modeling and running parallel systems before declaring that we know how the firm’s organization will change.We have no idea. For comparison, in developed countries, the Internet economy contributes anywhere from 5 to 12% of a nation’s GDP, and that was accomplished 23 years after the Web’s advent.Yes, cryptocurrency-based companies are emerging, but what will be the compound effect on real wealth creation across countries, industries and economies? We know that the total value of cryptocurrencies hovers roughly at the $15bn mark as of the end of 2016, but that is the only quantifiably measurable metric relating to wealth creation.Will the crypto-tech economy follow a similar path as the Web economy in being its own force of economic strength? I certainly hope so, but we are in the early innings of this evolution.How many blockchain identitieswill we have is an interesting question. One answer is that we’ll likely have as many blockchain identities as we currently can hold real ID cards in our physical wallets, combined with the number of online identities we possess. This is because a blockchain identity crosses the physical to online world due to the potential melding of the trust factor between these two semi-artificial boundaries.Blockchain-based identity holds a promise, which is to allow us to consume a number of services in a trusted manner, without the need to assert our physical presence, like remote voting for example.What will be the killer app for blockchain-based identity: voting, trading, social applications, e-commerce, consumer services, or others? Are we going to end-up with a variety of identities or will a handful emerge? Will bonding our reputation be a romantic linkage, or will it have a real value?There are big expectation for blockchain-based smart contracts. Will they be able to dispense money, change conditions, and enact decisions? Maybe it’s easier to codify existing law and we should start there, instead of creating new laws while we also attempt to codify them before they are proven.Can smart contracts govern company operations, decisions, stakeholders, and future directions? We must be careful in not rushing smart contracts implementations where we don’t fully understand the implications of their potential failures.In the case of the much publicized DAO rise and fall, too much autonomy was entrusted into fledgeling smart contracts, and the process took a turn that was humanly unstoppable (except via a hardfork).Autonomy seems to be a stubborn goal of DAO’s, as zealous engineers want to give power to their smart contracts, just because money, business rules, responsibilities and decision-making can now be programmed all together in a big mashup.Will we see the equivalent of a smart contrast in-chief that governs other smart contracts? Is Turing completeness a benefit or weakness of smart contracts?In light of the continued blockchain-related security hacks (eg: The DAO and Bitfinex, to name just two recently visible ones), a fundamental question is front and center: will we eventually take blockchain security for granted, just as we take bank grade security for granted? Or is it too early in the maturity cycle of blockchains to expect total security resiliency?There is no reason why we shouldn’t expect blockchains to be as trusted as what is commonly referred as “bank grade security”, although we are not there yet, today. However, we should be reminded that real banks have had a rich history of robberies starting with the 1800’s during the Wild West era in the US, and there are continued successful bank robberies, thefts and hacking exploit, up this day.Eventually, the frequency of blockchain security vulnerabilities should be an artifact of the past, because security is an essential condition if blockchains want to become big.That is a loaded question that we are barely starting to tackle and with expected breakthroughs in 2017.Will there be standard way to access off-chain data? Will decentralized oracles become provably honest retrieval sources by centralized services? Will various blockchains inter-operate with each other at the asset exchange level or via other types of linkages? Will the Internet of Things take off when we connect it to blockchains? Will there be other flavors of blockchains in addition to the popular public and private one? How will the blockchain record and update physical status? Or should we optimize for on-blockchain activity? Will moving assets across blockchains be like the nightmare of integrating multiple databases or will it be a lot easier?The innovator\u0027s dilemma is an omnipresent hurdle for large companies. The Internet was no exception to it, as we saw few large players reinvent themselves with the Web era. Instead, a number of industry sectors were hit broadside by the Internet: newspapers, retailers, bookstores, travel agents, stock brokers, lenders, payment processors, post offices, and others saw their business radically altered by the Internet.With blockchain implementations, large companies could keep busy for the next 10 years, reengineering their operations to benefit from cost savings and process improvements due to blockchain-based solutions, but will they go further outside of their comfort zones? Will they implement what’s under their nose and in their current operations?If central banks who have been tinkering with the blockchain adopt cryptocurrency, will it be as an experiment or as something they truly believe is in their future?Where are the consumer applications that don’t require users to have any technical knowledge of the blockchain? Early cryptocurrency wallets are very natively close to the blockchain and not user-friendly enough, at least not for mass consumption.Maybe there’s a Web equivalent to the blockchain that we are still waiting for. It was the World Wide Web that provided this user-friendly layer where users didn’t have to worry about connecting computers together in order to benefit from the information availability.Will we be able to shift the conversations from the technical realm into the business one?For the most part, regulators have not been too heavy-handed yet. But they are bound to place their marks on the blockchain, eventually. What is not known is whether they will innovate, update, experiment, support or tamper with blockchain innovation.The right regulatory updates could provide a great boost to blockchain implementations. There are new theories for blockchain regulations that place regulators as a node on the network, just like any other peer, allowing it visibility and transparency into a slice of transactions which they can observe and react to.However, we have yet to see official regulators taking these types of positions, and we still need to see more regulatory sandbox experiments bear their fruit.Will proof of work (POW) scale indefinitely or will a new consensus method such as proof of stake or delegated proof of stake replace it? Do we know all we need to know about the economics and safety of this popular consensus method?A corollary to that first question follows: will miners continue to play a key role or will their place become threatened? Furthermore, will it be possible to create a public blockchain that isn\u0027t dominated by a few mining interests?Let us be reminded of what Tim Berners-Lee said when they decided to make the Web technologies totally open: “You can’t propose that something be a universal space and at the same time keep control of it.”Finally, will it be possible to have a secure blockchain without a valuable token as the incentive to secure it, without calling that a permissioned private blockchain?Currently, new Initial Cryptocurrency Offerings (ICOs) are launching with a frenzy not unlike the Internet rush to IPO’s during 1999, when half-baked companies or ideas hurried to get listed, only to later face the ugly brutalities of public markets.Choosing the ICO route via a public crowdfunding campaign is almost like being a public company from day one. It’s not easy being in the public eye, and companies that can’t deliver high standards of transparency shouldn’t take that path.Amidst the uncertainties in evaluating ICOs, we really don\u0027t know if this trend will become a normative way to raise funds when a cryptocurrency is involved.Furthermore, we are still trying to validate the various roles that a cryptocurrency (or token) plays in it: is it a proxy for network effects, an intrinsic utility, a reward, or a speculative instrument?In 2016, waiting for blockchain standards has been like waiting for Godot, but that was not such a bad thing. Imposing standards too early may be hurtful to the blockchain industry, because we need to see the technology blossom a little further.The topic of blockchain standards is complicated, and it extends beyond just seeing it as an interoperability challenge. We will probably need a set of technical, business and legal types of standards, but we really don’t know which ones they are yet, or which existing ones need to be updated instead of being completely re-thought of.Technology innovation will always outpace regulatory and standards bodies who want to freeze-frame it in order to put their stamp on it. But if you try to frame a moving picture too early, the resulting optic will be distorted and you will want to replace it soon after.In theory, quantum computing could lower the security resiliency of blockchains because it threatens to break the strength of encryption.Will quantum computing be a force to reckon with, or will blockchain encryption also benefit from it and strengthen itself accordingly, rendering the net impact as a neutral one?We define the blockchain as being a peer-to-peer network for value flow without central intermediaries, but the reality is that new intermediaries are emerging.Much of the blockchain activity is focused on financial services, as many startups see banks as the disappearing intermediaries, but outside of financial services, what other industry sector will show good use cases for the blockchain? Government, energy, healthcare are good contenders, but real implementations are few and far in-between.Will linking physical assets to blockchains get accomplished without introducing trusted third parties?There are at least 25 various consortia across various sectors and industries, all of them vying to provide collective benefits to their members.Consortia are hard. Pulling diverse companies to work together is not easy. You need disciplined processes, persistence, patience, a tolerance for some politics and lots of maturity.At best, they level the playing field among participants and help to move forward collectively. Therefore, consortium work doesn’t offer a competitive advantage, which is why most participants will need other blockchain initiatives in parallel.Will group initiatives deliver on their promises or will they end up being a bridge into other types of activities?We are increasingly spending our time in online activities that we don’t get paid for, but will we continue to give our time away for free?Social media for example is a benevolent time consuming activity that has no direct financial paybacks. What if we injected cryptocurrency into these activities as a new unit of value? Will it be a good enough incentive that brings benefits and quality improvements?Is cryptocurrency the missing fuel that could re-energize the attention economy?What does a world of competing blockchains look like? Or will they all work together harmoniously?If there were more than one Internet, it would have undoubtedly not blossomed the way it did. Certainly, the path to multiple blockchains and distributed ledgers is currently being paved, but we still don’t fully understand how the needed network effects would be affected by a multiplicity of blockchain networks.Is the only form of private blockchain the consortium one, or will there be other forms perhaps similar to the private website where one firm runs its own blockchain application to serve its private customers?The intent of this reality check was not to be negative, but to be grounded.It’s always good to know about the headwinds you face, even when experiencing the feelings of hope and excitement.Optimists would like you to believe. Skeptics want you to forget. Realists (like me) encourage you to think hard and be aware.The proverbial jury is still out for many of the issues that I have enumerated. To bring these thoughts into the practical, I encourage you to take on a personal assignment for whatever blockchain activities you are involved in: make your own list of unknowns, and think of a path to remove uncertainties and turn them into known issues.Then, talk to people outside of your blockchain spaces. Ask them what they think of your projects and ideas. Like kids, they’ll say the darndest things, but they will tell the truth and ground you back to reality.After more than two decades in operation, we can say today that the Web has been largely tamed, as there are few unknowns to it (except perhaps for the vague mysteries of hacking). In contrast, the blockchain terrain is boiling with uncertainties, although not insurmountable ones, and will remain so for a few more years, until a given maturity is reached.Uncovering the known unknowns was only the easy part. The harder part will be to discover the unknown unknowns, but to get there, we will need to wait yet another year!(Thanks to Fred Wilson, Daniel James, Yondon Fu, Soumitra Mandhata, Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, Matt Moynihan, Brian Hoffman and several followers for providing input or feedback that I took into consideration.)Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

He was nominated by President Obama on 1st August, 2013, and was sworn in on 16th June, 2014.In this special feature for CoinDesk\u0027s 2016 in Review, Giancarlo discusses why he believes the US needs to rethink its blockchain policy for 2017 and beyond.I spoke a lot about distributed ledger technology (DLT) this past year because I believe in its promising benefits for the financial marketplace and financial regulators.DLT may help market participants manage the enormous operational, transactional and capital complexity brought about by the legion of disparate mandates, regulations and capital requirements promulgated globally in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.For regulators, DLT may help transcend the fragmented regulatory structure by providing reference to a single, verified record of all financial transactions across regulated markets.In order for this technology to flourish, however, regulators must come together and set uniform principles to encourage DLT investment and innovation.That\u0027s why, earlier this year, I outlined five practical steps that, my agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and other financial regulators should take to encourage DLT and other financial technology.On this last step, financial regulators must address how to prevent \u0027death from a thousand cuts\u0027 by numerous state, federal and foreign regulators for FinTech firms that look to provide services across financial market regulatory jurisdictions.Because emerging technology, such as DLT, has the potential to provide many benefits that transcend regulatory boundaries, financial regulators must start by putting forth uniform principles in order to avoid stifling innovation.The CFTC and other US financial regulators are falling behind foreign jurisdictions in promoting FinTech.The FCA, for example, has created a flourishing Innovation Hub that allows FinTech firms to introduce innovative financial products and services to the market and test new ideas through its Regulatory Sandbox.Several other jurisdictions are now following the FCA’s lead.The end of the year is generally a time to reflect on where we have been and where we would like to go in the year ahead.The changing administration in the US provides an opportunity to take a fresh look at promoting DLT and FinTech innovation.The five steps I have laid out provide a good roadmap. Further, I pledge to do my part in the new year to further DLT and FinTech innovation for the health and betterment of US financial and capital markets, market participants and the American jobs that they support.Follow Chris Giancarlo on Twitter: @giancarloCFTC.Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016?

However, the consortium effort, with a current membership of 27 companies, takes those efforts one step further.Other members of the new group include Dongbu Securities, Yuanta Securities Korea and Kiwoom Securities.The blockchain effort was organized in part by the Korea Financial Investment Association, an industry trade group in South Korea.The new initiative is the second of its kind in South Korea, and its formation last week comes on the heels of a separate consortium initiative spearheaded by the South Korean government.In late October, the East Asian country\u0027s government began putting the pieces in place for its public-private consortium, back by major South Korean banks and their top regulator, the Financial Services Commission (FSC).\"With the creation of the consortium, momentum is expected to start for spearheading the development of technology and service in the blockchain field, rather than passively following the footsteps of advanced nations,\" FSC chairman Kim Yong-beom was quoted as saying by regional news service Yonhap at the time.Specific elements of the government-backed consortium include the formation of a task force drawn from the banking sector and other agencies that would ostensibly regulate the technology. Forums for information sharing and joint development of projects are also planned.Perhaps most notably, the government has expressed interest in seeking solutions to potential regulatory problems in conjunction with the consortium, suggesting that the group could become a focal point for blockchain development in South Korea.Seoul, South Korea, image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Asia, South Korea, Technology, Regulation, News, Fintech, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Dec 12, 2016 at 3:00 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/12/12/what-we-know-about-the-federal-reserves-blockchain-stance/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/93m3knHbI9Rag1XZRgjGrnHnBv8\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/37CDBECGZRETRKPEPL2ZNRJ3QQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"What We Know About the Federal Reserve\u0027s Blockchain Stance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"On 5th December, the Federal Reserve released its much-awaited research paper on distributed ledgers.The paper, “Distributed Ledger Technology in Payments, Clearing and Settlement\", came two months after Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard remarked at the Institute of International Finance that the US central bank was \"paying close attention\" to the technology.The product of the input of 30 financial industry stakeholders, including government officials, experts from traditional finance and FinTech institutions and members of the industry consortia – the paper explored the possibilities of distributed ledger integration in the financial industry, including the legal and governance challenges facing the development of any future proofs-of-concept.As stated in the paper:Some may argue, however, that the publication of this paper is not necessarily the call of action anticipated following Brainard’s speech and Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen’s remarks before the House of Representatives’ Financial Services Committee.Yellen said that blockchain technology “could have very significant implications for the payments system” and that the Fed wants “to foster innovation”.The perception for some is that the Fed may be playing its cards close to the chest in regards to holding off on proposing definitive action and recommendations regarding distributed ledger innovation or – worse – may not have a hand to play at all.\"I do not think this report is particularly significant,\" said David Yermack, chair of the Finance Department at New York University’s Leonard N Stern School of Business, to CoinDesk.The \"very general introduction to the structure of payment systems and the potential uses of distributed ledgers\", he continued, \"barely mentions any role for the government, other than the need to consider whether new regulations will be required to fit the potential uses of the technology.\"\"I think the report is a useful reference but hardly a roadmap for how the industry might evolve,” Yermack added.A key consideration in the paper is the question of the payments, clearing and settlement regarding cross-border transactions. The current mechanism for transferring funds across international borders is a series of bank-to-bank credit or debit transactions, with varying fees being applied by each bank along the series.With banks not necessarily responding to messages from creditors promptly, settlement for cross-border payments could take as long as five days.The paper suggests that distributed ledgers can help to alleviate the friction caused by the credit chain, with the possibility of an open-source interoperability standard like the Interledger Protocol (ILP) spurring adoption of blockchains for international payments.There is also the hope that the use of distributed ledgers can help combat the problem of increasing numbers of fraudulent cross-border transactions.In one case, $81m was stolen from the Central Bank of Bangladesh through false payment requests connected to various Filipino casinos.The theft – the largest of a series of bank-level intrusion into the SWIFT network, the world’s largest interbank messaging service – illustrated a very uneasy truth about cross-border payments: there is no known way to secure them using current techniques and methods.While the banks victimized in these thefts all shared deficiencies in their local security, the notion that these thefts can occur unchallenged raises serious concerns about the creditworthiness and stability of the system as a whole.The paper takes the position that a distributed ledger – by making transaction histories and current states of ownership of assets readily available across all nodes of the network – can quickly make real-time auditing possible at a peer level, improving the transparency and security of the nodes.“DLT is essentially asset-agnostic, meaning the technology is potentially capable of providing the storage, recordkeeping, and transfer of any type of asset,” reads the research paper. “This asset-agnostic nature of DLT has resulted in a range of possible applications currently being explored for uses in post-trade processes.”Not everyone, however, is convinced that distributed ledgers can alleviate the friction caused by cross-border payments.“My thought on this is that they’re trying to fit a square peg in a round hole,” Spencer Bogart, research analyst for equity research with Needham \u0026 Company, told CoinDesk.“By digging in to explore how ‘blockchain’ or ‘DLT’ might improve efficiency in PCS systems that they may uncover some real inefficiencies that can be addressed — but I highly doubt that ‘blockchain’ or ‘DLT’ is the solution,” he said.The \"critical elements\" needed for a blockchain to function (such as proof-of-work security, decentralization and immutability) are not \"desirable features for these systems\", Bogart suggested, adding:This, of course, is not a position shared by all. Ryan Zagone is the director or regulatory relations at Ripple, which facilitated the development of the Interledger Protocol.In conversation with CoinDesk, Zagone pointed out that the research paper could be the first step in the formation of a guidance position the Fed could take to help lead innovation in cross-border payments.“By taking a moment to assess the implications of using this technology – both in the sense of what we can achieve, but also what are the risks and realities of using this technology for our payments – this paper presents a thoughtful look at the state of the cross-border payment system,” Zagone said.“There are real inefficiencies with cross-border payments and there is – as the Fed has pointed out – room to improve domestic systems,” he continued. “So, this is a broad look toward what is needed to improve the system today.”Ripple is a member of the Federal Reserve’s Faster Payments Task Force, which is charged with finding solutions for the agenda laid out in the 2015 position paper “Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System.”Contained within its agenda are calls for implementation of faster, safer payment capabilities in the US, reduction of fraud and security risks to the payment system, improvement in end-to-end efficiency for cross-border and domestic payments, and enhancement of the National Settlement Service and interbank settlement for check payments.Composed of stakeholders from government agencies, major financial and retail operations and affiliated non-profit entities, the task force represents the Federal Reserve’s commitment to promote change to the payment system from within the private sphere.“The Federal Reserve will act as leader, convener and catalyst as appropriate and will commit its resources to supporting these initiatives,” the task force paper reads. “... It would not consider expanding its service provider role unless it determines that doing so is necessary to bring about significant improvements to the payment system and that actions of the private sector alone will likely not achieve the desired outcomes for speed, efficiency and safety in a timely manner.”Ripple’s Interledger Protocol permits blockchains to automatically route and deliver messages and payments between each other without the need of complicated coding.The potential of this is that two accounts on different distributed ledgers can connect to each other without the need to vet the connection first.As the transmitted payment is secured using a ledger-provided escrow, this eliminates the need of a third-party ledger, ensures the receipt of either a cryptographically-signed receipt or the rejected escrow to the sender and removes the need for any mutually-agreed transfer arrangement.While it can be debated ad nauseam whether the Fed is doing enough to deliver on its promise of promoting innovation of blockchain technology or even if such technology could effectively be implemented wide-scale, the paper – taken with other blockchain innovation measures taken recently, such as the creation of the Illinois Blockchain Initiative – suggests an evolution in the conversation of cryptographic-enabled finances from the theoretical to the concrete.\"This working paper presents as a rigorously researched, lucid, thorough, and comprehensive place to begin in the development of a guiding document for the future,” said Perianne Boring, president and founder of The Chamber of Digital Commerce, in conversation with CoinDesk.She said:Playing cards image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Federal Reserve, Banking, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Dec 12, 2016 at 11:40 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/12/11/the-state-of-global-blockchain-consortia/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/usWLhCkUsdC3qATovWRxQ4GWvyA\u003d/570x300/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/MMBKX3KCXFGFRNURW7MUM2S45Y.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The State of Global Blockchain Consortia","INTRO":"William Mougayar looks at the current state of blockchain consortia across the globe.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"William Mougayar is the author of \"The Business Blockchain\" and a board advisor to, and investor in, various blockchain projects and startups (See: Disclosures).Here, Mougayar looks at the current state of blockchain consortia across the globe, providing an interactive map for closer investigation.Back in 2000, business-to-business consortia marketplaces were all the rage. They quickly became popular in every industry segment possible. The premise was that the Web could enable a new level of collaboration among industry players to streamline B2B transactions, and eliminating redundant processes.At the height of their popularity, there were close to 200 such initiatives, with hundreds of companies as their respective industry members.Following the dot-com crash, almost each one of these initiatives folded, for one reason or another, and only two survived.The theory of B2B marketplaces made a lot of sense. The practice and implementation were another story that was cut short, due to unrealistic assumptions, expectations, or not enough will power or budgets to see them through.I’m giving this background as context for the flurry of blockchain-based industry consortia that are springing out today across the globe.I am both excited and cautious about this burst of activity. Excited, because these initiatives are elevating the blockchain’s agenda in the eyes of executives, industries and companies. Cautious, because I know that some of them will not succeed.However, I am optimistic that the success rate record of the blockchain consortia will be much better than the fate of the dotcom B2B consortia initiatives.So, I’ve compiled here a detailed list of the 25 significant consortia or group efforts that are known and are doing work to advance the state of blockchain understanding and implementation.The scope of my work was:The interactive version is here (this means you can click on each marker to reveal more information about each organization).And here’s a link to the Google Sheet that I used.Some facts about them:Here is a Slideshare presentation that includes all the data.Consortiums are hard. Pulling diverse companies to work together is not easy. You need disciplined processes, persistence, patience, a tolerance for some politics and lots of maturity.At best, they level the playing field among participants and help to move forward collectively. Therefore, consortia work doesn’t offer a competitive advantage, which is why most participants have other blockchain initiatives in parallel.I will make the following predictions for 2017:The number of such initiatives will surpass 100 because many sectors and industries are still not represented.No matter what happens, the consortia activity is worth following.

He advises on cross-border investment and financial matters, primarily in emerging markets. Zimbler was assisted in the writing of this article by Dmitry Dmitriev and Andrey Ignatenko, associates at Morgan Lewis.In this opinion piece, the authors examine the seeming thaw in attitudes towards blockchain and bitcoin in Russia.Blockchain technologies are attracting increased interest from Russian financial institutions and IT companies, and may be poised to overcome skepticism from Russian regulators. This is perhaps not surprising, given Russia’s prominence in the technology sector, with over 120,000 local programmers and continuing growth in e-commerce and online activities.However, certain legal obstacles may still pose challenges for promoters and developers of cryptocurrencies and other blockchain applications.The Russian authorities have given attention to potential uses of cryptocurrencies for several years, but until recently the focus was on anti-corruption and anti-money laundering measures, legal compliance and risk management. The Russian central bank and Ministry of Finance have played leading roles in consideration of these issues.Russian law currently states that the ruble is the national currency, and that the issuance of other currencies or “currency surrogates” on Russian territory is prohibited. Some Russian officials have argued that cryptocurrencies should be treated as surrogates, but this point remains controversial.In 2014, the central bank issued a formal letter noting that the trading of goods or services for “virtual currencies,” as well as the conversion of such currencies to rubles or foreign currencies, could be used for money laundering and terrorist financing. While this warning did not have the force of law, it served to put Russian banks and companies on notice that transactions with cryptocurrencies are likely to be subject to special scrutiny.In early 2016, the Russian authorities appeared ready to go further in moving against cryptocurrencies. Reportedly, the Ministry of Finance prepared draft amendments to existing laws that would impose administrative fines and criminal penalties for the issuance, purchase or sale of bitcoins. These would include fines of up to 2.5 million rubles (about $39,000 at current exchange rates) for financial organizations, and imprisonment of up to seven years for senior managers.Certain other Russian governmental bodies expressed support for these proposals, including the Ministry of Economic Development and the Investigative Committee, a federal agency with authority over criminal investigations.However, it appears that the Russian government has decided not to pursue these amendments, for several reasons. First, it was reported that certain key players such as the Ministry of Justice and the federal Prosecutor’s Office did not support the proposed imposition of criminal liability. Some observers argued that existing Russian laws would be sufficient to deal with criminal activity, without establishing a separate rule based solely on use of cryptocurrencies.Second, Russia is now exploring the potential advantages of the relevant technologies behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Accordingly, some Russian authorities are working on new legal reforms to provide a legitimate basis for the use and development of cryptocurrencies.Proponents include Herman Gref, chairman of Russian banking giant Sberbank and a former Minister of Economics and Trade. Gref has argued that if Russia bans cryptocurrencies, it will risk falling behind in innovations related to blockchain and similar technologies. Other Russian officials have also expressed interest in blockchain, and further progress is expected on this front in 2017.A concrete example of Russian interest in blockchain technologies is Masterchain. Commencing in fall 2015, the central bank established a working group to study blockchain technologies and explore potential practical applications, with emphasis on financial markets. This led to efforts to establish a prototype distributed database for financial messaging.In 2016, a consortium including Russian payments company Qiwi, Accenture and four Russian financial organizations began testing blockchain technologies in cooperation with the central bank. The work of the consortium resulted in Masterchain, an ethereum-based blockchain prototype for the validation and exchange of client data and transactional information.In contrast to ethereum, Masterchain is a permissioned (private) database of chained blocks of data that sees the central bank act simultaneously as an ordinary user in payment processing and a trusted administrator.The next step may be to develop further prototypes. Central bank officials are currently examining two other proposed versions of Masterchain. One is ethereum-based and uses a proof-of-work (POW) consensus algorithm (to be replaced with a proof-of-stake (POS) algorithm when ethereum switches to POS). The second already uses POS.A group of 10 Russian financial organizations will test these products, with the goal of eventual commercial use.Another Russian proposal would see the establishment of a professional association – that would include representatives of various governmental agencies – called \"FinTech\" to assist in drafting legal reforms to regulate blockchain technologies.The new body would address various applications of blockchain technologies, such as electronic voting, notary systems, maintenance of shareholder, real estate and other statutory registers, and validation of client data and transactional information.Other Russian organizations and business leaders are also becoming active in the field. The National Settlement Depository, Russia’s central securities depository, has initiated a pilot e-proxy shareholder voting project using a permissioned blockchain solution.In addition, the Perm State National Research University has opened a laboratory to study “crypto-economics” and blockchain systems; a prominent Russian entrepreneur has invested in the BlockGeeks social media platform; and Russian payments company Qiwi has aired plans to upgrade its core database to a distributed ledger system within five years.The use of blockchain technologies for the formation and implementation of smart contracts has also attracted interest in Russia, but may require further legal reforms.The country has already begun incorporating applications for modern technologies into its civil laws and contract practices. For example, Russian law allows parties to enter into contracts by the exchange of electronic documents through email or other means. However, in some cases it may be advisable to create a separate physical document to establish the legal basis for subsequent electronic communications.The use of various types of electronic signatures is also authorized, under rules like the 1999 EU Electronic Signatures Directive, though certain verification keys may require certification by the Russian communications authorities.In addition, a number of Russian governmental bodies have modernized their operations to facilitate the exchange of documents via online platforms, such as electronic submission of tax declarations, accounting reports and license and patent applications. These include the Federal Tax Service, Federal Service for Intellectual Property, and Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media.Further, notary filings may be submitted electronically, and the state companies register is accessible online.Nonetheless, in some respects Russia remains a tradition-bound market in which physical documents, seals and stamps are essential. In particular, the transition to distributed ledger systems and virtual contracts will conflict with existing, centralized registers that are legally required for certain transactions.An example is the sale of “participation interests” in a Russian limited liability company (LLC) which is effected by notarial certification of the written sale contract, and recording of the corresponding entry into the state register. For sales of shares in stock companies, the transfer must be recorded in a separate register, typically kept by an independent service provider.While Russian courts are also joining the digital revolution – for example, some hearings and decisions are now accessible online – they are more traditional with respect to evidentiary matters. Generally, the courts require the production of physical originals or certified copies of documents, and it is not clear how virtual contracts should be documented for these purposes.In theory, blockchain solutions could be proposed to address some of these issues, for example to replace notarial certification and the use of central registers. They would also facilitate due diligence, as a prospective buyer could verify all prior share transactions.However, full adoption of blockchain solutions would entail further Russian legal reforms. For example, it is not clear how the use of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) or similar arrangements, where contracts are implemented by use of pre-written codes, would be interpreted under Russian contract rules, either from the perspective of enforceability or imposing liability for breaches. Occurrences of breach or fraud within the decentralized blockchain could also raise novel questions of jurisdiction and governing law without precedent in Russia.These matters will require further attention from Russian officials, IT developers, lawyers and other market participants. Ultimately, if Russia decides to play an active role in the development of blockchain technologies, then the necessary legal changes are likely to follow.Moscow skyscrapers image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Law, Blockchain Technology, Russia, Bitcoin, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/11/20/making-sense-of-blockchain-governance-applications/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/eWqs-yFSFH2oOuVNy2Yr22smUfg\u003d/570x360/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/BRN7JLBYNBAKHOVEIZRRZW77IA.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Making Sense of Blockchain Governance Applications","INTRO":"Ledger Labs\u0027 Josh Stark seeks to provide a high-level framework for understanding the potential of nascent blockchain governance applications.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Josh Starkis head of operations and legal at Ledger Labs, a blockchain consulting and development firm.In this opinion piece, Stark seeks to provide a high-level framework for understanding the power and potential of nascent blockchain governance applications.Governance has long been one of the most-hyped applications for blockchain technology.However, there\u0027s often little clarity about what \"governance\" means in this context. The term is used to encompass applications ranging from secure online voting, to new forms of political governance, to flawed experiments in decentralized investment funds.First, we need to be clear about what we mean by \"governance\".Most often the term brings to mind political governance. The institutions that, according to a system of rules and laws, make up our various levels of government. Political governance includes processes like democratic elections, votes held by representative bodies like parliaments, and the particular responsibilities and powers given to different institutions.We might also think of corporate governance: the processes used by corporations to make decisions. Corporate governance includes processes like shareholder votes, board meetings and the different levels of power and responsibility given to executives and committees.Both of these are applications of a common set of tools designed to facilitate group decision-making. Rules, laws, institutions, processes, rights and customs that, used together, become a system that enables organizations to make decisions. Applications of governance range from highly complex systems like nation states to very simple ones – say, a private club with a simple majority voting mechanism for approving new members.This is what I mean by \"governance\" for the purposes of this article – the processes and systems used to facilitate decision-making in any organization.Note that this doesn\u0027t refer to a particular use of those tools. Governance systems can be designed well or poorly, they can be effective or not and they can be just or unjust. But, the set of tools that lets us build any of these systems share common features, and it is the tools that might be improved by the various projects, products and technologies that make up the category of \"blockchain governance\" applications.Any governance system requires certain basic technologies.First, it requires a way to record a set of rules. Rules like who gets to vote, who gets to sit in parliament or who has commit access to a codebase. These rules have to be recorded somewhere securely so that they can\u0027t be lost, destroyed or forgotten.Importantly, we must also be able to verify that a given rule is the real rule, and not fraudulent.Second, there must be a way for people to interact with the rules. For instance, if a rule gives you the right to vote, then you need to be able to exercise that right. You need an election: poll workers, voting booths, paper slips, vote-reading machines and other technologies required to facilitate voting. If there is no way to interact with a rule, then the rule can\u0027t serve its purpose in the overall system.Third, governance systems require a way to enforce the rules. What if someone cheats? What if they vote twice, or refuse to give up power when their term is up? There must be a way to compel individuals to follow the rules, otherwise the rule is again hollow. Existing governance systems use different tools to enforce their rules, like social norms or legal systems.Let\u0027s look at a simple example: a small charitable non-governmental organization (NGO) with a three-member board. The NGO receives funds from sponsors, and must decide how to spend the money to achieve its mandate.Its rules are contained in a simple constitution that sets out the purpose of the organization, as well as articles of incorporation and bylaws that contain the rules that define how decisions are made. The NGO keeps a copy of these rules, and so does its lawyer, who serves as a trusted third party – a way of ensuring that they can always be certain about what the \"real\" rule is.To interact with those rules, the board convenes meetings where votes are carried out and recorded.Third, the bylaws are enforced – if necessary – by the legal system of the jurisdiction in which the NGO is registered.Blockchain technology offers an elegant new way of accomplishing these three basic functions of governance.First, blockchains are ideal for recording information in a way that can be later verified as authoritative. Information stored on a blockchain is distributed, meaning it is very difficult to destroy completely and very easy to access. Anyone can verify for themselves that a given entry on a blockchain has not been altered since it was created and verify that it was created through a particular process.Let\u0027s return to our NGO example and suppose it has a rule where the votes of two-thirds of the board members are required to approve any expenditure over $1,000. We could simply store a hashed copy of that rule written in plain language on a blockchain and then later be able to cryptographically prove that the rule we are reading is the same one we placed there and that it has not been altered since.Second, blockchains provide a new way for people to interact with the rules directly.To do this, we wouldn\u0027t simply store a copy of natural-language rules like in our example above. Rather, we could take this a step further and express the rule in code. Using what is commonly known as \"smart contract code\" technology, some blockchains allow users to create logical scripts that are executed by the blockchain itself.Instead of recording our NGO\u0027s rule in natural language, we could express it as a simple computer program. The program would receive a spending proposal as an input, check to see if its value is more than $1,000, and then trigger a vote. The program would receive inputs in the form of signed votes, count them, and then determine whether there was a majority. If two out of three board members have voted \"yes\", then the program would automatically send the funds to the recipient defined in the proposal.Crucially, we have already achieved our third requirement – enforcement. When the rule is expressed as executable code, the rule can be enforced at the same time it is exercised. So long as the code can control the assets subject to the rule, then the rule itself executes the outcome.While they sound mundane, these basic features form the building blocks of any governance system. The fact that they can be achieved – even in a narrow sense – through the scripting capabilities of blockchain networks opens up new possibilities to augment existing governance systems or build entirely new ones.Blockchain governance applications are an extension of the technology\u0027s general capability to execute rules defined in code.This capability is most often discussed in the context of \"smart legal contracts\", where blockchain code is used to augment traditional legal contracts. In that context, blockchain code is used to store and enforce rules as agreed to between two parties to a commercial relationship.Here, we are using the same technology – blockchain code as rules – and just applying it to a slightly different use case.In a commercial contract, the parties are agreeing to a set of rules designed to facilitate trade of some kind. In a governance system, the parties are agreeing to a set of rules that will help them cooperate and make decisions together. In either case, the ability of blockchain smart contract code to \"enforce\" its own rules is a powerful capability, though it comes with limitations.The first important limitation is what can actually be controlled by a blockchain governance system.In our example above, our blockchain-enforced spending limit rule was useful because the rule itself can have control over the funds at issue. Once the votes are in, the money is sent. This is possible because we are assuming that the NGOs funds are in cryptocurrency, which can be directly controlled by blockchain smart-contract code.But if the thing being controlled by the governance structure was something else – US dollars, or a physical asset like a vehicle – our solution can\u0027t be as easily automated. We could hold a vote through our system, but ultimately some person would have to enforce the outcome of that process by making a bank wire or transferring legal title of the car.Over time, we should expect that other types of assets – like fiat currency, or vehicle registries – will be integrated with blockchain systems, which will expand the utility of blockchain governance systems.Likewise, if our governance system is primarily concerned with controlling access and permissions within some other system (eg: over a codebase, or within a private Internet forum), then the utility of our blockchain governance system depends on whether the blockchain-enforced rules can control the permissions or access in those systems.This, too, is a barrier that will quickly be overcome as platforms are built that integrate easily with blockchain technology.Keeping in mind our analysis above, how do the various projects that fall into the category of \"blockchain governance\" relate to one another?Some of these projects aim to simply provide a user a set of tools they can use to build their own governance systems. Boardroom, for example, is a suite of \"governance components\" that a user can take and structure however they want. Using pre-built default code contracts – things like votes, proposals, boards and committees – a user can more quickly build something that fits their particular needs.The point of the product isn’t a specific type of governance, but rather just providing the tools needed for users to build their own governance structures. Our NGO above, for example, could use Boardroom to build the simple governance system we described.Other projects attempt to build new types of governance systems that take advantage of the unique strengths of blockchain technology. The most obvious of these strengths is that blockchains are decentralized – there\u0027s no central party required to maintain the system or \"enforce\" its rules. This makes it possible for governance systems built on blockchain networks to themselves be decentralized, with no central party.The best known project of this kind was The DAO. The DAO, which stands for decentralized autonomous organization, aimed to be a user-controlled venture fund. It raised funds by selling tokens, which granted holders of those tokens certain rights in its governance system.Token-holders would then vote on proposals submitted to the DAO and decide where it should invest its funds. The DAO had no legal entity and no bank account – it was governed entirely through blockchain code.It was an audacious plan, and it\u0027s unfortunate that it failed as quickly as it did. Critical security flaws in its code let an attacker siphon away The DAO\u0027s funds, destroying confidence in the project and leading to an elaborate game of cat-and-mouse as The DAO\u0027s creators tried to salvage their project and recapture the funds.As an experiment in smart-contract security practices, The DAO was a failure. But, it was also an experiment in whether a governance system of this type – a decentralized venture fund – could succeed in the marketplace. The failure of the first experiment unfortunately means the second wasn\u0027t truly tested.A third type of blockchain governance application is aimed at solving the practical problems facing traditional enterprise as they adopt blockchain systems more generally. For instance, consider the governance challenges facing consortium blockchain projects.Many \"enterprise\" blockchain systems being explored today take the form of a permissioned blockchain network that is shared between entities – a consortium. The nodes that make up the permissioned blockchain would not be maintained by the public, but rather by each participating institution.For instance, a shared blockchain ledger maintained by several banks that enables them to more easily settle cash balances between themselves, or a shared blockchain ledger that tracks ownership of financial assets like shares, derivatives, or bonds.One challenge facing institutions as they work on these projects is how they will be governed. If there is no central entity that will \"own\" the ledger – indeed, this is part of the value of this approach – the participants must be able to govern it jointly. Not only is this politically difficult (coordinating among competitors with different priorities is never simple), it\u0027s a practical problem as well.There must be a process, mediated by the code itself, through which the consortium makes critical decisions, like voting to add new members or removing existing ones, or upgrading the code over time.More than our other examples above, this will require careful integration of the blockchain-code components that govern the rules of the system and the traditional governance and legal requirements facing financial institutions.Within \"blockchain governance\" we can usefully distinguish between at least a few categories, illustrated by the examples above.There are projects that aim to simply provide the tools of governance, like Boardroom. Then there are blockchain projects that are using those tools to build particular forms of governance. The DAO sought to build an entirely new form of economic entity made possible by blockchain governance.Others have more modest aims, and are designed to solve the particular problems introduced by the adoption of blockchain technology – like those facing consortium projects. These use decentralization in a more limited sense: to enable a smaller group of participants like banks to jointly govern a shared piece of financial services infrastructure, with no centralized entity.Blockchain governance systems matter because they have the potential to permanently lower the cost of creating and maintaining governance systems of all kinds.Governance is valuable, and the systems that make it possible are expensive. Corporations spend large sums ensuring that their internal governance processes are followed, and they spend even larger sums settling lawsuits with shareholders or regulatory agencies when those processes are not followed or are inadequate.For organizations in jurisdictions with weak rule of law, the challenge is even more stark – the institutions necessary to ensure basic political or corporate governance may simply be unavailable without relocating to a different country. Access to functional governance systems is a barrier to entry for all kinds of organizations, ranging from companies to political parties to charity organizations.Blockchain governance systems could, in some circumstances, serve as a foundation for less expensive, more efficient and more automated governance. This could reduce the regulatory burden on existing political and corporate governance systems and give others access to enforceable, verifiable governance systems where they were not otherwise feasible.It seems odd to think about governance as dependent on, or intertwined with, technology. But it\u0027s certainly true that technology shapes, to some degree, the possible range of governance systems available to us.The possibility of modern democratic governance depends on the transportation and communication technologies that make it possible for millions of people to engage in secure democratic elections, and for a centralized bureaucracy to manage a nation with millions of citizens.Blockchain governance systems won\u0027t usher in a utopia, up-end the modern corporation or replace all of our existing governance methods. There are many aspects of governance that cannot be replaced by, or obviously improved through, technology. A governance system written in code can be designed just as poorly as one written in ink. But at a minimum, we’ve expanded the basic governance toolkit.Not only are these new tools cheap, but they\u0027re open source and can be accessed and improved upon by anyone with an Internet connection and a simple computer.You can\u0027t help but be curious to see what new things we will build with it.Chess king image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Politics, Blockchain Technology, smart contracts, Regulation, Governance, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/11/06/blockchain-why-the-big-guys-cant-win/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/_S3OTpXan0VcpAlDtCTZwM4QCoc\u003d/570x382/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/YHLHEJS2GFEYBHM5WUB2IOGW6A.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain: Why the \u0027Big Guys\u0027 Can’t Win","INTRO":"An industry commentator looks at moves by tech industry incumbents to capture the emerging blockchain market, and offers a warning for the future","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Matthew Spoke is CEO and founder of enterprise blockchain startup Nuco. He is a bitcoin and ethereum enthusiast, who has previously worked with Deloitte with the aim of advancing the use of smart distributed protocols.In this opinion piece, Spoke looks at moves by tech industry incumbents to capture the emerging blockchain market, and offers a warning for the eventuality that they succeed.There\u0027s a seemingly obvious marriage happening right now between two incredibly important Internet technologies, one that promised to make web businesses more scalable and organizations more efficient (which has happened to a large extent), as well as holding decentralization and disintermediation as the ultimate objective (on which the jury is still out).Earlier this year, I wrote a piece about the \"Race Towards Irrelevance\" that seemed to be taking place among traditional organizations whose markets and business models stand to lose from the adoption of decentralized systems. Primarily, I was referring to some intermediary companies in the financial services industry who will struggle to redefine their value propositions as blockchains become more commonplace.What I failed to include in my prior ramblings was that it\u0027s not only traditional industries and businesses who face this risk. Similar to the attention and investment that has poured into the \"blockchain industry\" from financial services firms, there are a number of global scale technology vendors positioning themselves to dominate this market – or, to a skeptic, centralize it.I’m referring to \"the cloud\" and \"the blockchain\", two terms which should more accurately be used in the plural sense.I’m not suggesting that cloud computing is not well suited to underlie blockchain infrastructures.On the contrary, in many cases, there’s an obvious match that allows for efficient scalability, robust node security and light weight onboarding, among other benefits. But (and this is a big but) these benefits quickly become irrelevant if we forget about the need for appropriate decentralization.Naturally, it’s no surprise that the same companies who, to a large extent, brought us the mainframe and the PC, want a piece of the blockchain action. It’s also no surprise that these same companies are already in the process of capturing large parts of the emerging blockchain market.As the old adage goes: \"nobody ever got fired for buying [insert big tech company here].\"In general, I think the entrance of big tech companies into this domain has had a positive impact.For one, it has helped bring much needed credibility and reaffirm the importance of these new technologies. That said, as markets consider their adoption, we should encourage an objective analysis as to the appropriate implementation of this technology so as to achieve its intended outcome.Although there are many reasons to trust the competency of prominent technology vendors and the integrity of their systems, which have been proven for decades in other domains, let’s keep in mind that the intended purpose of this paradigm shift is to eliminate the need for trust.Objectively, this means that a blockchain cannot be dependent on a single vendor’s infrastructure or security.Chess image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Finance, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/10/31/3-reasons-hyperledger-has-blockchains-best-development-model/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/FD7SzkR7NqpYUsrj0CnMsSykrYo\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/UJ7ECTFIERCUXAC6SMRNJ255YQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"3 Reasons Hyperledger Has Blockchain\u0027s Best Development Model","INTRO":"Skuchain\u0027s Zaki Manian argues that Hyperledger offers the best development model for the blockchain industry.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Zaki Manian is the founder of Skuchain, a startup seeking to bring cryptographic trust to the supply chain.In this opinion piece, Manian argues that Hyperledger offers the best development model for the permissioned blockchain industry, and that attempts to use public networks for business-to-business use cases are perhaps misguided.The nascent business-to-business permissioned ledger industry is moving rapidly from pilots to real product development and deployment.But as this novel application space opens up, it is important for technologists to start answering hard questions about what software development processes will provide the blockchain layer of these applications stacks.The permissioned ledger industry proposes to build a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure for the finance industry and general purpose Internet security. However, the dominant development model in our industry thus far (capital-strapped startups leveraging public ledger technology for permissioned ledger applications) is insufficient for the task.This approach comes with several drawbacks.For one, the technical considerations for creating and operating a permissioned ledger network are largely antithetical to the needs of public networks. While the industry can expect continued cross-pollination between enterprise and cryptocurrency applications, it belies the genuine engineering work that needs to be done when we rely too heavily on software artifacts from cryptocurrencies.Some parts of the blockchain ecosystem have been tackling the problem of blockchain infrastructure head on, and have made considerable investment in providing solutions to the technical challenges.Given the scope of the engineering investment involved, it isn\u0027t surprising that most of these efforts are proprietary codebases that become part of the value proposition of the startup to their customers. (As an early mover in the permissioned ledger space, Skuchain began by customizing bitcoin\u0027s Go implementation for proofs of concept).But to capture the value of a blockchain, customers fundamentally need the ability to operate and control their software independently, and this is only possible by delivering solutions on top of an ecosystem rather than a bespoke code base.My company Skuchain has long viewed its proprietary ledger as a bridge to the day when an ecosystem has emerged. We feel that day has come.Blockchains are an enabling infrastructure technology where most of the value creation occurs at higher levels of the application stack.The incentives in the technology businesses are largely to neglect infrastructure (most of the time) to provide the desired user experiences. But niche technology stacks are not the resilient technology that the world needs for critical systems.In our judgement, Hyperledger has three virtues as a home for enterprise ledger technology: architecture, organizational structure and development in the open.Perhaps the most important thing to get right at this early movement in the adoption of blockchain technology is the basic technical architecture. It has proven phenomenally difficult to start out with a monolithic architecture and try to construct reasonably componentized architecture.Hyperledger\u0027s Fabric reflects that we are in the early stages of figuring out what the best answers are for peer-to-peer enterprise application design, adversary tolerant atomic broadcast and blockchain architecture.Hyperledger\u0027s organizational structure elevates and incentivizes infrastructure work.Our view is that the participants in Hyperledger at the Linux Foundation have decades of experience trying to pick apart the puzzle of how to incentivize and sustain collaborative core infrastructure work among businesses with a variety of competitive and aligned interests in the marketplace.As observers in the steering process, we\u0027ve watched how an aligned set of incentives play themselves out in positive directions.At Skuchain, we see a responsibility to contribute back to this community on multiple levels technically in terms of code and design work, in terms of evangelism and, eventually, as we build a sustainable business on top of Hyperledger, financially through membership.Finally, while \"many eyes make all bugs shallow\" is neither adequate nor sufficient for robust security oriented development process, high-quality processes exist in both open- and closed-source development.At this stage, Hyperledger\u0027s core teams have been tremendously willing to balance the needs to get important milestones with an open and transparent development process. It gives us incredible confidence to see meaningful progress in the upstream commits, real work happening in the issue tracker and the second-version architecture coming along.We anticipate that a robust infrastructure of service providers and middleware analytics and other players will be necessary for the blockchain application stack and the open development process should play a role in coordinating and accelerating that growth in a way that closed system cannot.It\u0027s far too early to proclaim any sort of winner in the development of a blockchain stack. But Skuchain believes that Hyperledger is defining the right kinds of structure for the blockchain industry to avoid the pitfalls that might limit its potential.Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Skuchain.Puzzle image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Hyperledger, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/10/30/why-israels-banks-will-unite-over-blockchain/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/LBGd1Cg1lI99Jr_doKmYvyzxq9c\u003d/570x312/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/3PCZV7VSZZCMRJ7RJ5BUTBYF74.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Why Israel\u0027s Banks Will Unite Over Blockchain","INTRO":"Israel took a global lead on cyber security. Could it do the same with blockchain?","DETAILED_CONTENT":"This opinion piece was written by Roy Keidar and Yuval Shalheveth of Israeli law firm Yigal Arnon and Co with the assistance of Ahuva Goldstand.In the article, the authors argue that the Israeli financial industry could be poised to take a global lead on blockchain tech.The general consensus is that there is huge potential in blockchain technology. Some say it may be as big as the Internet itself, doing for transactions of value what the former has done for transfers of information.Blockchain could completely alter traditional industries, changing the face of financial transactions, legal contracts, verification mechanisms and even voting procedures. Where consensus is lacking, there possibly lie the future steps of blockchain.What can we expect to see next? Our hunch: we are entering the phase of the institutionalization of blockchain, and it will be led by the financial system. Yes, by the banks.The potential advantages to using blockchain are obvious. Most significant is the ability to remove the middleman, and allow for faster, cheaper and more secure transactions. This could prove to be economically beneficial to the financial system which facilitates billions of transactions every day.No less important is the advantage it provides for developing countries, where trust in the authorities is relatively low, and especially for those which suffer from high levels of corruption. There, people are looking for different ways to realize their civil liberties, including voting, identity verification, registering land ownership, etc. Blockchain technology – direct, decentralized, and secure – provides a potentially unprecedented and private alternative to these.Arguably one of the most vibrant blockchain industries currently is in Israel. A combination of expertise in cryptography and Big Data gained in the world of security and defense, combined with a passionate and talented entrepreneurial ecosystem has led a growing number of companies to lead the way to the next big thing in the blockchain domain.These companies include startups like Synereo (a decentralized communication platform), Simplex (a payments service working on enabling bitcoin purchases with credit cards), Colu (Colored Coins).Yet, careful observation of the Israeli ecosystem shows that it comprises much more than early-stage startups. Major Israeli financial institutions, perhaps lacking the sheer magnitude and market share of their American and European counterparts, are showing increasing interest in various applications being developed by these younger companies.Several banks (such as Bank Hapoalim, Leumi and Citi Bank) have launched accelerators with infrastructure designated to support early-stage initiatives. They offer much-needed funding, technical support and the opportunity to interact and collaborate with the banking system. This synergy could prove to be extremely valuable, as one of the major hurdles facing entrepreneurs in the field is developing products and solutions that could be adapted for, and used by, the highly conservative, heavily regulated environment such as that in which the banking system operates.In addition, more investors are being drawn into the industry, incentivizing promising ventures and adding fuel to the growing excitement and expectations surrounding the field. Recently, we\u0027re also seeing increased involvement of lawyers and accountants in the sphere, discussing implications and working with their clients on some of the challenges associated with blockchain.One cannot ignore the resemblance between the current growth in the industry and the evolution of the Israeli cyber industry roughly a decade ago. What began as a small group of cyber startups soon became a deluge of hundreds of companies, providing innovative technology and multi-tier services around the globe. Similar, but not the same. Unlike the cyber industry, the blockchain industry is lacking crucial tail-wind from the regulator.Almost two decades ago, the Israeli regulator came to the understanding that cyber was becoming a major new front. The main driver was the concern surrounding cyber-attacks on critical national infrastructure and security installations. The sharpest minds from the Israeli defense industry convened to discuss a national realignment to ensure Israel\u0027s ability to confront future challenges.Eventually the government adapted a combined approach, emphasizing the development of human talent, investment in technology, building institutions, allocating funding and providing a regulatory environment that allowed the industry to thrive. All together this has led to an unprecedented boost to the Israeli cyber industry, a push that Israel is still reaping benefits from to this day.This is not yet the case with blockchain. Regulators worldwide remain skeptical of virtual coins that circumvent banks and government authorities, and seem prone to criminal exploitations. We\u0027ve seen that SilkRoad, Mt Gox and the recent Bitfinex scandal has not done anything to defuse this stereotype.But resistance may be more deeply rooted than mere concerns over criminal misuse and consumer protection: a decentralized alternative to centuries-old systems of centralized governance and control is not something any regulator will be able to swallow too easily. Likewise, Israeli regulators are still \u0027sitting on the fence\u0027. Given that both future uses, and implications of blockchain, are unpredictable, this is to be expected.However, the regulator provides an indispensable support system, including supervision mechanisms and an appropriate legal framework. Such regulatory backing can bolster consumer awareness, understanding and confidence in the new technology and accommodate the move of blockchain from fringe to mainstream. But who will lead the charge?Various businesses worldwide are already beginning to take note of the potential economic value in using blockchain technology in myriad applications. And as competition grows, an even larger circle is beginning to feel the pressure to follow suit. Although the movement is certainly expanding, this grassroots growth may not suffice to live up to the disruptive potential of blockchain. This is where the big banks come in.Looking back at the major developments over the past year, there is no doubt that the ripest industry for blockchain is the financial system. The big financial institutions would have the most to gain – or lose.It is, however, the most highly regulated industry. Therefore, authorities need to deepen their engagement with the various applications of the technology with the aim of creating an appropriate regulatory framework applicable for the technology, whilst increasing consumer confidence, but without undermining the economic model of the financial system.And who is best qualified for that role if not the financial system itself? It has both the knowledge and capacity to conduct meaningful dialogue with the regulator on the one hand, and the economic incentive to cut down costs by using blockchain on the other. If that happens, we could soon find ourselves in an era of institutionalized blockchain, where cutting-edge technology meets conservative infrastructure to generate a wholly new and fascinating system.Israeli flag image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Israel, Blockchain Technology, Banking, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/10/22/physicians-say-blockchain-healthcare-ideas-in-need-of-exam/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/x0sV8IimpDXiIYRFp-XabaOb_24\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/W7AXVJI2JFAPXIIG6M2ZTDBK3A.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Physicians Say Blockchain Healthcare Ideas in Need of Exam","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"While there’s a lot of hype over blockchain in healthcare, some who work in the industry say that the product pitches so far are little more than pipe dreams.The comments come as blockchain technology has become increasingly touted as a solution that could streamline everything from electronic health record (EHR) management to medical insurance, reducing complexity in a system that remains frustrating for consumers and participants alike.But new interviews suggest that, while well-meaning, entrepreneurs exploring these applications aren’t quite showcasing why the technology is a match for industry problems.“It’s just not possible for the healthcare industry to be real time as it relates to claims,” said Dr Alyssa Hoverson Schott, a physician at Sanford Health who started this conversation at the Distributed Health conference earlier this month.Hoverson Schott sees about 39 patients per day, inputting medical visit and procedural codes for each patient in between visits.“There’s often not time right then to input the codes,” she said.These codes are then sent to insurance providers who review the claim and negotiate down the bill. This negotiation process, which goes back and forth between the hospital and the insurance provider, can go on for 90 days.The real problem? Those offering tech solutions to the industry don’t actually understand the day-to-day flow of providing healthcare, Hoverson Schott argued.She told CoinDesk:That’s not to say she doesn’t believe blockchain can solve problems in healthcare, rather she questions whether startups can succeed without collaborating with the traditional industry. Her interest is also personal, as her husband, a senior business analyst at Experian, has developed an interest in the technology.Despite the concerns of industry incumbents, however, her story shows how blockchain has become more than a business solution, but a social phenomenon that continues to spread.This expansion has led to interest from other healthcare veterans like Dr Jonathan Holt, a once practicing physician that now focuses on his two startups: SeqTech Diagnostics (which carries out genetic testing on food) and TranSendX, a blockchain for healthcare interoperability aimed to bring patients more control of their medical records.Yet, Holt sees an opportunity to parlay his expertise into a new venture. He argued that healthcare providers, like financial institutions, have incentives for keeping patient information private and in their control.And Holt isn’t alone in his belief that healthcare providers will continue to be cautious about new systems for housing their data, as they can incur huge fines for exposing patient health records – fines big enough to bankrupt some healthcare institutions.During the conference, tech entrepreneurs were met with this kind of skepticism when presenting such ideas.Yet another reason healthcare providers are hesitant about blockchain technology is because they’ve put a significant amount of time and money into their existing architecture. Just as the financial services industry likely won’t rip and strip away legacy systems completely, healthcare providers would also rather see updates instead of overhauls.Adding to this, most hospitals are now transitioning to electronic health record (EHR) software.As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the government mandated that healthcare providers show “meaningful use” of EHR by the beginning of 2014.“Other innovation screeches to a halt,” said Holt about the transition from paper to digital, adding:Instead of focusing on EHRs and insurance claims, Michael Gucci, a practicing emergency room physician and founder of Bitcoin Fortress Ventures, thinks blockchain entrepreneurs would have a better chance disrupting medication provenance first.While counterfeit medication isn’t as much of a problem in the US, in developing countries it’s a huge dilemma, he said. The issue costs the industry hundreds of billions of dollars per year and results in thousands of deaths annually, according to a 2014 American Health and Drug Benefits report.And there are already companies working towards this practical solution, he said, pointing to Block Verify out of the UK. The company has been working on several provenance pilots that allow medical professionals and consumers to scan a QR-code on a bottle of pills to ping the blockchain to verify the integrity.In terms of streamlining the insurance claims process and the transfer of EHRs between providers, that’s probably 10 to 15 years off, Gucci said.“Hospitals aren’t going to implement any huge changes right away. It’s going to happen in small steps,” he said.This aligns with Holt’s thoughts that blockchain entrepreneurs should develop systems of data integrity and provenance, but for simpler problems.One example is Saavha, a blockchain startup verifying the integrity of healthcare scheduling. This is particularly interesting in light of the Veterans’ Affairs (VA) scandal of 2014 and the VA’s continuing problems with falsified waiting lists.It’s also a problem one US Congressman’s proposal argues distributed ledger technology could solve.The VA even has a more stringent regulatory burden than most other hospitals, said Holt. Much of its data has to be encrypted on a hard drive under lock and key in a cage with 24/7 video surveillance, he said. And yet, the information was still manipulated.“The attention is on these big issues because everyone loves the sexiness of solving a big problem,” said Mathew Rose, a practicing junior doctor in Ireland and co-founder at Saavha. “But if you think throughout history, anything that was an immense problem, it was easier to solve the little problems inside that big problem.”Look at the development of medicine, for example. Part of the reason medical science has advanced so far is because every medical researcher works on a part of the problem, Rose said. In cancer research, some doctors focus on practices for removing tumors, while others focus on inhibiting blood supply, while still others investigate what role proteins play.In Saavha’s implementation, a hash of the appointment data is stored on the blockchain so it can be proven that the data wasn’t changed retrospectively. The problem also circumvents one of the core criticisms about blockchains – that they are inherently slow databases that aren’t good at storing of large amounts of data,.By focusing on data integrity, EHRs can store a hash on a blockchain to prove the validity of information stored elsewhere, likely in centralized repositories that exist today.There is, however, an argument to be made that these centralized databases could benefit from other less immediately viable applications of blockchain.Adrian Gropper, CTO at the non-profit group Patient Privacy Rights, thinks these centralized stores of data need to be scaled down immensely. Today, there are centralized healthcare databases containing between 5 million and 10 million patients, he said.“We’ve created a 10 million patient honeypot [for fraudsters] where something on the order of 50,000 people on staff at these hospitals have access to those records. And these systems are totally opaque to the user,” Gropper said.This already is a big problem for the industry. Last year, fraudsters pulled off the largest healthcare hack in history on Anthem, exposing more than 78 million customers. And in March, MedStar Systems, a clinical information system of 10 hospitals was hacked and had to take its system offline.This is a situation that’s likely to continue, since some estimates show healthcare data is almost 100 times more valuable than stolen credit card information.“The only hope for actually managing this kind of personal-level information is to distribute it back out to a diverse group of holders, and blockchain is going to play a central role in this,” said Gropper, who is building a patient-centered health record platform on blockchain technology called HIE of One.In his mind, the blockchain acts as storage for identity data, a hash of a timestamped document and the payment record.Further, he says centralized healthcare databases should be smaller, housing only the records only one doctor or maybe one community. Transfer of data is in the hands of patients, with HIE of One using User-Managed Access (UMA) as its access control standard.Lofty ambitions aside, the healthcare industry looks likely to take its time in experimenting and implementing the technology.In place of a large disruption is likely to be a cautious, piecemeal approach that might arguably be the safer, preferable option for the aspects of healthcare that may adopt blockchain applications over time.Rose argued that, in this light, technology solutions also need to take a backseat to patient security, which he said remains the industry’s core mandate.He explained:Doctor image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Healthcare, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Oct 22, 2016 at 12:16 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/10/16/a-pitch-perfect-illustration-of-blockchain-hype/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/jWlkdCRWe9Y9aAP0Sy47pR0VN2w\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/3DWVEOHVRBDDHN4ICPHRJAZU5Y.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"A Pitch Perfect Illustration of Blockchain Hype","INTRO":"Craig Pirrong takes a hard look at the hype surrounding blockchain technology and finds that it isn\u0027t necessarily justified.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Craig Pirrong is Professor of Finance and Energy Markets Director of the Global Energy Management Institute at the Bauer College of Business, University of Houston. He has a PhD in Business Economics from the Graduate School of Business at the University of Chicago.In this opinion piece, Pirrong takes a hard look at the hype surrounding blockchain technology and finds that it isn\u0027t necessarily justified.If you’ve been paying the slightest attention to financial markets lately, you’ll know that blockchain is The New Big Thing. Entrepreneurs and incumbent financial behemoths alike are claiming it will transform every aspect of financial markets.The techno-utopianism makes me extremely skeptical. I will lay out the broader case for my skepticism in a forthcoming post. For now, I will discuss a specific example that illustrates odd combination of cluelessness and hype that characterizes many blockchain initiatives.Titled “Blockchain startup aims to replace clearinghouses,” the article breathlessly describes a post-trade start-up based on hyperledger technology that it says is designed to \"disintermediate central counterparties (CCPs) from the clearing process, effectively removing their role in key areas\".I have often noted that CCPs offer a bundle of many services, and it is possible to considering unbundling some of them. But there are certain core functions of CCP clearing that this blockchain proposal does not offer.Most importantly, CCPs mutualize default risk: this is truly one of the core features of a CCP. This proposal does not, meaning that it provides a fundamentally different service than a CCP.Further, CCPs hedge and manage defaulted positions and port customer positions from a defaulted intermediary to a solvent one: this proposal does not. CCPs also manage liquidity risk. For instance, a defaulter’s collateral may not be immediately convertible into cash to pay winning counterparties, but the CCP maintains liquidity reserves and lines that it can use to intermediate liquidity in these circumstances. The proposal does not. The proposal mentions netting, but I seriously doubt that the blockchain – hyperledger, excuse me – can perform multilateral netting like a CCP.There are other issues. Who sets the margin levels? Who sets the daily (or intraday) marks which determine variation margin flows and margin calls to top up IM? CCPs do that. Who does it for the hyper ledger?So the proposal does some of the same things as a CCP, but not all of them, and in fact omits the most important bits that make central clearing central clearing. To the extent that these other CCP services add value–or regulation compels market participants to utilize a CCP that offers these services–market participants will choose to use a CCP, rather than this service. It is not a perfect substitute for central clearing, and will not disintermediate central clearing in cases where the services it does not offer and the functions it does not perform are demanded by market participants, or by regulators.The co-founder says “[c]entral clearing is turned into distributed clearing.” Er, “distributed clearing”– AKA “bilateral OTC market.”What is being proposed here is not something really new; it is an application of a new technology to a very old, and very common, way of transacting. And by its nature, such a distributed, bilateral system cannot perform some functions that inherently require multilateral cooperation and centralization.This illustrates one of my general gripes about blockchain hype: blockchain evangelists often claim to offer something new and revolutionary but what they actually describe often involves reinventing the wheel. Maybe this wheel has advantages over existing wheels, but it’s still a wheel.Furthermore, I would point out that this wheel may have some serious disadvantages as compared to existing wheels, namely, the bilateral OTC market as we know it. In some respects, it introduces one of the most dangerous features of central clearing into the bilateral market. (Hat tip to Izabella Kaminska for pointing this out.)Specifically, as I’ve been going on about for about eight years now, the rigid variation margining mechanism inherent in central clearing creates a tight coupling that can lead to catastrophic failure. Operational or financial delays that prevent timely payment of variation margin can force the CCP into default, or force it or its members to take extraordinary measures to access liquidity during times when liquidity is tight. Everything in a cleared system has to perform like clockwork, or an entire CCP can fail. Even slight delays in receiving payments during periods of market stress (when large variation margin flows occur) can bring down a CCP.In contrast, there is more play in traditional bilateral contracting. It is not nearly so tightly coupled. One party not making a margin call at the precise time does not threaten to bring down the entire system. Furthermore, in the bilateral world, the “FU Option” is often quite systemically stabilizing. During the lead up to the crisis, arguments over marks could stretch on for days and sometimes weeks, giving some breathing room to stump up the cash to meet margin calls, and to negotiate down the size of the calls.The “smart contracts” aspect of the blockchain proposal jettisons that. Everything is written in the code, the code is the last word, and will be self-executing. This will almost certainly create tight coupling: The Market has moved by X; contract says that means party A has to pay Party B Y by 0800 tomorrow or A is in default. (One could imagine writing really, really smart contracts that embed various conditions that mimic the flexibility and play in face-to-face bilateral markets, but color me skeptical–and this conditionality will create other issues, as I’ll discuss in the future post.)When I think of these “smart contracts” one image that comes to mind is the magic broomsticks in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice. They do EXACTLY what they are commanded to do by the apprentice (coder?): they tote water, and end up toting so much water that a flood ensues. There is no feedback mechanism to get them to stop when the water gets too high. Again, perhaps it is possible to create really, really smart contracts that embed such feedback mechanisms.But then one has to consider the potential interactions among a dense network of such really, really smart contracts. How do the feedbacks feed back on one another? Simple agent models show that agents operating subject to pre-programmed rules can generate complex, emergent orders when they interact. Sometimes these orders can be quite efficient. Sometimes they can crash and collapse.In sum, the proposal for “distributed clearing to disintermediate CCPs” illustrates some of the defects of the blockchain movement. It overhypes what it does. It claims to be something new, when really it is a somewhat new way of doing something quite common. It does not necessarily perform these familiar functions better. It does not consider the systemic implications of what it does.So why is there so much hype? Well, why was Pets.com a thing? More seriously, I think that there is an interesting sociological dynamic here. All the cool kids are talking about blockchain, and nobody wants to admit to not being cool. Further, when a critical mass of supposed thought leaders are doing something, others imitate for fear of being left behind: if you join and it turns out to be flop, well, you don’t stand out–everybody, including the smartest people, screwed up. You’re in good company! But if you don’t join and it becomes a hit, you look like a Luddite idiot and get left behind. So there is a bias towards joining the fad/jumping on the bandwagon.I think there will be a role for blockchain. But I also believe that it will not be nearly as revolutionary as its most ardent proponents claim. And I am damn certain that it is not going to disintermediate central clearing, both because central clearing does some things “decentralized clearing” doesn’t (duh!), and because regulators like those things and are forcing their use.This article was previously published on the author\u0027s blog and has been republished here with permission.

Whereas the traditional venture capital industry is boring, the crypto-tech industry has become more exciting.Actually, I see the two models as diametrically opposed: one is a closed market, dominated by command-and-control practices, led by a few rich people on Sand Hill Road. The other is a widely open global market where anyone can play, and where the gains and risks are more evenly distributed.This has led to a re-thinking of how startups who are operating in the blockchain space can raise money, and it has potential implications that will revamp the relationships that venture capital firms can hope to strike with these startups.As an investor, advisor or board member, I have been closely associated with a variety of early stage companies that are tackling the innovation explosion around cryptocurrency and blockchain-based models, and have had the fortunate insights of seeing where we might be headed.The upcoming shifts are encapsulated in the following table, covering nine variables.Return horizon: Whereas the return horizon for traditional VC funds is squarely in the 7-10 year horizon, we are currently at the beginning of an inflection point in cryptocurrency-led valuations, resulting in much shorter liquidity options for early investors, in the 1-5 year range.Ownership model: Traditionally, VCs receive preferred shares by buying private equity. With the new models, they can acquire shares and/or tokens/cryptocurrency that have been issued by the startup.Entry phases: Angel, Seed, Early to Late Stages (A-F) are the known trajectories for conventional startup investments. The new continuum has another progression lingo with it: pre-mine, genesis, initial cryptocurrency offering (ICO), listing on an exchange, or private sale of crypto-tokens directly from the company.Business model: A traditional startup is typically focused on developing and marketing a tangible product or service. A blockchain-based startup could have a product/service as part of what they are developing, but their stride is best hit when they are also creating a self-sustaining circular economy that is supported by their own currency or tokens, and where there is a transactional loop between earning and spending these tokens within their ecosystem.Legal structure: Startups typically incorporate as a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC) or any other traditional way according to the corporate laws in their given jurisdiction. In the new environment, the LLC could be creating a base open source technology/protocol, but they will run a proprietary separate business on top of it or adjacent to it (e.g. IPFS and Filecoin), or they could create a valuable ecosystem around it (e.g. Ethereum). In extreme cases, the organization is non-registered and operates as a distributed autonomous organization on the blockchain (e.g. BitNation).Limited partners mix: The same traditional mix of institutional, high net worth individuals, family offices and funds of funds that typically invest in venture capital funds will be attracted to this emerging segment, only if they are progressive, innovative and forward-thinking, with the ability to allocate discretionary funds under strategic considerations pretexts. In addition, given the more relaxed crowdfunding rules that exist in several jurisdictions around the world, a new venture fund could also get a mix of participation from a publicly crowdsourced segment of investors.Fund currency: In addition to fiat currency, a new VC fund could also accept cryptocurrency (especially from the crowdsourced segment), because of the frictionless capabilities that exist for accepting cryptocurrencies online. However, it would be prudent to immediately convert these funds into fiat as the initial reference currency for investment vehicles, in order to avoid being caught in cryptocurrency value downturns, and to remove any perceived intent of currency speculation which is outside the mandate of a venture capital fund.Market approach: The best candidates for this new model will be blockchain startups that are purposely creating new business models, and not supporting existing ones. The reason is that these new business models are more fertile grounds for innovative circular economies, new ecosystems, and new value creation, which are important conditions for success.The nature of blockchain startups is changing, and this change should be accompanied by an evolution on how they are funded.A new VC fund with the above characteristics has the luxury of having no baggage within an existing Limited Partners Agreement (LPA) where changes may be hard fought. Instead, these elements would be baked as part of the initial LPA, while properly addressing the legal and compliance considerations.Business startup image via ShutterstockThis article was previously published on the author\u0027s blog and has been republished here with permission.Author\u0027s disclaimer: In no way does this article represent an offer to sell securities or an advertisement of raising a new fund.

Stringent rules regarding collecting, storing and sharing customer data add layers of rigorous validation, verification and internal sign-off on top of the regulatory approval.Even though many regulators are actively supporting banks in exploring blockchain, this is simply not an environment geared to early adoption in the wild.The fact that banks are coping with dwindling IT budgets, as well as heavy legacy IT investment, is an obstacle as well. As to an extent are legacy mindsets: The financial industry is heavily invested in centralized models; blockchain represents the opposite worldview.We believe blockchain will be implemented first in more lightly regulated sectors, particularly those which face challenges in managing data access control and ensuring data integrity. This can be sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) such as healthcare records, competitive secrets or other internal corporate data. Or it could be intellectual property, as with managing copyright for music or art.Areas poised for takeoff include e-government, supply chain management and finance, insurance, real estate and the Internet of Things. BHP Billiton’s announcement last week that it was using blockchain to improve its supply chain processes is a perfect example of how this is already happening.At Credits, Nick has been observing this trend closely too. The company has been exploring a number of use cases outside of financial services, such as proof of identity, procurement processes, and interdepartmental payments. It recently worked with a client on a corporate identity blockchain solution.Credits has also been very active in e-government, where blockchain has the potential to inject trust and accountability into many processes. This includes providing means to share sensitive personal data between departments that prevents data leaks while still allowing for data integrity checks.The good news for banks is that many of the non-financial use cases also provide compelling first customers for the eventual financial ones. If we can solve supply chain management, for example, than we are not far from solving supply chain finance.So while we may not see distributed ledgers taking over in financial services right away, that shouldn’t be interpreted as meaning it will never happen.When it comes to blockchain and banks, there is no escaping destiny.This article was originally published at FinTech Pulse, Oliver\u0027s blog featuring megatrends, digital transformation and innovation in the FinTech industry.

In such cases, banks will end up using distributed ledgers that are just databases, instead of true blockchains.The CEO further delved into the history of the space and its current terminology, saying at one point that venture capitalists that had invested in bitcoin wanted to get the banks on board.Considering that bitcoin was ‘tainted’ in the media thanks to its associations with drugs and hacking, the venture capitalists apparently pitched the banks on the use of blockchain. The \"buy\" side became interested in blockchain technology after Blythe Masters and her firm Digital Asset Holdings raised the appeal of the tech with Wall Street institutions.However there is only one blockchain that works at scale, he stressed, and that is bitcoin.Looking to the future, Dixon suggested that startups focus their efforts on those applications that have the most utility.When it comes to bitcoin, he said, there are two disparate sections of populations that will find the most value going forward.On the one hand there are the ultra-wealthy, who invest in bitcoin as a hedge against bank deposits, therefore utilizing bitcoin as a store of value. On the other, are the poorest four billion or so of the world population who are underserved by the current banking system and could use bitcoin as a means of value transmission in applications like remittances.However, the first wave of bitcoin startups, like payment processor Bitpay, largely targeted the middle sector of the population, which is neither ultra-wealthy nor unbanked, he said.This segment of the population didn’t have a compelling case to use bitcoin for everyday transactions, and so the tech failed to really take off, even after gaining initial traction. Now, Dixon said, his company is investing in startups that cater to either end of the spectrum, and avoiding the middle.Moving on, Dixon said the interest of central banks in issuing digital currencies is a radical change in the relationship between central bank, money, and the financial industry.Such digital currencies, that don’t need to rely on a blockchain, would be issued directly by the central banks without involving the banking system, and would not be backed by debt.Digital currencies issued by a central bank would represent a way to reduce systemic risk in the financial sector and are likely to become more prominent during financial crises, he said. Investors would then be able to transact directly with central bank-issued digital currencies and bitcoin, thus cutting out the wider banking sector altogether.Addressing other use cases that are traditionally touted by the financial industry as requiring private blockchains, Dixon believes most such instances could be addressed using traditional or distributed databases rather than blockchains.Further, many such problems are not really technological problems, he suggested – for example, the hurdle to overcome when bringing about instant settlement of payments is a \"compliance problem\" rather than a technical one.Chess image via Shutterstock.

A search for “blockchain” on the US Patent and Trademark Office website brings up 60 hits, whereas looking up “bitcoin” highlights more than 500 pending patents.“But it remains to be seen whose claim will be allowed or issued,” Mlynar said.One problem with the claimsthe two Hogan Lovells partners have seen is that the applications themselves are considerably broad. The Alice Corp Pty Ltd vs CLS Bank Int’l court decision – which singled out financial business methods as abstract concepts that are not likely patentable – means that patent examiners will be taking a stern look at the claims.Plus, any patent filed after the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), which was signed into law in 2011, will be answerable to a post grant review. This allows anyone to oppose the validity of the claim within the first nine months of its issuing, which the two Hogan Lovells partners think will make keeping a blockchain patent difficult.“All of these are new tools in any kind of patent litigation war, for those who have patents or those who are fighting for patents,” said Schaefer.And this process of narrowing down the scope of blockchain patents and the impending patent war will likely take several years, according to Mlynar.But Geoff Cohen, PhD, vice president of digital forensics at Stroz Friedberg in Boston, isn’t so sure.“The only reason we haven’t seen it yet for all the talk and hype ... is that [blockchain] hasn’t turned into huge profits for anybody yet,” Cohen said. “On an industrial economic scale you don’t have standing companies making huge steady profits over the course of multiple years.”That state of affairs might be right around the corner, however. Several startups and large financial institutions have stoked excitement about the prospect of a commercial launch of their respective blockchain products late this year or early next.As companies both big and small gear up to launch profit-making products, they’re also gearing up to go to patent war.Patent litigation, at its simplest, generally goes one of two ways, said Cohen. In once instance, a patent-holding small startup might go after a large corporation knowing it’ll get a sizeable payout from the corporation.Under the other scenario, a large incumbent player might launch a lawsuit against smaller companies in an effort to effectively tax the competition by way of court expenses. Sometimes, these efforts even put those on the receiving end of a patent lawsuit out of business entirely.“It’s an investment decision for the startups,” Cohen said. “For large corporates, sometimes they sue for strategic reasons.”There’s already been a hint of the latter in the blockchain space already, although via trademark infringement. Eris Exchange, an over-the-counter futures market is trying to stop Eris Industries, a well-known blockchain software startup, from using the name.What’s particularly interesting about the case, according to a report by American Banker, is that Eris Exchange’s founder and board member, Don Wilson, is also the co-founder and a board member of Digital Asset Holdings, the competing blockchain startup led by Blythe Masters, a former JPMorgan Chase executive. However, it’s unclear whether there is a direct connection.Another soon-to-be plaintiff could be Dell Products LP. The company published an application for computing device configuration and management using a secure decentralized transaction ledger. The patent is a continuation of one the company applied for in March 2015. If that patent is issued, the incumbent company could go after smaller startups using the same process.But bitcoin and blockchain startups are also securing their stake. For example, Coinbase has about 10 patent applications waiting in the wings.Cohen has some first-hand experience with these issues. His background lies in computer science, but he spent the past 10 years consulting on high-stake, high-tech litigation for Stroz Friedberg. Specifically, he and his team worked through many smartphone patent cases between 2010 and 2013.One threat Cohen has seen and is worried might affect the blockchain industry is that large companies, which perceive that they have monopoly of sorts being undermined by small startups trying to offer the same kind of service, will move to stifle any possible competition. In many instances, the larger company will dredge up past patents, sometimes for products that never went to market, in order to wage war against another firm.“Big companies tend to have big portfolios of thousands of patents that they can generally find something that relates,” Cohen said.But Schafer and Mlynar aren’t so sure. They haven’t seen any large institutions getting issued handfuls of blockchain-related patents. Although, they agree many companies get patents for defensive measures.“There are a lot of strategies for patent enforcement, mainly someone has economic interests that they are trying to advance, a business that you are trying to protect, so you can use patents to clear out competition,” Mlynar said. “But the blockchain needs multiple participants so … you risk public censure.”Plus, patents are typically issued on 20-year timelines and can be used to sue for infringement and damages going back six years with injunction against further or future use.“That’s why patents are so valuable,” said Schaefer.Of course, you can’t explore the idea of blockchain patents without touching on Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin. History suggests that Nakamoto must be more aligned with the open-source community than patent-hungry corporations, since he/she/they did not apply for a bitcoin patent in 2009.And, since the invention itself has been used in the public for more than a year, any creator would be barred from patenting it at this point.That time limit is what is interesting about Craig Wright’s patent assertions after claiming he was Satoshi Nakamoto earlier this year. Cohen assumes that Wright’s patent applications are likely about trying to make some money off his now infamous reputation.“Once something has become public information there’s not a whole lot you can do to reverse that; that’s not fair to the general commonwealth,” Cohen said. “There’s public interest in saying if you’ve let it out in the public for a year, you’ve missed your window.”It’s because of this that the industry is unlikely to see any foundational patents actually being issued.While patent issuance can sometimes take several years, it’s not likely that someone has a foundational patent on bitcoin that hasn’t been realized – one in which anyone that’s operating in bitcoin might then have to pay a tax to the patent holder.The more plausible scenario, according to Cohen, is that people will obtain patents for specific applications or uses cases for bitcoin or other blockchains. For example, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) just issued a patent for a method of analyzing transactions on a distributed ledger.However, it’s also unclear how narrowly or broadly the scope of those patents will be interpreted.“There will not likely be a patent for all uses of the blockchain or of distributed ledger. Instead they’ll be very specific,” Cohen said.Even more worrisome than the back-and-forth between incumbents and startups could be the patent trolls, or, as Cohen politely put it, the patent assertion entities (PAEs).PAEs like Intellectual Ventures or Acacia Research Corporation buy up portfolios of patents and keep them on the sidelines until they see an opportunity to make money on either litigation or a licensing campaign.“I would be surprised if these companies didn’t have some patents in the bitcoin/blockchain field or the money to buy up a company that does have those patents,” Cohen said. “The better funded these [bitcoin/blockchain startup] companies are and the more profit they’re making, the more the patent world is going to start circling around and looking for a target.”Plus, abstract patents that are applied to new technology, sometimes called \u0027submarine patents\u0027, are going to make these threats hard to see in advance.Yet for all the gloom and doom, according to Cohen, there are ways to protect the technology. It’s something that will require the community to come together to protect businesses from the threat of licensing fees and patent litigation, he said.For instance, when a large corporate starts suing smaller companies over patents, those small firms will generally work on their own to fight the lawsuit. However, if all of those businesses came together to hire a law firm to defend them all, they might have a better chance at continuing business and fending off the suit.“The more coordination and collective action there can be, the more efficient the response is,” Cohen said.Tug of war image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Patents, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 24, 2016 at 12:40 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/09/21/blockchain-smart-contracts-need-a-new-kind-of-due-diligence/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Mkp1VDtCm3u8CQMVv0Q3LJbtM14\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/GGYWAGS3SJCB5FLPJ3W5JJUVAU.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain Smart Contracts Need a New Kind of Due Diligence","INTRO":"Two legal experts argue that we need enhanced due diligence before smart contract transactions are written in \"blockchain stone\".","DETAILED_CONTENT":"More than 20 years ago, Nick Szabo proposed the use of a \u0027smart contract\u0027 to reduce fraud and enforcement costs associated with traditional paper contracts. His smart contract would be implemented as a “computerized transaction protocol that executes the terms of a contract” – in other words, a computer program.Like any other software, a \u0027smart contract\u0027 computer program would receive inputs, run a series of program steps, and supply outputs. For example, the smart contract could wait for a predetermined condition to occur (eg: a stock reaches a particular price), automatically deem the terms of the contract met, and trigger a predetermined series of performance steps (eg: a payment) that would be automatically carried out. Well ahead of its time, the idea did not catch on.Fast forward now to 2016. Blockchains abound, and there is renewed interest in smart contracts, particularly with decentralized contract execution: smart contracts on the blockchain.The bitcoin blockchain has been running since 2009 but, despite various efforts, does not appear to lend itself to convenient implementation of smart contracts. By contrast, the original ethereum blockchain, announced in 2014 and launched in 2015, was specifically designed to allow the implementation of smart contracts.Since the launch, smart contracts began to proliferate in the ethereum ecosystem. However, the future immutability of ethereum smart contracts is uncertain after the widely publicized ethereum “hard fork”. The existing ether effectively became “E[i]ther” – ether classic (ETC) and *new* ether (ETH) – leaving market forces to determine whether either, or both, will survive.The ethereum system, like bitcoin, associates ownership of currency (ether) with an address. Unlike bitcoin however, ethereum also provides an address for executable contract code that runs on the blockchain. When the contract address receives a suitable message from a user or another contract, the code is executed. Ethereum smart contracts are stored on the blockchain and executed on “ethereum virtual machines” (EVMs) by self-selected computer nodes, commonly known as “miners\". Those nodes perform the processing needed to execute the corresponding program steps. For a fee, of course.The processing fee for each ethereum smart contract is proportional to its complexity and use of computing resources. By charging a proportional fee, resource-intensive misuse of the ethereum system is discouraged.But overuse of ethereum resources is not the only type of misuse possible. A recent paper noted that among the roughly 19,000 ethereum smart contracts studied, 44% contained vulnerabilities. As smart contract code was copied over and over again, and flawed drafting techniques were repeated, error-filled code propagated. Old, flawed code apparently became the unsteady foundation for towering new smart contracts.As we are all painfully aware, software bugs and system vulnerabilities are nothing new. The most popular operating systems and application software are “updated” frequently. And more bugs are found all the time. The typical software license agreement includes years of “free” updates.As a software consumer, your “due diligence” is fairly straightforward because an error correction process is built into the software license. When (and not if) something goes wrong, you have some hope that someone is trying to solve the problem.But smart contracts are not ordinary software. A smart contract is supposed to automatically implement a real-life contract: an actual agreement between two (or more) parties. After the negotiating parties agree to the terms of a deal, those terms are converted into a smart contract – eg: given to a computer programmer to create smart contract code. So how do the parties know if the terms agreed upon were correctly programmed?Moreover, if a smart contract is stored on an immutable blockchain then, by definition, its stored program code does not change. The certainty that results from such permanence becomes a valuable feature. But that certainty also means that immutable smart contracts lack traditional error correction capabilities. The program code implementing the smart contract cannot readily be debugged after being stored on an immutable blockchain. Any errors or vulnerabilities are set in \u0027blockchain stone\u0027.A smart contract needs to be error-free, error-tolerant or, in at least some way, correctable. Relying on “form” contracts is no guarantee of safety – especially not for smart contracts. Old, buggy software certainly can be exploited and has been to great effect. Look at The DAO hack. A reported $50m-plus of ether was diverted due to a smart contract vulnerability.There needs to be a new kind of due diligence for this new kind of contract. Smart contracts blend law and computer science. The due diligence on smart contracts should do the same.What due diligence is needed for a smart contract?A traditional analysis of the proposed transaction and the negotiated contract terms should identify practical and legal issues. A source code analysis should identify flaws in programming the smart contract before it is compiled.In addition, the proposed smart contract should be run on a simulator to see how it operates in response to expected and unexpected messages from users and other contracts. Both the legal issues and the programming issues can then be addressed together. Expected and unexpected contingencies can be identified, evaluated, and mitigated.To the dismay of some, using smart contracts on a blockchain won’t eliminate the need for lawyers. More likely it will just change what the lawyers need to do.We predict this new type of due diligence will bring together specialized transactional lawyers who can review the terms of a specific deal, software experts who can analyze smart contract program code and its operation on the blockchain, and \u0027smart contract\u0027 lawyers who can bridge the gap between the two.Obviously, the due diligence team should be engaged well before a smart contract is added to the blockchain – even before the underlying deal is negotiated – to help avoid foreseeable mistakes. By conducting this new type of due diligence with the proper team, smart contracting parties can have much more confidence in achieving their intended results.More rigorous smart contract due diligence may finally bring some peace of mind.Auditing image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, smart contracts, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/09/17/the-upside-of-the-internet-defending-bitcoins-downside/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/vbQ_3zKn8WX9H4f6US6STCBcPpw\u003d/570x396/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/FXUYLDOHCNG5RJUQ6D5KJYSBZM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The Upside of the Internet: Defending Bitcoin\u0027s \u0027Downside\u0027","INTRO":"BlockCypher\u0027s Josh Cincinnati critiques a recent NYTimes article that suggested bitcoin\u0027s immutable ledger of transactions is its weakness.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Like any good cryptocurrency adherent, in my romping around social media I was unsurprised to find yet-another-grossly-misrepresented-hit-piece on bitcoin. But this one sure was fancy. Op-ed in the NYTimes, you say? Group chief executive (?) for financial services from a major consulting firm? Wow. Must be a hard-hitting, well-researched, incisive look at the downsides of cryptocurrency. I clicked the link.And then I read the goddamn title.Downside of Bitcoin: A Ledger That Can\u0027t Be CorrectedSigh. You’d think the author would have relented after writing The Downside of Transistors: Miniaturization or The Downside of the Internet: Worldwide Two-Way Connectivity, but I guess you can’t fault the symmetry. (Note: he didn’t actually write those, but is it really such a stretch?)Because guess what the upsides of bitcoin are? The fact that it can’t be corrected; that it’s immutable. And that you don’t need anyone’s permission to use it.For posterity’s sake  –  and because I haven’t written anything quite this biting in a while and I miss it –  I’ve cherry-picked a few passages where I felt a deep need to Accensure.Let’s start with the first paragraph:Nothing to really argue about here, but spoiler alert: the elephant is willful ignorance, doubly ironic given the relative intelligence of elephants in the animal kingdom.This is –  remarkably  –  correct. Maybe we were wrong, dear reader! Let’s just keep reading and…Ah, there we are! There’s the piping-hot absurdity, fresh out of a convection oven powered by the hot air of blockchain hype.Let’s consider what “clash[es] with new privacy laws like the right to be forgotten”.I’m not sure how the hell a pseudonymous system of transferring value has anything to do with the “right to be forgotten”, especially when one considers privacy-enabling technologies like Zcash and MimbleWimble (amongst others) that would make it practically impossible to associate real-world identity with cryptocurrency movement.But let’s assume, for a beautiful moment of dissociative cognition, that somehow, for reasons only top consultants can divine, having an immutable record of pseudonymous money transfers violates these laws.Maybe these laws aren’t a good idea in the first place, since they can have a chilling effect on free speech and enable the whitewashing of history.Instead should we endeavor to create a more privacy-protecting Internet from the ground up? Where citizens can confidently share information with cryptographic assurances that it only reaches the intended parties, or investing in homomorphic encryption to enable cloud services where providers have zero access to the information you provide to them for computation? Surely you can still make money off consulting those services, Accenture?The last company to value “simply striking things from the record” over “pristine accounting” was Enron.The article makes an oblique critique of bitcoin\u0027s technology, assuming an old worldview. One where providers will know what their customers are putting into blockchains.That’s –  surprise surprise –  silly and pointless. When you interact with bitcoin, you don’t sign up for an account while your personal credit history is checked and uploaded into a “central Bitcoin KYC repository.”Remember that a key tenet of what makes a blockchain special is its permissionless usage. You know how you can accept money on bitcoin? You generate a private-public key pair. Could do the process completely offline if you’d like.So repeat after me: I will not put sensitive, non-cryptographically-sealed information into a public blockchain. You don’t embed your social security number into a bitcoin OP_RETURN and then say, “Oops, please delete that.” You don’t embed sensitive customer data into a public blockchain like a private database, because it’s not a private database.Whoops, I guess a blockchain is a private database – if you can amend or redact it, by writ of some authority. Let me rewrite this paragraph:We need the means to solve this challenge, while neutering what makes a blockchain special. At Accenture, we’re working with leading academics on a database that can be amended or redacted where necessary — under responsible governance models potentially developed in cooperation with regulators. It’s a database, but spelled b-l-o-c-k-c-h-a-i-n.And finally:Who wants to move beyond cryptocurrency? The outstanding value of all bitcoin has reached close to ~$10bn as of this writing, with ether at a close ~$1bn. Public blockchains are already profitable deployments.Fundamentally, I believe the author is dreadfully confused, or  – perhaps more likely  –  was running an A-B test with his paid NYTimes Op-Ed advert and I was unlucky enough to catch the B-side. In the corrected version, I hope he reminds readers that “conventional orthodoxy” is relying on a mutable database and trusted parties for financial transactions. Challenging it is bitcoin.This article was originally published on the author\u0027s Medium blog and has been reproduced here with permission.

The truth is that our economies, our institutions, are not just merely created by man, but regulated, maintained, altered, manipulated and changed by man, for better or for worse, whether sought or unsought.This is to say that no such economy or its participants are immune from human imperfection.One word that represents an immutable standard in a successful free-market economic system, is trust. But what is it that must be trusted? A proprietor, a merchant, or a bank? The economy itself? The ability to prevent or allow interference?We place our assets and transact with these \"trusted\" participants through reputations, relationships and experience. This trust is not to be assumed, for bad fortune may surface for those who do.What if there was a solution to eliminate trust as a requirement for transacting safely in a free-market economy? One that has an inalienable set of rules, similar to the constitutional rights of American citizens.We need a \"trustless\" system.Ever since bitcoin disrupted many of our lives, its underlying technology, the blockchain has awakened sleeping giants from big finance to governments around the world.Now, they are racing to develop and evolve their \u0027pre-Internet\u0027, \u0027pre-mobile\u0027 infrastructure to this new \u0027trustless\u0027 standard. Blockchain technology is the database of the future, and the future is now.How can I make this assertion? Well, a blockchain is a ledger of information that is digitally recorded. These records of information are stored in \u0027blocks\u0027 that form a chain. The information in every block is secured using cryptographic hashes, and are added in linear fashion upon the previous block. This prevents information in the ledger (the blockchain) from being altered, ensuring trust and transparency is maintained.While mainstream outlets continue a negative narrative, they aren\u0027t telling you how important the blockchain is.Every major bank and stock market operator is currently looking to employ or developing technologies centered around blockchain tech as you read this. But the applications go beyond finance. Bitcoin and ethereum have proven to be the most successful applications of such technology, with the latter being centered around the digitization and execution of agreements through the implementation of smart contracts – the digitization of law.While brainstorming alternative applications for blockchain technology, the possibilities become endless.Most if not all \u0027pre-Internet\u0027, \u0027pre-mobile\u0027 infrastructure providers should adopt such technology, as it is cheaper, faster and more secure than the current technologies that precede it.Imagine if you could own your own medical record? Your credit history? Have your country’s voting system protected by a blockchain? Or even eliminate the headache of a tax audit by providing the authorities with your unalterable ledger of information in token format?Imagine a world today, analogous to the pre-9/11 intelligence community, where many redundant operations are going on, resources are wasted and the hoarding of intelligence prevents action, namely due to the lack of information sharing.Imagine using a system to \u0027share info, without sharing info\u0027.For example, the credit card companies, banks, payment processors, etc, do not share as much information with each other as they should. Such a system would enable them to share certain data without revealing specifics about customers or vendors – essentially metadata, that could assist with many of the challenges currently present in those industries today.\"The combination of economic and political power in the same hands is a sure recipe for tyranny,\" said noted economist Milton Friedman.The blockchain decouples such power and puts it right back where it belongs, with we the people.Collaborative hands image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Economics, Governance, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/09/11/the-trend-towards-blockchain-privacy-zero-knowledge-proofs/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/1t_DyDhRS4qK7YrO8UiWucyVLDQ\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/H36X7BGSLVCRDDU2N3CUKJ7YDE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The Trend Towards Blockchain Privacy: Zero Knowledge Proofs","INTRO":"George Samman, former CMO of Fuzo, looks at how solutions like zero knowledge proofs could preserve privacy on blockchain platforms.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"One of the bigger trends in the blockchain world, particularly when it comes to financial services and specifically capital markets operations, has been a need for privacy and confidentiality in the course of daily business. This has meant that blockchain solutions are being designed with this primary need in mind. This has led to all the private blockchain solutions being developed today.When you build for privacy and confidentiality there are tradeoffs that come with that. Mainly you lose transparency, which was the major feature of the the first blockchain: bitcoin. As originally designed, a blockchain is a transparency machine. In this system, the computers are distributed and no one entity controls the network. Not only this, but anyone can be a validator and anyone can write to or read from the network. Clients and validators can be anonymous and all the data gets stored locally in every node (replication). This makes all transaction data public.The security of bitcoin is made possible by a verification process in which all participants can individually and autonomously validate transactions. While bitcoin addresses the privacy problem by issuing pseudonymous addresses, it is still possible to find out who\u0027s addresses they are through various techniques.This is the polar opposite of what is happening in the private blockchain world, where decentralization and transparency are not deemed as necessary for many capital markets use cases.What is important is privacy and confidentiality, latency (speed) and scalability (able to maintain high performance as more nodes are added to the blockchain). Encrypted node-to-node (n2n) transactions mean only the two parties involved in the transaction receive data. In many of these systems there are opt ins for third party nodes (regulators) to be a part of the transaction.Other systems being developed for similar purposes, which have been written about on this blog, have one designated block generator which collects and validates proposed transactions, periodically batching them together into a new-block proposal. Consensus is provided by a Generator that applies rules (validates) agreed to by the nodes (chain cores) to the block and designated block signers.In these systems, decentralization is simply not necessary because all the nodes are known parties. In private blockchains the nodes must be known in order to satisfy certain regulatory and compliance requirements. The focus has been on how to preserve privacy and confidentiality while achieving speed, scalability, and network stability. Therefore, there are ways for legal recourse even between parties who don\u0027t necessarily trust each other.What are cryptography and encryption?As noted above with privacy and confidentiality being pivotal, encryption has become a major focus for all blockchains. Many of these solutions are using advanced cryptographic techniques that provide strong mathematically provable guarantees for the privacy of data and transactions.In a recent blog post titled \"A Gentle Reminder About Encryption\" by Kathleen Breitman of R3CEV, she succinctly provides a great working definition:\"Encryption refers to the operation of disguising plaintext, information to be concealed. The set of rules to encrypt the text is called the encryption algorithm. The operation of an algorithm depends on the encryption key, or an input to the algorithm with the message. For a user to obtain a message from the output of an algorithm, there must be a decryption algorithm which, when used with a decryption key, reproduces the plaintext.\"If this encryption uses ciphertext to decrypt this plaintext, you get homomorphic encryption and this (combined with digital signature techniques) is the basis for the cryptographic techniques which will be discussed in this post. Homomorphic encryption allows for computations to be done on encrypted data without first having to decrypt it. In other words, this technique allows the privacy of the data/transaction to be preserved while computations are performed on it, without revealing that data/transaction. Only those with decrypt keys can access what exactly that data/transaction was.Homomorphic encryption means that decrypt(encrypt(A) + encrypt(B)) \u003d\u003d A+B. This is known as homomorphic under addition.So a computation performed on the encrypted data when decrypted is equal to a computation performed on the encrypted data.The key question being asked is: How can you convince a system of a change of state without revealing too much information?After all, blockchains want to share a (change of) state; not information. On a blockchain, some business process is at state X and now moves to state Y, this needs to be recorded and proved while preserving privacy and not sharing a lot of information. Furthermore, this change of state needs to happen legally, otherwise there is a privacy breach.Cryptographic techniques like zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs), which use different types of homomorphic encryption, separate:1) reaching a conclusion on a state of affairs2) the information needed to reach that state of affairs3) show that that state is valid.The rest of this post will discuss how the trend towards privacy has led to cryptographic techniques, some old and some new, being used to encrypt transactions and the data associated with them from everyone except the parties involved. The focus will be on Zero Knowledge Proofs, zk SNARKs, Hawk, confidential signatures, state channels and homomorphic encryption.The privacy problem on a blockchain is the main gap for deployment for all of the cryptographic solutions talked about below.Outside of a blockchain, there are examples of homomorphic encryption in practice. CryptDB is an example of system that uses homomorphic encryption and other attribute preserving encryption techniques to query databases securely. It is used in production at Google and Microsoft amongst other places.It does have limitations though: you have to define the kinds of queries you want ahead of time and it is easy to leak data. CryptDB provides confidentiality for data content and for names of columns and tables; however CryptDB does not hide the overall table structure, the number of rows, the types of columns, or the approximate size of data in bytes. One method CryptDB uses to encrypt each data items is by onioning. This allows each data item to be placed in layers of increasingly stronger encryption.Gregory Maxwell designed a cryptographic tool (CT) to improve the privacy and security of bitcoin-style blockchains. It keeps the amounts transferred visible only to participants in the transaction. CT\u0027s make the transaction amounts and balances private on a blockchain through encryption, specifically additively homomorphic encryption. What users can see is is the balances of their own accounts and transactions that they are receiving. Zero knowledge proofs are needed to demonstrate to the blockchain that none of the encrypted outputs contain a negative value.The problem with Confidential Transactions is that they only allow for very limited proofs as mentioned above. zkSNARKs and Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) which will be described in detail below, allow you to prove virtually any kinds of transaction validation while keeping all inputs private.A zero-knowledge proof must satisfy three properties:The first two of these are properties of more general interactive proof systems. The third is what makes the proof zero-knowledge.\"A zk-SNARK (zero-knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) is a Zero Knowledge proof that is a way to prove some computational fact about data without revealing the data. Zk-SNARKs are the underlying cryptographic tool used in Zcash and Hawk both of which are building blockchains with ZKPs and both will be explained later. In the case of Zcash these SNARKs are used for verifying transactions and in the case of Hawk they are used for verifying smart contracts. This is done while still protecting users privacy.A zk-SNARK is a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge that is succinct and for which proofs are very short and easy to verify. They can be thought of as little logic circuits that need to generate a proof of statement to verify each and every transaction. They do this by taking a snapshot of of each transaction, generate a proof and then need to convince the receiving side that the calculation was done correctly without revealing any data except the proof itself. The basic operation of a SNARK execution is a coded input into this circuit which can be decrypted.Since zk-SNARKs can be verified quickly, and the proofs are small, they can protect the integrity of the computation without burdening non-participants. It should be noted that this technology is just now starting to mature but still has limitations. They are very CPU intensive to generate proofs and it takes up to 1 minute to generate new proofs, so scaling is still an issue that needs to be resolved.The very first data points for zk-SNARKs will be Zcash which is a combo of distributed state and proof that you own the assets.Zcash can be described as an encrypted open, permissionless, replicated ledger. A cryptographic protocol for putting private data on a public blockchain. Zcash can be thought of as an extension of the bitcoin protocol. Basically Zcash added some fields to the bitcoin transaction format to support encrypted transactions.Zcash uses SNARKs (ZKPs) to encrypt all of the data and only gives decryption keys to authorized parties to see that data. This could not be done on a public blockchain until now because if you encrypted everything in the past it would prevent miners from checking to see if transactions are valid. ZKPs have made this possible by allowing the creator of a transaction to make a proof that the transaction is true without revealing the sender\u0027s address, the receiver\u0027s address and the transaction amount.Zooko describes this by saying bitcoin has 3 columns, which are the three mentioned above (sender address, receiver address, transaction amount) and Zcash has 4. The 4th column proof doesn’t know the sender address, the receiver address and amount transferred, but it does know that nobody could have created the proof that comes with the encrypted values unless they have a secret key which has sufficient value to cover the amount amount being transacted. This is a proof that the data inside the encryption correctly satisfies the validity constructs. This allows the prevention of double spends and transactions of less than zero.Zcash is mostly the same as bitcoin. The miners and full nodes are transaction validators. Zcash uses POW that has miners checking ZKP’s attached to each transaction and getting a reward for validating those transactions. Full nodes are the same except that if you have the private keys you can detect if some transactions have money that is there for you. SNARKs make it so that miners can reject a transaction from someone if their private key doesn’t have enough money for that transaction.By keeping all data private except for the 4th column it omits information from leaking onto a private blockchain which allows for everyone to view information about transactions. zCash has selective transparency while bitcoin has mandatory transparency. This means that Zcash can reveal specific things to specific people by permissioning. It reveals specific transactions that anyone looking at them can verify in the blockchain.Some differences from the zCash whitepaper include:\"Value in Zcash is carried by notes, which specify an amount and a paying key. The paying key is part of a payment address, which is a destination to which notes can be sent. As in Bitcoin, this is associated with a private key that can be used to spend notes sent to the address; in Zcash this is called a spending key.A payment address includes two public keys: a paying key matching that of notes sent to the address, and a transmission key for a key-private asymmetric encryption scheme. “Key-private” means that ciphertexts do not reveal information about which key they were encrypted to, except to a holder of the corresponding private key, which in this context is called the viewing key. This facility is used to communicate encrypted output notes on the block chain to their intended recipient, who can use the viewing key to scan the block chain for notes addressed to them and then decrypt those notes.The basis of the privacy properties of Zcash is that when a note is spent, the spender only proves that some commitment for it had been revealed, without revealing which one. This implies that a spent note cannot be linked to the transaction in which it was created.\"Zcash is what\u0027s known as a decentralized anonymous payment schemes (DAP schemes). A DAP scheme enables users to directly pay each other privately: the corresponding transaction hides the payment’s origin, destination, and transferred amount.In Zcash, transactions are less than 1 kB and take under 6 ms to verify — orders of magnitude more efficient than the less-anonymous Zerocoin and competitive with bitcoin. However the privacy achieved is significantly greater than with bitcoin. De-anonymizing bitcoin has become much easier through services that track and monitor bitcoin movements and the data associated with it. Mixer services allow for coins to be changed as they move through the system via a central party but this still is not sufficient enough.The zCash whitepaper states:\"[M]ixes suffer from three limitations: (i) the delay to reclaim coins must be large to allow enough coins to be mixed in; (ii) the mix can trace coins; and (iii) the mix may steal coins. For users with “something to hide,” these risks may be acceptable. But typical legitimate users (1) wish to keep their spending habits private from their peers, (2) are risk-averse and do not wish to expend continual effort in protecting their privacy, and (3) are often not sufficiently aware of their compromised privacy.\"The major motivations for ZKPs and the Zcash protocol are 1)privacy and 2)fungibility. Fungibility is being able to substitute individual units of something like a commodity or money for an equal amount. This can be a real problem when some units of value are deemed less because they are considered \"dirty\". Hiding the metadata history doesn\u0027t allow for a coin with a bad history to be rejected by a merchant or exchange. Gregory Maxwell said \"Insufficient privacy can also result in a loss of fungibility--where some coins are treated as more acceptable than others--which would further undermine Bitcoin\u0027s utility as money.\"Zcash is expected to launch soon and with that the genesis block of the Zcash blockchain. This will allow, like the bitcoin blockchain anyone in the world to mine, for Zcash. It will be an open, permissionless system (fully decentralized). Users will be able to send it to anyone using zero-knowledge privacy.ZCash’s use of cutting edge cryptographic techniques comes with substantial risks. A cryptographic attack that permits the forging of zero knowledge proofs would allow an attacker to invisibly create unlimited currency and debase the value of Zcash. Attacks of this kind have been found and fixed in the recent past. Fortunately, the metadata hiding techniques used in Zcash tread are more production-hardened and can be considered less risky.Andrew Miller in his whitepaper: \"Hawk: The Blockchain Model of Cryptography and Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts\" has developed a programmable smart contract system which works in much the same way as zCash for smart contracts.Hawk does not store financial transactions on the blockchain and keeps private the code of the code of the contract, data sent to the contract and money sent and received by the contract from the public. It is only the proof that can seen and all other useful information is hidden. Like zCash, transparency is selective in Hawk and wouldn\u0027t need to be used by all smart contracts but based on use cases and the preferences of the parties involved. It also aims to tackle the isssues of privacy and fungibility in much the same way as the zCash protocol.The Hawk whitepaper does a great job of describing the motivation for contractual security it seeks to provide for financial transactions:\"While on-chain privacy protects contractual parties’ privacy against the public (i.e., parties not involved in the financial contract), contractual security protects parties in the same contractual agreement from each other. Hawk assumes that contractual parties act selfishly to maximize their own financial interest. In particular, they can arbitrarily deviate from the prescribed protocol or even abort prematurely. Therefore, contractual security is a multi-faceted notion that encompasses not only cryptographic notions of confidentiality and authenticity, but also financial fairness in the presence of cheating and aborting behavior.\"According to Andrew Miller, Hawk is based on several cryptographic primitives. It uses the same zero knowledge proof library as zCash, which is called libsnark. Hawk also uses custom implementations of a lattice-based hash function, and public key encryption. Hawk uses a jSnark tool which is open sourced.In Hawk, each party generates their own secret keys. Miller stated that: \"For each contract, there is also a trusted public parameter, similar to Zcash. The only way to generate these parameters is a process that involves generating a secret value in an intermediate step, which needs to be erased at the end of the protocol. To borrow Zcash\u0027s term for this, it\u0027s like a \"toxic waste byproduct\" of the setup procedure, and like all industrial waste, it must be securely disposed of. There are many options... we could do what Zcash does and use a multi-party computation to generate these parameters, simply let a trusted party do it (the trusted party only needs to be used once and can go offline afterwards), or use trusted hardware like SGX.\"Miller has said there are some differences between Ethereum contracts and Hawk contracts. Unlike Ethereum, the input language for private contracts in Hawk is C code. A private Hawk contract is not a long running stateful process like an Ethereum contract, but rather a 1-shot contract that proceeds in phases, where it first receives the inputs from each party, and then it computes the outputs for each party. After the outputs are computed, the contract is finished and no longer holds any balance. So, it is a slightly different computing model. Hawk supports both private contracts as described above, as well as public contracts which are exactly like those in Ethereum. (No privacy guarantees are provided for the public contracts, though).As in Zcash, there are some challenges to blockchain scaling and optimizing cryptographic schemes so they are efficient when using ZKPs. Hawk tries to do as much computation off chain as possible. This is done because in public blockchains on chain computing gets replicated to every node and slows things down dramatically. Producing the proof can take up to several minutes (which is long) and can be costly. Nodes checking the proof only take milliseconds to do that. Data from the whitepaper: In Hawk, it takes about a minute of CPU time for each participant in a Hawk contract. On chain computation takes about 9 to 20 milliseconds.Hawk has not announced a release date yet as they are still working on optimizing their snark compiling tools to enhance performance.State channels allow for a payment channels that are off chain and allow for updates to any type of applications that have a change of state. Like the Lightning Network, two or more users can exchange payments that would normally require a blockchain transaction without needing to publish them on the blockchain or wait for confirmations except when setting up or closing out the channel.Vitalik Buterin explains this in his paper for R3CEV \"Ethereum Platform Review\"\"State channels are a strategy that aims to solve the scalability challenge by keeping the underlying blockchain protocol the same, instead changing how the protocol is used: rather than using the blockchain as the primary processing layer for every kind of transaction, the blockchain is instead used purely as a settlement layer, processing only the final transaction of a series of interactions, and executing complex computations only in the event of a disputeState channels are not a perfect solution; particularly, it is less clear how they extend to massively-multi-user applications, and they offer no scalability improvements over the original blockchain in terms of its ability to store a large state size – they only increase de-facto transaction throughput.However, they have a number of benefits, perhaps the most important of which is that on top of being a scalability solution they are also a privacy solution, as the blockchain does not see any of the intermediate payments or contracts except for the final settlement and any disputes, and a latency solution, as state channel updates between two parties are instant - much faster than any direct on-blockchain solution, private or public, possibly could be, and potentially even faster than centralized approaches as channel updates from A to B can be secure without going through a centralized server.\"State channels aim to address the scalability issues, privacy issues and confirmation delays associated with public blockchains while allowing actors who don\u0027t necessarily trust each other to transact.For many people all of these cryptographic methods which mask all of the transactional data will come as a surprise. The blockchain is supposed to be a transparency machine in which anyone can join the network and as a result view all information on that network. Even in private blockchains, there is a more open view into the data then the protocols that have been mentioned in this post.Another question which might come to mind is if consensus is even needed, since everything is private but the proof. If the proof is only between the two parties involved in the transaction why is consensus needed and why use a public blockchain. It may seem counterintuitive, but the answer is that yes a public blockchain is needed and so is consensus and its due to the privacy of the proofs. Essentially, complete transparency is needed to maintain the privacy of the proofs.ZKPs and blockchains complement each other. You can\u0027t just use one to replace the other. A blockchain is used to make sure the entire network can agree on some state which may or may not be encrypted. ZKPs allow you to be confident about some properties of that state. In this scenario, you still need a canonical source of truth. A view key that reveals all incoming transactions but not outgoing ones. In order for this to happen, you need a fully decentralized ledger with consensus where everyone agrees with the data written there.For example, Zcash has data which contains information which is useless and unreadable to most actors. It’s a database of commitments and opaque pieces of data. It\u0027s just a way to synchronize data between actors. (Zooko Wilcox has publicly stated that if Chainalysis graphed this out it would just be a series of timestamps of when a transaction occurred.) In cases where the number of transactions are low, then timing attacks could reveal the originator of transactions, imagine this to be equivalent of just one node connected to a Tor network.The real emphasis is on the wallet side for actors because this allows them to spend money and move assets around, in bitcoin you can take a private key and move bitcoin. Now it\u0027s more. It’s a private key and a set of secrets you keep to prove previous proof and generate a new proof that you use to convince others. For this, a fully decentralized ledger is needed with consensus where everyone agrees with the data written there.A blockchain is necessary because you need consensus layer from everyone: It is necessary to have an agreement of proofs in the ledger to move assets around later on, if that proof isn’t available in every node then you can’t convince anyone of the proof when you need to move assets later on. These proofs need to be stored in an open way so the proofs can be seen as being verified and accepted by receiving parties.There are two different layers: 1) Needs to be agreement on what proofs everyone accepts 2) Needs to be agreement on what you can prove and what happens on proof of zero knowledge and what happens once you know the information.How do you generate proof and pass that information to the next person? The key is to get authority of the transaction by adding a proof or metadata to the transaction with some type of conditional script (if then statements for transaction acceptance). This code contains transaction validity rules. A person sees proof from outside but they don’t know if the rule itself has been triggered or not.Now that have you privacy from ZKPs, in order to comply with the transaction, you need to prove that the transaction abides by the rules. So you can take 2 proofs and create new proofs that the person receiving them can point at and verify that the proof is accepted by the entire network. Once the proofs have a meaning to you based on the rules, you can agree they were proved in the past and can be used in the future to transact and transfer money.ZKPs are moving out of the realm of theory and becoming production strength. Now is the time to see how practical they are. They are only now going to start having really world tests and they still suffer from big scalability issues.The work of developing a proof is enormous and has massive computation costs. As mentioned before, in Zcash in order to create a proof you move money from someone else it takes between 45 seconds and 1 minute on a really strong computer. Presently, people are working on making SNARKs and ZKPs more efficient by allowing for more proofs per second or for more elaborate proofs in the same amount of time.Deep changes need to be made architecturally in DLT’s- understand knowledge of ZKP architecture need to understand the constraints of what you can prove and at what scale.This article was previously published on the author\u0027s blog and has been republished here with permission.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Zcash.Locks and keys image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Privacy, Blockchain Technology, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/09/10/the-blockchain-an-experiment-in-governance-without-power/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/jkanatErjebpSOIY7KU9PAytMvM\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/7KKZ56T6MNEGVM4N5ST3MZDRAQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The Blockchain: An Experiment in Governance Without Power","INTRO":"Cryptocurrencies aren\u0027t just an experiment in monetary theory, but also a radical experiment in decentralized governance, says Ariel Deschapell.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Bitcoin’s unique ecosystem of peers and stakeholders stands in stark contrast to most other human organizations.The voting public is accustomed to issues being settled by aggregated winner-take-all votes, and executive edicts enforced by the state. Meanwhile in the corporate world, directives are issued down a hierarchy, and those who do not comply with them are ultimately fired.But the same rules and attitudes do not define the governance of blockchain ecosystems.According to conventional political ideas a decentralized and wholly voluntary system of governance should not be possible, let alone optimal. The success of bitcoin as a monetary and social experiment therefore could depend on shattering this very narrative.\u2028\u2028 Unlike other systems, its organization is not defined by power structures, but by voluntary consensus and open competition.Take democracy, nearly unanimously considered in Western academia as the most optimal form of governance, it seeks to fill positions of power in the most egalitarian manner possible using popular vote.Political scientist Francis Fukuyama even famously remarked “What we may be witnessing … is the end point of mankind\u0027s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government”, leading us to believe that no further improvements are left to be made.Like other systems of government, though, democracy never actually questions the necessity of positions of power. It is an underlying presumption that power, the ability to compel others, is a necessary prerequisite for organizing collective efforts in the most socially optimal manner.So what happens when we can\u0027t force our peers to conform and comply? What do we do when there is no one in charge?These are the questions facing cryptocurrencies, making them not just an experiment in monetary theory, but also a radical experiment in decentralized governance.How does such a system work, and can it prosper?At bitcoin’s core is a peer-to-peer network of nodes and miners, and on top of this network is a much larger ecosystem comprised of a diverse population of stakeholders.These stakeholders include everyone having something to gain should bitcoin use continue to grow, such as bitcoin businesses who would hope to see higher revenue as a result. But far more common are everyday users who are made significant stakeholders by the simple virtue of owning bitcoin.The reason for this is inherent to the functionality of the blockchain, the breakthrough in computer science that is at the heart of bitcoin. Public blockchains by their very architecture require native tokens in order to operate. These tokens are created and rewarded to miners, or earned as transaction fees, in exchange for performing the work of securing the network.This incentive created by native tokens is what keeps the network as a whole trustless.In bitcoin’s case especially, an ultimately fixed number of tokens means that, should use and ownership increase, then so too will their value and the wealth of existing stakeholders. Just as the earning of newly created bitcoins and transaction fees incentivize miners to secure the network, the mere possession of them incentivizes the holder to contribute in some way to improving and growing the ecosystem.Rather than a simple payment network, bitcoin thus resembles a corporation, complete with shareholders but without a head, officers, or any guidelines besides what is hardcoded into the protocol. In this way, bitcoin is the original decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), and has been running very successfully for over seven years in this capacity without any formal delegation of authority.Initially the lack of any central leader or decision-making body in this system can seem like a significant drawback. As the blockchain adage goes: this is a feature, not a bug.Governments and corporations both depend on such figures to make decisions on behalf of the collective group. But one person’s knowledge is limited, and they can always make mistakes. Misdirected decisions from on high can and do often bring ruin to both companies and nations.Yet it is undeniable that like all else, bitcoin’s utility and growth face challenges which require solutions and directed effort. Fortunately, the lack of a structured hierarchy poses no actual barrier to problem solving. Instead of convincing one key decision maker, energy is better spent on competing in the market. Anyone is free to submit ideas, contribute code and build applications on top of the network.The absence of a central authority figure is also not synonymous with a lack of leadership. To the contrary, it means anyone and everyone is able to lead. The difference is that without compulsion, different ideas and solutions must openly compete against each other. No one can be forced to accept any service or use any software. The resulting competition means that multiple solutions to different problems can be market tested and users will ultimately vote with their feet.This simple dynamic is the key to not only how the bitcoin ecosystem works, but how it can ultimately thrive over centralized planning. Ineffective solutions to problems on the part of stakeholders are able to fail in isolation without threatening the whole ecosystem, and valuable solutions can succeed and grow on their own merit and earn the appropriate amount of market share.So, what do the dynamics of this environment mean for stakeholders?It means there are various classes of challenges limiting bitcoin’s utility and adoption, and ultimately they can only ever be addressed by stakeholders on their own volition. As far as we are motivated to improve the ecosystem as stakeholders, we should identify problems facing it that are in our power to address.This can be as simple as educating others, as communicating the workings and ideas behind cryptocurrency are an ever-present challenge. Various other pain points can be addressed through a limitless possibility of services, businesses and applications built on top of the bitcoin peer-to-peer network. This includes services which make it as easy as possible to buy tokens and onboard new stakeholders, or wallets that improve the user experience and the security of their funds.This level of ecosystem problem-solving has several advantages, chiefly that it’s the easiest to engage in. Such solutions require no consensus to implement and are able to move quickly using the centralized structure and decision making of individuals and traditional businesses, while still operating competitively within the framework of the existing consensus protocol.The benefit of building these services and apps on top of the most established and secure blockchain ecosystem is tremendous. The shared underlying token creates compatibility between services and applications, leading to a powerful network effect that greatly benefits utility. As utility increases so does the value of the token, and a rising tide lifts all boats. Yet blockchains themselves are far from perfect.So, how do we manage deeper problems that cannot be addressed without altering the underlying protocol?Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network sets the framework within which everything else operates. It possess the hard-coded rules by which everyone agrees to play in order to use the shared token it facilitates. In this way, the consensus around the Bitcoin Protocol is very much a social contract in the spirit of polycentric law – the idea that legal systems freely compete like any other good or service. The Bitcoin Protocol contains the rules that all participants agree to play by, but unlike monopolistic law, there’s also no compulsion to play by them. Participants freely choose to do so in their own self interests, and can walk away at any time.If no parties can be forced into abiding by the protocol\u0027s “legal” framework, then that framework must adequately and solely serve the universal needs of all stakeholders, lest it too lose market share and be replaced. This is why development of any cryptocurrency protocol requires true consensus.A spectacular example of how this can go wrong is, of course, the ethereum classic split. Following “The DAO” hack, a group of ethereum and DAO stakeholders led an effort to reverse an exploited smart contract by altering blockchain history. It made no difference that these stakeholders included high-profile lead developers and architects of ethereum itself, or a great many of the burned investors in the DAO.To continue to use polycentric parallels, this “ruling” was still deemed unacceptable to a significant part of the ecosystem. They were under no obligation to accept it and instead opted to continue operating by the original consensus rules of immutability, thereby peacefully splitting the network, ecosystem, and token as a result.This development is arguably the most significant high-profile event to occur in the cryptocurrency space and it bodes very well for its future. Modern consumers have always taken for granted the ability to choose between goods and services and the beneficial competition which follows. But never before has the same competition been extended to the very rules which we agree to participate by.This is the very idea behind polycentric law. Until now, that idea has largely been the purview of abstract legal and economic theory. Thanks to cryptocurrencies, we have for the first time living examples of frictionless and purely consensus-derived rules in place, and the spontaneous order which follows as individuals attempt to determine which are the best ones.The developers of such projects as ethereum can be credited with recognizing the success of bitcoin as the original DAO and seeking to build on it. What they perhaps don’t realize is that that very success is due precisely to the conscious choice to limit the protocol itself to a simple and neutral framework for exchange.So long as such controversial steps such as the ethereum rollback are taken, a blockchain’s consensus based network cannot remain whole. The altering of the protocol in any unneutral manner can never be agreeable to all stakeholders, virtually ensuring a split occurs. Such actions could be pulled off easily from the top down in a hierarchal system, but even with good intentions they are incompatible with establishing a widely agreed upon voluntary protocol for transferring value. Public blockchain development driven by special interests is a doomed enterprise.The most widely used blockchain will therefore be the one that best meets the base goal of facilitating universal exchange and cooperation and nothing more.Any intervention beyond universally advantageous improvements to this function should not be undertaken, as consensus is not likely to be maintained and potential network utility will be needlessly lost. But where there is disagreement as to what actually constitutes improving “universal exchange and cooperation”, vote with your feet. Competition is the only way to identify which implementation works best.In this environment, stakeholders are able to self organize with others according to whichever shared goals or ideas they may possess. This means they can apply themselves to where they believe they can add the most value to the ecosystem, as well as choose which underlying protocol rules they use and support.None of these actions requires permission and the accompanying zero-sum power struggles which follow.This mode of thinking is predominantly different from looking to a distant capital or a powerful figurehead for either answers or to place blame. As my former colleague from FEE Max Borders writes, it demands a shift in attitude which requires we stop looking for leaders, and instead start looking for teammates.By doing so, we must also work to shed the divisive winner-take-all mentality of politics we are all accustomed to. Commercial competition creates for us a positive sum world – that is, a world of ever-increasing wealth. But the advantages of a competitive system begins to be negated if energy is not actively directed towards creative and constructive efforts.Should you find available features or services to be lacking, create a viable alternative. Should you believe adopted consensus rules fundamentally hamper the protocol’s neutral mandate to facilitate exchange and cooperation, switch to a competing cryptocurrency or fork and move on.Forks especially may seem like a messy and undesirable event to skeptics who do not recognize the marvelous dynamics at play. But the unique competition that follows, and the new and more productive mentality that it enables, is the key to success in this experiment in decentralized governance.Halls of power image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Politics, Blockchain Technology, Governance, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/08/20/why-big-bank-blockchain-leads-are-leaving-for-startups/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/35mk19-EMzVpW93vBSVMDMYEipQ\u003d/570x379/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/OHARI3HZW5CA3LEUA2PBEL6ARM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Why Big Bank Blockchain Leads Are Leaving for Startups","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Recent months have seen blockchain innovation professionals departing legacy financial institutions for smaller startups, but the motivations driving this shift in the industry are less than clear.To date, it’s been one of the less-discussed trends of 2016, given the lack of public dialogue from the major firms affected and the relative quiet of the new startup founders, many of whom are seeking to do business with their former employers.So far in 2016, BNP Paribas, Deloitte, JPMorgan and State Street have all seen members of their blockchain teams depart. This has given rise to a new wave of lesser-known startups including firms like DPactum, Kadena and Nuco. Still others, like the founder and head of Philips Blockchain Lab, have left without specifying why.In interviews, representatives of these startups say the departures are more about bringing their enterprise blockchain insights to a wider group of industries. Rather than the result of any cutbacks in spending at major backs, this new generation of founders believes it will be easier to raise more capital, more quickly, outside the firm.For Stuart Popejoy, who left JPMorgan’s blockchain project in July to found financial services-focused private blockchain startup Kadena, it’s about opportunity and demand.Popejoy told CoinDesk:But, Popejoy didn’t go alone, as his fellow JPMorgan colleague, developer Will Martino, also made the move to Kadena. The two ex-bank execs want to bring the technology to the broader market, and in their eyes, it’s still early enough to make headway.Even the high-profile enterprise blockchain groups are having trouble answering basic technical questions – scalability, transaction privacy and the safety of smart contracts – about how blockchain can be implemented, he said.“When we were at the bank, we simply couldn\u0027t find a vendor solution that could provide the necessary performance our use cases demanded without sacrificing the robustness and simplicity of a true blockchain, which is why we ‘rolled our own\u0027,” Popejoy said.Other former finance executives are departing for existing startups.Jeremy Drane, for example, was previously head of blockchain at ‘Big Four’ accounting firm PwC before joining blockchain startup Libra as its CCO. Drane said he sees the recent run of departures as the natural progression of tech moving from experimentation to pilot phase.“What you’re seeing is the first round of projects moving ... off the innovation budgets into enterprise evaluation cycles where the processes are more rigid,” Drane said. “There’s a totally different set of rules around how those projects are managed and what flexibility you have.”This maturation is another possible reason that members of blockchain teams at legacy institutions are moving on, but industry analysts also spoke to its “sex appeal”.For professionals that are geared towards innovation, moving into production is less appealing. Instead, they’ll take what they learned and build startups that bring the tech to more industries.“There are probably push-and-pull factors for joining startups. The potential upside is larger in the entrepreneurial space than in managing a team in a large organization,” said Antony Lewis, an independent blockchain consultant.While there seems to be enough blockchain startups to go around, most of these companies operate in the financial services space. Legacy companies in other industries will need help adopting the technology for their business models. Consumer product companies, entertainment and media businesses, as well as humanitarian and international aid projects, are a few of the industries currently showing interest in blockchain.Chris Larsen, founder and CEO of Ripple, said this movement signals that blockchain optimism is still on the rise for both banks and startups.“If anything, I’d say it’s an indication that thing are getting stronger and that [the professionals] see things booming and want to put themselves where the action is,” Larsen said.Others have demonstrated more skepticism.Gideon Greenspan, founder and CEO of blockchain tech specialist Coin Sciences, sees the market for private blockchain solutions contracting. For example, he said that concerns about confidentiality have shaken the faith in use cases such as clearing and settlement that had previously been earmarked for R\u0026D budgets.“Much of banks\u0027 early investments in blockchains were based on this expected use case, rather than more general ideas of shared data storage (for which blockchains are well suited). In that case it would make sense for them cut back on spending in the area,” he said.However, Greenspan indicated that he hasn’t seen a slowdown in the use of Coin Science’s Multichain platform for big bank pilot programs. So far, he said, Multichain has been used to create a crowdfunding platform, a regulator overview and a shared documentation notarization service.One reason banks may be pulling back on external equity investment and partnerships with startups could be the overabundance of blockchain startups in the market.“Banks could be waiting to see which platforms become dominant before developing a project on any particular platform,” Greenspan said.Many banks, analysts said, simply don’t have the manpower to filter through and vet all these various startups.For now, it seems the industry will remain stuck in the awkward positioning of its hype cycle. While many are heralding 2017 as the “Year of the Blockchain”, it’s likely that this claim will be valid for years to come.Libra’s Drane concluded:Evolution image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Venture Capital, Blockchain Technology, startups, Banking, Funding, Finance, investments, investors, Features, Markets News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Aug 20, 2016 at 1:36 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/06/19/with-blockchain-where-theres-smoke-theres-usually-more-smoke/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/_1FpV5hO_mkOZ9GHSUkuZF4RqhA\u003d/570x378/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/TP3A5AZPNVA6NA6K2IYG73DCNE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"With Blockchain, Where There\u0027s Smoke, There\u0027s Usually More Smoke","INTRO":"In this op-ed, Jonathan and Robert Wolinsky of the Genesis Project focus on the blockchain technology industry\u0027s inability to deliver on its promise.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Jonathan Wolinsky is senior managing director and chief scientist of Genesis Project, the company behind the private blockchain platform OpenBlock.In this opinion piece, Wolinsky – and colleague Robert Wolinsky – focus on the blockchain technology industry\u0027s inability to deliver on its promise: the bone crushing, market flattening creative destruction of the Bitcoin-style blockchain innovation.In recent weeks, hot topics in the banking and blockchain technology sector have been the heist of $81 million from Bangladesh\u0027s central bank facilitated by hackers manipulating the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) messaging platform, and the oft-repeated buzzwords \"blockchain\" and \"distributed ledger\" as the \"white knight\" technology duo that\u0027s going to correct all that ails SWIFT.SWIFT is a global interbank messaging service connecting 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. SWIFT handles 25 million transfer messages worth approximately $5 trillion daily. However, because of SWIFT\u0027s importance to the global financial system, SWIFT\u0027s activities do not happen in a vacuum. Plainly said, the SWIFT hacking problem is a global banking industry problem.Seeking to address this and other questions, since 2014, SWIFT, along with many major firms in the securities and banking industries, have banded together through consortia and collaborations to investigate how to reduce or eliminate mutualized costs, and improve security and reliability. These companies are embracing distributed ledger blockchain technology initiatives as a new means to long- term sustainability in an increasingly digital challenged marketplace.Of course, there\u0027s nothing new about technology collaborations, even amongst competitors. So, let\u0027s chalk that up to just good public relations. However, despite the collaboration, the what\u0027s \"new\" is the increasing clarity that saying the word \"blockchain\" may be more about selling the \"old\" than delivering the \"new\".Recently, I collaborated with colleagues at our firm to pen a contrarian viewpoint entitled \"Can Trust-based Private Blockchains Be Trusted?\". Our call-out was simple: permissioned or trust-based blockchains without the proof-of-work protocol provably do not deliver historical record immutability and are merely distributed databases impersonating blockchain technology. And since the article\u0027s debut, many blockchain development initiatives including the R3CEV group have fessed-up: they are not building blockchains at all. Investors take note.A little history is in order. Since the inception of Bitcoin there\u0027s been two distinct evolutionary or generational steps. First, there was Bitcoin, the tour de force of market flattening and all sorts of disruption. In the abstract, Bitcoin was a fresh idea with tremendous promise. Nonetheless, enterprise- class users had problems using it right off the bat. And rightfully so.Think about it. Having to get involved with or entangled by the openness of a public blockchain, the Bitcoin brand and its checkered history, internal convulsions, software rigidities and forks, regulatory murkiness, and having to rely on Bitcoin in perpetuity is a really big ask, especially for the folks in the C-suite. The reality was obvious, absent some miraculous innovation – Bitcoin\u0027s purpose is to be a digital currency, not an enterprise platform.The eureka moment came in 2013, when the 2nd generation blockchain salesmen said, \"We don\u0027t need the openness of a public blockchain; we can build \u0027private\u0027 blockchains without the limitations of Bitcoin, and build them better! Let\u0027s separate the blockchain from Bitcoin and make private, permissioned blockchains.\"And, soon \"the blockchain is going to change the world\" meme made selling anything with the word \"blockchain\" easier. And, the idea of the \"blockchain\" as a discrete element conveying heretofore not seen revolutionary new efficiency to non-digital money activities was born. Capital started to flow into so-called \"use cases\" for blockchain technology.However, in their zeal to harness the awesome power of blockchain technology for enterprise users, many newly minted \"private\" use-case innovations quickly jettisoned the blockchain data structure and the proof-of-work protocol. Because without having the market flattening disruption and network effect of a public blockchain, it\u0027s hard to rationalize the inefficiency of a blockchain database and its associated proof-of-work energy costs.So what\u0027s left?Once you remove the technology that makes Bitcoin what it is, what\u0027s left is a shared or common protocol platform consisting of existing \"permissioned\" parties inside the walled garden. Yes, getting onto a common platform can add some computational efficiencies between parties, but it\u0027s not a true P2P blockchain experience that changes worlds, levels markets and generates maximum efficiency – the type of disruption people think about when they hear the term \"blockchain.\"What most fail to realize is the blockchain structure becomes largely superfluous without the trustless environment. The blockchain data structure by itself – blocks of information chained together through cryptographic signatures – is not a particularly efficient way of storing or distributing information. However, when combined with the proof-of-work protocol, this ordinary chain of blocks transforms itself into an immutable record with tremendous potential.Add an objective mechanism for determining the record\u0027s validity along with a consensus protocol and, poof, say \"goodbye\" to the necessity of a central authority and trusted or permissioned parties to maintain the veracity of a multiparty record; say \"hello\" to uber-efficient P2P transactions without counterparty risk.In the case of blockchain technology, the benefits gained by removing counterparty risk results in an efficient peer-to-peer environment facilitated by the elimination of multiple and varied rent seekers. These benefits outweigh the costs of using an inefficient data structure as well as the energy costs required by the proof-of-work protocol to secure the provenance of the historical record in perpetuity.However, when practitioners of 2nd generation blockchain technology reintroduce trusted third-parties in the form of permissioning, or trusted nodes, in order to maintain and \"guarantee\" the validity of the record, the inefficient blockchain data structure provides little to no value. The blockchain salesmen therefore logically remove the blockchain data structure or modify it into a pseudo-blockchain without real immutability, resulting in an information sharing network strangely similar to the systems that currently exist, albeit maybe using a new, common protocol.It\u0027s important to note that pseudo-blockchains may have cryptographically signed blocks but lack the deterministic and external validation capabilities provided by the proof-of-work protocol that ensure the immutability of the record and the famous self-enforcement blockchain efficiency gains.The gain comes at a price, though. Bitcoin pays approximately $400m to $500m a year to provide immutability for its record.Second generation blockchain technology practitioners have repeatedly attempted to circumvent the costs of mining with various software, validator round-robins and circularity workarounds like proof-of- stake, not realizing or carelessly ignoring that both the externality and the resource consumption associated with the proof-of-work protocol are essential to providing immutability of the record, without which a blockchain becomes just your usual common protocol information-sharing environment.Of course, a common protocol for sharing information may be beneficial, particularly for a system that lacks a common protocol. That\u0027s pretty obvious, but it is certainly not the type of efficiency provided by authentic blockchain technology. Nevertheless, the Bitcoin-style, trustless blockchain efficiency is the type of \"efficiency\" being sold with the term \"blockchain\" but not being delivered.By 2016, the wheels started coming off the story. Not only did R3CEV admit they are not building blockchains, it appears Ripple, Blythe Masters\u0027 Digital Asset Holdings\u0027 Hyperledger, Chain, IBM and a lot of others may be just hawking the same-old common protocol (permissioned) information sharing systems along with varied round-robin consensus software, dressing them up as something new and revolutionary.And, of course, gaining only the efficiency of going from a non-common-protocol environment to a common protocol environment, not delivering the bone crushing, outside the walled garden, creative destruction of the Bitcoin-style blockchain innovation.And, so, with a bit of alchemy the \"old\" became \"new\" again.While all this profound thinking was churning the blockchain technology intelligentsia, there remained a small cadre of blockchain enthusiasts, entrepreneurs and data scientists, not alchemists, which understood the poetry behind the blockchain technology.In the world of digital money, Bitcoin is a technological haiku, a masterpiece of simplicity, balance and rationality. We should not easily dismiss this amalgam of proportionality because, like haiku poetry\u0027s unique ability to convey a deep thought in the simplest of word and sentence, a blockchain does one thing extremely well: it eliminates counterparty risk in a transaction, leaving gobs of parties that previously ensured the completion of a transaction without jobs. This is both the simple elegance and the disruptive force of blockchain technology.To be specific, Bitcoin\u0027s \"high-art\" blockchain innovation is the \"trustless\" or \"self-enforcement\" environment powered by the proof-of-work protocol. Without it, all you have is...a bunch of computers talking to each other the way they currently do.As an aside (but relevant to deeper meanings), maybe Bitcoin\u0027s inventor chose the Japanese pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto to hint at his creation\u0027s Haiku-like perfection.Nowhere!Only seven-odd years since exploding onto the world, \"blockchain,\" once a descriptor of elegance, is now a pop-culture money slogan entering middle age. The slogan has raised over $1 billion from venture capital firms, businesses, angels and incubators. Many have likened it to the halcyon days of the Internet all over again.Yes, slogans are useful for some things. However, blockchain slogans are not of the useful kind. Because when it comes to blockchain technology, where there\u0027s smoke, there\u0027s usually more smoke.And the fall has been fast. In a mere seven years, cadres of blockchain salesmen and their academy cohorts have devolved and deconstructed the \"high-art\" into its several components, selling various elements as \"blockchain technology\" while either excluding or redefining the one component that animates the ordinary distributed ledger to become disruptive Haiku art, the \"trustless\" or \"self- enforcement\" environment made possible by an immutable record.I would like to digress for a moment into a small technical discussion in order to elucidate the preposterous notion that blockchain components are malleable, interchangeable or removable while expecting the type of disruption associated with blockchain technology. Blockchains are comprised of three main interlocking components: 1) consensus, 2) authentication and 3) immutability. And, for the sake of clarity, the technology behind each of these components predates Bitcoin and the \"blockchain\" hype by decades.Both the consensus mechanism (built into the underlying application logic) and authentication technology (provided by public key cryptography) are commonly used in distributed systems. However, prior to Bitcoin, the third component, immutability (provided by proof-of-work), was never before used in concert with the other two technologies. And, when all three were combined, something truly fresh and amazing, almost magical was created. In other words, proof-of-work tied the other components together into what became known in modern parlance as a \"blockchain\".Of course, not everyone\u0027s happy with the inelasticity of the proof-of-work protocol and the science behind immutability and its cost, especially the promoters. So, in eagerness to commercialize, many promoters watered down the definition of immutability in order to shoehorn blockchain technology into their dream state. Unfortunately, the vaunted resiliency of blockchain technology – self-enforcement – is not transferable without the historical record immutability provided by the proof-of-work protocol.In the face of the prior discussion, the most common response – said in a matter-of-fact manner to disguise the contempt for being caught – is: \"well, we\u0027re not really building \u0027blockchains\u0027, we\u0027re building \u0027distributed ledgers\u0027.\"That is to say, they got rid of the inefficient blockchain data structure and the proof- of-work-enabled immutable record and brought back trusted third-party validators that merely reimpose a modified or virtual central authority scheme.To use another big concept, what came – although, very slowly – was an understanding that blockchain promoters are just back where they started. And, the \"where\" is merely \"work for hire\" software projects, not the Internet all over again kind of stuff worthy of big investments and high-multiple financial exits customarily expected by the sophisticated investor class.Until now, use-case validation schemes have guided investment. And there\u0027s likely many use-cases for common protocol systems in various sectors and industries. However, to achieve Nirvana, common protocols require en masse existing participants\u0027 adoption.There\u0027s two problems here.First, experienced financial individuals instinctively know that amassing whole industries is like herding cats and will likely never happen. The second problem is that investors didn\u0027t invest their cash into building common protocol software, they invested into (disruptive) blockchain technology.So, investors need to take hold of the situation before too much money is lost and reputations destroyed because most if not all blockchain investment has gone into common protocol use-cases masquerading as \"blockchain technology\" with a return on investment likelihood of zilch. If you are one of those investors who thought you were investing in disruptive blockchain technology only to find out you got a \"distributed ledger,\" I\u0027m sorry to tell you – you got played. This isn\u0027t the Internet all over again, get used to it and cut your losses.Moving forward, I recommend the following two guidelines.One – investors need to differentiate between the few projects that unleash the Bitcoin-style disruption into new markets from the many so-called \"blockchain\" (use-case) projects that merely repackage common protocols that empower existing participants; and, two – if the blockchain technology industry persists in pretending to build blockchain technology, then the investment community should \"pretend\" to invest money.As for the folks at SWIFT, be careful what you wish for.

He is founder of the online payments company Due.In this opinion piece, Rampton recalls the lessons he learned when trying to apply blockchain solutions to his startup.In serving as a record for every bitcoin that has been generated and transferred between parties, the blockchain has a critical role to play. Each cryptocurrency has its own blockchain, so it becomes very important to be able to use it correctly in order to maintain its quality and credibility as a value exchange network.For me, I originally sought out blockchain for a project that would transform the online database functionality powering our online invoicing and payment system, which included the directory of users, their staff, and their clients.Because of the complexity of keeping all this transaction data organized and secure, we wanted to offer a streamlined transaction system for our customers that offered greater payment options across multiple traditional and digital currencies while lowering transaction costs and speeding up the payment process.At the time, I recognized the potential that blockchain technology had to help us quickly advance our technology and the solution we offered customers, thereby creating a competitive advantage.The only problem? I hadn\u0027t yet developed a deep knowledge of the technology, so mistakes were made along the way.As a relatively new concept, blockchain is still evolving, so it’s easy to understand how mistakes can be made in terms of how it can actually be used. Many processes are still being tested to see if private blockchain applications will work for various business functions. By sharing the mistakes I’ve made, hopefully others can learn and avoid the same pitfallsWith that, here are the nine things not to do when using blockchain that we learned the hard way.Although dynamic and easier to manage once in the midst of using it, I made the mistake of just assuming I could figure out what blockchain was all about over time.It’s a much better idea to take the time to read the available research and how-to guides. It’s also a good idea to seek out information from qualified companies that work in the bitcoin and blockchain space, as well as visit forums where you can ask questions and gain a more practical understanding.If I had done this first, I would not have fumbled along and wasted so much time and effort. For example, I would have realized that certain data systems can sit outside the blockchain and still work without leading to operational redundancies.Initially, I made the mistake of turning to the bitcoin blockchain because my criteria was a) that I had heard of it before, and b) it had been around the longest in terms of testing and stability.This made it the most credible choice at the time – but not necessarily the one that would work well with my business need.The problem is that it wasn’t exactly what I was looking for in terms of my business purpose once I started looking into available custom blockchain software that has since been developed and deployed.While the new custom blockchain software has yet to go through as much testing, and may not have the same level of robustness, I have found one that aligns with my business needs.I thought everyone else would be as excited as I was about the potential of blockchain for various business applications.However, I saw that it takes time to get buy-in from other organizations that I wanted to include in my private blockchain. Not only did I have to convince them of the value, but then we also had to agree on using the same software – not the easiest process by any means.Since then, I’ve had to learn to be patient. But in that time I also turned to a more proactive approach in order to show these organizations the benefits they would receive. Ultimately, I believe they will come around to the idea – eventually.Don’t assume like I did that, because blockchain seems so flexible as part of machine technology, that it will help every business function.That\u0027s because it won’t – at least not right now in its current form.The good news is that, since the network is only accessible to a limited group of people, anything that doesn’t work as part of a test doesn’t have to end up impacting the business or your brand’s reputation.While the internet uses domain names rather than numeric-based IP addresses to reference a location, blockchain nodes are only referenced by public key hash, which makes them more susceptible to human error.This has happened to me as it has to so many others, so developing something similar to how the internet uses domain names could help solve this typical user mistake.Within an organization, not everyone should have access to the private key file that unlocks access to the blockchain.That’s because this can essentially corrupt the ledger because people are using it who may not know what they are doing. While the network needs to be accessible for use, I had to determine how to decide who should use it and, then, how to go about making it accessible.I am still working on a contingency plan should the private key get corrupted or lost.I realized that, in using blockchain for business applications with a high volume of information held within various documents, the amount of stored blockchain data can add up quickly.This is because the blockchain tends to replicate itself with every node that is added. To lighten the blockchain load, thereby returning its processing speed and efficiency, I had to link the blockchain to an external data source.While this may reduce its reliability to a certain degree through the separation of the data, it is still a better solution to a data-heavy blockchain.While it is an excellent solution for a secure and private database, it is not a store-all for an endless amount of data. Trying to use it for any large-scale database application is a mistake.Not only can the database on blockchain not hold all the information you need it to contain reliably, but it also may become too complex with the addition of other necessary database features that help analyze that information.Because I’ve been so excited about this new technology, I have taken the approach that it is the end-all solution – but the reality is that there are many inherent flaws in its design that still need to be addressed.This is a system that continues to evolve, which leaves it open to flaws that will need to be addressed.That means I had to think more about proceeding with caution before completely integrating blockchain technology into the applications I was using it for within my business.Instead, I’ve stuck to a testing phase and limited use to see how the flaws that have become apparent are addressed. This is another reason why it is important to continue researching, reading, and engaging with forums and thought leaders in cryptocurrency.Like mistakes in any part of business, these blockchain errors have become the necessary lessons that propelled me toward greater success with incorporating the technology into my business processes.The most important lesson? Be open and curious to the potential that blockchain technology may hold for numerous applications – and then proceed thoughtfully with thorough research and testing.Collaboration among businesses looking to adopt potential applications can make this process that much more fruitful.Mistake image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/03/05/can-trust-based-private-blockchains-be-trusted/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/fv0siV9sWOz26Uqer8fFsL6bpF4\u003d/570x376/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/VGTYF6EW7NDYLCBDLP65QFD7WU.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Can Trust-Based Private Blockchains Be Trusted?","INTRO":"Researcher Bob Wolinsky looks at the challenges facing permissioned blockchains, arguing they are unable to provide immutable records.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Bob Wolinsky is senior managing director of Genesis Project, where he leads a blockchain research and technology company focused on the commercialization of private blockchains.

Today, the blockchain technology sector is awash in salesmen selling every kind of workaround to the one thing they can\u0027t deliver to a private blockchain: the efficiency, bulletproof security and mathematical certainty of the proof-of-work protocol. There\u0027s a growing trend that finds people believing that an equivalent alternative to proof-of-work efficiency exists, that traditional countermeasures can be employed to secure the fidelity of a private blockchain\u0027s historical record, or that \u0027regulated\u0027 or \u0027trusted\u0027 parties will not collude to alter the historical record simply because they are regulated. Nothing can be further from the truth. With the desire to commercialize blockchain technology, two schools of thought have emerged regarding mechanisms to secure the provenance of the historical record of a distributed-ledger blockchain system: (1) proof-of-work and rules, and (2) trust or permissioning and rules. Many would argue that proof-of-stake and its derivatives are a third security mechanism. However, upon detailed inspection of the underlying mathematics and rules you will find that proof-of-stake is merely an exotic form of permissioning, so we lump it in with trust. Our colleague Paul Sztorc has written extensively on the economics and security regarding proof-of-stake. Suffice it to say, proof-of-stake is less efficient, untested and potentially less secure than proof-of-work. Others talk about blockchain node \u0027round robins\u0027, \u0027token rings\u0027 and the like. However, these mechanisms ultimately rely on trust as well. Many have used very colorful arguments in support of trust-based blockchain systems including rationales that \u0027rules\u0027 govern the interactions of the parties, and in certain FinTech situations, the parties are government \u0027regulated\u0027 and, as such, guided by a higher authority. For the sake of clarity, let us look at the quality of the regulated parties. Below, we culled from the media a small sampling of evidence covering the behavior of \u0027trusted\u0027 and \u0027regulated\u0027 parties (emphasis added). Bloomberg, 24th July 2015: CBSNews, 20th June 2015: Wall Street Journal, 12th September 2015: In all situations described above, traditional countermeasures (lawsuits, fines, settlements, SEC investigations, and in some cases jail) are being used to address collusion amongst \u0027trusted\u0027 and \u0027regulated\u0027 parties. So, what does \u0027trusted\u0027 mean in the context of blockchain technology? Does it simply mean you can rely on the party for anything? No, not really. In blockchain parlance, \u0027trusted\u0027 means the party is being\u0027trusted\u0027 to follow the rules of the blockchain. This line of reasoning forms the basis to the perceived viability of all trust-based systems. As evidenced above, it is faulty. Now that we\u0027ve heard the fantasy, let\u0027s look at the reality. Any rules created for a blockchain (ie: using a token ring, \u0027longest chain wins\u0027 ... any rule, it doesn\u0027t matter) can be broken by colluding parties. Why? Because there is factually nothing substantive, nothing other than faith, stopping colluding parties from disregarding the rules. When collusion occurs amongst blockchain parties, they can rewrite their local records regardless of other parties\u0027 interests and protestations. Other parties may not even detect that colluders altered the historical record. Even worse, since there is no way to prove which party has the correct record (ie: the objective state of the ledger), the system breaks with multiple objective states and multiple attendant claims to historical record authenticity, none of which are provable. Using dates to prove the correct objective state of the distributed ledger is both useless and immaterial – data can be backdated, after all, it\u0027s just ones and zeros that can be rewritten. So, what happens if the parties choose not to follow the rules and fork the historical record of the blockchain? What mechanisms exist for aggrieved parties to respond to collusion, if detected? Well, in the case of trust-based blockchain environments, not much other than old-fashioned traditional countermeasures – lawsuits, fines, settlements, SEC investigations and in some cases jail – all the inefficient stuff the pre-blockchain world used to enforce contracts. It should be apparent that the need of reliance on traditional countermeasures to enforce blockchain rules defies the entire concept and implied efficiency of blockchain technology. In the case of proof-of-work, Satoshi expects the parties to cheat/collude, hence the now well-known 51% attack vector example. However, Satoshi introduces a cost equation to cheating/collusion via the proof-of-work protocol as a non-traditional countermeasure. Proof-of-work in the context of a distributed ledger and the trustless environment it helps to generate is a massive paradigm shift that is foundationally new and revolutionary. The cost is both predictable and big, and it does not require the imposition of traditional countermeasures on participants in order to enforce following the rules (just a simple equation for determining whether the rules have been followed, ie: longest chain/most work wins), hence the \u0027trustless\u0027 environment. Notwithstanding so-called \u0027miner consolidation\u0027 arguments (which is a topic for another discussion), the 51% attack vector discussion is immensely relevant to understanding the genius of Satoshi\u0027s bitcoin innovation and successful blockchain technology derivatives. In actuality, the 51% discussion describes a risk-assessment mechanism – precisely calculating the requisite proof-of-work hashing power cost to overturn the record.

Using dates to prove the correct objective state of the distributed ledger is both useless and immaterial – data can be backdated, after all, it\u0027s just ones and zeros that can be rewritten.So, what happens if the parties choose not to follow the rules and fork the historical record of the blockchain? What mechanisms exist for aggrieved parties to respond to collusion, if detected?Well, in the case of trust-based blockchain environments, not much other than old-fashioned traditional countermeasures – lawsuits, fines, settlements, SEC investigations and in some cases jail – all the inefficient stuff the pre-blockchain world used to enforce contracts.It should be apparent that the need of reliance on traditional countermeasures to enforce blockchain rules defies the entire concept and implied efficiency of blockchain technology.In the case of proof-of-work, Satoshi expects the parties to cheat/collude, hence the now well-known 51% attack vector example. However, Satoshi introduces a cost equation to cheating/collusion via the proof-of-work protocol as a non-traditional countermeasure.Proof-of-work in the context of a distributed ledger and the trustless environment it helps to generate is a massive paradigm shift that is foundationally new and revolutionary.The cost is both predictable and big, and it does not require the imposition of traditional countermeasures on participants in order to enforce following the rules (just a simple equation for determining whether the rules have been followed, ie: longest chain/most work wins), hence the \u0027trustless\u0027 environment.Notwithstanding so-called \u0027miner consolidation\u0027 arguments (which is a topic for another discussion), the 51% attack vector discussion is immensely relevant to understanding the genius of Satoshi\u0027s bitcoin innovation and successful blockchain technology derivatives.In actuality, the 51% discussion describes a risk-assessment mechanism – precisely calculating the requisite proof-of-work hashing power cost to overturn the record.Proof-of-work makes the cost of overturning the record empirically quantifiable. Without proof-of-work, alternative means are subjective in nature and, as such, provide neither a practicable nor an empirical approach to quantify the fidelity of the historical record. Consequently, the immutability of the historical record becomes a theoretical academic argument not a scientific or objective fact. This particular (non-theoretical) quantifiable risk capability makes proof-of-work very appealing from a transaction, tax and audit perspective and drives the interparty efficiency of blockchain technology in-toto. Let us digress for a moment to a prior argument in order to elucidate the immense paradigm shift that proof-of-work delivers in the form of a trustless environment. Many would argue that cheating by, or collusion amongst, regulated parties is an illegal act with associated and significant deterrent costs which are sufficient to enforce the rules. As evidenced above, we know this line of reasoning to be faulty. The reason for this is because when practicably employed, traditional deterrents generate both a non-deterministic and dynamic environment whereby deterrent costs inevitably become cost/benefit estimations – that is, zero cost for successful evasions versus more money due at some future point in time for unsuccessful cheating. Contrary to the traditional deterrents approach, proof-of-work is entirely deterministic, whereby parties know the cost of cheating and collusion and must decide to pay this cost upfront. If efficiency is greatest when the countermeasures are most expensive and immediate, then proof-of-work in the context of a distributed ledger and the trustless environment it helps to generate is a massive paradigm shift that is foundationally new and revolutionary. It should be apparent by now that trust-based systems are merely unsecure and non-empirical software \u0027workarounds\u0027 (if you can even call them that) to the provision of a real security work-product, proof-of- work. In addition, it should be equally apparent that the arguments in support of workarounds to proof-of-work arise, not from a wisdom that it is prudent to build a distributed ledger without proof-of-work, but rather they arise solely from the historical inability to attain proof-of-work in an economical way. It should also be obvious from the discussion that the proof-of-work protocol is factually the underlying key to unlocking the huge paradigm shift and efficiency of distributed-ledger blockchain technology – no traditional deterrents and countermeasures required – there really is no other viable alternative. Incorporating the proof-of-work protocol into private blockchain technology taps directly into the immense efficiency of the bitcoin blockchain paradigm shift. Without it, all you\u0027ve built is an old-fashioned (and inefficient) distributed database. There\u0027s a warning here for companies seeking to utilize blockchain technology: beware and become aware. Beware the software-workaround salesman selling \u0027eternal immutability\u0027. Become aware of the underlying elegance of bitcoin – it\u0027s not the software that makes bitcoin so efficient, it\u0027s the economics. As can be expected, when it comes to blockchain technology and historical record immutability, there really isn\u0027t a free lunch.

The first offered an overview of how the technology works and its potential applications. Later, attendees examined possible regulatory approaches to blockchain tech.The event comes amid a time of growing activity on the subject of bitcoin and blockchain within elements of the European Union governance structure. The European Parliament\u0027s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) held a hearing in January and later released a report calling for a dedicated task force focused on digital currencies.Both the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, and the European Council, composed of the bloc\u0027s heads of state as well as representatives from the Commission, are also moving to establish policies on the technology over the course of this year.Notably, some of those present at the event pushed to bring credence to the idea that regulation of distributed ledgers could, in fact, be accomplished through the code itself, rather than a top-down approach from one agency or another.In his opening comments, Wong referred to blockchain tech as a \"platform for innovation\", spelling out its advantages as money you can program. The transparent and verifiable transfer of ownership aspects of the technology, he stressed, amount to a \"huge change\" in how money works.Primavera De Filippi, a researcher at Harvard University, remarked that blockchain could change the current financial industry and \"eliminate the need for financial intermediaries\".This, she said, would allow individuals \"who don\u0027t trust each other to actually interact and exchange value\".De Filippi also explored the idea of how distributed ledgers can improve governance through transparency. The technology, she argued, has the potential to spread power from top-heavy institutions out to the \"edges\", thereby offering a means of reducing the occurrence of corruption by providing a greater degree of visibility for constituents.This could mean that the traditional format of organisations can \"progressively become more flexible and quicker to adapt\" in changing situations, she suggested.Henning Diedrich, a programmer working on IBM\u0027s blockchain initiative for the Internet of Things (IoT), weighed in on the use of the technology to facilitate the creation of decentralized entities.Diedrich explained that an entire company could run on a blockchain through the use of various smart contracts, allowing for the development of a decentralised Uber or Facebook, for example. But such a system, he warned, could be very hard to regulate.\"How do you punish a [decentralized] company?\" he asked.Mentioning author Isaac Asimov\u0027s famous Laws of Robotics, he raised the question of who, in a world increasingly governed by automated systems, will be coding the rules or instituting automated regulatory mechanisms.\"Programmers will need to know law, or lawyers will need to know code,\" he suggested.This sentiment was echoed by Wong, who foresaw issues where blockchains could be used to manage a multitude of devices within an Internet of Things framework.\"Sending computers to jail will make no sense,\" he said, going on to add that some kind of governance model will be essential in this instance.Wong used his introduction to raise the question of whether the technology should be regulated at all.\"Would the Internet have happened if we had to apply the letter of the law of copyright?\" he asked.Suggesting that regulation could stifle innovation in the space, Wong put forward the possibility that the technology itself could be leveraged to meet those perceived requirements.Taking a similar view, De Filippi questioned what it means to regulate blockchain technology anyway. \"It\u0027s a data structure,\" she said.The researcher suggested it may make more sense to focus regulatory efforts on the apps built on top of open and private blockchains rather than the technology itself.Ruth Wandhöfer, CitiBank\u0027s global head of regulatory and market strategy, provided the overview that distributed ledgers can indeed usher in beneficial changes in finance.Private and hybrid blockchains, she said, could bring increased privacy and control and, by removing the middleman, force the banks to change or even disintermediate them completely. Further benefits can be found in the removal of what she called centralised \"honeypots\" that are attractive to bad actors.However, Wandhöfer concluded that some degree of regulation will be needed in order to \"establish trust\".Image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Regulation, News, Events, European Parliament, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Mar 2, 2016 at 7:20 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/03/01/isitc-majority-of-securities-firms-plan-to-explore-blockchain-this-year/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/-wCmSDXC6JjF8C-xh4VDBxCgzLM\u003d/570x299/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/KPPWGRD7FFEJ7LJWRQKATTCV3Y.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"ISITC: Majority of Securities Firms Plan to Explore Blockchain This Year","INTRO":"A new survey has revealed that the current buzz around blockchains is driving a focus on technological investment within the financial sector.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A new survey by the International Securities Association for Institutional Trade Communication (ISITC) has revealed that the current buzz around blockchain is driving a focus on technological investment within the financial sector.ISITCis an industry trade group focused on standards and efficiencies in securities transaction processing. It boasts hundreds of member companies from across the globe, including major institutions such as BNY Mellon, Citibank, JPMorgan and more.In its annual survey, which polled 45 member firms from a variety of areas within financial services, the association says it set out to examine perspectives on the industry’s \"progress and focus\" for 2016. The findings revealed that 62% of firms see investment in technology as a main area of focus for 2016–2017, with an interest in both blockchain and cybersecurity technology cited as driving factors.Specifically, ISITC says, 55% of firms are monitoring, researching or already developing solutions for blockchain technology. A hefty 74% of firms also mentioned specific plans for investment aimed at improving cybersecurity – a climb from 57% last year.As evidence of the new interest in FinTech, 62% of firms saids investment in infrastructure is an area of operational focus for 2016, possibly driven by the need to reduce costs – a factor that 80% see as the biggest challenge in the next year.Blockchain tech has widely been viewed as a way for a number of financial sectors to drive new efficiencies, as well as reduce crimes like fraud given the transparent and immutable nature of the technology.\"New and emerging technologies have taken the financial services industry by storm,\" said Jeff Zoller, chair of ISITC and vice president at US investment firm T Rowe Price, adding:The CEO of ISITC Europe, Nigel Solkhon, recently spoke to CoinDesk in interview, saying that he believes that the current interest and investment in blockchain tech among financial firms will reveal its impact in just 12 to 18 months.The association has also announced that the theme of new technology and innovation disrupting the financial services industry will be the primary topic at the ISITC 22nd Annual Industry Forum and Vendor Show, taking place on 20th-23rd March, at the Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel.Compass image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Research, Blockchain Technology, Banking, News, Finance, capital markets, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Mar 1, 2016 at 5:23 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/03/01/dh-2016-will-see-blockchain-solutions-reach-banking-consumers/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/jBRoK3tROEtB3TNXqPp8aRCdmHo\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/PHZN7Z7DEBBKZFBA7RB5FEEVFM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"D+H: 2016 Will See Blockchain Solutions Reach Banking Consumers","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"DH Corporation (D+H), a Canada-based provider of technology solutions to financial institutions, recently announced the integration of a proprietary blockchain solution with its payments hub, Global PAYplus.The move makes D+H the latest payments vendor to carry out a blockchain integration. Following similar announcements by Dwolla, Earthport and PayCommerce, the developments can be viewed as a tipping point that finds blockchain moving from innovation labs and into real-world implementations.For example, the Global PAYplus platform already integrates different payment types, currencies and systems into a single payments hub providing for large numbers of immediate payments – and D+H may soon offer \u0027blockchain\u0027 as a payment method alongside more conventional alternatives.The advantages offered by blockchain and \"virtual ledger\" technologies, said Moti Porath, D+H\u0027s executive vice president of global pre-sales, are that they enable banks to simplify and reduce the costs associated with clearing, and can further \"achieve objectives related to immediate payments\".It was that potential for fast transactions, he said, that drove D+H to become an early adopter of the technology:While the blockchain integration is still not yet being used for live payments, Porath told us that the firm is currently in \"discussions and trials with certain customers\".Though unable to divulge the names of these clients, he expressed the hope that significant news announcements would be made in the near future.Adding a blockchain solution demonstrates that Global PAYplus is \"adaptable to blockchain technology\", Porath said, and, further, that the technology is integrated to meet evolving peer-to-peer client payment needs.He framed the project as a means for banks to streamline the process for conducting, operating and delivering payments, saying:The firm\u0027s blockchain integration supports credit and debit transfers, as well as returns and rejections, and is best suited for immediate payment clearing schemes and inter-branch transfers, according to Porath.The only precondition is that members of the scheme are operating as a private network, he added.Going into the detail of how the system works, the D+H executive said that it establishes a node in the network that acts as a liquidity pool, with various liquidity pool accounts being funded by real external transfer (using SWIFT, for example).\"The liquidity pool node simulates accounts in a central bank and, when value is exchanged and the blocks are being updated, the \u0027central bank\u0027 node is updated to reflect the exchange of value,\" he explained.Notably, D+H formed a partnership with Ripple last October, aiming to deliver \"innovative payment capabilities\", although this latest blockchain product integration was fully built in-house.The new multi-chain, private blockchain solution was built using open standards, and can provide access to \"any number\" of real-time gross settlement systems, Porath told CoinDesk.Explaining why the company didn\u0027t use Ripple or another pre-existing blockchain solution, he expressed the firm\u0027s belief that there is a strong market for distributed ledger technology in a closed private network as opposed to a large open network.\"If the technology is used in conjunction with a payments hub, it can provide a more secured environment and faster, more efficient money transfer and clearing,\" he said. \"At the same time, it [maintains] the privacy of the participants in the transaction.\"Providing a solution that adheres to regulatory requirements, such as know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, was also a factor.Notably, D+H released recently a white paper, setting out five key principles the company believes the banking industry needs to get right with regard to blockchain.The firm said it is \"encouraged\" by the potential positive impacts of blockchain on the payments industry, but warned that banks must be careful to address its five points in order for blockchain to fully realize its potential.Key considerations in the paper include finding and addressing the right problem, and retaining the transformative potential of the technology.\"If the past year was an era of experimentation and innovation for banks with regard to blockchain, then the year ahead could be the time we see this technology emerge from banks\u0027 back rooms to solve real business problems,\" said Porath in the paper, adding:Image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, payments, News, D+H, White Papers,

central bank revealed on Sunday it had established a working group that will provide analysis of \"advanced technologies and innovations in the financial market\", with the goal being to study distributed ledger technologies, as well as developments in mobile, payments and other areas.The news comes at a time when certain public entities in Russia are supporting a possible ban on monetary surrogates, a classification that includes digital currencies. Officials from groups including Russia\u0027s Ministry of Finance, the government agency overseeing financial policy; members of the state duma, one of the country\u0027s legislatures; and its Investigative Committee, which investigates criminal offenses, have all previously voiced concerns about the technology.Russia\u0027s central bank, by contrast, has been more positive about the technology, issuing more measured statements as far back as 2014.Olga Skorobogatov, the Bank of Russia\u0027s Deputy Chairman, and the leader of the new group, said in a statement:Financial services is quickly digitising, and new business models, ecosystems and market participants are \"changing the behavior of consumers of financial services\", Skorobogatov added.The working group plans to hold regular meetings with representatives of banks, self-regulatory organisations and other financial market participants to discuss the use of new financial technologies.The Bank of Russia\u0027s head, Elvira Nabiullina, earlier this month announced that the bank was \"closely monitoring\" blockchain technology with the aim of \"developing its own approach to financial innovation\".Sunday\u0027s announcement also comes hot on the heels of a report from Russia\u0027s official news agency Tass last week, which claimed that the country ranks fifth for number of cryptocurrency users globally.Users of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies now number 200,000, with only the US, China and Germany having higher numbers, said deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma committee for security and anti-corruption, Andrei Lugovoi [Ed –his figures actually making Russia fourth, not fifth].Lugovoi noted that, while the central bank had previously held a somewhat negative stance towards cryptocurrencies, it was now in favour of a \"careful approach to bitcoin, and saw a serious economic potential\" in the technology.The Ministry of Finance, on the other hand, has made a number of statements condemning bitcoin, though it has conceded the potential use case for blockchains in finance.Image via Popova Valeriya / Shutterstock.com","TAGS":"Crime, Blockchain Technology, Russia, Bank of Russia, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 29, 2016 at 1:57 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/27/imagine-the-trust-blockchains-growing-role-in-financial-services/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/x-B-t-3RSyJCPv3CTLKggrpsxlY\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/JGUWKZ3YTBFXFAI7BF54KRHFLI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Imagine the Trust: Blockchain\u0027s Growing Role in Financial Services","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Helen Thompson is a writer for the SWIFT Institute, a forum for knowledge-led debate established by the SWIFT financial telecommunications network.In this article, Thompson examines how financial services firms might benefit from blockchain technology and some pitfalls they need to avoid as they move towards adoption.Much has been made of the blockchain, the name given to the underlying technology of the digital currency bitcoin, but these systems are not as novel as some believe.Having built a shared distributed ledger system 20 years ago, professor Michael Mainelli, co-founder and chairman of the commercial think-tank Z/Yen and emeritus professor of commerce at Gresham College, London, can attest that this technology is most definitely not new.Yet banks, discovering the existence of blockchain through bitcoin, have only recently started to realise the possibilities such technology can provide.Mainelli contends that two concurrent developments have been occurring.Firstly, people have been coming to the realisation that there could be a multitude of ledgers responsible for a multitude of purposes, potentially in the several billions, due to the expected growth of the Internet of Things.Secondly, companies in the financial services industry have begun to grasp the fact that these systems are relatively easy to build, meaning that banks could construct a shared distributed ledger themselves thereby doing away with the role of a trusted third party.\"Banks are on the cusp of change, but sadly what is driving them into this space is fear,\" Mainelli pointed out.Leda Glyptis, newly appointed director at business and technology marketing and consulting company Sapient, based in London, agreed.“In the past year we have seen the industry move from panic and disbelief to realisation that the technology is real and very powerful,” she said.Adjustments, however, need to be made to the original bitcoin code in order to make it work for applications in the financial services industry. It is not likely, for example, that banks would share information on a public blockchain. The assumption is rather that they would exist as gated communities.Glyptis pointed out that while established industry players are now much more comfortable in exploring the possibilities of blockchain, a short-term problem remains in the expense of running parallel infrastructures.Banks, eager to stay competitive, need to further explore where the line between the technology\u0027s utility (and its associated economies of scale) and its business value might lie.Industry consortiums are beginning to provide thought leadership on the topic, nevertheless, there will be limitations as to what can be achieved. In order to build a shared ledger, one has to share – which makes for cautious conversations.Mainelli commented that whilst 30 banks had signed up to a recent, well-publicised cross-industry initiative, they had yet to decide upon any firm use cases.Glyptis noted that an agreement over a common architecture was \"not nothing\" and she feels it is right to have API standards driven by practitioners.She said, however, that whilst standards are important, functionality of the system as a whole should first be determined before the drafting of specifications.Is the blockchain limited to certain types of financial services transactions?Glyptis explained that we simply do not know all the different variations that a blockchain system could be used for, but warned that it is critical the industry should not cut corners when thinking through what future configurations might be needed.“We need to minimise technical debt, meaning we need to ensure that our chosen stack is not limited in terms of capabilities,” she said. “Some blockchain companies have gone down the route of designing capabilities to suit functions of today, but I feel that this approach would limit our imagination in terms of what we could eventually do.”Mainelli explained the best way to approach the issue is by imagining a spectrum of trust with the left-hand side designated as ‘low trust’ and the right-hand side as ‘high trust’.On the extreme left would sit a structure built on very low trust and open membership – representing bitcoin or Ripple. Other examples at this left-hand end of the spectrum include the open public-facing blockchain system, Ethereum. The project is currently trying to build in smart contracts and faster transaction times, however, this has proven expensive to maintain.In high-trust environments, on the right end of the spectrum, players have historically gone to a central counterparty or exchange, which typically charge high fees for either membership or associated market data.With the introduction of blockchain technology, however, no one body would own the data – rather it would be collectively owned, thereby reducing the potentially monopolistic position of a central counterparty.“So in answer to the question about the types of non-payment transactions that are suited to mutual distributed ledgers, it is most of them within regulated financial services,” said Mainelli. “For almost all non-payment transactions, eg: time-stamping, regulatory reporting, standing data updates, proof-of-identity, or even asset transfer (with payments separate), tokens are not needed.He added:Mainelli believes that the role of shared distributed ledger systems in financial services would be quite different to that provided by a cryptocurrency system.He outlined the possible options for designing a blockchain system; for example, whether the system should (1) be open for reading or closed, (2) have permissioned or permissionless participants, (3) represent a fully or mildly distributed ledger, or (4) have a wide choice of validation mechanisms.It is expected that the financial services industry would for the most part decide upon a closed, permissioned system – one that would exist within a regulated market with an identifiable regulator who would determine which players would be allowed to operate within that community.Once these options were chosen, the idea of producing a proof-of-work validation mechanism – the equivalent of a cryptocoin (eg: a token) – would seem a bit redundant.Participants would also have further options to consider; for example, the setup of a single party system with the regulator effectively becoming the master node, or the establishment of identity systems and voting mechanisms.Each shared distributed ledger could be set up with individual specifications, but it is clear that systems without a validation mechanism would be much cheaper to run because they would be based on simpler rules.“I don’t see why you would want to have this huge overhead if it’s not adding value,” Mainelli said.Furthermore, the role of a trusted third party would fundamentally change. While, from the outside, the system would appear to be accessed in a similar fashion to that of a central database, the data would actually be retrieved from completely different servers because the system would be technically decentralised.The central party would therefore lose its control of the functions of storing data (preserve) and prevention of double selling (safeguard), but it would still maintain a role in validating transactions. It would follow that the regulatory role of a third party would remain intact, though the commercial element of selling market data would likely disappear.“Trusted third parties are having to think about the relative benefits of what they do; validate, safeguard, preserve,” maintained Mainelli. “It is similar to a central phone system moving onto a Skype platform.”He went on to say: “The weight shifts from providing cable to building a community to chat with.\"This means a certain party would still need to hold responsibility for access to the community and would also need to verify the transactions on the ledger. As a result, identity services rise in importance.A trusted third party would be able to do this much more cheaply and quickly using a shared distributed ledger system than they have been able to in the past, he said.One aberration in the structure of the bitcoin blockchain is that, if one player were to gain over 51% of the computing power used to verify transactions, it would then have the ability to add on new, potentially invalid transactions. A disincentive, however, has been built into the system, because it is extremely costly to obtain this amount of computing power.Yet if the validation mechanism were to be removed as advocated by Professor Mainelli, what would then prevent manipulation of the system?Mainelli commented that, whilst the technology took away the ability to alter a historic transaction, risks still exist. A trusted third party would still be needed in order to maintain the integrity of the community in terms of preventing false new entries.Glyptis believes that it would be naive to assume that any system would be impervious to meddling. A blockchain system would be much harder to tamper with because it minimises the amount of time settlements would remain in limbo.“Once the design of the system would be more or less established, you could then build your security, assumptions, tests and harnesses around it,” she explained. “This process is part of discovery. It is something we have not done in this industry for a very long time.”Looking forward, the development of blockchain technologies represents an opportunity for greater efficiency, transparency and democratisation. Reconciliation would become a thing of the past and regulatory transparency would be remarkably improved.Mainelli is of the opinion that overall the banks would not do too badly from a switchover to blockchain systems, because they could still provide the valuable trusted third party role.Glyptis foresees the iteration of this maturity in that FinTech start-ups providing niche services to incumbents would no longer define themselves as blockchain providers, rather they would simply be leveraging the best-of-breed distributed ledger technology for functionality.She speculated that this could prove to be the future tipping point for the large banks – when they realise that most of their technology providers have already moved to a distributed ledger capability, they might as well convert the rest of their systems.Glyptis concluded:This article was first published on 10th February by the SWIFT Institute.

And if they\u0027re in transit from one jurisdiction to another, do these tokenized assets become recognized under law?\"The topic of collaboration between both financial institutions and regulators was frequent during the hearing.For example, Levy remarked that there is a strong willingness among financial incumbents to engage in this process, highlighting that MarkIt believes open-source code will be an important aspect of this process.\"Even if you think about the words that are used in this space, share, peer to peer, distributed, all assume some level of collaboration,\" he said. \"And then we actually think open source is going to have a really big role in this space, probably more so than any other initiative in our industry, maybe ever.\"One subject that came up during the hearing was how regulatory bodies would conduct oversight of blockchain networks.According to the panelists, this process could result in regulators maintaining nodes on a distributed network or being given special access to the data on these networks.Ro remarked:Slazas echoed these comments, suggesting that regulators like the CFTC would have access to a \"dashboard\" giving them a window into what’s happening in a particular network.\"I think that in just a few short years that we would be able to provide some type of mechanism where you have a window into that space, and I think it can be done in parallel to what is being done currently, off the blockchain,\" he said.While no indications were given as to specific actions the CFTC may take, it was suggested by some committee members during the hearing that aspects of existing regulations be adjusted to account for blockchain use.In closing statements, the commissioners said further discussion and fact-finding about the technology is needed and encouraged.Hearing image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Derivatives, CFTC, Blockchain Technology, Regulation, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 23, 2016 at 10:26 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/23/uk-financial-regulator-vows-to-give-blockchain-space-to-grow/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/-91kHKaSPTWFHQDEE6PQTuW9sbg\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/6H7EQ35ZUZFC5PCDI72JBJKZAY.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"UK Financial Regulator Vows to Give Blockchain \u0027Space\u0027 to Grow","INTRO":"The UK FCA has said it does not plan to regulate the blockchain industry for now as it believes it needs \"space\" to grow.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said it does not plan to regulate the blockchain industry for now as it believes the technology will need \"space\" to grow.The news was delivered yesterday in a speech by Christopher Woolard, the FCA\u0027s director of strategy and competition, who took a focus on innovation at the start of London London Fintech Week.Describing innovation as an \"iterative process\", Woolard said that it is \"crucial\" that innovators are given space to develop their solutions. He further framed the development of distributed ledger technology as a potential revolution in financial services, though he cautioned it has yet to be seen if the tech is \"the panacea of all ills in the financial world\".Moving onto the authority\u0027s position on regulation of the blockchain businesses, Woolard said:Woolard went on to state that he believes there are \"regulatory and consumer issues\" that will need to be examined as the technology evolves, such as how individuals gain access to a distributed financial network and which entities control this access.Additionally, he cited levels of data security for users as a further \"vital consideration\" for the FCA.The FCA regulates domestic financial firms providing services to consumers, and is also charged with helping to maintain the integrity of UK financial marketsDuring the speech, Woolard took the time to discuss the FCA\u0027s Project Innovate initiative, launched in October 2014 to help startups improve policies and processes.The FCA chief explained that the FCA will continue to work with firms developing distributing ledger technology solutions via the innovation scheme to ensure \"consumer protections are being factored in during the development phase of this technology\".Woolard further explained that the FCA had identified some \"key opportunities\" in applying the technology to the needs of regulators, which he termed \"RegTech\".He said:Of particular interest to the authority is whether blockchain technology can help companies across industries meet know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML) requirements \"more efficiently and effectively\".The FCA is currently engaged in discussions with government and industry on the issue, he indicated.To date, the UK has taken an extremely open stance on both digital currencies and blockchain technology, issuing a number of official statements and initiatives expressing a willingness to help the industry develop.In October 2015, the economic secretary to the UK Treasury, Harriet Baldwin MP, spoke about the benefits of digital currencies and blockchain technology, explaining that the government was working to create the right regime for digital currency businesses that would attract both overseas investors and companies to the UK.This January, a report from the UK Government Office for Science recommended a broad government effort to explore and test blockchain and distributed ledger technology.The report, headed by the government\u0027s top scientific advisor Mark Walport, contained proposals aimed at pushing for segments of the UK government to pursue applications of the technology.London skyline image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"UK, Blockchain Technology, Europe, FCA, Regulation, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 23, 2016 at 6:23 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/23/ripple-distributed-ledger-tech-can-save-banks-42-on-payments/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/BNOmhAAfzpibfzH1G60FT9FQ3D8\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/ZJYUX7MYGJCFHOLJUK4VPTA2TU.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ripple: Distributed Ledger Tech Can Save Banks 42% on Payments","INTRO":"A new Ripple Labs report claims banks using XRP as a bridge currency could save up to 42% on costs today.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ripple has projected that banks that use the Ripple network and its native cryptographic token XRP for cross-border payments can save up to 42% when compared against today\u0027s options.The findings are part of a new 15-page report issued today by the distributed ledger technology (DLT) startup. Entitled \"The Cost-Cutting Case for Banks\", it finds Ripple offering clarity as to the cost-savings its products can realize for the first time.Further, the report projects respondent banks using Ripple without XRP can save 33% on international payments, with savings being generated by a 65% reduction in liquidity costs, a 48% drop in payment operations costs and a 99% decline in Basel III compliance costs.The release comes at a time when blockchains and distributed ledgers are being widely touted as having the potential to bring new efficiencies and savings to a variety of industries, particularly finance. However, there has been a lack of information as to the levels of such savings the technologies can achieve, largely since most projects are still in development or are being built behind closed doors.Ripple instead has the advantage of experience working with financial institutions including a number of banks, as well as Western Union, Japan\u0027s SBI Holdings and global payment hub Earthport.Still, the projected figures are based on \"model assumptions\", meaning its unclear how the report was informed by any real-world data about its clients\u0027 use of the service.Perhaps most notable about the report is its implications for XRP, the cryptocurrency that is used to facilitate trades on the permissioned Ripple DLT system and that trades on an open market on digital currency exchanges.More recent Ripple announcements have found the company largely glossing over the role of XRP in its system. For example, the Interledger protocol, released in October, sought to create a way to exchange funds between ledgers without a \"digital asset\", as it is described in the report.Like bitcoin and other digital assets, XRP is a store of value that can be transferred between parties anywhere in the world without a central counterparty. However, Ripple stresses that XRP can also support liquidity between any two currencies, acting as a bridge asset.Instead of holding local currency in many accounts around the world, banks can instead bring their liquidity for global payments into just one XRP account, the paper argues.\"This singular XRP pool then allows respondent banks to allocate less total liquidity to service the same volume of international payments,\" Ripple writes.Further, this process allows banks to minimize the number of intermediaries involved and their markup on spread, it says.As a result, claims Ripple, respondent banks that use the Ripple network with XRP as a bridge currency can save up to 42% on costs today, and potentially up to 60% as XRP gains usage and volatility decreases.As for whether bitcoin and other blockchain platforms can provide similar savings, Ripple says that\u0027s a \"different story\".The bulk of the report, however, finds Ripple analyzing the ROI of a respondent bank using Ripple in several scenarios.Summarising the problem today, the firm explains that cross-border payments are processed through a chain of banks with each intermediary representing a \"potential point of delay, failure and cost\".Smaller, respondent banks depend on large correspondent banks to provide liquidity for their cross-currency payments, but are required to maintain liquidity in nostro (foreign) accounts with the correspondent banks.The costs of this process make servicing certain types of cross-border payments, such as low-value payments, unprofitable for banks.However, DLT-based solutions like Ripple, enable \"instant, point-to-point settlement\", reducing these liquidity requirements, the firm says. Furthermore, by providing end-to-end visibility, Ripple reduces operational costs associated with reconciling exceptions and failures.For more information, read the full report below:Xrp Cost Model Paper Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.Image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, Ripple Labs, XRP, Banking, News, Distributed Ledger Technology, Companies, Ripple Labs, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 23, 2016 at 5:00 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/18/isitc-blockchain-investment-impact-12-to-18-months-away/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/vQoaaNmzRMDXwEUIr_1F0mPrafk\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/PVVG5SDWLFDITH4GGQPWREHIZY.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"ISITC: Blockchain Investment Impact 12 to 18 Months Away","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Trade processing was historically an inefficient process that involved sending documents between firms via fax and Telex, and manual re-keying of data as it passed from one proprietary trading system to another.Then, in 1991, a group of financial industry leaders and competitors created an advanced standard electronic message format with which to trade mortgage securities. That format is now known as straight-through processing (STP) and the group that created it still exists as the International Securities Association for Institutional Trade Communication (ISITC).The association continues to work to promote operational efficiency in the global securities trading industry, and boasts hundreds of companies from around the globe as members, including BNY Mellon, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.Technology never sits still, however, and once again a new disruptor has arrived that promises to bring further improvements to securities trading – blockchains, also called distributed ledgers.\"Today Blockchain is potentially a new paradigm requiring initially an educational angle for operational and technical teams across the ISITC Membership,\" Nigel Solkhon, CEO of the association’s European arm, told CoinDesk.Solkhon, who is also director, regional product head of execution 2 custody for Citi in London, added:While ISITC believes that blockchain is in its infancy in the securities market, it is accelerating extremely fast, according to Solkhon.\"Should you reflect back to the early 2000s, this was also the challenge perceived for the introduction of the Internet and how long it took for companies and models to be defined and become successful,\" he said.He pointed to the \"enormous\" amount of investment in research and development of blockchain, adding that, though the evolution of the technology may not be not clear today, it will likely become visible in the next 12-18 months.With blockchains being such a new technology, Solkhon framed ISITC Europe’s early role as an educator that will facilitate communication between regulators, partner forums and experts.To that end, he said that the association had already funded London Metropolitan University as an association member – creating a \"pilot link\" between the securities industry and academia.As the level of awareness of the technology, infrastructure and regulatory guidance matures, Solkhon predicted, ISITC Europe will move further into examining at the impact of the resulting technology shift on standards and the supply and value chain, as well as the integration of today’s \"complex industry modus operandi\".On whether or not blockchain technology is a good thing for the securities industry, he explained that the vendor- and member-neutral association is unlikely to propose one technical solution over another, adding:Advocating and making predictions are not the aim, though. From an ISITC perspective as an industry forum, the key hope is that the industry will collaborate and define a common solution, he said.Last week, ISITC Europe held its inaugural meeting on blockchain technology in London. At the event, a new blockchain working group was created and a commitment made to collaborate with other groups engaged in discussions on the technology – specifically when related to operational and technical definitions.For now, ISITC Europe plans to adapt to the new financial work on several levels represented by other new working groups covering regulation, technology and industry players.Imagevia Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, News, Standards, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 18, 2016 at 10:10 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/18/mizuho-microsoft-japan-trial-blockchain-system-for-syndicated-loans/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/agGw5zuiEBeXU-fhcXaML3wzPCQ\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/Q2QXBDBISNFUTBS3KRVQB4K6Q4.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Mizuho, Microsoft Japan Trial Blockchain System for Syndicated Loans","INTRO":"Financial services giant Mizuho has announced a second blockchain technology trial that will focus on syndicated loans.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Financial services giant Mizuho has announced a second blockchain technology trial to be focused on syndicated loans.Announced on 16th February, the project finds Mizuho uniting with other Japan-based companies, including Information Services International-Dentsu (ISID), blockchain startup Currency Port and Microsoft Japan Co, the local subsidiary of the US tech giant.ISID corporate communications officer Kayoko Lee said that the trial is still in early stages, as the partners seek first to \"verify the applicability\" of the technology to the post-trade process using Microsoft’s blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) offering.Lee told CoinDesk:The news follows Mizuho’s partnership with IT consulting firm Cognizant, which will find it working on blockchain applications for internal record-keeping, and further, comes at a time when a number of startups are seeking to apply blockchain tech to syndicated loans.Both Digital Asset Holdings and itBit, for example, list syndicated loans among their business offerings, with the two companies accounting for nearly $90m in total fundraising.Train station image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Asia, Japan, Technology, Microsoft, Mizuho Bank, Banking, News, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 18, 2016 at 3:16 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/17/researchers-argue-radical-redesigns-needed-to-scale-decentralized-blockchains/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/KiyY7Zmp5xlS1iP2sMskUgRFLMc\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/ZF24I5OC7ZCKFBTUDJY4T2XC7I.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Researchers Argue Radical Redesigns Needed to Scale Decentralized Blockchains","INTRO":"A new paper suggests bitcoin will need a major redesign to scale into a mainstream payment network.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A new research paper has put forth the argument that fundamental changes are needed to the design of decentralized blockchain networks should any iteration of the technology serve as a transaction network for global consumers.Entitled \"On Scaling Decentralized Blockchains\", the paper was authored by researchers at Berkeley, Cornell, ETH Zurich University, the National University of Singapore and the University of Maryland, including Christian Decker, co-author of the Duplex Micropayments Channels report; and Ittay Eyal, Adem Efe Gencer and Emin Gün Sirer, authors of the Bitcoin-NG proposal.Though different in intent, both papers were focused on presenting new ideas for how decentralized blockchain networks could scale at a time when the conversation was dominating industry conversation both among major financial institutions, who are seeking to leverage the technology for existing high-volume transaction systems, and bitcoin developers, who are working on solutions to scale the digital currency\u0027s transaction capacity.The increasing popularity of bitcoin as a digital currency has made scalability a \"primary and urgent concern\" for the bitcoin network, the authors say, touching upon a topic that has been hotly debated for months in the bitcoin space.Overall, the position paper analyses how \"fundamental and circumstantial bottlenecks\" in decentralized, public blockchains like bitcoin limit the ability of its current peer-to-peer network of miners to support substantially higher numbers of transactions at lower latencies.Likewise, the paper is not concerned with an analysis of permissioned networks, in which a group of entities or entity manages a blockchain-based ledger system in a more centralized manner.The group\u0027s new analysis will be presented at the Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2016 conference, which is being held from 22nd to 26th February in Barbados.The statements in the paper echo previous comments from some of the team members, who have been critical about scaling issues they believe are inherent in bitcoin\u0027s current design and short-term improvement proposals.Back in September 2015, some of the researchers spoke to CoinDesk about the \"inherent problems\" in blockchain design.Ittay Eyal, for example, said then his work on Bitcoin-NG arose over fundamental issues with the design of blockchains that will make scaling any implementation, public or private, a challenge.He told CoinDesk at the time:Notably, in the same month, Eyal also made an appearance at the Scaling Bitcoin event in Montreal, where he introduced Bitcoin-NG as a kind of radical attempt to scale decentralized blockchain networks to match the ambitious of those excited about the technology.Overall, the paper looks at whether decentralized blockchains can be scaled up to match the performance of a mainstream payment processors, and how they might achieve such functionality.The team went on to make three contributions that illuminate the problem of scaling bitcoin and blockchains generally, and offer ways to achieve high-performance, decentralized systems:Supported by their measurement studies, the authors suggest that \"more aggressive\" scaling will, in the longer term, require fundamental redesign to bitcoin\u0027s protocol.They go on to suggest a variety of \"potentially successful\" approaches to such scaling, categorizing some recently proposed and new ideas, and posing a number of open technical challenges for the community going forward.In conclusion, the paper suggests that the process of reworking the parameters of block size and transaction intervals is only a first step toward achieving \"next-generation, high-load blockchain protocols\", and that for bitcoin to make major advances it will require a \"basic rethinking\" of the underlying code.Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.Image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Academic Research, News, Scalability, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 17, 2016 at 9:22 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/17/new-australian-political-party-seeks-to-popularize-blockchain-voting/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/AXu3tuUBg_v6xSkbKLuWrG_E5D4\u003d/570x416/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/QIPI4WLFH5EM7AR7ZLJE3OWZMI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"New Australian Political Party Seeks to Popularize Blockchain Voting","INTRO":"A new Australian political party has proposed the introduction of a blockchain-based voting system that would govern actions of lawmakers.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A new Australian political party has proposed the introduction of a token-based political system based on the concept of decentralised blockchain technology.Called the Flux Party, the new entity has already attracted more than the 500 members it needs to potentially place senate candidates on ballots in all the country\u0027s states. However, the party\u0027s immediate goal is to try and elect six senators, according to Reuters.Notably, the Flux Party will be free of its own policies, instead opting for its senators to vote for or against legislation at the bidding of token holders.Party co-founder Max Kaye told the news source:At election time, the bitcoin-like tokens would be issued to Flux members – as well as single-issue campaigners that support the party. The tokens can then be used either use to vote, trade with others or give to trusted third parties to carry out proxy votes.The results of the voting would be distributed proportionately – for example, with an 80% to 20% vote in favor of a bill, five Flux senators would vote for and one against.Suggesting that the current democratic system is too antiquated for the Internet era, Kaye told Reuters that, while ministers sometimes do not have expertise on all issues, they are trusted with making vital decisions on policies affecting environmental or monetary policy.The Flux Party system would mean that large numbers of of voters could effectively grant their votes to experts such as scientists or economists on these issues.Describing itself as a \"layer for the redistribution of political power\", Flux says on its website:While Flux\u0027s proposed voting system is potentially workable, bitcoin expert Dr Adrian Lee from the University of Technology Sydney told Reuters the absence of a legal mechanism to ensure senators vote as directed could be problematic for the party.The concept of blockchain-based voting systems is not a new one.

It’s permissioned, while you have access you’re only allowed to see what you’re allowed to see based on permissioned, and you can perform business logic on the ledger.\"The latter attribute, he said, will allow users to create transactions that have logic, such as programmable contracts that would govern how an asset would be managed over a specific length of time or under certain conditions.\"The fabric enables a ledger, it enables a network to be created,\" he added.In its release, IBM elaborated on technical details, stating the service will feature a \"pluggable architecture\" to allow users to experiment with different software modules; cryptographic identity management tools and smart contracts written in Java and Golang; and privacy and confidentiality controls that allow users to specify who can view and execute smart contracts.The functionality differs greatly from current public blockchains, such as bitcoin and Ethereum, in which any participant can join the network and participate in its operation. Further, its smart contract offerings are written in more familiar development languages, whereas Ethereum, for example, uses wholly new languages.The BaaS offering also features some overlap with its work on the Hyperledger Project, a separate collaborative effort that has so far united 30 industry stakeholders, including startups, financial incumbents and potential end-users of the technology, all with the goal of creating an open-source blockchain offering.IBM’s consensus algorithm, Cuomo remarked, will use 44,000 lines of code it has contributed to the Hyperledger Project as a founding member, but remain a distinct offering due to its value-added services.\"Everything we use is all based on that code, other than the value on top of it,\" Cuomo said. \"What we’ve added is the ability to orchestrate and stand up a blockchain network, [and] a set of samples and we have another set of services planned.\"As an example of what this test environment allows, IBM included a sample blockchain application on its website in which developers can experiment with asset transactions.\"We have a simple example called a ‘Marbles App’, that allows you to create an exchange for creating and exchanging marbles. This helps developers understand the basics for blockchain, the definition of an asset, in this case it’s a marble of different size and color, and the ability to exchange assets between members,\" Cuomo said.IBM intends to launch additional demos on its website, with its page displaying as-yet-unlaunched demos including a \"Smart Contract Investigator\", which will allow developers to experiment with smart contracts; and a \"Car Lease Demo\" that will provide an overview of blockchain-based supply chain applications.Cuomo framed the service as one that would enable users to collaborate within its cloud, stating that users can use the technology to connect with peers.As with the Azure service, the offering is still in testing, opening to developers first with the goal of scaling it so that, eventually, production versions of blockchains created within the offering can be launched publicly.Cuomo cited Japan Exchange Group as a company with such aims, working on proofs-of-concepts (POCs) aimed at innovating on systems for the exchange of low-liquidity assets. “They’re starting using our test services with the goal of graduating,” he added.According to Nikkei, Japan Exchange Group intends to release a report on the initial fundings of the study based on its work with the service later this year, while LSE indicated it intends to create projects aimed at managing risk and promoting transparency in global marketsHere again, Cuomo acknowledged there is some overlap between Hyperledger and IBM’s work, as Japan Exchange Group is also working on the former project\u0027s technical committee, in part, because of its aspiration to include regulators in its projects.\"The exchanges getting involved want to make sure their regulators have access to the code, so they’re involved in the Hyperledger Project. But we’re working with them with our hosted services,\" Cuomo said.Cuomo went on to suggest that he sees such business activity around both IBM’s consensus algorithm and the Hyperledger Project sending a positive signal to regulators, as its clients want to ensure their projects meet the approval of global government agencies.He added:Key to IBM’s offerings, Cuomo said, will be their ability to leverage existing offerings such as IBM z Systems, its system of mainframe computers and distributed server technologies.On its website, IBM touts that its z Systems offering could take blockchain performance to \"new levels\" given that the system can handle \"massive amounts of transaction data\".\"Accelerate time to value and reduce complexity and cost by accessing System of Record transactional systems and data already on z Systems,\" the company’s \"How Can IBM Help?\" section of its blockchain domain reads.Cuomo said that z Systems would allow users to \"tune their fabric\", encrypting transactions as they’re passed along the network and validated by peers.\"z Systems has been known for its ability to perform cryptography at high scale, so the system should be able to scale more readily when run on z Systems. It looks like a platform that was made for this workload,\" he added.Coming soon, the company plans to launch its IBM Blockchain DevOps service, which Cuomo said would allow clients to set up mini-blockchain networks in as little as 12 seconds.To help its potential clients better understand these aspects of its technology in the meantime, IBM is launching IBM Bluemix Garages in London, New York, Singapore and Tokyo that will seek to provide in-person support to developers looking to design and implement blockchain POCs.There, Cuomo said IBM will offer clients the chance to engage in “90-minute interactive sessions” with subject matter experts who can help them make their ideas actionable at impressive speeds. Telepresence and web conferences are also available to clients.Cuomo believes clients will find value in that they will be able to use his team’s knowledge to quickly make the technology actionable.He concluded:More information on IBM’s full range of offerings can be found here.Images via IBM","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, IBM, Technology, Microsoft, Hyperledger, Companies, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 17, 2016 at 1:20 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/16/7-asian-banks-investigating-bitcoin-and-blockchain-tech/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/fyJhzSMWY2u6_RkgJHa6CLNj0_8\u003d/570x423/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/QC4Z22KQGJERJMQ6JTVKA5FOY4.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"7 Asian Banks Investigating Bitcoin and Blockchain Tech","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"UPDATE (17th February 15:40 GMT): Added detail on SBI Group\u0027s recent investment announcements._____Until recently, there was a noticeable lack of interest in bitcoin and the blockchain among the financial institutions of Asia. In fact, banks there were more likely to be issuing warnings about digital currencies than getting involved in any related activity.It was the fall of Mt Gox in Japan and the Chinese central bank\u0027s crackdown on bitcoin exchanges, events that both took place in 2014, that resulted in early barriers among financial institutions in those nations.However, the recent upsurge in the popularity of blockchain technology in the global finance sector seems to have at least somewhat laid those concerns to rest. Now, the region\u0027s banking sector is showing the same growing enthusiasm for the tech\u0027s disruptive potential in banking that can be seen in Europe and North America.Evidence of this sea change can be seen in the number of large financial institutions in China, Japan and Korea that have recently moved to launch or support initiatives involving blockchain and digital currency, and develop proofs of concept around forward-looking applications of the technology.In this article, we look at which banks are engaging with the technology in the region.At the start of this month, Japan\u0027s Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG) revealed that it has developed its own digital currency nicknamed \"MUFG coin\" as part of its research into blockchain and distributed ledger technology.The initiative was set up to replicate the peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange and mobile-wallet functionality that bitcoin provides, but without relying on its distributed network of miners.MUFG began the project in the autumn of 2015, with the aim of decreasing the costs of managing financial transactions, particularly in the case of P2P transfers and remittances.The country\u0027s largest bank, MUFG ranked eighth among the world\u0027s largest banks in total assets by Relbanks.com.South Korea\u0027s KB Kookmin Bank announced just this week that it is developing a blockchain solution for international remittances with the aim of offering \"safer and faster\" money transmission services.The initiative, which is being carried out in partnership with local bitcoin startup Coinplug, is built on the premise of eliminating intermediary services involved in international SWIFT bank transfers, with an eye to offer cheaper consumer-facing services as a result.A bank spokesperson remarked at the time:Kookmin has also announced plans to develop a blockchain-based \"overseas fund transfer and data storage service\" that can be used for verification when opening online bank accounts.KB Kookmin Bank is the largest subsidiary of KP Financial group, which according to its 2014 annual report earned KRW 1.4tn ($1.16bn) in revenue from more than 30 million customers.As 2015 drew to a close, news emerged of a blockchain partnership between Singapore\u0027s DBS Bank and multinational banking firm Standard Chartered.With the aim of creating a distributed ledger project for trade finance, officials at both firms told Bloomberg that they have completed initial testing for the idea, and that they are seeking to collaborate with other firms on the initiative over the course of 2016.While details are sketchy, DBS and Standard Chartered are considering various distributed ledger technologies to achieve project goals.Furthermore, both banks have reportedly been investigating applications for the technology since as early as May of this year, according to a blog post by R3CEV co-founder Todd McDonald.DBS Bank is Southeast Asia\u0027s largest bank, reporting $319b in total assets as of September 2015.In December, Japan\u0027s SBI Sumishin Net Bank announced that it is developing a proof-of-concept aimed at exploring blockchain-based banking services in conjunction with Nomura Research Institute (NRI), the research arm of Nomura Holdings.While details on the initiative are scarce, NRI said it will seek to \"examine business scenarios\" with the goal of preparing a prototype for SBI Sumishin.However, it is known that Dragonfly Fintech Pte, a blockchain firm, will assist in the project\u0027s development.In statements, NRI senior management director Minoru Yokote cited the project as an example of how the organization is seeking to embrace distributed financial technologies.Yokote said:SBI Investment also announced on 29th January that it has agreed to invest $5m in Payward, the parent company of the Kraken bitcoin exchange.On the same day, SBI announced a second agreement to invest an undisclosed amount in distributed ledger tech startup Ripple and to establish a joint venture company with the firm that will operate in Asia.An investment in Japanese exchange bitFlyer may also be on the cards according to the groups Q3 financial results for the last financial year.SBI Sumishinis a recent joint venture between Japan’s largest trust bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, and SBI Holdings.Founded in 1965, NRI is Japan\u0027s oldest private think tank, offering consulting services and provides IT solutions for various industries, including finance.Last month, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the country\u0027s central bank, suggested it is considering the launch of its own digital currency, which may or may not use blockchain technology.The PBoC revealed in a 20th January release that it had held a meeting discussing the possibility, which had included central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan and deputy governor Fan Yifei, as well as a group of \"relevant research institutions, major financial institutions and advisory bodies of experts\".The central bank also received input from Citibank and Deloitte, as it weighed up how to issue the digital currency.Notably, the central bank put together a team dedicated to digital currency research in 2014 – the work of which played into the Beijing meeting.Late last year, the R3CEV consortium announced that yet more institutions had joined its roster of 25 banks (now over 40) that were working with the group to investigate and develop use cases for distributed ledger technology.One of those institutions was Japan\u0027s Mizuho Bank, which notably has a long track record of engaging with the bitcoin industry, having served as a banking partner for bankrupt bitcoin exchange Mt Gox. Indeed, Mizuho is currently embroiled in ongoing lawsuits related to that ill-fated partnership.Mizuho joined R3 in October, indication in statements that the bank saw the potential for \"improved banking service in every aspect\".\"Distributed ledger technologies might become the next disruptive technology that has the potential to innovate everyday banking activities,\" Toshitsugu Okabe, deputy president \u0026 executive officer for the bank\u0027s Incubation Project Team, said at the timeBlockchain remittance startup Streami closed a $2m seed funding round last December that notably included among its backers Shinhan Bank, one of South Korea\u0027s largest financial services providers. The bank committed roughly $427,000 to the funding round.By targeting the Asian remittance market from South Korea to China, Streami seeks to help people bypass illegal money transmission services in the area. Shinhan Bank is headquartered in Seoul, South Korea.

Very little innovation has taken place in the post trade clearing/settlement environment and even less when it comes to trading between counterparties. The FIX protocol helped usher in the world of high frequency/algorithmic trading but was to limited to only trade execution.Blockchain is just one of a number of technological innovations such as machine learning/AI, multi-tenant cloud architectures, and Big Database platforms, that have the potential to liberate markets from incumbent players and start the process of real – not phantom – liquidity generation away from market makers and investment banks and toward the infrastructure of the market itself.A major ancillary benefit is that a series of expensive, time-consuming activities could be dramatically reduced for hedge funds with the adoption of distributed ledger technology. A blockchain-based ledger would be continuously updated, secure and available to all permissioned participants. This would obviate the need to constantly communicate data back and forth between hedge funds and their trading counter parties and subsequently reduce the need to reconcile that data and store it ad infinitum.Whether it is transforming traditional clearing/settlement cycles or supporting the price discovery/liquidity process across non-equity asset classes, investment banks (eg: Goldman Sachs), emerging technology players (eg: Digital Asset Holdings), exchanges (eg: Nasdaq Linq) and market data vendors (eg: MarkIT) recognize the opportunity and are positioning themselves accordingly.Blockchain-based technology represents just one aspect of a wider, more fundamental shift in the infrastructure of the global financial markets. As mentioned previously, the post-trade lifecycle has remained a largely innovation-free zone since the creation of Euroclear (arguably the last major post-trade innovation).Now, a host of commercial imperatives are driving the adoption of new technologies such as blockchain, not least among them the impact of regulation on banks\u0027 – particularly investment banks\u0027 – returns on capital.Instead of using their balance sheets and trading acumen as a competitive advantage, regulation is driving banks to look at technology as a means to achieve more stable, less volatile shareholder returns by morphing into utility-type players. It is no surprise Goldman wants to consider itself a \"technology business”. The adjacent benefit of being a utility is that you see \u0027flow\u0027 and that itself may open up other monetizable opportunities.Disruptive technology is where the future lies; and where everyone in the market appears to be long-term greedy.Image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, banks, hedge funds, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/12/one-of-south-koreas-biggest-banks-is-developing-blockchain-remittances/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/uWICkW-m2LC3zbVORCSvjKYXIvo\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/UHR4JPNFJZCUHLYVXUZWBGZ674.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"One of South Korea\u0027s Biggest Banks is Developing Blockchain Remittances","INTRO":"South Korea\u0027s KB Kookmin Bank is developing a blockchain remittance solution with the aim of ushering in \"safer and faster\" foreign exchange services.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"South Korea\u0027s KB Kookmin Bank is developing a blockchain solution for international remittances with the aim of ushering in \"safer and faster\" foreign exchange services.For the initiative, the commercial bank said it is partnering with local bitcoin startup Coinplug to utilise patents the firm holds in the field.In statements, KB Kookmin Bank explained that banks currently send overseas remittances via the SWIFT network, which sends payments through an intermediary before they arrive at the beneficiary institution.However, utilising blockchain technology avoids the intermediary, and could reduce costs and result in possible savings for the customer, the bank said.A bank spokesperson remarked:KB Kookmin Bank is the largest subsidiary of KP Financial group, which according to KB\u0027s 2014 annual report, it earned KRW 1.4tn ($1.16bn) in revenue from more than 30 million customers, an amount it estimates is more than half the population of Korea.In the same announcement, Kookmin also announced plans to develop an \"overseas fund transfer and data storage service\" that can be used for verification when opening online bank accounts.This new offering will also be based on distributed ledger technology, the bank said.According to the company, the move follows a shift in stance by Korea\u0027s Financial Service Committee that has enabled online verification to be used for this purpose, a new policy it said aims to promote online financial services and encourage financial start-ups.Coinplug provides Koreans with a variety of bitcoin services, such as in-store card schemes and digital currency purchases via standard ATMs. The company has closed a number of funding rounds which have raised at least $8m since late 2013.Korea image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, South Korea, Coinplug, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 12, 2016 at 8:01 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/12/nasdaq-to-launch-blockchain-voting-trial-for-estonian-stock-market/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/v6j29GVrU6zjCe7ozdsx3sl_l8o\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/Q6LNGVZ5R5HMVL57QTQY4SH664.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Nasdaq to Launch Blockchain Voting Trial for Estonian Stock Market","INTRO":"Stock market giant Nasdaq has announced it is developing a shareholder voting system based on blockchain tech.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Global stock market giant Nasdaq has announced it is developing an electronic shareholder voting system based on blockchain technology.According to Nasdaq representatives, the trial marks the first steps in a project that would allow shareholders of companies listed on the Nasdaq OMX Tallinn Stock Exchange – Estonia\u0027s only regulated securities market – to more frequently participate in voting processes.Currently, they suggested, these processes are out of touch with the needs of the market.In comments to CoinDesk, officials connected to the project cited statistics that show shareholder engagement in public company voting is low, with roughly 1% of shareholders participating in acts of governance such as general meetings.Representatives said Estonia’s market is ideal for testing the system, as Nasdaq will have access to investor data through the country\u0027s e-Residency platform, meaning it will be able to create voting accounts for users. They further cited the country’s love of IT innovation as a sign it would potentially gain support, and upon completion, wider use.Nasdaq president Hans-Ole Jochumsen said in a statement:The announcement marks the company\u0027s second formal blockchain project, following the debut of Nasdaq Linq, a product that seeks to ease the issuance and management of shares in private companies, and that is currently open to a small group of initial test users.Apart from the broad vision of the project, however, Nasdaq was not forthcoming with design details.Company representatives did not disclose the type of blockchain technology they are seeking to leverage as part of the process, nor if they were engaging with any service providers from the industry on the trial.Neither did they comment as to how any end product might look, though statements hint at the desired functionality for users.For example, the representatives said the goal is for users to be able to identify themselves for purposes of shareholder voting from their home or office, suggesting there may be a mobile aspect to the project.Today, they also expressed their belief that the company is using a platform which offers limited functionality due to the need for voters to be physically present, or otherwise appoint a proxy to facilitate this execution of their rights.Nasdaq said it hopes to complete the project sometime in 2016.Tallin image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Nasdaq, Estonia, News, capital markets, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 12, 2016 at 6:15 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/12/asx-details-blockchain-strategy-in-financial-update/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/fkAcsgUiXSL0ra4NRF-auHmYoQU\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/CDN6MAOMVBAZ3KCR3TEC3K3QNM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"ASX Details Blockchain Strategy in Financial Update","INTRO":"The Australian Securities Exchange has revealed its spending as it prepares to build blockchain solutions to improve the Australian equities market.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) has revealed new details about its effort to innovate in the Australian equities market with blockchain technology.The ASX is now actively working on a technology transformation programme that will employ blockchain (distributed ledger) technology to potentially replace its equities settlement systems.In its half-yearly results, the group said it incurred AU$18.7m on capital expenditure during the period ending 31st December 2015, compared to $13m in the previous period.That expenditure was primarily spent on the technology transformation program – which will see a replacement developed for the ASX\u0027s futures and cash market trading platform – as well as the enhanced risk management platform.

Headquartered in Frankfurt Rhein-Main, the group had 4,540 employees at the close of 2014, and received a net revenue of over €2bn in the last financial year.The move to explore blockchain is perhaps unsurprising given the fact that the German financial giant\u0027s business covers the whole process chain, from securities and derivatives trading, to clearing, settlement and custody.According to Heiner Seidel, a spokesperson for the group, Deutsche Börse has been interested in blockchains for some time, but is still looking for the best way to approach the technology.Seidel told CoinDesk:In a new interview, Seidel spoke more candidly about the efforts ongoing at Deutsche Börse and its developing thesis on the technology.Intriguingly, Seidel noted the group is already working on multiple proofs of concept for the technology.\"Since early 2015, we have a dedicated project which has been analyzing the market, identified potential use cases and [that] even developed some prototypes,\" he said.Rather than risking focusing on any single use case for the tech, the group is taking a broad view of the possibilities for distributed ledgers across a number of its business lines.While research and development into blockchain-based systems may be ongoing, providing infrastructure for financial firms places responsibilities on the group and its services in terms of efficiency, security and robustness.\"As operator of critical market infrastructure,\" Seidel said, \"we have to fulfill certain business requirements to ensure orderly trading and clearing.\"The comments echo findings from Aite Group, which has found that issues with interoperability between existing and legacy systems was likely to be a bigger concern for financial institutions as they move forward with the technology.Echoing some criticisms that have been directed at bitcoin\u0027s blockchain in recent months, he continued:Going forward, the group has plans to get more deeply involved in the blockchain space, according to Seidel, and will take a \"three-dimensional\" approach to achieve this aim.Firstly, the ongoing internal development of software and applications based on the group\u0027s IT expertise as a market operator is set to continue.He further explained Deutsche Börse intends to participate in industry consortiums and efforts such as the Hyperledger Project, an open-source project to create a blockchain fabric for businesses led by the Linux Foundation.Formerly known as the Open Ledger Project, the Hyperledger Project was first revealed in December as a cross-industry initiative boasting participants such as Cisco and IBM as well as blockchain industry startups such as Digital Asset and R3CEV. This week, the project announced that it now has 30 members on board.Finally, as evidenced by the recent investment in Digital Asset, Deutsche Börse is open to acquiring stakes in FinTech startups, stating it will do so \"where appropriate and reasonable\".Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.Image via Wikipedia","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, News, capital markets, Deutsche Börse, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 11, 2016 at 9:29 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/11/linux-ibm-share-bold-vision-for-hyperledger-project-a-blockchain-fabric-for-business/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/mTJlcGfeucUbIxQwv6no69pTue0\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/XM6H2UXY4FD7BG3ZEFY5WYPIJQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Linux, IBM Share Bold Vision for Hyperledger Project, a Blockchain Fabric for Business","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"No longer a group of thinkers and entrepreneurs on the fringe, the proponents of blockchain technology are growing in number, boosted by new attention from the media, financial institutions, professional services firms and, most recently, major tech giants.The development comes amid reports that the blockchain market could expand to account for more business in the coming years, with Aite Group projecting it could be worth as much as $400m in annual business by 2019.However, how this market takes shape, and which technology providers start to generate actual revenue, is less clear given the variety of new projects arising – from consortiums composed of financial institutions to open-source collaborations. What\u0027s more, each of these groups boasts a who’s-who list of well-known backers.Entering this market is the Hyperledger Project, an ambitious attempt to unite the industry’s technologists with those seeking to leverage the technology. The effort intends to follow the open approach to innovation that has propelled the adoption of projects such as Linux, the popular open-source operating system that has led to the creation of $1bn companies such as Red Hat, which delivers Linux solutions for enterprise firms.So far, a broad selection of institutions interested in the technology has voiced support for the Hyperledger project, which is described in statements as an \"open-source project to advance blockchain technology\" under the oversight of the Linux Foundation, and with participation from 30 partners, including startups, banks and IT firms.The development comes at a time when major financial institutions have continually voiced their confidence in permissioned or private blockchain networks that limit the parties involved in the operation of a distributed ledger, while at the same time criticizing public versions of blockchain technology – such as that underlying bitcoin – as ill-equipped to handle the requirements of businesses.As put forth by Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s vice president of blockchain technologies and a participant in the initiative, the Hyperledger Project aims to apply the ideas behind the blockchain to a wider variety of use cases.Cuomo told CoinDesk:According to Jim Zemlin, the Linux Foundation’s executive director, the discussion is currently taking shape around high-level questions, such as how the very different blockchain consensus algorithms in use today could be leveraged for a solution that maximizes the efforts of those who are developing code.\"What I see is a complete willingness for these entities to genuinely collaborate on technology decisions, even if it’s not their own,\" he said.Hyperledger has so far received code from three industry stakeholders, including Blockstream, a development company building solutions that extend the capabilities of the bitcoin blockchain; Ripple, the developer of a public, permissioned distributed ledger aimed at cross-border payments; and Digital Asset Holdings, a blockchain startup seeking to innovate in capital markets.Also contributing code has been IBM, which in recent weeks has been increasingly vocal about its position on how an open, innovative approach is needed to create a true platform for value exchange and why today\u0027s blockchain tech falls short of meeting the needs of the business market.Among the doubts facing Hyperledger is a perceived lack of clarity on what might be ultimately produced by the initiative.Zemlin acknowledged that exactly how the project will move toward a specific solution is unclear, but that this is intended so those parties wanting to be involved can determine the best path forward.\"One things about these communities is that they’re organic. What is clear is that they want to establish an open blockchain infrastructure. They, as a technical community, will be defining the scope of that effort,\" Zemlin said.Zemlin, who has been executive director at the Linux Foundation since 2007, positioned the developing conversation as one that is focused on applying blockchain to use cases such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and digital rights management.This inclusive approach was echoed by Cuomo, who said that the goal of the project lies not in making existing solutions compatible, but in designing a new solution that allows for both privacy and auditing.Cuomo said:Cuomo described Hyperledger as an exploration of the characteristics of blockchains, noting that all are shared ledgers that support transactions, and that have specific ways of enabling the replication of data across the network, as well as who can approve that data.\"They all have these basic elements, they all have the same DNA, they just mutate the gene here and there,\" he added.When asked how development teams representing public blockchain projects may benefit from participation in Hyperledger, Zemlin was less clear, stressing that those involved see a value in sharing ideas and bringing a mature technology to market.\"I’m having conversations with all of them,\" Zemlin said. \"It’s not, \u0027If we don’t use my toys, then we’re going to go home.\u0027 I think they see a group of technologies trying to create an underlying platform.\"Cuomo said he sees all participants benefiting, even if the tokens that run on their public blockchains aren’t used prominently, as it would advance innovation on the concepts underlying a new type of technology.\"I see bitcoin and Ripple as applications of blockchain. I think they would all benefit on some level, on doing some innovation on core blockchain,\" he said.Cuomo went on to suggest that the Hyperledger Project itself would benefit from taking a longer view on the technology, one he believes could be used in everything from global supply chains to governmental social security programs.\"The next-generation systems of record are going to be around for a long time,\" he continued. \"Looking at the pioneers, the bitcoins and Ethereums have done some nice work building on the applications, [but now] there’s an opportunity to step back.\"The comments are notable given the nature of public blockchain networks, in which holders of the tokens, or individual units of data that run on the protocols, are often considered by supporters as investment opportunities that may benefit from how their systems come to be used by enterprise business.Notably, Ripple is not formally participating in the initiative as of yet, though it has donated code.Ripple CEO Chris Larsen told CoinDesk:In addition to the accumulated code, Cuomo noted that Hyperledger has launched a website, Hyperledger.org, where information on the effort will continue to be made available.\"Over the next couple weeks, we’re going to be putting together an architecture that puts the code into a solution. At that point, we already have information on the site, where people can read about blockchain for business. After that, they’ll be able to start downloading code for the foundation,\" he said.As for how useable the code should be to end users given the youthfulness of the technology, Cuomo said users will still need some expertise.Cuomo suggested that those using the code could even be involved in consortium models, such as those popularized by R3CEV, which has signed up more than 40 banks to develop its own \"Global Fabric for Finance\".Likewise, Zemlin spoke to the need for neutral parties to help facilitate open-source development of such a system by managing communal trademarks and other assets.The Hyperledger Project, for instance, is also composed of a Technical Steering Committee (TSC), which will evaluate code contributions, as well as an as-yet-unelected Governing Board that will manage the Hyperledger branding, which was donated by Digital Asset.Both Zemlin and Cuomo alluded to the overall benefits open-source collaboration, citing past examples as evidence that Hyperledger could come to yield powerful technology.For example, Zemlin noted that the mobile industry has embraced Android, with many of the participants in this platform contributing code that has come to have unforeseen benefits beyond initial expectations.“[Android users] contributed code to the project to boost the battery power efficiency, and when they improved it, that same exact code was being used on high-performance computing systems [to reduce] millions of dollars in the cost of computing for data centers,” he said, adding:Zemlin said he believes Hyperledger could come to support a new wave of exchange platforms and financial applications, but that a unified approach is needed to move these ideas forward.In this light, he likened the initiative to a drive to create an iPhone that could come to support a variety of blockchains as plentiful as today\u0027s apps.Cuomo, in turn, said that the vision was to create an effort where companies could \"plug value\" into the platform after it is established.Still, Zemlin alluded to the somewhat opaque nature of public statements on blockchain in general, in which entities seem to suggest they can \"say ledger and blockchain\" and \"wave a wand\" to produce a solution.Zemlin concluded:Blocks image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, IBM, Technology, Hyperledger, Linux Foundation, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 11, 2016 at 10:38 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/10/online-retailer-overstock-spent-8-million-on-blockchain-projects-in-2015/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Y5lA5EBwoyAK0I43JgNeD0Wge9c\u003d/570x445/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/EUN7PSCKTREAPBZXPLGHEFC4RI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Online Retailer Overstock Spent $8 Million on Blockchain Projects in 2015","INTRO":"Online retailer Overstock.com has announced that it spent $8m last year on its blockchain-backed securities trading initiative.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Online retailer Overstock.com spent $8m last year on its blockchain-backed securities trading initiative.In a statement to investors, CEO Patrick Byrne wrote that the firm spent $6m more than originally anticipated on its blockchain research.

Bank after bank has headed down the path of, firstly, finding that blockchains offer intriguing possibilities, then, secondly, initiating their own research projects or joining consortia to develop proofs of concept en masse.But in the general positive hubbub of late, there have been a small but growing number of sceptical voices calling out the burgeoning blockchain space and the media for over-hyping the potential of distributed ledger technology.By doing so, they warn that banks could be falling into the same pattern of overpromising and underdelivering that seems to have stalled digital currency efforts.Writing in the FT\u0027s Alphaville blog, noted blogger on all things financial, Izabella Kaminska recalls that the blockchain conversation was pervasive at Davos this year.However, in her reporting, she sought to paint such discussion as juvenile and uninformed, writing:Kaminska is not convinced about the cost benefits of blockchains, however.It is \"imprudent\" to make that claim, she writes, without there being any real proof of a working private blockchain and \"the nearest candidate, the bitcoin blockchain, encountering ever greater cost and scaling challenges by the day\".The comments are a reference to the ongoing debates about how to best scale the bitcoin network, up from the three-to-seven transactions it processes a second today.Further, she points out that all blockchains have thus far been subsidised by funding rounds or speculative investors and eventually those investors will want returns.\"The jury’s still out on whether they’ll get that,\" she says.\"It’s getting out of control,\" says David Birch of Consult Hyperion, who makes a plea for some rationality in the dialogue on distributed ledgers in a new piece for Finextra.In an article titled \"It\u0027s time to take a stand against all the blockchain crap out there\", Birch writes:As well as a general lack of understanding over the terminology, Birch raises concerns over the utility of blockchains, which are widely touted as being able to disrupt a wide range of industries and potentially to change the world for the better.While conceding that there is \"no doubt\" that blockchains are an interesting way to implement \"one particular kind of shared ledger\", and the permissionless innovation environment unleashes tremendous creativity, \"it’s a big step from that to ending world hunger\", he says.A trio of authors over at the Open Data Institute (ODI), the UK-based non-profit dedicated to preserving an open tech culture, have come to a similar conclusion.They recognise in a recent response to the UK government\u0027s Chief Scientific Advisor\u0027s blockchain report, that blockchains do have potential in building confidence in government services through audibility, and also have a place in the collection and publishing of distributed data. Smart contracts are further singled out for their potential.However, they suggested that some people may be trying to shoehorn the technology into places where it is not necessarily needed, or in use cases where it is not appropriate or possible for a successful marriage of systems and concepts.Putting personal data into blockchains could also create significant new privacy issues if misused, they add.\"New technologies go through a hype cycle,\" they write. \"The challenge near the beginning of that cycle is to identify the uses and applications that will stand the test of time. Like most new technologies, blockchains could cause significant damage if used indiscriminately.\"The ODI team concludes:R3 research director Tim Swanson has put forth a similar criticism, suggesting that the technology has \"jumped the shark\" in a January slide deck, the phrase a reference to an episode of \"Happy Days\" that is viewed as the point where the series was no longer creatively relevant.Swanson told CoinDesk that the message of the deck is aimed at the new community working on permissioned blockchain solutions, which he fears may run into the same \"expectations management\" issues as the bitcoin industry has.\"If we’re responsible in the statements we’re making publicly, we’ll avoid the over-promising, under-delivering of the virtual currency space,\" he said.Swanson cautioned that those seeking to popularize blockchain tech\u0027s use in database management should pass on this caution to their clients.Should the blockchain space fail in this regard, Swanson worries that the industry could face a funding crunch.Investors, he said, are already wary of the space given the sky-high funding rounds of the bitcoin industry, and what he characterized as a lack of movement on those deliverables.He added:There seems to be little doubt that blockchains will play some part in our future systems, or at least inform the future of database systems.Major institutions such as Nasdaq and the Australian Securities Exchange are already undertaking blockchain projects that could see real-world usage in the very near future. Other blockchain services like the timestamping of documents and media are already out there as usable apps.Yet, perhaps the sceptics have a point when they say that the technology is generally yet to prove itself.For all the talk of disruption, many proofs-of-concept remain stuck in the lab, and it remains to be seen if their expectations can live up to the reality.Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.Image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Media, R3CEV, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 10, 2016 at 5:26 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/09/financial-stability-board-seeks-better-understanding-of-blockchain-tech/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/PUR_tjeQXg9kiV2et6ZnhxkjBa8\u003d/570x401/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/WF4NS7BBDFCN7F6CYTJQGGR64M.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Financial Stability Board Seeks \u0027Better Understanding\u0027 of Blockchain Tech","INTRO":"The Financial Stability Board, a group of central bank governors and financial regulators, has begun working on blockchain technology issues.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The Financial Stability Board (FSB), a group of central bank governors and financial regulators from the world’s major economies, has begun working on blockchain technology issues.The work was disclosed in a speech given by Subhash Sheoratan Mundra, the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the country’s central bank.Mundra, who was speaking at a regional banking conference on 4th February, brought up digital currencies and blockchain technology in the context of competition in payments from non-bank entities.Declaring that “a massive disruption is possible”, Mundra went on to suggest that banks “would need to either develop own capability or seek proper alliances”, a possible reference to the consortia financial institutions have formed in the past year to investigate blockchain or distributed ledger technology.Mundra went on to disclose that the FSB has begun work on the technology, telling the audience:The FSB was formed in 2009 in the wake of the global financial panic, and is aimed at guiding international policy decisions.

Gray, on the other hand, described Microsoft’s goal as helping facilitate interaction between clients and protocol-level blockchain providers\"We\u0027re looking at places where we’re not competing with our customers and partners, but we’re trying to be that platform company we’ve traditionally been,\" Gray explained.In this light, he categorized the work ongoing at companies such as Accenture, Deloitte, Ernst \u0026 Young and KPMG as more focused on their traditional domain – applying blockchain technology to business use cases, an area in which he doesn’t believe Microsoft can, or should, compete.\"Vertical expertise will come from our traditional vertical partners,\" Gray said. \"You’re not going to see us writing an equities trading platform.\"Instead, Gray lauded Microsoft\u0027s product for its success allowing partners to provide potential clients with access to their technology in a way that \"provides rapid feedback\" and allows them to more quickly respond to customer demand.In a blog post, Gray summarized this strategy as one that allows users to \"fail fast and cheap\".As for how Microsoft sees its efforts in contrast to consortiums formed by major banks, Gray sought to position the tech giant as providing a neutral, \"Switzerland-type\" environment for development.Alongside development sandboxes, consortiums have emerged as an increasingly favored path for banks and financial institutions seeking to better understand the technology. The most famous to date, R3CEV, has so far signed up 42 banks to its effort, and is seeking to expand its mandate beyond this demographic.But, these networks aren’t optimized to handle participants\u0027 every need, Gray contends.Consortia projects, he believes, can leverage the Azure platform to offset the need for traditional types of trust agreements in permissioned blockchain networks.While bitcoin’s blockchain has an almost Darwinian \u0027every entity for itself\u0027 environment commonly termed “trustless”, consortiums so far seem interested in replicating existing trust-based relationships in a distributed ledger environment.One concrete example where Microsoft\u0027s services can serve as an arbiter, Gray said, is in cryptographic key storage.\"When a consortium owns the keys to the kingdom, they can be kept on Azure and not by an individual bank,\" he said. \"They may want the consortium to be able to do the management, but they may also want to own their own resources.\"He also sought to position cloud offerings as a more mature testing environment for such efforts – a claim evidenced by the fact that R3 used Azure as part of its first completed blockchain test with 11 major banks.As for the current version of Azure’s BaaS service, Gray stressed that it is \"fully open\" to the public now, and that clients can deploy blockchains either directly in Azure or in a local data center via its platform.For cloud users, blockchains can be deployed by clients who \"fill out a web interface and click go\". From there, Marley said, they can be managed like any virtual machine in a cloud environment, with users quickly adding blockchain networks.Such mechanisms, however, are currently developed by application providers and not Microsoft. So, for example, developers looking to run Ethereum on a virtual machine will need to deploy via a template created by tech platform provider BlockApps.Gray described this ability for innovators and incumbents to interact in energetic terms, suggesting that Microsoft sees Azure as a way to ramp up the pace of innovation in the blockchain sector.\"You can have a private cloud, but nodes can be sitting under people’s desks. If they’re permissioned to join the blockchain, they can join,\" Gray said.In this way, he suggested the BaaS is a way for the company to replicate its own experimentation process, and its successes.\"We initially launched the BaaS platform to include numerous blockchain platforms … to allow customers and partners and developers to try these things out to figure out the strategies,” he said, concluding:Image via drserg / Shutterstock.com","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Microsoft, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 9, 2016 at 11:17 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/08/five-uk-mutual-funds-partner-on-blockchain-trading-project/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/f2FhiG3Mk7mc6kuFSLqW1DDUZM4\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/WBFMDW57Z5BEJMS74PXZVPYJMU.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Five UK Mutual Funds Partner on Blockchain Trading Project","INTRO":"Five major UK fund houses have reportedly partnered on a project to explore blockchain technology\u0027s cost saving potential in trading systems.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Five major British mutual fund operators have partnered to explore blockchain technology\u0027s cost saving potential in trading systems.As reported in the Financial Times, Schroders Investment Management and Aberdeen Asset Management have initiated the project, along with Columbia Threadneedle Investments.

Furthermore, \"in-depth research shall be conducted, with a focus on the application of distributed ledger technology\".The document concludes by saying that government and regulator also have their role and, while addressing risks, they should create a \"comprehensive and flexible regulatory system\", so as not to hinder innovation.Disclaimer: This article is based on a translation provided by the paper\u0027s author.Seoul image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, South Korea, Central Bank, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 2, 2016 at 11:05 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/02/02/bny-exec-lack-of-industry-standards-hurting-blockchain-tech/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/k-6sGoSwatgeXMX_KxXJ5IciwOQ\u003d/570x285/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/B3BZHJYZ4ZCE7PEKBPZQBT5AII.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BNY Exec: Lack of Industry Standards Hurting Blockchain Tech","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"\"To me, network effect is the key.\"So says Saket Sharma, CIO of New York-based financial services firm BNY Mellon\u0027s Treasury Services unit, as he outlined the bank’s approach to adopting the technology that underlies bitcoin.Last week, BNY Mellon hosted a day of seminars focused on the blockchain. The event, which drew a small but engaged crowd of BNY employees, followed months of internal development and experimentation that saw the bank pilot its own digital currency and, later, joining a consortium of financial institutions looking to implement the technology.In an interview, Sharma argued that collaboration among banks, particularly when it comes to establishing standards of use, will be the driving factor as to whether financial companies begin using blockchains for their services.He told CoinDesk:Sharma said that all of the business lines within BNY Mellon are looking at possible blockchain applications, but cautioned that the bank sees regulatory and legal questions as an impediment to adoption.\"I think there’s a lot of potential with this technology, and our goal is to really capitalize on the talent in the bank, working collaboratively with others, and play a bigger role in the opportunities there,\" he said.According to Sharma, BNY Mellon began to look into the technology by testing bitcoin and, later, its own kind of digital currency.\"We started with the bitcoin,\" he said. \"We downloaded Bitcoin Core, we modified it, we actually ran it on an internal private cloud,” he said.These days, Sharma continued, business units within the bank meet monthly to discuss the results of those blockchain experiments. This, he said, is one product of an effort to establish a culture of experimentation of new technologies within BNY Mellon.He explained:Sharma added that he has pushed for a more ground-up approach to technology testing within the bank, arguing that collaboration between business units or companies is a better way to approach potential business models compared to a top-down, mandate-driven process.\"To me, the culture of innovation doesn’t come from five people sitting in a room and saying I know already. I don’t buy that culture,\" he remarked, going on to say:Sharma went on to reiterate that the bank sees the pursuit of standards for the technology as a key priority as the industry moves toward potential adoption.This, he said, will enable greater degrees of operability in the event that financial firms operate their own blockchains, pointing to past conversations with startups working in the bitcoin and blockchain space as examples of how the industry hasn’t settled on one solution over another.\"When [Digital Asset Holdings CEO] Blythe Masters came to us last year, she said we have a technology that\u0027s blockchain agnostic. I was surprised. Is it really? I looked at her and said you don’t have a technology. And two weeks down the line they went and bought Hyperledger,\" said Sharma.Sharma went on to relate a similar experience with bitcoin market data provider TradeBlock. He said that while, during initial conversations, the startup indicated that it used its own proprietary code, the company has since shifted to Ethereum.\"So the underlying technology itself is so fluid that there’s no stack as a standard, right? So unless you have a standard, you will not be able to interoperate, eventually,\" he continued.Sharma went on to say that the bank’s look at blockchain applications is part of a wider effort to examine how new forms of financial technology.He suggested that the financial services industry is undergoing a significant period of hype, one that could result in significant change – or simply end up as an unfulfilled promise.He told CoinDesk:For now, he said, the bank is committed to pursuing use standards through the R3CEV-led bank consortium, as well as promoting more in-house experimentation and education, both in terms of distributed ledgers as well as other forms of financial technology.\"That’s a great opportunity for a bank – and [blockchain technology] is one example,\" he said, adding:BNY Mellon Center image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, News, BNY Mellon, Distributed Ledgers, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 2, 2016 at 10:22 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/01/28/deloitte-new-blockchain-applications-will-accelerate-adoption/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Dtj6jhpgPOROdZA17kaFw3RdynE\u003d/570x405/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/NTDGVC6BBVE6RACLSJQIK6MDOQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/01/26/is-digital-assets-50-million-funding-a-blow-to-bitcoin-vcs-weigh-in/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/tqpaEIaQrMycUtKqh6oAZ_AXKtE\u003d/570x268/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/SIKHEENQENHMLOSQGOHRKKF26U.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Is Digital Asset\u0027s $50 Million Funding a Blow to Bitcoin? VCs Weigh In","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Founded in 2014 and led by CEO and ex-JP Morgan executive Blythe Masters, Digital Asset Holdings had long been the subject of speculation that suggested that, despite its high-profile leadership, the startup was having difficulties raising an initial funding round.All that uncertainty was laid to rest last week, however, when Digital Asset silenced rumors by raising upwards of $50m (some reports say $52m was the total) from 13 major financial institutions, among them traditional financial giants such as Citi, CME Ventures and Santander InnoVentures.The $50m round is the largest to date for a startup seeking to use private or permissioned blockchain technology, which unlike the open-source bitcoin network, is purposed for use by a selected number of trusted institutions for use cases including syndicated loans, US Treasury repo, foreign exchange, securities settlement and derivatives.Further, the news comes amid a decline in funding for bitcoin-focused startups in the sector. Data from the forthcoming CoinDesk State of Bitcoin 2015 Report, for example, reveals that, when revised historically, \"blockchain startups\" have collected 34% of the estimated $1bn in publicly reported industry funding.For many observers, the Digital Asset round confirms what they believe is a trend that suggests venture capitalists are increasingly interested in blockchain startups, and that bitcoin-focused companies are experiencing more difficulties.However, some of bitcoin’s most high-profile supporters in the venture capital community believe that the attention the Digital Asset round brings to blockchain technology is good for ecosystem as a whole, even for startups focused on the public bitcoin blockchain.Tally Capital founding partner Matt Roszak told CoinDesk:Bart Stephens, managing partner at Blockchain Capital, an industry-focused fund whose investments include Abra, BitFury and Ripple, voiced his firm’s opinion that the \"blockchain not bitcoin\" trend is a \"false dichotomy\".\"Bitcoin and the bitcoin Blockchain are inextricably linked, but not limited,\" he said. \"Certain use cases of blockchain technology might not include the bitcoin blockchain.\"Still, Stephens sought to stoke the flames of competition, adding:While positive for the ecosystem, investors surveyed also indicated their view that the pressure is on Masters and her team to deliver a product or products worthy of the brand’s big entrance.Virtual Capital Ventures partner William Mougayar echoed this sentiment, telling CoinDesk that, in his view, it is now on Digital Asset to \"showcase actual implementations and deployed use cases\".\"I would expect [Digital Asset] to clarify further their product roadmap, given that there is a degree of mashup of technology acquisitions inside their offerings. That said, I\u0027m sure that each one of their investors will also keep them busy with projects, since they are all potential recipients of blockchain technology,\" Mougayar said.Less optimistic was Trace Mayer, an angel investor in bitcoin firms such as Kraken and Armory, who said he believes Masters may be fighting an uphill battle against a superior version of blockchain technology.Mayer further voiced concerns about the backgrounds of Digital Asset\u0027s new investors, telling CoinDesk:Mayer suggested that Digital Asset would now have to prove the quality of their code, or else face potentially hard consequences.\"Blythe is sink or swim now,\" he added.Notably, Digital Asset has already begun the process of opening up about code produced by its team, recently detailing the specifications of its Hyperledger platform, which is being transferred to the Linux Foundation\u0027s Open Ledger Project for further development.Among those who contributed comment, Mayer was more critical about Digital Asset\u0027s outlook. As noted by Roszak, the bitcoin industry is currently undergoing a period of acquisitions, but the two were mixed on what were likely to be the results.In particular, Mayer put forth the criticism that Digital Asset was likely to experience challenges hiring developers who could help it fulfill its technology goals.\"[This is] a seven-year-old industry,\" Mayer said. \"[Masters] comes from an industry with millions and millions of years of [combined] experience. When you need a senior analyst, it’s pretty easy to go find one. But if you want to find a senior blockchain specialist, where are you going to go find one?\"Mayer was also skeptical of the acquisitions Digital Asset has so far made, which have included blockchain startups such as Blockstack.io, Bits of Proof and Hyperledger.Roszak, in turn, spoke more broadly about this climate, suggesting that developers who have been or will be acquired will now have the chance to contribute to further innovation.\"This is good because those innovators and entrepreneurs are going to continue that innovation track with other companies,\" he said.Cross Pacific Capital Partners’ Marc van der Chijs, an investor in BEX.io and frequent panelist at industry conferences, noted his belief the early-stage startup ecosystem could be most impacted by the deal.“With this round, Digital Asset is suddenly the leading player in the blockchain field, so it will be harder for emerging startups to compete,” van der Chijs said.Less concerned was Adam Draper, CEO of the San Mateo-based startup accelerator Boost VC, who called the news \"great for the market\".Draper said:The statements suggest that Draper believes the deal is unlikely to affect dealflow among Boost’s early-stage applicants, which have included bitcoin startups Blockcypher and Wealthcoin, as well as blockchain startups like Epiphyte and Align Commerce.Ni\u0027coel Stark, a former investor at Block26, said she didn\u0027t believe the funding would impact the early-stage space, given that other use cases are so abundant.\"Our fund won\u0027t be looking to the DAH team for any cues as we do not share the same focus. We are interested much more in consumer applications like media and content distribution, Internet of Things and mobile data security,\" Stark said.Still, observers were not in agreement that the Digital Asset round would be a boon for bitcoin and other public blockchains.Alex Tapscott, CEO of North West Passage Ventures, an advisory firm for early-stage companies in the blockchain sector viewed the funding as a strong signal that market interest has shifted.\"[The funding round] demonstrated, once again, banks\u0027 strong preference for permissioned distributed ledger systems over open blockchains, such as bitcoin and Ethereum,\" he said.Tapscott further lauded Masters as a \"pioneer\" that has successfully shifted conversation to blockchain technology among industry incumbents.Van der Chijs added that the announcement confirms \"private blockchains are in fashion\" and that \"public blockchains are dead\" in the eyes of institutions and the public.Now, he said, it\u0027s up to the bitcoin ecosystem to respond and innovate, first by ending the block size debate and then proving public ledgers like bitcoin are more secure than private alternatives.He

opportunities they present.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Consumers\u0027 Research, the independent educational group and organiser of a recent blockchain workshop at Bretton Woods, has published a new white paper on blockchain technology.The paper, released today, sets out to identify the opportunities presented by the technology, the challenges present today and potential solutions to those concerns.Yet the report often invokes the possible advantages of transacting in digital currencies like bitcoin.Joe Colangelo, executive director for Consumers’ Research, writes in the preface to the report:Colangelo goes on to write that the paper aims educate those unfamiliar with the technology and inform members of the bitcoin community of hurdles that may impede their ability to effect change.Overall, the report is pitched as a vehicle for grasping the technology in what could be a key year for bitcoin and the blockchain.In its preamble, the organisation makes strong reference to the original Bretton Woods Conference – a gathering of hundreds of delegates from all 44 Allied countries that took place in the hills of New Hampshire in mid-July, 1944, in the wake of World War II.The financial system that emerged from that gathering established the US dollar as the global reserve currency.Consumers’ Research argues that the financial system is on the verge of a new era, and invokes the spirit of that gathering to suggest that similar change is on the horizon.\"We believe that we now find ourselves in a situation not unlike that faced by our predecessors,\" the report states.While there are potentially a huge number of differing use cases of blockchain technologies, Consumers’ Research says, there is a narrower range of broader strategic goals blockchain opportunities seek to address.Early on, the document\u0027s identifies and explains the five \"transformative goals\" that blockchain technology can achieve over time, which were identified by the authors of the paper with input from numerous collaborators.The goals are: efficiency, consumer choice, access, privacy and protection, transparency, direct self-governance and human empowerment.The document goes on to spell out how successive implementations of the technology can provide avenues for new use cases.For example, the report states, next-generation blockchains can be deployed to focus on microtransactions, identity issuance, proof of asset ownership and more efficient, transparent governance.The paper finishes up with some \"exhibits\" – detailed use case examples, such as \"Smart Contracts: Building Blocks for Digital Markets\" and \"Game Theory and Collaboration: A thought experiment with Decentralized Autonomous Organizations\".While offering up both opportunities and challenges, the report states that, if approached correctly, the technology could be leveraged to affect real change in the world.\"There is no doubt that the potential economic benefits of smart property and blockchain-based title registries could have a transformative impact on the global economy,” the report’s authors write, concluding:Image credit: Art Phaneuf Photography /

have the potential to disrupt card-based payments.made his comments while addressing a Bank of France Conference in Paris on 18th January, in a speech titled “Card payments in Europe – latest trends and challenges”.Discussing the emergence of innovative payment solutions, including distributed ledger technologies, the banker predicted they could \"impact payment behaviour and the usage of cards and other traditional payment instruments in the years to come\".Innovative card-based solutions have \"the potential to further boost card usage by replacing cash payments\" he said, while warning:Mersch cited instant payments as one of the challenges for card providers, explaining that the Euro Retail Payments Board, set up by the ECB, has decided that the European Payments Council should develop an instant payment scheme for euro payments based on the SEPA credit transfer system.Elaborating on distributed ledger technologies, he predicted that they could potentially have a \"profound impact on the whole financial \u0027ecosystem\u0027”, disrupting both the use of \u0027traditional\u0027 payment instruments and services and the payments processing industry.More choice for consumers and businesses is beneficial, he said, provided new payment solutions offered are secure and efficient and that all providers \"play by the same rules\".Still, card transactions still have \"huge\" growth potential in the EU, according to the ECB board member, so long as an instant payments system is realised and a \"harmonised, competitive and innovative European card payments area\" is achieved via \"standardisation, interoperability and appropriate security measures\".He warned, though, that innovative payment solutions will pose a challenge to the cards industry. Competition will come from instant payments based on the SEPA credit transfer, from payment initiation services in the e-commerce sector, and from the adoption of distributed ledger technologies.Mersch concluded:","TAGS":"credit cards, Blockchain Technology, ECB, Yves Mersch, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jan 21, 2016 at 4:26 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/01/21/mastercard-exec-talks-cautious-approach-to-blockchain-tech/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/OMEC7m0oZQTD1dGdLB9Fd5KADwk\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/C52LEDUNWJE6RFCXVRU7MW37E4.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"MasterCard Exec Talks Cautious Approach to Blockchain Tech","INTRO":"A MasterCard exec has said that while the firm is interested in blockchain tech, it intends to be cautious with its strategy in this area.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A MasterCard executive has said that while the firm is \"very, very interested\" in blockchain technology, it will take a cautious approach to its experimentation with the tech while it believes it is still developing.Speaking to Business Insider at the World Economic Forum in Davos, MasterCard CIO Garry Lyons outlined the steps the major global credit card network has so far taken to explore the industry.Lyons said:The comments come at a time when thought leaders in the traditional payments and finance industry are increasingly skeptical about the growing hype around \"blockchain\" and distributed ledger tech and its potential.Lyons hinted at the growing chorus of blockchain enthusiasts, saying that every tech panel he attended at this week\u0027s Davos conference mentioned blockchain, with some even calling it \"the second coming\".\"While we think it’s very interesting, we don’t want to, and no one wants to, be blindsided by rushing into it,” he told the news provider.Lyons went on to speak positively about MasterCard\u0027s partnership with industry investment conglomerate Digital Currency Group (DCG), which the company said would help provide it with a strong connection to the industry.Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Mastercard, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jan 21, 2016 at 3:30 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/01/20/vermont-says-blockchain-record-keeping-system-too-costly/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/LfmvoS5mJt-xTe2TIGBpsh1x0pw\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/NKVMZOIE5BEQZFSEJLRZQON4XQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Vermont Says Blockchain Record-Keeping System Too Costly","INTRO":"The cost of using the blockchain for a public records system would outweigh any benefits, a report prepared for Vermont’s legislature concludes.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The cost of using an implementation of the blockchain for a public records management system would outweigh any potential benefits, a report prepared for Vermont’s state legislature concludes.The reportThe report’s authors state that Vermont could see some benefits from a system that is able to verify when a public record document is entered and by whom. However, the report raises questions about the cost of operating a state blockchain, how such a system would function within Vermont\u0027s legal framework for storing electronics records, and why a blockchain would be needed at all given the methods and requirements in place today.The report’s authors state:Despite arguing against the creation of a blockchain-based public records system, the authors do note that it would offer some protection against forged or erroneous records.“The hash of a document existing outside the blockchain and the hash registered within the blockchain will be identical if the documents are identical. If the documents are different (due to forgery, corruption, error, or other problems) the hashes will not match,” the report states. “Thus, the blockchain can potentially provide an immutable registration of a record, to which future records can be compared for authenticity.The report goes on to suggest that Vermont could see some economic benefit from attracting companies that use the technology.“To the extent that Vermont can be part of a process of economic and technological innovation that is likely to go forward with or without any legislative recognition, early acceptance of this technology may result in some economic benefit to the State,” the report explains.The report also left the door open to future consideration of a state-run blockchain system, suggesting that a future implementation could be used to augment existing methods of public record keeping.“Further study is required before considering it for the regular business of the State, and moreover, any application would certainly need to support rather than replace the existing records management infrastructure,” the report concludes.The full report can be found below:Blockchain Technology: Opportunities and Risks Image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Technology, News, Vermont, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jan 20, 2016 at 11:56 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/01/19/report-urges-uk-government-to-test-blockchain-tech/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/PPpB1DfefBu8zTIlBvolLJn2oGI\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/FHU3J5UWKRHBLIQ2VZG3BLMDDE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Report Urges UK Government to Test Blockchain Tech","INTRO":"A new report from the UK Government Office for Science has recommended a broad government effort to explore and test blockchain technology.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A new report from the UK Government Office for Science has recommended a broad government effort to explore and test blockchain and distributed ledger technology.The report, spearheaded by the government\u0027s top scientific advisor Mark Walport, contained proposals aimed at pushing for segments of the UK government to pursue applications of the technology.The recommendations include the development of standards for the technology\u0027s use; the creation of new roles in the government to demonstrate proofs-of-concept; and the establishment of a roadmap for further exploration and utilization.The report highlights the potential benefits of using the technology, writing:Notably, the report pushes for comprehensive testing of blockchain tech, advocating that agencies within the government as well as elements of the country’s research community collaborate on such initiatives.\"Understanding the true potential of distributed ledgers requires not only research but also using the technology for real-life applications,\" the report states. \"Government should establish trials of distributed ledgers in order to assess the technology’s usability within the public sector.\"Among the potential applications identified in the report include uses for government aid payment systems and tax monitoring.\"Distributed ledger technologies have the potential to help governments to collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land registries, assure the supply chain of goods and generally ensure the integrity of government records and services,\" the report said.The publication adds to the growing calls to action within the UK government for aspects of blockchain tech to be implemented.

But lately there has been more and more talk about \"the bitcoin blockchain\", \"the blockchain\", \"blockchain\" or \"blockchain technology\".Bloomberg reports that Nasdaq is seeking to show progress using the much-hyped blockchain. LWN notes The Linux Foundation recently announced a project to \"advance blockchain technology\". The Washington Post lists bitcoin and the blockchain as one of six inventions of magnitude we haven’t seen since the printing press. VISA, Citi, and Nasdaq have invested $30m into a blockchain company.VCs have invested $1bn in the bitcoin ecosystem. Bank of America is allegedly trying to load up on \"blockchain\" patents. The Bank of England says there\u0027s \"buzz around blockchain\" and is curious what you’d use \"blockchain\" for.It seems “blockchain” is becoming an increasingly generic term, like \"cloud\" or \"cyber\".A new breed of snake oil purveyors are peddling “blockchain” as the magic sauce that will power all the world’s financial transactions and unlock the great decentralized database in the sky.But what exactly is a “blockchain”?Let’s turn to the definitive source, Satoshi Nakamoto’s seminal paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System” and look for the first reference to “blockchain”. Hmm, there doesn’t seem to be one.The paper contains multiple references to a \"proof-of-work chain\", and one reference to a “chain of blocks”, but other than that neither “blockchain” or “block chain” ever make an appearance in the bitcoin paper.So if it’s not defined in the bitcoin paper, what does “blockchain” actually mean?I’ve asked a lot of people this question, ranging from renowned cryptographers and distributed systems experts to bitcoin enthusiasts to people not particularly versed in either bitcoin, distributed systems, or cryptography. No two people have ever given me the same answer.I can try to take a crack at the question myself.Here are the interesting properties of the bitcoin “blockchain” as I see them:In my previous blog post “The Death of Bitcoin” I had also mentioned Hyperledger, Tendermint and several others. I’ll get to those in a bit.My Death of Bitcoin blog post also touched on the idea that the blockchain could be subject to incremental refinement in the same way the Watt steam engine massively improved on the previous Newcomen steam engine.A few months later we saw exactly that with Bitcoin-NG (paper), a protocol that inverts the ordering of bitcoin consensus, in which a miner is first elected leader by winning the proof-of-work \"lottery\" by mining a \"key block\", and then once elected leader becomes a transaction broker who can mint “micro-blocks” via digital signature until the next leader is elected.Decoupling leader election from the publishing of transactions allows the overall system to have a much higher throughput as the rate new transactions are published is no-longer coupled to the rate at which the proof-of-work problem is solved.I’ve referenced Certificate Transparency several times in this post, but it has a few drawbacks: it’s a point-solution specifically for the purpose of X.509 certificates, and as a system that merely logs and audits what certificates CAs provide to it, it has no consensus protocol and therefore cannot be used for things like finding the canonical certificates for a given domain name.For what Certificate Transparency is trying to accomplish, this is perfectly fine. However, given the several years they’ve spent working on it, it feels like a bit of a shame that it only serves the purpose of authenticating X.509 certificates when the general idea behind it seems much more powerful. This is perhaps how people feel about “the blockchain” when they see it applied only to bitcoin.Cothorityis a framework for building collective authority systems using a Merkelized log a la CT, a consensus algorithm, and threshold signatures (using Ed25519 for threshold Schnorr signatures).By combining the ideas of consensus systems with a CT-like witness protocol, it provides a generalized framework for auditable decentralized trust and consensus which can be used for many of the same things people are pitching “blockchain technology” for without the need for a costly proof-of-work-based “consensus by lottery”.These two images are taken from Philipp Jovanovic’s 32C3 talk on Cothority, where they were juxtaposed as two potential solutions to the same problem. While I think Bitcoin-NG is a brilliant optimization on the original bitcoin design (and one I’d strongly suggest bitcoin adopt some variant thereof), Cothority provides many of the same properties without a proof of work function.Lately I’ve seen a lot of systems of the sort I previously wouldn’t have classified as “blockchains” (because they do not use a proof-of-work chain) who previously seemed to be distancing themselves from bitcoin and the proof-of-work approach go FULL BLOCKCHAIN:Have you accepted THE BLOCKCHAIN into your heart?This is Tendermint, a protocol I highlighted in my last blog post as being based on a proof-of-stake system and distributed consensus protocol, as opposed to a proof-of-work scheme like bitcoin. Now there is no mention of proof-of-stake anywhere on their web page.Is Tendermint a blockchain? I guess there’s no question about it now! Whatever Tendermint turns out to be, its creators leave little room to doubt that it is, indeed, a BLOCKCHAIN (blockchain blockchain).Hyperledger, another protocol I highlighted in my last blog post, has also undergone a blockchain makeover. Their old web site now redirects here (as reported on by LWN), where we no longer see any mention of \"Hyperledger\", just Enterprise Blockchain 2.0 technology!With this much ambiguity as to the actual definition coupled with hyperrepetition, \"blockchain\" is fast on its way to becoming the new “cloud” – one of those words whose actual meaning is nebulous and unspecific, but whatever it is it must be so important people can’t shut up about it!Now don’t get me wrong: I like Hyperledger and Tendermint, or at least, I thought I did. Per my personal rubric above though, neither of these systems are \"blockchains\" because they do not use a proof-of-work-based consensus protocol.The great thing about a nebulous term is that it knows no limits.What can’t you put in the blockchain? Perhaps we could encode Wikipedia into the blockchain, or store the entire archive of Netflix videos in the blockchain. All of Archive.org could go in the blockchain. We could move the entire World Wide Web into the blockchain so all web pages are permanent and live forever.The only real question is: What can’t you put in the blockchain?Well, the answer is: not much. The bitcoin blockchain’s ability to store data is greatly limited by its \"publish everything to everyone everywhere\" nature. 80 bytes per transaction is pretty much the limit, and the system is already hitting scalability bottlenecks at a relatively modest scale.To go beyond that, we need a different protocol. We can’t just throw \"blockchain technology\" at the problem. The relevant algorithms do not exist in the bitcoin codebase. We need a different protocol.This is a problem many people have tried working on for a very long time. I’ve blogged about it before. There have been many pretenders to the throne: Xanadu, FreeNet, GNUnet, MojoNation/MNet, Tahoe-LAFS, OneSwarm, BitSpray, MaidSafe, IPFS. I’ll note MojoNation specifically as a system that tried to tie storage service to a cryptocurrency.So far the leading technology for the decentralized database seems to be BitTorrent, which dominates Internet traffic. But it doesn’t make for much of a database, only a blob store. Perhaps you’re now thinking: TorrentChain! Yeah, that’s been tried. But I don’t think the great database in the sky is going to be unlocked by cobbling together disparate parts into a Rube Goldberg apparatus.Believe me that I would like to see the craziest fantasies of what people hope to accomplish with decentralized systems realized. But the blockchain is probably not the technology that is going to do it.I feel “blockchain technology” has not delivered a lot of practical value: compared to most payment systems, the value bitcoin moves, and the transaction rate, are both rather insignificant (and bitcoin is all that matters – all other blockchain-based systems move practically nothing by comparison).Bitcoin is hitting scalability limits under a relatively modest payment volume.The only thing I think \"blockchain technology\" has actually delivered on is hype: a press release with \"blockchain\" in the title garners media attention. (I direct you back to the opening paragraph of this post if you doubt that).Old financial institutions recruiting for “blockchain” positions are a lot more likely to find talented engineers than if they have job requirements to maintain decades-old legacy systems. I won’t dispute that \"blockchain\" is pretty much guaranteed to engender a lot more excitement in your average engineer than \"ledger\", \"reconciliation\", \"settlement\" or \"notarization\".In the meantime, \"blockchain technology\" advocates need a litany of big-name positive endorsements of “blockchain” to lend credibility to the idea, even if it’s little more than expressing interest in the concept.Thus we wind up with a positive feedback loop of hype without anyone actually delivering on anything valuable.That’s not to say that the idea of decentralized transaction ledgers and timestamping systems lacks merit, but I don’t think copying and pasting Satoshi-and-friends’ codebase all over the place is the best way to go about solving the problem.If you’re doing that, please at least take a look at Bitcoin-NG and fix the broken Merkle trees.In Blockchainiac terms, I don’t want there to be “on-chain” and “off-chain”. I want “sidechains all the way down”. I want systems that are built from the ground up to support that model. Bitcoin doesn’t scale. Decentralize the blockchain!I want protocols that are formally proven to come to consensus correctly, not protocols that are formally proven to be broken.I want each transaction to use less electricity than I do in a day. Much less. I want the entire system to use a lot less electricity than the entire nation of Ireland.I want more than 3 transactions per second.I want consensus faster than every 10 minutes. Ten seconds is a lot better.The most interesting ideas I’m seeing are coming from people who describe their protocols as requiring no blockchain.I worry the media are giving undue attention to questionable ideas simply because there’s a lot of \"buzz around blockchain\".I worry that the hype surrounding the “blockchain” might lead those who award research budgets to favor blockchain-based solutions over those that are blockchain-free.I worry financial institutions might pick a \"blockchain\"-based solution where a blockchain-free solution might be, by all quantitative metrics, better in every regard, simply because they’ve heard what a big deal “blockchain” is.But perhaps my concerns are overblown, and this is just a giant semantic argument. Maybe \"blockchain technology\" is just becoming a meaningless all-encompassing umbrella term for decentralized protocols.Can it do ledgers? Sure! Data? Why not? Computation? Smart contracts baby!Perhaps \"post-blockchain\" protocols will start branding themselves as “blockchain technology” just to stay relevant.\"Cyber\" is starting to grow on me, so why not \"blockchain\" too? Who needs a metaverse?

Defining an Industry Buzzword","INTRO":"Dave Hudson, author of the Hashingit.com blog, looks back to Satoshi\u0027s white paper to discover what a blockchain is, and what it might be...","DETAILED_CONTENT":"As we approach 2016 there seem to be endless discussions about \u0027blockchain\u0027. It\u0027s a term that is ever-more frequently cited in even mainstream journalism, while in the FinTech space alone there are a slew of would-be suppliers and would-be users claiming that \u0027blockchain\u0027 will revolutionize any number of applications.This now-common usage suggests it must be something precisely defined and well understood, but this seems to be more a matter of mantra than comprehension.The echo chambers of the Internet reverberate to many opinions, but attempts to find a precise meaning seem to find a dismaying lack of agreement. To be anything more than marketing hyperbole we really need the answers some questions.What is it? What isn\u0027t it? What might it be? Can it be something that will allow us to build new and enduring systems? In short, what is the essence of blockchain?Almost every discussion of blockchains starts with the Satoshi white paper, but it is this very foundation that starts us on a path to confusion. Neither the terms \u0027blockchain\u0027 or \u0027block chain\u0027 appear there; there are 67 uses of \u0027block\u0027 and 27 of \u0027chain\u0027, but zero of \u0027block chain\u0027 or \u0027blockchain\u0027. This aside though, let\u0027s see where this origin leads us.The white paper is short; it\u0027s just nine pages long. The first mention of \u0027block\u0027 and \u0027chain\u0027 starts at the bottom of page 2, section 3, where there is a discussion of a basic timestamp server. Prior to this the white paper describes a series of design goals associated with the bitcoin design, such as the ability to allow two parties to transact without needing to trust a third party.The statement of the design goals are fundamentally important. They set the scene for an implementation to meet those goals in which characteristics are layered upon each other, but it is informative to look at what each new layer does.In our quest for the nature of a blockchain we need to be careful to look for things that are its attributes, rather than characteristics of this first implementation.Section 1 of the white paper is an introduction and it is with section 2 that we see anything really substantive. Section 2 sets a scene for a digital coin, but it is described as being a chain of transactions in which the \u0027coin\u0027 is assigned to new owners. The coin is really a metaphor for a transaction history of linked transactions.Interestingly, section 2 also describes how a centralized system doesn\u0027t actually need to do this.With section 3 we see the essence of the design pattern that might best describe the basis of a blockchain. It is given as something that is constructed from a series of incremental blocks of data, each of which can be identified by a cryptographic hash over its contents. In addition, each block incorporates the cryptographic hash of its predecessor block to ensure the construction of a chain.The block hashes are published as a form of widely witnessed evidence that demonstrate shows the existence of both the block data and the predecessor hash. Changing either the predecessor or the other data within the block would result in a different hash signature for the block that would not match the widely witnessed view.These characteristics are all fundamental, and without them we cannot construct anything interesting. What is equally interesting though is what is not stated as necessary at this point. There are no mentions of coins, no mentions of peer-to-peer networks, no mentions of mining, etc. Instead the suggestion is that publishing hashes in any widely disseminated form would be sufficient, with the two examples being given as publication in a newspaper or publication via Usenet.While we see some explicit characteristics these lead to a few implicit ones:Publication of the hashes is meaningless unless those same hashes can be independently recomputed by an external observer who is given just the data from the blocks in the chain. It is this characteristic that enables the observers to not have to trust the originator of the chain of blocks; instead they are able to compare historical hashes for themselves.Recomputing of the hashes requires that the algorithm by which the blocks is produced be deterministic and well specified. Without these our external observer cannot recompute the hashes.The next section, 4, of the white paper talks about proof-of-work. The first line is interesting: \"To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis, we will need to use a proof-of-work system similar to Adam Back\u0027s Hashcash\". Proof-of-work is not required to construct a blockchain, just to enable the peer-to-peer implementation of the timestamp server.Subsequent cryptocurrency designs have shown there are potentially other approaches that can be taken here too (eg: forms of proof-of-stake, or hybrids of both), but if we are happy with a client-server approach then none of these are actually necessary.This is not to say that proof-of-work might not have some other uses with a blockchain design, but none seem fundamental to our quest.Section 5 describes the implementation characteristics of the bitcoin network. Nothing here explicitly extends the concept of what a blockchain is, or might require. Indeed, neither sections 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 (the final section) go on to explicitly offer any new ideas about what a blockchain might be.If the Satoshi white paper is the origin of the blockchain design, we\u0027re left with a rather thin definition, but perhaps that is the most enlightening aspect. It is very explicit about particular design choices and their purpose, which tends to lead towards a realization that many of the claims about \u0027blockchains\u0027 may actually be a matter of implementation rather than architecture.Let\u0027s ask some specific questions then!There is an interesting discussion in the white paper about the need to provide incentives to those providing security to the P2P network to remain honest and as a means to introduce \u0027coins\u0027 into the system, but the discussion is clearly in the context of the P2P network. The concept of coins themselves is noted as unnecessary with a trusted \u0027mint\u0027.A trusted mint is not something desirable in a cryptocurrency, but there seems to be no requirement for coins if we wish to construct a chain of cryptographically-linked blocks. There is an interesting question to ask about trust, but we will return to that later.From the perspective of the white paper this seems unlikely. The word \u0027contract\u0027 does not appear anywhere.Might a blockchain enable smart contracts? Yes, of course it might, but it might enable many other things too.Again the answer seems to be no. Neither the words \u0027program\u0027 or \u0027script\u0027 appear in the white paper.A blockchain does have a requirement to be interpretable by one or more independent observers, so it is clearly built from one or more well-defined data structures. The block data structure must contain a previous block hash, and the cryptographic hash of the block must be performed in a very specific way, but none of these require that the data structure carry any notion of executable code.Can a blockchain contain some form of program code? This is an implementation question and the answer is yes. Bitcoin includes a limited scripting language, and other systems, such as Ethereum, have subsequently attempted to support more elaborate programming models.The choice to support such concepts seems more to be either expedience, or, more ambitious design goals, but it seems a blockchain need no more be \u0027programmable\u0027 than any other linked list data structure.Once more the answer seems to be no. As before, the word \u0027database\u0027 does not appear in the white paper.At its core, a blockchain is a special type of data structure. The blocks within the chain contain data, but this does not make it a database; at best the blocks represent the transaction log of a specific database implementation.Similarly there are no semantics for querying a blockchain, any more than there are for querying a linked list. A specific implementation might allow for queries of either, but the implementation does not define the thing itself.As a point of comparison, the IP packets for the TCP packets carrying this article are defined as data structures in a series of IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) RFC (Request For Comments) documents. The documents describe the form of the packets and their behaviour when they are transported. Recipients of those packets are able to make their own determinations of their validity without regard to any part of the network implementation between them and the originator.An implementation of a router/firewall may offer a feature to capture those packets so that they can be analyzed later, and may offer database queries of those packets, but there is nothing in the nature of an IP packet that makes it a database, nor is there anything in the RFCs that would suggest otherwise. Implementation features and specification are very different things.The answer here is no too, but that\u0027s because the question is too broad. A blockchain does allow us to require less trust than many traditional systems, but any implementation still requires some level of trust.A recipient of block data must trust that it has been delivered without being compromised by some intermediary. The P2P distribution of blocks within the bitcoin and similar networks set out to try to minimize trust in peers, but even this model has potential failure points. Here are a few:\"In code we trust\" makes for an interesting mantra, but 30-plus years of malware, spyware, etc, informs us that this is a highly debatable strategy.A blockchain design does make falsifications harder for an adversary, and makes accidental errors dramatically less likely. We are able to \"trust but verify\" (within bounds), but this is still a significant improvement over blindly trusting. Most importantly, none of these trust minimizing characteristics are aspects of the P2P network design, but are instead intrinsic to the block encoding.A blockchain is just a data structure, so really the question makes no sense. Who has the ability to read or write a data structure is a totally different question.Let\u0027s ignore this subtle distinction for a moment, though, and act as if the question might make sense. Consider the case of bitcoin; who writes the blockchain?The answer is that miners (or more precisely, block makers such a mining pool operators, not those who just hash blocks) get to write new blocks. Transactors on the network can provide candidate transactions to be included in blocks, but this does not guarantee blocks will ever contain those transactions. With bitcoin we talk about this being \u0027non-permissioned\u0027 because no-one needs any explicit permission to become a block maker.If we consider other potential uses of a blockchain design, though, there are is an often very well-defined set of participants who we would wish to be able to write block data. In many cases this may even be one single participant.A critique levelled at such potential uses of a blockchain are that this makes it no better than a database, but a conventional database is something in which blind trust must be placed. Its internal state is generally unknowable. Even in its simplest uses a blockchain can at least provide a means to verify the state of such a system, and to do so in a way that enables histories to be validated. This is only the start of the possibilities, however!Realistically, no, or at least not on its own.When we looked at \"not a database\" we also touched on why this claim doesn\u0027t really make sense. Superficially the argument seems seductive. The thought is that we can build lots of technology on top of a blockchain in the way that a network stack is layered.There are many problems with this proposition, but the obvious one is that a blockchain is just a data structure. It makes a good candidate for being used to convey information across the Internet but doesn\u0027t enable anything in and of itself.Separating the blockchain from any transport of a blockchain, however, does give some hope that blockchains may enable more reliable financial applications over the Internet. A clear separation also allows experimentation at each layer of the system design and this is a key characteristic that has enabled the Internet to be so successful.With the Internet, candidates for all layers of the network stack are able to be trialled, replaced or modified, allowing the best designs to win. Similarly the standards-based approach has enabled disparate implementations to work together without preventing commercial advantages from being sought and monetized.In the case of blockchains, we have already seen that there is a requirement to support external observers and this mandates a level of interoperability.We have looked at what a blockchain might or might not be, and perhaps seen some hints of what it might enable. The technology that underpins bitcoin can be used to build many things, and bitcoin\u0027s legacy should not just be bitcoin itself – it has shown the viability of something far more fundamental.The debate over what constitutes a blockchain won\u0027t end here, but we need to move the discussion forward and we need to resist the urge to allow it be just another marketing buzzword.To make that happen we need both clear terminology, and well-reasoned usage. We need to avoid conflating many different ideas, and we need technology claims to be realistic and achievable. If we fail then, eventually, the term \u0027blockchain\u0027 will be meaningless and have to be replaced. This seems like the wrong outcome.If we succeed then the idea of a blockchain will not be the end of the story. Instead it will take its place as a layer upon which better and ever-more useful systems can be built.This article was republished with permission from Hashingit.com.

However, the most recent announcement finds Gem advertising its service as an agnostic \u0027blockchain API\u0027, a move that puts it in line with industry firms such as ChangeTip and Uphold that have sought to diversify their offerings away from digital currencies in recent months.In conversation, Gem CEO Micah Winkelspecht acknowledged that the funding round comes at a time when the two-year-old company’s business strategy is changing.Gem’s product, he said, has become less \"bitcoin-focused\" as the company has sought to tap into a growing new market for blockchain project development expertise at enterprise financials.Winkelspecht compared his company\u0027s new model to competing competing blockchain API provider Chain, which raised a $30m Series A in September after pivoting away from bitcoin.Winkelspecht told CoinDesk:The CEO went on to suggest the startup has \"always realized\" its product would need to integrate with different blockchains, citing Gem’s integrations with the litecoin and dogecoin blockchains.In total, Gem has raised $10.4m to date as part of three public rounds.The latest round of funding notably saw participation from participants in Chain’s September funding round, including the Digital Currency Group and RRE Ventures.While Chain has cut its bitcoin API service, Winkelspecht indicated that Gem has no plans to stop supporting bitcoin-focused partners like Bitwage and Purse.Winkelspecht framed the shifting emphasis as a prudent one given that, in his view, users from the bitcoin industry don’t need to be educated on its products or the technology on which it is based.This, he suggested, is a sharp contrast from new customers, who require more time to learn how the tech can meet their needs.“Our goal is not to be a consulting company,\" he said. \"Why we do consulting is our customers need help. Before they’re building out a solution and they’re putting their engineers on it, there’s a huge amount of time on that.”Following the funding, Gem said it will seek to add new employees that can complement its existing engineering personnel, which means adding business support.Core to Gem’s strategy going forward, Winkelspecht said, is a belief that the bitcoin blockchain does not meet the needs of enterprise clients due to its inability to satisfy certain use cases.Winkelspecht worded his remarks carefully, but indicated that while he sees bitcoin’s proof-of-work mining network and open consensus algorithm as essential components of a decentralized global currency, they might limit the technology\u0027s wider adoption.\"Quite frankly, financial institutions don’t have the need for a censorship-resistant blockchain. They do have a need for speed, and custom assets that they can represent,\" he said.Still, he noted that, in his view, participants in the industry are \"talking past each other\", and that he believes the future will be one where there are many available blockchains.“Some will be more focused on solving smart contracts and automation, and some will be geared toward financial transactions, and some are going to be geared toward data management,” he added, concluding:Image credit: Mikadun / Shutterstock.com","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, Chain, Gem, Companies, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Jan 8, 2016 at 10:31 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/01/07/will-provenance-be-the-blockchains-break-out-use-case-in-2016/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/tKu71JeT1BVYS0-3nN5NjcK6P4Y\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/Y46VR3EBBVFOBFG3AU2HMK2AQE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Will Provenance Be the Blockchain\u0027s Break Out Use Case in 2016?","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"2015 may have been the year that financial institutions embraced blockchain technology, but as we move past the hype and the inevitable slump, it\u0027s best to focus on what today\u0027s blockchains can actually accomplish.One of the main appeals of blockchains among enterprises is the notion of a value network, where parties can transfer custody of valued assets in an auditable manner without relying on intermediaries.The recognition that these assets don’t necessarily have to be currencies, but that they can be any kind of financial instrument, has opened up new possibilities for innovation.Yet, the technology as it stands today has limitations that are yet to be resolved. Privacy on blockchains is probably the largest hurdle for adoption, because by default every transaction on a blockchain is visible to every user of that chain.Other problems relating to regulation and legal definitions will also need to be resolved, so it will take time for the full breadth of use cases to develop.In 2015, most of the use cases we\u0027ve seen with concrete proofs-of-concept focused on post-trade settlement, trade finance, payments and remittance. The common denominator is that these business processes harness blockchains as a provenance protocol.Much has been said about the blockchain as an ownership layer. But what exactly does that mean?It means that blockchains represent ownership of an asset in terms of control over the data relating to that asset. In other words, only the current owner can authenticate a transaction that would cause that asset to be transferred to another owner.This is provenance expressed in protocol form. The word \"provenance\" is derived from the French \"provenir\" which means \"to come from\", and is used to describe the custodial chronology of an object.Provenance is one of the backbones of economies, whether it relates to artifacts or real estate. There has always been a need to authenticate that a party actually owns an asset prior to any business dealing involving that asset, to ensure that the asset is \"true\" rather than stolen or faked.In the past, trusted third-parties have traditionally played this role.However, blockchains can streamline this function by serving as the infrastructure for registering and authenticating asset ownership between untrusting parties with common interests.But that’s not to say that blockchains can make all the intermediaries in the financial system go away. For example, even in an all-blockchain world, some may find themselves issuing tokens representing the assets to be transacted, offering anonymization services or acting as chain administrators.Time will tell if and how existing financial players can adapt to these roles.Regardless of how this plays out in the traditional financial sector, the past year has made it clear that tracking of ownership on a blockchain has been one of the most immediately feasible applications.Even on the bitcoin blockchain, we\u0027ve seen startups that focus solely on provenance, such as Everledger, Colu, Ascribe and Monegraph, gain significant attention.The tokens that blockchains track can also be used as digitized representations of the documents that accompany financial transactions.If we were to deconstruct the business processes of trade finance, we\u0027d see that many relate to the ordering and processing of shared documents between a group of untrusting parties.The same can be said for post-trade settlement and collateral management. And where \u0027smart contracts\u0027 have been used, they often act as computations that initiate and control these same changes in state.If we were to look beyond finance, a blockchain can also be used to manage data in a more general sense, providing a full audit trail of that data\u0027s origin in both time and place. Thus, a blockchain can act as a provenance protocol for data across disparate semi-trusting organizations.In the past year, we’ve even seen interest in using blockchains within a single enterprise, because they act as highly robust and resilient distributed databases, with the added bonus of an incontrovertible internal audit trail.As blockchain technology matures, more properties relating to provenance can be introduced.Today, we already have permissioned blockchains in which there is an explicit assignment from one party to another of the ability to connect, issue, send and receive assets, confirm transactions and administrate the blockchain.One can consider this as another type of provenance, in which the \u0027good\u0027 changing hands is a permission relating to the blockchain itself.In the future, assets on a blockchain will have more properties to authenticate and track, not only regarding their origins, but also how particular entities are permitted to hold and interact with them. Again, these properties will be assigned by particular sources.It might well be that, as a distributed ledger, blockchain tech\u0027s \u0027killer application\u0027 is as a provenance protocol that can accommodate different types of entities as they’re created, shared and used by multiple participants.Golden key image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Technology, Provenance, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Jan 7, 2016 at 1:09 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/01/05/vermonts-blockchain-recordkeeping-report-due-next-week/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Wzdorb1enjYGUHFuKNPeQJvpXBk\u003d/570x386/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/LKQXE5YNYFDWLHXVYK4XRXQIMA.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Vermont\u0027s Blockchain Recordkeeping Report Due Next Week","INTRO":"A report on the use of blockchain technology for storing state records is to be delivered to Vermont’s legislature by the end of next week.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A report on the use of blockchain technology as a mechanism for storing state records is set to be delivered to the Vermont legislature by 15th January.According to a summary of the bill, the study is intended to explore \"opportunities and risks\" for storing electronic facts using blockchain technology.

Financial institutions are already beginning to realize the potential of this next-generation business process improvement software to structurally alter shared practices between customers, competitors and suppliers.In our view, blockchain technology may result in a radically different competitive future in the financial services industry, where current profit pools are disrupted and redistributed toward the owners of new highly efficient blockchain platforms.We anticipate a lot of changes as we roll into the new year and see three trends we believe will be important:If you operate anywhere in the FinTech space, it\u0027s likely that you\u0027re already considering how to incorporate blockchain technology into your business.Established players, such as banks and exchanges, are looking for ways to refine and improve all kinds of transactions, while startups and service providers that understand the new technology are trying to learn how best to connect to and complement these business processes.As we enter 2016, we encourage established financial institutions entering into these conversations to understand what intellectual property they are sharing.Many industry participants have focused on the positive impact of industry collaboration from a technology standpoint. However, strategic collaboration certainly does not fit this open model.Consequently, we believe established financial institutions should build a core level of technical proficiency and understanding so they can better determine which information they should share in open forums versus what they should keep confidential.We see 2016 as a year in which financial institutions will be inundated with many options as new participants enter the market and start to compete with early movers.In 2015, we saw a large number of market participants begin to talk publicly about their innovative offerings related to blockchain.However, there were numerous other companies working on solutions. The fruits of those investments will certainly come to market as the year unfolds.As financial institutions explore their options in 2016, another challenge will be assessing the potential long-term viability of their FinTech partners.Companies looking to develop proofs-of-concept, pilots and even make direct investments must understand the financial position and strategic focus of their potential partners as well as the ecosystems that support them. We don\u0027t know at this point who will survive to see their next round of funding, but we certainly see a divergence of the successful startups from those that are running low on funding or being acquired.How can financial institutions filter, evaluate, and assess these new solutions to make sure they\u0027re a good investment?We advocate for strategic plans that help set parameters and steer the direction of investments and establish solid criteria for selecting projects and partners.In 2015, most of the focus of the market was on new transactional-based proof-of-concept solutions. As financial institutions enter 2016, we see attention shifting to the supporting systems and processes that underpin ongoing transactional excellence.The industry will need to explore governance, auditing and IT security, to name a few.We also see the beginning of the shift from financial institutions asking, \u0027How can we utilize blockchain?\u0027 to \u0027How can we establish the supporting processes to leverage this new technology?\u0027 and, more importantly, \u0027How do these new processes impact our risk profile?\u0027We advocate for early involvement of various corporate functions (such as compliance, risk and internal audit) so that proofs-of-concept don\u0027t get stalled and can more easily make the jump to the next round of internal funding.The benefits from new technology are rarely shared equally among market participants. Said differently, there are always winners and losers.As a result, the business benefits for many players may not materialize as promised.We see a possible future where savvy market participants partner with only a handful of players (in strategic partnerships that we call microconsortiums) to focus on transforming expensive internal processes into efficient shared platforms. The resulting platforms could then be sold as a service to smaller competitors.The ability to collaborate on both the strategic and business levels with a few key partners, in our view, could become key to competitive advantage in the coming years.Given the speed of adoption of blockchain technology, it may feel as though you\u0027re sending your recent kindergarten graduate off to college. We see 2016 as the summer break, when a great deal of preparation must be packed into a short time frame.Our advice? Make sure that you are not teaching too much more than you are learning. You’ll need a strategy for where you are going to place your bets.And you’ll need to understand much more than the technology itself in order to benefit from it.Crystal ball image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, PwC, 2015-review, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/29/4-hype-free-predictions-for-private-blockchains-in-2016/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/x3tjJjkbaRsFBkHhRZq57PQwUjE\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/HAXO3MQQDRA2PCJE2LYLKJRCEM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"4 Hype-Free Predictions for Private Blockchains in 2016","INTRO":"To cut through the hype around blockchain tech, outspoken Eris COO Preston Byrne offers these four predictions for 2016.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Preston Byrne is a co-founder and COO of Eris Industries and a fellow of the Adam Smith Institute. Previously, he was a securitisation and derivatives lawyer with Norton Rose Fulbright in London and he continues to \"geek out\" on high finance.It’s been said the only way to win the game of life is for your obituary to run in The Economist.By that measure, the blockchain (or rather, the idea of a blockchain as a distributed database, rather than merely a backbone for a cryptocurrency) is certainly doing well.This year alone, the blockchain has chalked up dozens (if not hundreds) of articles in most financial periodicals of record and the cover, no less, of The Economist. Even liberal culture hero Lawrence Lessig recently called the technology \"the most important innovation in fundamental architecture since the tubes of the Internet were first developed\".I agree with this assessment, albeit cautiously. I was there when bitcoin\u0027s earliest adopters were describing their technology in similarly high-flying terms (back in the heady days of Charlie Shrem and Mark Karpeles, before anyone noticed the three transaction-per-second throughput limits or before FinCEN got antsy about MSB licensing).It’s the same now with blockchains.Although the technology has considerable potential, given that so few people actually know how to build with it, there is a risk that failing to be sufficiently sober about its capabilities and straightforward about its drawbacks will lead us to apply it in ways that will not showcase this potential at its best.I would therefore like to humbly offer a few sober and fairly boring predictions for 2016, in the hope that this puts everyone in a hype-free state of mind for the new year.I’m often asked by journalists and VCs whether the blockchain game is a \u0027winner take all\u0027 proposition.To ask the question betrays a degree of ignorance about what blockchains actually do. Blockchains allow disparate groups to do things on a peer-to-peer basis that, to date, they have relied on third parties like IBM, Google or Amazon to do for them. They cut the data service provider, whomever that might be, out of the transaction and let the blockchain\u0027s pre-set transaction management rules do the heavy lifting.Let’s take bitcoin as an example.Most bitcoiners, when asked what problem bitcoin solves, will quickly respond with something like \"trust\" or \"value\" or \"intermediaries.\" But if we reread the white paper from a teleological point of view, these aspects of the bitcoin solution were the means to achieving an objective, not the objective itself.In the most abstract terms, the point of bitcoin is to provide verification and authentication for a particular type of transaction (cash payment) without the provision of personal information by either of the participants. In Satoshi’s own words, the problem bitcoin solves is privacy.To do this with money, you need to create both new money (bitcoin) as well as a distributed network architecture that doesn’t depend on a central machine (the blockchain). To do this with most commercial data, however, you don’t need to create a new asset class. What you need is to wrest control of network infrastructure away from existing data service providers and allow people to run that infrastructure themselves.Blockchains make sense because privacy and verifiability are not just problems in payments. Current free-to-use services, from search to email to social networking, are dependent on advertising revenue to fund their operations.As a result, companies offering these services must – to paraphrase Satoshi Nakamoto – hassle their users for considerably more information than they would otherwise need. This necessity has skewed the Internet toward a more centralized infrastructure than was originally intended, with attendant consequences for personal liberty and data security.Where bitcoin was designed to solve this centralisation problem in relation to point-of-sale and banking transactions, private blockchains hold the promise of distributing – if not fully decentralising – the logic of all manner of other apps. If we can prove who we are and enforce our relationships with cryptography, we don’t have to share as much data with each other.Nobody owns HTTP, and nobody’s going to own blockchain.Last week\u0027s news that IBM had developed a free, open-source blockchain and was donating that code to the Linux Foundation was greeted with widespread derision by the bitcoin community, including a number of prominent VCs.This lack of enthusiasm is extremely odd, keeping in mind the \u0027DIY Internet\u0027 that blockchain tech allows. Although bitcoin fans grate at the idea that permissioned databases should bear the name, it\u0027s clear from the white paper that bitcoin and the blockchain are clearly not the same thing.After all, bitcoin is \"a purely peer to peer version of electronic cash\", while a blockchain is four pages of technical writing that follows the phrase “a purely peer to peer version of electronic cash” and describe the database back-end that runs that application.If we were to summarise those four pages, we might come up with something like this: a shared datastore for peer-to-peer networks designed to \"reliably (manage) a large amount of data in a multi-user environment so that many users can concurrently access the same data.\"If the latter line sounds familiar, it\u0027s because it is. The part in quotation marks is Oracle describing its own open-source database management systems.Similarly, at Eris, our thesis is simple: what relational database management systems such as MySQL were in the 1990s and 2000s for computing silos, blockchains are in the 2010s and 2020s for distributed networks.So how is a \u0027private blockchain\u0027 innovative vis-a-vis existing databases? As Tim Swanson wrote about bitcoin, \"while all the individual elements that comprise the bitcoin blockchain have been around since 2001, it took until Satoshi\u0027s 2008 white paper to demonstrate how these individual pieces could be cobbled together to work as one.\"Private blockchains simply mix and match new components to better fit particular use cases. Where bitcoin needs (1) a timestamp server (which ‘chains the blocks’), (2) hashcash\u0027s proof-of-work algorithm, and (3) a digital signature scheme (ECDSA secp256k1),Most commercial chains with permissioning systems just keep what we need (the timestamping) and swap out what we don\u0027t with better components (eg: the Tendermint consensus algorithm plus EdDSA ed22519 signature algorithm).In 2016, this proposition will no longer be controversial.Mining is not, and will likely not ever be, relevant to running a private blockchain.The reasons for this are fairly straightforward: bitcoin mining isn’t \u0027transaction processing\u0027 or \u0027transaction validation\u0027, as both of these are done on an ongoing basis by full nodes on the bitcoin network as they propagate valid transactions to one another (verifying digital signatures).\u0027Mining\u0027 is not about validation: it is about fork choice. With a decentralised system like bitcoin\u0027s, anyone in the world can add a block to the end of the chain. As a result, a competitive mechanism is needed to penalise bad conduct.A private blockchain, on the other hand, is designed to suit a very specific coordination and communication need for a very specific person or group of people, some (or all) of which will be known.If you control those nodes or know who runs them, you can use the same digital signatures that secure a bitcoin balance (a write permission to spend bitcoin) to secure the chain (a write permission to add a block to the end of a chain).Chain security thus becomes a question of sufficiently distributing your nodes and effective key management. These are difficult problems, but they are (if done well) as effective and significantly more flexible than bitcoin’s approach.For bitcoin itself, of course, mining is likely to remain relevant for some years to come until a better solution can be found.Where 2015 was the year everyone talked about blockchain, 2016 is going to be the year everyone builds on it.There’s a lot of experimentation, improvement and optimisation left to do. In my personal opinion, we’re two budget cycles away from the first production systems in finance, and I agree with Chris Skinner, chair of the Financial Services Club, that we’re probably 10 years away from mainstream use.By \"mainstream use,\" of course, I mean that applications with blockchain back-ends are ubiquitous and the end-users don’t even know they’re using a blockchain.For the time being, however, there are numerous distributed networking platforms – including our own, OpenChain, Tendermint, MultiChain, and IPFS – which exist, work, and are free to use, and which some of the world’s largest corporations are already testing to solve difficult commercial problems, particularly in terms of business process efficiency.What this means for any financial institution or other business looking to use the tech is that the ball is entirely in your court.It’s cheap as chips to get started and there’s much to be learned, so there’s simply no excuse not to allocate budget and let your developers loose on this for a year – especially considering that your competitors already are.Want to share your opinion on bitcoin or blockchain in 2015, or a prediction for the year ahead?

The firm plans to use blockchain technology to cut down settlement and clearing times at incumbent financial firms, but has to date acquired most of its technology through acquisitions.\"The deal would need to improve materially for us to get involved,\" an anonymous executive at a financial company considering participating in the round told the Times. \"It’s not super compelling.\"Digital Asset is hoping to raise $35m to $45m in the funding round, which would value the startup at $100m, according to the report, figures that align with those published in a New York Post exclusive earlier this month.The news is notable as Masters has become something of a figurehead for the fledgling blockchain industry and, since taking on the role of chief executive at Digital Asset in March, is rumoured to have been working to promote blockchain technology within Wall Street institutions.Launched in early 2015, Digital Asset has been quiet in public until recently, when it announced it was involved in an open-source blockchain project spearheaded by IBM.According to the publication, Digital Asset representatives have denied allegations in the Times report.Maze image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Venture Capital, Blockchain Technology, Banking, Funding, News, Digital Asset Holdings, investors, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Dec 29, 2015 at 2:11 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/24/bitcoin-is-entering-the-age-of-practicality/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/8luQZn6cZyfR6KWzaP_RGLtuQpI\u003d/570x383/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/KM4MOBOZ2NASXM5IMSPC3257RA.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin is Entering the Age of Practicality","INTRO":"As the end of the year approaches, Fluent co-founder Lamar Wilson discusses what he believes should be the industry\u0027s plan of action for 2016.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Lamar Wilson is a programmer, web developer, serial entrepreneur and loving father. He co-founded the software development firm 212ths with his long-time friend and co-founder of Fluent, Lafe Taylor. Lamar is co-founder and CEO of Fluent, a B2B payment platform built on the blockchain.As the end of the year approaches, it is customary to begin thinking of what\u0027s next.We try to assess what changes can be made to better our lives, our businesses and our relationships. We ask what can we do differently that will push us positively towards our anticipated outcomes.In the spirit of this thinking, let\u0027s discuss bitcoin and blockchain technologies.Bitcoin and blockchain technologies are still in their infancy. Yet, millions of dollars have been invested and many companies have reaped tremendously from early adoption.But, it\u0027s important to note that the companies that have had the most success have done so by creating a foundation for the entire industry.As when building a house, the foundation is the first and possibly the most important element. Without it, the house would fall, and any good builder knows that you have to give the foundation a chance to cure before building on top of it.The companies we\u0027ll list below have built a pretty solid foundation on top of the ground that the core developers provided. The only problem is, sleeping on a concrete slab can prove to be uncomfortable.Enter the age of practicality.With the foundation laid, it is time to begin building practical solutions to real-world problems.People want to put all kinds of things on the blockchain – from gold to furniture receipts. If it exists, someone has pitched that it should be on a blockchain. But the blockchain is not some magic wand that solves all problems.The blockchain, at its core, is a database. It may be the Liam Neeson of databases, but still it\u0027s a database.This new age of practicality must be filled with companies solving real problems – problems that could not be solved before the gift Satoshi left for us (before returning to his alternate dimension).We as an industry must be able to look into every industry and every discipline and see what challenges a distributed, immutable ledger can really solve.We have debated on Reddit and other forums about what can be. But the new age must be filled with companies that not only see what can be, but build what should be.We have to embrace people from all disciplines and lend a ear to what struggles they have. We have to then be creative enough to innovate through cross-discipline association.There are a handful of companies that have already prepared us for this future.Companies like Blockcypher have become the Amazon Web Services for blockchain tech. They began with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin, and because of this early versatility, can now easily create private blockchain solutions with their full suite of tools.Companies like Coinbase and BitGo have become the \u0027First National Banks of Bitcoin\u0027, and are expanding to be Global Bitcoin and FX banks. They are providing a foundation for developers to build all types of transaction-heavy applications.Elsewhere, Zapchain has taken full advantage of the simple API Coinbase provides for tipping to reimagine social communities.Chainand the recently acquired Blockstack.io, focus (or focused) heavily on private blockchains and the tools to interact with them. R3 has done a great job of grabbing a piece of mindshare at some of the largest banks in the world, creating a foundation for meaningful engagement with incumbents.Michael J Casey at MIT Media Lab is helping to lead us toward this age by encouraging the MIT Sloan School of Management and the MIT School of Engineering to work together on blockchain technology, combining two world-class schools at a world-class institution.These types of actions will begin to create the walls of our industry\u0027s house. They will help discover new problems that we can then solve with technology.At Fluent, we\u0027ve found a very specific problem by talking to industry leaders and professionals about issues in their supply chains. Equipped with our knowledge of blockchain technology, we were able to build a solution that will solve this problem in a way that was impossible without the core technology.The beginning of the new year will be filled with optimism and glee, but when the confetti is cleared, we\u0027ll need to move forward toward solving real issues.Bring on the age of practicality.Father and son image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, 2015-review, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/24/what-the-blockchain-means-for-economic-prosperity/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/h0pwUiT8uPGAv1PIIGZjSb4sSW4\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/WBTBXK2AA5ET3GVL437OM3CKHU.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"What the Blockchain Means for Economic Prosperity","INTRO":"Authors Don and Alex Tapscott argue the Internet is entering a second era, one that gives us another shot to achieve a prosperous digital future.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Don Tapscott is the author of 15 books about the digital revolution in business and society, and chancellor of Trent University. Alex Tapscott is the CEO of North West Passage Ventures, an advisory firm building early stage companies in the blockchain space.Together, they are authors of the upcoming book, Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business and the World.The Internet is entering a second era, one that gives us another shot to achieve a prosperous future.Yes, the digital revolution has brought countless wonders. The Internet, the World Wide Web, social media, mobile computing, geospaciality, Big Data and the cloud have all enabled advancements in virtually every aspect of life.But when it comes to business, a careful analysis shows that the changes to date are only scratching the surface.Capitalism\u0027s basic institution, the corporation, has remained relatively unchanged. Hierarchy, vertical integration and bureaucracy – hallmarks of the industrial age – still reign.When it comes to the economy as a whole, the digital revolution has not had a positive impact on prosperity for most. There is real creation taking place but, paradoxically, social inequality is growing.The economies of many developed countries are growing, but for the first time in history there is no commensurate job creation.Privacy, the foundation of a free society, is being undermined by data \u0027frackers\u0027 and governments everywhere are using the Internet to create the surveillance society.Two billion people don’t have a bank account or participate in the global economy at all.Rather than the solution, technology has been a big part of the problem, and not just because a new round of automation – robotics or disruptive business models are wiping out parts of the workforce.The old paradigm in technology and media, whether broadcasting, print or mainframe computing, was to make things centralized and to control them with powerful forces. The recipients were passive.The new paradigm was supposed to be distributed, controlled by everyone and empowering to active participants.However, the distributed Internet was dropped into an economy that has concentrated power structures with the asymmetrical ability to shape it for their own purposes.Wealth, prosperity and freedom have arrived, but only for the few.Without an economic layer to the Internet, we can’t establish each other\u0027s identity or trust each other to transact without validation from a third party like a bank or a government.Quite the opposite: It allows people to commit fraud, collect our data and invade our privacy. It excludes 2.5 billion people from the global financial system. It channels power and prosperity to those who already have it, even if they\u0027re no longer earning it.What if the next generation of the Internet enabled not just the communication of information but the direct communication of value and money? What if we could build businesses, send transactions directly, peer-to-peer without powerful intermediaries?Well it’s happening. The digital revolution is bringing a new and radically different platform for business and other institutions that can take us through the next quarter century of human progress.At the core is the biggest innovation in computer science in a generation. It is the technology underlying the digital currency bitcoin – the blockchain.This technology platform is open and programmable. As such, it holds the potential for unleashing countless new applications and as-yet-unrealized capabilities that have the potential to transform everything in the next 25 years.At its core, the blockchain is a global database – an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions, but virtually everything of value and importance to humankind: birth and death certificates, marriage licenses, deeds and titles of ownership, educational degrees, financial accounts, medical procedures, insurance claims, votes, transactions between smart objects and anything else that can be expressed in code.This ledger represents the truth because mass collaboration constantly reconciles it. We will not need to trust each other in the traditional sense because the new platform ensures integrity.Think trust achieved through clever code and mass collaboration.Today, the new platform enables a reconciliation of digital records – call it The Digital Reconciliation.The Internet of Everything needs a Ledger of Everything. Business, commerce and the economy need a Digital Reckoning. Get ready for the World Wide Ledger.We believe the truth can set us free and distributed trust will profoundly affect people in all walks of life.Maybe you\u0027re a music lover who wants artists to make a living off their art. Or a consumer who wants to know where that hamburger meat came from. Perhaps you’re an immigrant who’s sick of paying big fees to send money home to loved ones in your ancestral land. Or a Saudi woman who wants to buy a fashion magazine.Maybe you’re an aid worker who needs to identify landowners so that you can rebuild their homes after an earthquake. Or a citizen fed up with the lack of transparency and accountability of political leaders. Or a user of social media who thinks all the data you generate might be worth something – to you – and that your privacy matters.Even as we write, innovators are building blockchain-based applications that serve these ends.

The bitcoin ecosystem now includes a number of financial intermediaries, like wallet providers and exchanges, and these show a trend towards concentration.\"All this in the same week as Satoshi Nakamoto has been identified as an Australian academic called Craig Steven Wright, or is he? Some say that Mr Wright was part of an extortion scheme.We shall see, but it seems to me that Satoshi is still to be found, and Cornell Professor Emin Gün Sirer kind of tells us as it is: Who cares?Anyways, attending a discussion about blockchain and bitcoin earlier this week, I heard the simplest summary of what it’s all about.Bitcoin is a currency, a method of value exchange and a smart way to record contracts. As a technology it is good at these three things, and that’s what we should focus upon.For banks, the permissioned and shared ledger structures enabled by bitcoin technology provide value exchange and smart contracts is what the whole financial system has woken up to, which is why we talk about blockchain more than bitcoin.Private ledgers enable banks to exchange value in a trusted shared network, and that network can be backed by USD, EUR or RMB, no bitcoin required.The \u0027no bitcoin required\u0027 systems are all based upon private shared structures, and the key to this is to remember that word shared.No blockchain development has value in the financial system unless it\u0027s shared by a critical mass of people.Hence R3 is interesting, with Sberbank being the latest bank wanting to join the global consortium of 30 banks and financial institutions. Even SWIFT is finally making commitments to blockchain developments, so these things are moving fast.Meantime, I remember thinking when UBS announced a \"settlement coin\" on the blockchain that it would go nowhere unless other banks committed. UBS has now designated ownership of the coin to Clearmatics, who are trying to create an R3 for post-trade markets, so these things are moving fast.In fact some would say, and I’m one of the them, that 2015 has been all about the blockchain.This piece originally appeared on the Financial Services Club Blog and has been republished with the author\u0027s permission.Globe and chain image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, UBS, Banking, R3CEV, 2015-review, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/22/why-insurers-caught-the-blockchain-bug-in-2015/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/1peiSl20IdnQd9ORFlXC--O90yY\u003d/570x368/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/UCH54IACSNCPFPFCPUJK537BYA.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Why Insurers Caught the Blockchain Bug in 2015","INTRO":"Z/Yen\u0027s Michael Mainelli explores how distributed ledgers could at last fully modernise an insurance industry that still over relies on paper.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Professor Michael Mainelli is executive chairman of Z/Yen Group and principal advisor to Long Finance. His latest book, The Price of Fish: A New Approach to Wicked Economics and Better Decisions, written with Ian Harris, won the 2012 Independent Publisher Book Awards Finance, Investment \u0026 Economics Gold Prize.In this special feature, Mainelli explores how distributed ledgers and blockchains could fully modernise an industry that still relies heavily on paper.In April 2015, Lloyd’s of London launched the Target Operating Model (TOM) project. TOM is a central body responsible for delivering modernisation to the still heavily paper-based wholesale insurance transactions in the London insurance markets.You can state ‘I Support TOM’ on a registration site or ‘like’ TOM on social media. There have been several ‘innovation’ events. There is an orange logo reminiscent of the 1990s when ‘orange was the new black’. The project has even tried to coin yet another tech mashup for the London insurance markets surrounding Lloyd’s – ‘InsTech’.This is not the first time that the London insurance markets have tried to modernise. They are serial reformers, their attempts have had varying degrees of success, from total failure to middling impact.Limnet (London Insurance Market Network) made progress with electronic data interchange in the 1980s and early 1990s. Electronic Placement Support (EPS) worked in the late 1990s, but few used it. Kinnect, at a cost conservatively quoted as £70m, was abandoned in 2006. Project Darwin, 2011 to 2013, achieved little. The Message Exchange Limited (TMEL) is a messaging hub for ACORD messages that has had modest success, but most people still use email.Numerous private exchanges or electronic messaging ventures have gained only partial market shares. Xchanging Ins-Sure Services (XIS), a claims and premiums processing joint venture, was formed in 2000 and runs adequately, but there is still a lot of paper involved.A swift walk round Lloyd’s, perhaps passing by the famous Lamb Tavern in Leadenhall Market, reveals a lot of heavy bundles of paper lengthening the arms of long-term insurers.Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919) was a German biologist and philosopher who proposed a (now largely discredited) biological hypothesis, the \u0027theory of recapitulation\u0027. He proposed that in developing from embryo to adult, animals go through stages resembling or representing successive stages in the evolution of their remote ancestors. His catchphrase was “ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny”.In a similar way, TOM seems to be going through all the previous stages of former wholesale insurance modernisation projects, databases, networks and messaging centres, but may come out at the end to realise the potential of mutual distributed ledgers (aka blockchain technology).Information technology systems may have now evolved to meet the demanding requirements of wholesale insurance.Wholesale insurance differs from capital market finance in some important ways.First, insurance is a ‘promise to pay in future’, not an asset transfer today. Second, while capital markets trade on information asymmetry, insurance is theoretically a market of perfect information and symmetry – you have to reveal everything of possible relevance to your insurer, but each of you has different exposure positions and interpretations of risk. Third, wholesale insurance is ‘bespoke’. You can’t give your insurance cover to someone else.These three points lead to a complex set of interactions among numerous parties.Clients, brokers, underwriters, claims assessors, valuation experts, legal firms, actuaries and accountants all have a part in writing a policy, not to mention handling subsequent claims.People from the capital markets who believe insurance should become a traded market miss some key points. Let’s examine two: one about market structure and one about technology.People use trusted third parties in many roles in finance, for settlement, as custodians, as payment providers, as poolers of risk.Trusted third parties perform three roles, to:The hundreds of firms in the London markets are rightly concerned about a central third party who might hold their information to ransom. They want to avoid natural monopolies, particularly as agreed information is crucial over multi-year contracts. They are also concerned about a central third party that must be used for messaging because, without choice, the natural monopoly rents might become excessive.Many of the historic reforms failed to propose technology that recognised this market structure. Mutual distributed ledgers (MDLs) though provide pervasive, persistent, and permanent records.MDL technology securely stores transaction records in multiple locations with no central ownership. MDLs allow groups of people to validate, record and track transactions across a network of decentralised computer systems with varying degrees of control of the ledger.In such a system, everyone shares the ledger. The ledger itself is a distributed data structure held in part or in its entirety by each participating computer system. Trust in safeguarding and preservation moves from a central third-party to the technology.Emerging techniques, such as, smart contracts and decentralised autonomous organisations, might in future also permit MDLs to act as automated agents.Because MDLs enable organisations to work together on common data they exhibit a paradox. MDLs are logically central, but technically distributed. They act as if they are central databases where everyone shares the same information.However, the information is distributed across multiple, or multitudinous, sites so that no one person can gain control over the value of the information. Everyone has a copy. Everyone can recreate the entire market from someone else’s copy. However, everyone can only ‘see’ what their cryptographic keys permit them.How do we know this works? We at Z/Yen, a commercial think-tank, have built several insurance application prototypes for clients who seek examples such as motor, small business and insurance deal-rooms. The technical success of blockchain technologies in cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple have shown that complex multi-party transactions are possible using MDLs.And we have build a system that handles ACORD messages with no need for ‘messaging’.Z/Yen’s work in this space dates from 1995. Until recently, though, most of those in financial services dismissed MDLs as too complex and insecure.The recent mania around cryptocurrencies has led to a reappraisal of their potential, as blockchains are just one form of MDL. That said, MDLs are ‘mutual’, and a number of people need to move ahead together.Further, traditional commercial models of controlling and licensing intellectual property are less likely to be successful at the core of the market. The intellectual property needs to be shared.A message is getting out on the jungle drums that MDLs, while not easy, do work at a time when people are rethinking the future of wholesale insurance.If TOM helps push people to work together, perhaps this time market reform will embrace a generation of technology that will finally meet the demands of a difficult, yet essential and successful, centuries-old market.Perhaps TOM should be beating the MDL drums more loudly.Insurance image via ShutterstockWant to share your opinion on bitcoin or blockchain in 2015, or a prediction for the year ahead?

Instead, she argued, the issue resides with the lack of information available to people wanting to make those purchases.This is where the blockchain technology comes in.\"What we see is really exciting with the blockchain in that there is finally a method of perhaps gathering this data from far-flung areas where products are being produced and having that connected to an open ledger that isn\u0027t governed by anyone,\" said Baker. \"So, it can be committed there and also help people who are already gathering that information to do so in a more interoperable way from the get-go, such as certificates, for example.\"Provenance sets out to help businesses become more transparent, both on a business and product level.\"More recently we have been looking on an item level, so looking specifically at tracking and being more transparent about what is going on with individual items,\" said Baker.The objective in doing so, she added, is two-fold: greater transparency will translate in increased information for consumers about the product\u0027s provenance, but it will also serve to build trust in brands and producers that behave well.To this end, Provenance is building on both the bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. However, Baker was quick to discuss the benefits of using the latter.\"So, with bitcoin, we can do a certain degree of stuff: we can track assets through a chain of custody, for example ... but when you start to look at consensus mechanisms – such as, is this product organic – and therefore carrying that certification along the chain ... Ethereum lends itself a little bit better.\"Provenance has been working with various small- and medium-sized enterprises in the UK to test how the platform performs and is looking to expand abroad with an upcoming pilot. This will see it put \"the first fish on the blockchain\" in the coming year.Baker said:Although she declined to divulge specifics, she said that the project would see her team work with fisherman in Indonesia who catch pole and line-caught tuna for the Japanese sashimi market.As part of the endeavour, Provenance is set to work with a local NGO, charged with verifying the produce\u0027s social and environmental sustainability. The token – in this case holding the provenance information of the fish – would get carried along the blockchain throughout the whole supply chain until it reaches its destination in Japan.This will allow consumers to observe the produce\u0027s attributes, such as its freshness, the day it was caught and whether the produce has been handled in a socially and environmentally compliant manner.\"It kind of gives you this extra dimension to the old shashimi,\" Baker commented.Aside from helping to build transparency by leveraging distributed ledger technology, Baker told CoinDesk that Provenance is also seeking to make bitcoin\u0027s underlying technology far more available outside of FinTech.She said:Provenance\u0027s quest to drive awareness about blockchain technology, however, does not come without its own set of challenges.The issue, Baker thinks, is that currently the industry is fairly dominated by financial services but also \"anarchists, super geeks and greedy venture capitalists\".In order for the use of the technology to prevail, Barker said that more diversity is required. \"I think that unless we add diversity to that ecosystem, it\u0027s going to be a slower uptake before we start to see some real-world, useful application outside of finance,\" she said.Baker is personally excited by what blockchains can do in general, primarily in terms of legal frameworks, trust frameworks and the Internet.\"I think at the moment we are not even scratching the surface for its potential because I think there isn\u0027t enough diversity in the ecosystem yet to really uncover those ideas,\" she said.Provenance, Baker said, is fully funded until 2017 following the procurement of various grants, including funding from Innovate UK and the European Union\u0027s Horizon 20/20 fund.\"This year has been a big year for us,\" she said. At the moment, the startup is upheld by five full-time staff and five freelancers, but Baker said there are plans in the pipeline to continue growing and developing its permanent workforce.Provenance, she explained, has gone from being a side-project, undertaken along with her studies, to now becoming a full-time endeavour.\"It\u0027s not just blockchain stuff ... [we are doing] a lot of data stuff, helping people gather, organise and convey information for their supply chain. The blockchain is a really great asset for the authenticity layer,\" she said.Vegetables image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, Provenance, Companies, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Dec 17, 2015 at 3:23 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/17/12-more-banks-join-blockchain-consortium-r3/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/T0AjDITLkCxiaft7dZP8H5wi77s\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/UFXLT3LZABHRNH46LQ57NBZSAQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"12 More Banks Join Blockchain Consortium R3","INTRO":"Twelve more banks have joined the distributed ledger consortium led by startup R3CEV.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"UPDATE (17th December 14:25 BST): This article has been updated with additional information.Twelve additional banks have joined the blockchain consortium led by startup R3CEV.New entrants to the group include Banco Santander, Danske Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Natixis, Nomura, Northern Trust, OP Financial Group, Scotiabank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, US Bancorp, Westpac Banking Corporation and BMO Financial Group.The consortium, announced in September, is focused on proof-of-concept experimentation and the development of standards for blockchain tech.

This first step could also solve for moving assets into and out of a closed blockchain network,\" it says.From this point, blockchain technology can scale up by replacing the manual processes at a subset of banks, providing what McKinsey called a \"solid testing ground\" for the tech.\"Small networks of market participants could convene to agree on standards and protocols for booking and transfer with relatively little investment and with the potential to improve current operations,\" the report reads.This stage would be followed by the conversion of inter-dealer-dominated markets and finally the large-scale adoption by buyers and sellers in public markets.Today, McKinsey found blockchain adoption is happening most rapidly in over-the-counter markets, where \"volumes are lower and operations are more manual\".Other areas where blockchain solutions are likely to proliferate, the report said, are in asset-backed securities, precious metals, repurchase agreements, syndicated bank debt, title insurance and unregistered securities.Many of the use cases targeted by early entrants into the bitcoin space, the report suggested, will need longer to develop.Notably, this includes the application of the technology in the payments sector:Staircase image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Research, Blockchain Technology, payments, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Dec 16, 2015 at 10:14 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/16/sec-approves-overstocks-plan-to-issue-blockchain-securities/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/_gl0c2_JC0VvueL8memjSwOe7gY\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/CBEPUAMXBNFMVLYP2ZE3AMGB4M.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"SEC Approves Overstock\u0027s Plan to Issue Blockchain Securities","INTRO":"The SEC has approved Overstock\u0027s plans to issue stock via the blockchain through its subsidiary tØ platform, a report says.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has reportedly approved Overstock\u0027s plans to issue stock via the blockchain through its subsidiary tØ platform.According to Wired, the company was granted an amended Form S-3 – a requirement solely for companies that report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 – meaning that it could now issue public securities leveraging blockchain technology.It is still unclear when the company will issue its first public security on a distributed ledger but Patrick Byrne, Overstock\u0027s CEO, told Wired:Submitted back in April, Overstock\u0027s S-3 form application filing outlined how the online retail giant was planning on issuing new stocks or securities, possibly amounting to as much as $500m.The reports of the approval come after Byrne revealed Overstock\u0027s long-awaited blockchain-based private and public equities trading platform – known as tØ – in August this year at Nasdaq\u0027s New York headquarters.According to the US retailer\u0027s latest quarterly reports, released in November, Overstock spent $3.2m on its blockchain securities initiative during the previous three months.Image via Shutterstock.","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, SEC, startups, Overstock, Patrick Byrne, News, Companies, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Dec 16, 2015 at 2:15 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/14/ing-exec-all-our-business-lines-involved-in-blockchain-exploration/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/JHqnexRZom1ZHHQOrBaU7EYk4zw\u003d/570x346/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/TDUQFMYYIJC27C2CMR6GBW5QUM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"ING Exec: ‘All Our Business Lines’ Involved in Blockchain Exploration","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"“It’s quite an effort.”So says Mark Buitenhek, global head of transaction services for Dutch banking and financial services group ING.In a new interview, Buitenhek told CoinDesk that the Amsterdam-based bank is pushing forward with a broad-reaching initiative to explore blockchain technology – a process that includes working with a global group of banks, as well as conducting in-house experimentation across a range of departments.ING was among a group of five banks that announced in November that they were joining the global banking consortium headed up by startup R3 CEV.Buitenhek said:According to Buitenhek, the bank sees the potential for blockchain applications in a variety of banking and finance contexts, including securities and trade settlement, internal transacting, e-identity and also as a backbone for connected devices.“We do see the potential – we don’t know if it’s going to work. But if it’s going to work, it’s going to be big. That’s why we want to invest time, effort and money now,” he said.Buitenhek said that one of the driving forces behinds the bank\u0027s efforts to explore bitcoin and the blockchain that underlies it is the fact that a large number of its staff had already been experimenting with the technology on their own initiative.“Two years ago – somewhere in 2013 – we started to look at this. We found out that over 100 of our IT staff were playing with applications of blockchain, including bitcoin. We didn’t even know about it.”The process of looking at the technology, he said, is now very much a “bottom-up” process and reflects a change over what had previously been a top-down, hierarchical process.“It’s also a new sign of the times,” he added.As one of a group of more than 30 banks working collaboratively, ING said that it was in strong support of the R3 effort and expects that much of the “granular” heavy lifting will take place over the next year.The early efforts appears to be paying off. In a recent interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, R3 director of research and author Tim Swanson suggested that a distributed ledger connecting consortium members could be active as early as a year from now.Buitenhek struck a positive note about the initial phases of the project:Despite the blockchain\u0027s promise, Buitenhek suggested that the outcome of ING’s exploration of the technology will rest on whether any operational problems can be met.“We need to look at our problems and see if the blockchain is a solution rather than the other way around,” he said. “And that is one of the things we’re focusing on, is making sure that our people don’t come up with fantastic application of what is possible with blockchain, but it really isn\u0027t an answer to a problem.”He pointed to efforts in recent decades to onboard new types of technology within the banking system that, despite early hype and millions spent, failed to have a significant enough impact to elicit sufficient demand and justify the investments.To that end, Buitenhek went on to say, the bank plans to spend the next several years looking at the technology internally, as well as externally through the R3 consortium.He said:“But we want to try right now and see what comes out. And that’s why we joined R3,” he said.Image Credit: Nessluop / Shutterstock.com","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, ING, Banking, News, R3CEV, Companies, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Dec 14, 2015 at 12:32 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/13/how-deloittes-rubix-is-approaching-blockchain-tech/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/apG_NE0Nh40dJA5RbhVwqiUPMC8\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/ZLAPPWBIF5AUNI2OEQ6ZEP44WI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How Deloitte\u0027s Rubix is Approaching Blockchain Tech","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"\u0027Big four\u0027 professional services firm Deloitte made headlines earlier this year when it revealed it had become the latest in a long line of mainstream brands to take an interest in blockchain technology.However, Deloitte is perhaps distinguished from its peers due to the fact that it is seeking to help clients, including mainstream financial institutions, launch pilots and proofs-of-concepts with the emerging technology.To better understand Deloitte\u0027s path to this new market, CoinDesk spoke to Iliana Oris Valiente, business development manager and co-founder at Rubix – a service it calls a \"one-stop blockchain software platform\".Launched after approximately a year of R\u0026D, Oris Valiente said, Deloitte is now equipped to help business clients she argues are just starting to wake up to the future possibilities of what could be built with blockchain technology.Oris Valiente told CoinDesk:Oris Valiente said that a key driver of interest in the service is the desire for financial services providers to determine how the technology could mature so they can best develop a forward-looking business strategy today.However, Deloitte is not alone in the trying to serve this market and its competitors in the space include tech giants like Microsoft and rival PriceWaterhouseCoopers, both of whom have launched similar initiatives.Given this climate, Oris Valiente was careful not to divulge specifics about current projects, though she did hint at some of the organization\u0027s work.For example, Oris Valiente told CoinDesk her team is currently working with a client in the healthcare sector to build a prototype to enable payments.\"[The client\u0027s] expectation is that these POCs [proof-of-concepts], [will] serve as a reminder or a signal to the rest of the organisation, their respective organisation about what is to come ... and what the technology is capable of supporting today,\" she said.Other areas of possible focus, she added, would be looking at applications in the loyalty space and supply chain sector, both areas she said where automation could change existing business practices.\"One aspect of the technology that I think is going to have a significant impact is the automation of certain procesess ... by providing the transparency and the open ledger, if you can drive efficiencies in existing processes that\u0027s a very clear value proposition of the technology,\" she said.Perhaps most notable is the fact that Rubix is offering its clients access to multiple distributed consensus platforms.According to Oris Valiente, Rubix has focused most of its work to date on the Ethereum protocol, which she argued offers functionality that is of particular interest to enterprise clients.Launched in 2014, Ethereum is an open, public blockchain like bitcoin, only it aims to enable the rise of a new class of decentralised applications due to its inclusion of a Turing-complete scripting language.The comments come as many financial incumbents are experimenting with both the bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain in an effort to understand the distributed financial technology stack.\"Often what people are describing when they talk about the power of blockchain technology, they are referring to what Ethereum has been able to build, without realising it\u0027s Ethereum,\" she said.A key advantage of the Ethereum protocol, Oris Valiente said, is that its clients can use the protocol to ensure products being built are capable of intra-connectivity amongst various other platforms.\"At the end of the day our role as a team is to do what is best for the client and if the client comes to us and has a use case that makes perfect sense to be built on top of the bitcoin blockchain ... we are happy to do that,\" she said.Oris Valiente also addressed the interest among mainstream financial providers in private or permissioned blockchains.In doing so, she was quick to point out that the efforts are perhaps problematic in their approach. For example, many major financial institutions have expressed reservations about bitcoin as a digital currency, and their intent to pursue projects that don\u0027t use, or limit access to, similar digital tokens.However, Oris Valiente noted that tokenisation is required in order to maintain decentralised ledger systems. \"You can\u0027t have the blockchain without a token, of course,\" she explained.Oris Valiente further voiced her belief that there is potential for digital currencies to succeed in the future:She added that she believes there are hurdles that need to be overcome if any digital currency is ever to reach mainstream adoption in developed markets.\"Is virtual currency going to become very dominant in an established markets where we already have options as consumers and various alternatives? Maybe not because of the lack of accessible tools and the various hurdles for people to apprehend the technology,\" she added.In this light, Oris Valiente said clients are looking at blockchain technology as a way to build new products in emerging markets that would have been previously impossible to create or distribute.A perfect example of this, she said, is in the insurance industry, where the technology could be used as a way to eliminate the need for consumers to have trusted relationships with insurers.\"All of a sudden if you think about blockchain technology, as an enabler of something like a peer-to-peer insurance platform in emerging markets ... well, you\u0027ve just created a new product that brings value to an entire community and moves towards financial inclusion and poverty alleviation,\" she said.But how far are we from such applications?Oris Valiente said believes that this transition is likely going to take place once industry initiatives move past the exploratory phases and begin to consolidate.\"Once you start seeing all those little Lego pieces coming together into a comprehensive network, I think that is when you are going to start seeing a lot of very meaningful impacts,\" she said, concluding:Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.Puzzle piece image via Shustterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, Deloitte, Companies, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Dec 13, 2015 at 10:30 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/09/blockchain-technology-explored-at-techcrunch-disrupt-london/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/hvKaoJVN7pckcJjE1yjiKe0oB60\u003d/570x295/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/OV7LGFRHBVGCXI7RZNLFUJEIDI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain Technology Explored at TechCrunch Disrupt London","INTRO":"Blockchain technology was discussed during a panel at TechCrunch Disrupt London, held earlier this week.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"With blockchain technology enjoying buzzword status in mainstream finance and technology circles, it is hardly surprising that TechCrunch Disrupt London, held earlier this week, hosted a panel to discuss the potential of bitcoin and the blockchain.Led by TechCrunch editor and Freemit CEO John Biggs, the panel consisted of Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, Blockstream CEO Austin Hill and Steve Waterhouse, partner at the bitcoin investment firm and hedge fund Pantera Capital.The discussion, which touched upon various areas of debate, was first sparked by Biggs\u0027 questions about the possibility of separating bitcoin, the digital currency, from its underlying technology, the blockchain.Hill, whose firm develops technology on the bitcoin blockchain, was first to answer, noting how the question rests on whether financial institutions ought to build their own private blockchains, or if they should use public decentralised ledgers such as the bitcoin.With this in mind, Hill commented on how previous attempts to create decentralized protocols had failed in the past.\"I was involved in the early 90s in a company that worked on this, we spent millions trying to build e-cash, and all of the previous systems ... they all failed because of a central concept, central trusted parties,\" he said, adding:Hill also paid tribute to what the bitcoin protocol and the R\u0026D behind it had done for the development of specialized chips as a whole, noting how the the digital currency\u0027s mining industry had propelled it \"forward three or four years\".From a technical perspective, Hill explained how bitcoin served as a reward for participants in the network:There are, he said, some instances in which issuing digital tokens in the form of a cryptocurrency is not appropriate, pointing to US dollars issued on a ledger as an example.Buterin, whose Ethereum project oversees an open, public blockchain for decentralized applications, delved further into the debate, adding that, for him, the need to tie bitcoin to the blockchain rested on the types of applications that people were concerned with exploring or building.\"Do you actually care about the currency?\" he asked. \"Is the issue being about the Federal Reserve being corrupt and you wanting to replace the Federal Reserve?\"Having already invested in various notable startups in the bitcoin blockchain space, Waterhouse said that Pantera Capital puts a greater focus on bitcoin\u0027s underlying technology.\"We\u0027ve tended to look more at this as a a technology, as an infrastructure and I think it is important sometimes to take a longer view ... I think that if you look at distributed networks, the Web, when it first, started off, it was not good for streaming real time video, but now we do it quite easily,\" he told the panel, adding:Waterhouse went on to call for public attention to shift from how the blockchain could not only disrupt existing technologies but also potentially replace them. Instead, he urged the industry to consider the endless possibilities brought by decentralised ledger systems.\"To me, it\u0027s not important to think which industries are going to die or what banks are not going to work out. To me, it\u0027s more interesting to think what are the new kind of things that you can start very easily because you have this open protocol of the network,\" he added.The comments by Waterhouse on how banks are interacting with blockchain technology did not go unnoticed and resulted in further queries from Biggs about the extent to which they were actively engaged.\"There are some that are way more mature in their development cycle. I know of a couple of banks that have more than 150 people working on blockchain technologies,\" Blockstream\u0027s Austin Hill said.Picking up on a recent patent filing by Goldman Sachs for its own in-house settlement cryptocurrency, Hill added that the technology\u0027s potential goes beyond financial technology and banking, putting forward transactional insurance for the peer-to-peer economies as an example.Finally, Hill concluded by alluding to the robustness of the bitcoin protocol, hinting future development is to be expected.\"Frankly one of the best things bitcoin has done is that it painted a $1bn-10bn security bounty on the protocol which is out there, available to be stolen. So over the last six years, I don\u0027t there is a system that has undergone more peer review or stress testing than bitcoin, and that gives people a lot of confidence to then build on that as a platform.\"Images via Yessi Bello Perez for CoinDesk","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, TechCrunch, startups, News, Events, Companies, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Dec 9, 2015 at 10:55 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/12/09/grammy-winner-imogen-heap-blockchain-tech-can-empower-artists/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/LZ1IK6s4eXg4nxi226NvQ8cV-kg\u003d/570x384/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/6BR7TWN26JC3VBQ6U5V34NW6XU.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Grammy Winner Imogen Heap: Blockchain Tech Can Empower Artists","INTRO":"British singer and songwriter Imogen Heap has discussed how blockchain technology could help empower musicians.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"British singer and songwriter Imogen Heap has discussed how blockchain technology could help empower musicians.Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt London yesterday, Heap, a self-confessed technologist and Grammy Award winner, told the audience that a revolution among artists was impending and that smart contracts on the blockchain could transform the ways in which people in the industry interact with data.She added:Heap made headlines earlier this year when she released her song \"Tiny Human\"and its associated data on the Ethereum blockchain at a special event hosted by The Guardian.During her panel discussion, at yesterday\u0027s event, the singer also picked up on the issue of monetisation within the music industry.\"The single biggest problem for an artist right now is payment.

Boroujerdi, is also quick to note that the \"hype is high\" and that \"roadblocks\" remain before blockchain technology\u0027s potential can be fully realised.Boroujerdi chose to highlight the decentralized nature of the bitcoin blockchain as its major advantage over existing financial ledger systems.Cutting out the middleman means blockchain technology can operate more efficiently, more securely and at a lower cost than current systems, Boroujerdi writes, adding that it can reduce counterparty risk and has the potential to provide instant feedback on transaction risks and costs.The report highlights a number of use cases for blockchain technology, ranging from back-office functions and regulatory paperwork at banks to notarising alternative assets like artwork or providing a record of academic certificates.According to the report:The report also points out some of the potential problems with blockchain technology.Among them are restricted scalability, with the bitcoin blockchain\u0027s seven transactions per second compared unfavourably to VisaNet\u0027s 47,000.It also notes that the question of public or private blockchains may cause friction, slowing adoption and increasing fragmentation.Boroujerdi points to a healthy startup ecosystem benefitting from \"exponential\" growth in venture capital invested, but highlights the fact that there are players in the ecosystem beyond the startup world who could bring the technology to corporate America.Outside startups, Goldman is closely following the work done by the banking consortium R3CEV (of which Goldman is a member); IBM\u0027s ADEPT project, which seeks to marry the Internet of Things and blockchain technologies; and Nasdaq, which has built its Linq private markets platform on a blockchain.Can blockchains exist without bitcoin?

For more than a year, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, the nation\u0027s economic lawmaking body, has been repeatedly and staunchly against allowing its use as an alternative to government-issued money. Just last month, for example, deputy finance minister Alexey Moiseev told CoinDesk that the Ministry was working on a draft law that would seek to punish those converting cryptocurrencies into the ruble with up to four years in prison. Outside of these statements, however, the agency\u0027s opinion on bitcoin as a financial technology has been less clear. Speaking to CoinDesk, Moiseev said that his office was dealing with bitcoin and its underlying technology in different ways: Nonetheless, Moiseev remained vocal about the dangers of bitcoin as a means for facilitating payments, though his comments displayed a less aggressive stance than has been outwardly projected by his agency.\"We appreciate the potential relevance of blockchain technology for the development of e-commerce and therefore we feel that it should be allowed and developed, but bitcoin themselves, in particular, the implementation of the bitcoin transactions into the real economy, in the real banking system can be very dangerous,\" he concluded.Moiseev also elaborated on the reasons the Ministry of Finance believes new rules are necessary, citing the digital currency\u0027s association with money laundering and terrorism financing. But while Russia may be looking to potentially criminalise bitcoin-to-fiat conversions, Moiseev said that he did not perceive bitcoin to be a threat to Russia\u0027s national currency.Since its emergence government regulators have struggled to determine how best to regulate digital currencies, and whether new laws need to be applied to businesses using the technology.New York, for example, introduced unique state law governing its use, but despite its early movement on this issue, other US states have largely sought to update or apply past statutes to cover the technology.Of the government organizations that have issued comments on digital currency, many are concerned about that the payment method is being used by cybercriminals, the evidence of which has encouraged fears bitcoin could be leveraged by terrorists, a view that has been given new attention in the wake of last week\u0027s terrorist attacks in Paris.The topic of terrorism is clearly on Moiseev\u0027s mind as well, as the deputy finance minister expressed concerns about bitcoin potentially making the country\u0027s financial system more vulnerable to exploitation:He then went one step further, noting that Russia was monitoring how bitcoin was being regulated by its contemporaries in both Europe and elsewhere.\"We are looking at how bitcoins are being regulated, how they are being protected from potential abuse by money launderers and terrorists,\" he added.Despite adding clarity to the conversation, Moissev\u0027s comments don\u0027t successfully foretell how the technology will be regulated in Russia. Russia\u0027s central bank has indicated it is against measures that would outlaw its use, and the organization\u0027s view was supported by President Vladimir Putin when he discussed digital currencies for the first time in July this year. At the time, Putin backed the Bank of Russia\u0027s advocacy for the technology but also implied that bitcoin is \"backed by nothing\", and thus might require special oversight. Although bitcoin\u0027s future remains uncertain in Russia, it is perhaps safe to say that crypto enthusiasts can remain at ease at least for now. The draft law – which would criminalise bitcoin conversions – pursued by the Ministry of Finance is being reviewed by the Cabinet, a process which is expected to take a few months, and will then have to be submitted to the country\u0027s Parliament for final approval.

The ideas were presented by Michael Mainelli, an emeritus professor at Gresham College and executive chairman of Z/Yen, a think-tank and venture capital firm.Mainelli said online digital deal-rooms could significantly change the way business is currently done in the London Market. While such technology already exists, few market participants make use of it.Instead, they rely on physical proximity to one another, personal relationships and paper documents to get deals done, he said.\"Everyone [in the market] works within three minutes of Lloyds, but they also know they\u0027re dirt if they renege on a contract. Within hours everyone will freeze them out,\" Mainelli added.But an online deal-room using a blockchain could make the London Market more attractive to international business, which could drive significant growth for Lloyd\u0027s and the London Market, he pointed out.\"If we were sitting in Hong Kong right now and decided to create a global insurance market, we could build a quick deal-room and we would automate it from the start,\" added Mainelli.A blockchain-based deal-room would strip out the need to trust an intermediary while providing an accurate record of the documents shared by the deal\u0027s participants.\"It gives you a database that\u0027s unalterable and nobody owns. It\u0027s a ledger of who sent what to whom, when, forever. That\u0027s an important part [of the insurance process],\" Mainelli said.The other technologies presented at the Lloyd\u0027s seminar included peer-to-peer lending and alternative cross-border payments. The seminar\u0027s goal was to debate the \"risks and rewards of technological disruption\" with a view to implementing some of those ideas in the modernisation plan.The TOM is a five-year plan to \"support the ease of doing business\" in the London Market. It kicked off this year with a goal to develop a roadmap for the initiative. Next year, a governance structure will be set up to implement the recommendations over the next three years.The end-result of TOM would be a \"one touch, unified and intelligent\" approach for the London Markets with a strong emphasis on updating the technologies in use by market participants.The plan is driven by the London Market Group, an industry advocacy organisation that counts the market\u0027s major participants among its members.Although the LMG\u0027s modernisation plans are both ambitious and laudable, Mainelli cautions against putting too much stock in an outcome that will move the insurance markets away from its favoured technology: paper.\"They always have these reform programmes. None of these have ever bitten. The quickest way to see that is to walk through Leadenhall Market and see all these guys carrying stacks of paper around,\" he concluded.","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, Insurance, Banking, News, Lloyds, Zyen, Companies, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Nov 27, 2015 at 4:00 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/11/25/bank-of-england-launches-search-for-blockchain-savvy-interns/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/vaQPciOsamuRuSaJeBl_tFzFX2g\u003d/570x377/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/ATGR5PZMPFACDMPJ4UBGVQV7V4.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bank of England Launches Search for Blockchain-Savvy Interns","INTRO":"The Bank of England has launched a blockchain challenge, offering the winning students the possibility of a six-week paid internship.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The Bank of England (BOE) has launched a search for blockchain-savvy interns, offering the winning students the possibility of a six-week paid internship and the chance of landing a role within the organisation.According to its website, applicants are encouraged to pitch an idea for a blockchain-based product that would contribute a positive change to UK society by 7th December.The website reads:Students are encouraged to either enter individually or create a team of up to six people.

Politically speaking, that\u0027s incredibly powerful if you think about it. While states rely on closed bureaucracies to support their institutional belief system, the world has the Internet and the blockchain,\" he added.Siri\u0027s family, perhaps unsurprised by the entrepreneur\u0027s ongoing fascination with technology, welcomed the idea to register Roma\u0027s arrival on the blockchain.\"Those close to me already know how passionate I am about blockchain and civic technologies in general. My family probably thinks that I am a bit crazy, but when I consulted Pia to do this she gave me her full support,\" said Siri, adding:To register the birth, Siri first filmed a video, stating the baby\u0027s full name, date and location of birth and hashed it on the blockchain using blockchain verification service Proof of Existence. In so doing, the entrepreneur ensured that the file was notarised and validated by bitcoin\u0027s mining network, a global network of computers contributing to the ledger.To validate the process further, Siri also added his testimony and included that of Roma\u0027s mother and her two grandmothers.Additional proof was provided in the form of the hospital birth certificate, although in the video Siri purposely noted that the birth had taken place in San Francisco and refrained from mentioning a nation state or a specific geographical location or jurisdiction.He also showed a screenshot which displayed the last mined block on the blockchain.\"No one can challenge that [the] file was shot before Sunday, 8th November or modify its content without altering the proof, making this file a valid certificate of the events it describes,\" he added.Siri also used his interview to speak about his interest in the technology, which began in 2011, and how it could grow to impact the world his daughter grows up in.\"It was love at first sight, specially for someone living in a country like Argentina with high inflation and inability to acquire foreign currency,\" he told CoinDesk.These technologies, he said, have an intrinsic emancipating force which help users become independent agents:Siri speaks from experience, noting how he\u0027s seen the extent to which this nascent technology has proved for activists in his native South America.Similarly to his contemporaries, the entrepreneur explained that he believes blockchain\u0027s and bitcoin\u0027s biggest potential lies in developing countries where there is an urgent need for alternative systems to transform the status quo.Siri said he is close to the blockchain and decentralised community in the San Francisco area, but cautioned that there is still a long way to go before this technology fulfills its potential.\"Developing these kind of applications is not trivial, it still feels like [only] a few [are] working on this extremely innovative piece of technology and certainly we are at the early days of the revolution,\" he concluded.The blockchain\u0027s potential for identity registration has been highlighted in the past, with various companies in the space working specifically on this use case.ShoCard – which recently raised $1.5m in funding– is seeking to leverage blockchain technology for identity management.Open-source identity protocol provider OneName, which received seed funding from investors including Barry Silbert and San Francisco-based investment firm SV Angel, is also working to disrupt the way in which identity is managed online.Further afield, the possibility of using a decentralised ledger to register identity has also caught the attention of celebrities such as Lucy Liu, who was revealed as a surprising advocate during the private Block Chain Summit held at Richard Branson\u0027s private island earlier this year.Image via Santiago Siri","TAGS":"Identity, Blockchain

Though only a proof of concept, Rhodes indicated that the concept advanced toward discussions on user experience.Patients using a fully developed product, Rhodes said, would be provided with a QR code of their public key or patient identifier, which a doctor could then use to access their medical records.\"The vision here was that if a patient is on holiday skiing, crashes into a tree and gets knocked out, [the patient has] a key fob or another way to access their patient identifier, and doctors can immediately view their medical records,\" he continued.On the tech side, MedVault uses digital asset startup Colu\u0027s platform, leveraging its software development kit to avoid \"bloating\" the bitcoin blockchain. \"As the blockchain can only store so much information, Colu leverages the colored coin protocol and the BitTorrent network to store the digital asset and medical record in a verifiable way,\" added Rhodes.

Both Nasdaq and Visa are also investors in the startup.Covered by American Banker, Forbes and the New York Business Journal, among others, the Nasdaq announcement was the latest sign that the stock market giant is serious about capturing a first move advantage when it comes to understanding the technology and shaping it for its use.Still, the announcement was not without its critics.FT Alphaville\u0027s Izabella Kaminska also covered the news, adding her take on the announcement, which was largely critical of how Nasdaq is framing its use of \"the blockchain\" in relation to the projects.Kaminska noted that Linq is a \"permissioned blockchain\", a ledger controlled and operated by Nasdaq and its approved users – a key difference between its design and that of the open, public bitcoin network.\"Remember, a permissioned blockchain is supposed to be a distributed ledger which harmonises clearing and settlement between independent parties whilst improving security. It does this mostly by forcing the network to share responsibility over each other’s databases,\" she explained.Kaminska also sought greater insight into the specific technical underpinnings of Linq, stating that it is not connected to bitcoin\u0027s blockchain, and is therefore nothing more than a high-powered, shared database.\"In reality, however, we suspect the use of the term \u0027blockchain\u0027 is mostly a distraction,\" she said.According to representatives from Chain, Linq runs on a federated blockchain, meaning that while private to Nasdaq, the blockchain is theoretically interoperable with the main bitcoin blockchain.CEO Adam Ludwin was also at the event to clarify his take on Chain\u0027s work, which he characterized as intended to compete with traditional databases.Elsewhere, mainstream news outlets covered Visa\u0027s partnership with DocuSign on a proof-of-concept that uses blockchain for car leasing and the announcement that Barry Silbert\u0027s Digital Currency group had closed a new fund of an undisclosed sum that would be put toward industry investments.Last but not least was bitcoin\u0027s bull run this week, which while mentioned at Money20/20 was still overshadowed by announcements related to blockchain technology applications.Unsurprisingly, news coverage has so far mirrored the real-world interplay at the event, with Reuters and City AM being among the few news outlets to pay attention to the digital currency reaching its highest value to date this year.City AM\u0027s piece began:CoinDesk\u0027s BPI recored $330.75 as its highest value, reached at 08:16 UTC on 30th October.The article continued by positioning this against the asset\u0027s performance over the past few years: \"Bitcoin prices plummeted over 2014, from a high of $1,150, and 2015 didn\u0027t start much better. The currency began the year by falling 43% to crash through its $180 floor.\"Still, the publication heralded that bitcoin is now on a \"winning streak\", suggesting that its gains, positioned against the wider attention for blockchain technology, could be long lasting.This article was co-authored by Yessi Bello-Perez.Image via The Economist","TAGS":"price-news, Blockchain Technology, Visa, startups, Nasdaq, Bitcoin in the Headlines, Companies, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Oct 30, 2015 at 5:40 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/29/capital-one-survey-finds-blockchain-interest-growing-at-money2020/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/ZhPy7cf7kybABSrBf-fTGlF2mnU\u003d/570x369/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/HXVPIOU5KBETXOQ56UUGCJEIKI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Capital One Survey Finds Blockchain Interest Growing at Money20/20","INTRO":"Capital One has released a new survey that affirms the financial industry is increasingly optimistic about blockchain technology.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Nearly 20% of attendees at this year’s Money20/20 conference in Las Vegas believe that blockchain technology will have the greatest impact on the financial services space over the next three to five years.Capturing 19% of the responses, blockchain technology surpassed the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, which garnered 17% and 9% of the vote, respectively.

But how exactly are payment giants such as MasterCard interacting with the world of crypto?Be it through direct investment, partnerships with companies in the space or public comments on bitcoin and its underlying technology, here\u0027s a round-up of some of the most notable interactions between payment giants and the world of crypto.Founded: 1966Company type: PublicCompany size: Over 10,000 employees.Reported revenue: $2.4 net revenue for the fourth quarter of 2014 – a 14% increase versus the same period in 2013.American payments giant MasterCard was one of 11 investors in Barry Silbert\u0027s Digital Currency Group\u0027s (DCG) new undisclosed funding round.The news came months after the multinational corporation claimed the risks presented by digital currencies far outweighed the benefits in its submission to the UK Treasury\u0027s call for information on digital currencies, last November.Matthew Driver, MasterCard\u0027s president for South East Asia was also critical of digital currencies in December 2014, following the company line that cryptocurrencies presented too many risks.Driver saidMasterCard was \"not completely comfortable with the idea of cryptocurrencies\", adding that the technology was \"against the whole principle\" on which the credit card giant had established its business.Reports surfaced that MasterCard had spoken out against bitcoin\u0027s perceived risks, calling for regulators to create a \"level playing field\" for payments systems:MasterCard filed a patent application to be able to incorporate bitcoin into the design of a proposed online shopping cart which would be rolled out to its global customers. Despite this, MasterCard insisted the filing should not be perceived as the company\u0027s support of bitcoin.Founded: 1958Company type: PublicCompany size: between 5,001 and 10,000 employeesReported revenue: GAAP net income in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2014 was $1.1bn, a decrease of 10% over the prior year.Like MasterCard, Visa has also invested in the crypto space, contributing to blockchain startup Chain\u0027s $30m funding round.Earlier this week, Visa revealed a new proof-of-concept that leverages bitcoin\u0027s blockchain for record keeping.Debuted at Money 20/20 in Las Vegas, the project sets out to digitise the car rental process, using bitcoin transactions to create a digital fingerprint for each vehicle on the blockchain. Visa is involved in the project through its technology innovation arm.Unlike MasterCard, which has been generally dismissive about digital currencies, some Visa executives have spoken positively about bitcoin and its blockchain in the past.Speaking at Wired Money this summer, Jonathan Vaux, executive director of new digital payments and strategy at Visa Europe, said:Visa CEO Charlie Scharf spoke about bitcoin in January last year. \"There are certainly some interesting things about bitcoin and other things like it, but there are also a great deal of complexities,\" he said. Schartf went on to suggest that Visa was not actively monitoring the bitcoin space: \"We feel quite comfortable with the business we have here.\" Founded: 1850Company type: PublicCompany size: over 10,000 employeesReported revenue: American Express earned a record $5.9bn in net income in 2014, up 10% from the prior year.American Express\u0027 VC arm invested in bitcoin-to-cash app Abra as part of its recent $12m Series A round.Speaking to CoinDesk, AmEx Ventures managing partner Harshul Sanghi said it was too soon to know how the company may leverage blockchain technology.\"Let\u0027s see what currencies are important and we\u0027ll transact in the currencies that our customers want to transact in,\" he said, adding that the company was paying closer attention to possible blockchain technology applications:Sanghi\u0027s remarks come after the company\u0027s CEO Kenneth Chenault spoke about digital currencies in December last year.Similar to his contemporaries, Chenault said he saw more potential for bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology than the digital currency itself.“The protocol of bitcoin is going to be important,\" he said.Founded: 1998Company type: PublicCompany size: Over 10,000 employeesReported revenue: $8bn in 2o14.Online payments leader PayPal announced its first partnerships in the bitcoin space in September 2014.At the time, the company\u0027s senior director of corporate strategy Scott Ellison, said the company was \"proceeding gradually, supporting bitcoin in some ways today and holding off on other ways until we see how things develop\".Bitcoin payment processors BitPay, GoCoin and Coinbase told CoinDesk the partnership had been months in the making.Rumours of a possible bitcoin-related partnership first surfaced at the beginning of September 2014, after the company released a new promotional video which mentioned bitcoin.Earlier that year, John Donahoe – CEO of PayPal at the time – hinted at possible bitcoin integration. In an interview with CNBC, the former CEO said:PayPalalso held an introductory bitcoin event as part of a monthly speaker series in January 2015.","TAGS":"PayPal, Blockchain Technology, Visa, Mastercard, startups, Funding, American Express, Companies, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Oct 29, 2015 at 2:25 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2015/10/28/distributed-ledger-firm-r3cev-gains-three-more-banking-partners/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/xlmQh1scdq2vL1d2V4sw_jEqOio\u003d/570x412/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/BLZPTUR7OFHFNFINZCHQGR4JHE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Distributed Ledger Firm R3CEV Gains Three More Banking Partners","INTRO":"Distributed ledger startup R3CEV has added an additional three banking partners, raising the number of total banks involved to 25.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Distributed ledger startup R3CEV has gained an additional three banking partners, raising the number of total banks involved to 25.Japan\u0027s Mizuho Bank, Nordea Bank – which operates in Northern Europe – and Italian bank UniCredit join the likes of Citi, HSBC, Barclays and Goldman Sachs in R3CEV\u0027s blockchain project which sets out to spread the use of the technology across the world\u0027s financial markets.David Rutter, R3CEV CEO, said in a statement:He continued: \"An emphasis on working with the market has always been a key differentiator of our project from day one, and so we are delighted to broaden the network once again and grow the resources we have to research and develop this exciting technology.\"","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, Banking, R3CEV, Companies, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Finance","CREATION_DATE":"Oct 28, 2015 at 2:41 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/27/nasdaq-to-unveil-blockchain-based-platform/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/39MVBD-5Ge25TQ99cibYP_HAkxg\u003d/570x253/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/J4B5RHYQTZEZ7KEBVKDJRLXB24.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Nasdaq to Unveil Blockchain-Based Platform","INTRO":"Nasdaq is set to unveil its new blockchain-based platform, which will facilitate share transfers and sales on its private market.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Nasdaq is set to unveil its new blockchain-based platform, which will facilitate share transfers and sales on its private market.

At the same time, they are more efficient,” he added.Current public land registry ledgers are, like many other public ledgers and databases, relatively easy to manipulate. It can be extremely hard to identify who makes specific changes to them and they are expensive and inefficient.This applies not only to Honduras, which has a budget transparency described by Transparency International as ‘scant to none’, but to governmental systems all around the world.Blockchain technology seems almost tailor-made to tackle such issues. The biggest advantage of blockchain in government settings is the simple fact it can lead to massive efficiencies.Several companies and startups are working on solutions that can meet this potential demand.Factom\u0027s system includes native time stamping and provides a distributed mechanism to lock in data, making data verifiable and independently auditable.Through employing the technology, Factom enables people and businesses to use a mathematically provable, third-party “notarization” service, which is immune to manipulation.Factom uses the bitcoin blockchain to anchor entries so they are timestamped and proven. However, Factom has its own blockchain and network of federated servers where companies can create Factom chains to insert as many records as they want.The advantage of this is that a land title registry, for example, can insert millions of records in one or more Factom chains at very low cost. When they are ready, they can then anchor all these records with one hash on the bitcoin blockchain.The system utilises the strength and immutability of the blockchain to create a system that secures ledger data and renders it almost unhackable.Dobhal said the bitcoin blockchain is secured by more computational power than all of Google\u0027s servers combined, stating that the decentralized hashing power of the network makes it \"impossible to hack and change data\". He added:Factom’s solution can be used to monitor document versions and prove data lineage.Government transparency can be increased through the use of publishing cryptographic hashes during each step of a mission-critical business process. This provides an irrefutable “proof of existence” and establishes a standard of care.“In large organizations and within governments, data transactions between disparate systems can contain incorrect or inappropriate data. Thus, initiating a reconciliation process and, subsequently, an audit review. As the number of systems multiplies that each have sway over some set of data, settlement becomes increasingly difficult. A shared ledger – or source of truth, if you will – could ensure that transactions and data shared with the core systems are consistent and error free,” Dobhal said.Other uses of the system could include message authentication mechanisms to fight against message spoofing, anti-phishing for internal and external audiences, and controlling or monitoring document version of various documents or templates used internally and externally by large organizations.Dobhal believes blockchain technology will evolve into a commonly used protocol to secure both data and transactions throughout society.The strengths of the technology mean it will become the de facto standard for audit and compliance.“I imagine a \u0027blockchain backbone\u0027 will be deployed across a lot of public and private systems to record and prove data as well as financial transactions,\" Dobhal said.He added that the financial, supply chain, manufacturing and retail sectors could all benefit from the use of blockchain technology.\"Pretty much everywhere data sharing takes place, blockchain has the potential to make it more efficient, create faster settlements and thereby higher economic activity with less corruption and fraud. Apart from that, it will lead to us living in more honest and transparent societies,” he concluded.Bribe image via Shutterstock.","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Government, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/22/research-examines-compatibility-of-public-and-private-blockchains/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/N4keS84-hSnG5gZEtfuQch9Rxrg\u003d/570x379/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/OIJ5YGLQGZHDDLWRBKZQZSERB4.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Research Examines Compatibility of Public and Private Blockchains","INTRO":"Permissioned and permissionless blockchains are compatible according to Bitfury\u0027s latest research.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"While distributed ledger technology continues to gain momentum among the world\u0027s financial institutions, the potential and viability of bitcoin is still being largely dismissed by the same parties.Avid bitcoin supporters believe that using a private blockchain would inevitably result in a centralised system – a world away from bitcoin\u0027s decentralised, trustless protocol.However, according to bitcoin mining firm BitFury\u0027s latest white paper – written in collaboration with developer Jeff Garzik – permissioned and permissionless blockchains are compatible and can be interconnected.Many permissioned blockchain applications, the paper says, can be layered on top of permissionless blockchains using existing technology.For example, coloured coins – a concept designed to be layered on top of bitcoin\u0027s blockchain which aims to ease the transfer of assets – could make public ledgers useful for financial institutions.The paper adds:\"Payment channel networks could streamline payments by creating a scalable peer-to-peer layer on top of permissionless blockchains,\" it continues. \"Sidechain technology could be used to integrate permissionless and permissioned blockchains into a single interconnected environment.\"Although the paper says that private, permissioned blockchains could hold the key for blockchain innovation in the short run, it notes that public permissionless ledgers are less vulnerable to attacks.This, the paper notes, is due to the design of permissionless ledgers, which are based on the assumption that transaction participants do not have to trust each other.It concludes:Jigsaw image via Shutterstock.","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, BitFury, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Oct 22, 2015 at 7:02 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/19/coinprism-launches-open-source-distributed-ledger/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/dDm1ciK5qnhDS5UqQBh36fz0NIA\u003d/570x320/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/QF3YXNKYTBC2LB3EX2FXGVVHE4.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Coinprism Launches Open Source Distributed Ledger","INTRO":"Coinprism has released Openchain, an open source, distributed permissioned ledger that targets enterprise and financial institutions.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain technology company Coinprism has released Openchain, an open source, distributed permissioned ledger that targets enterprise and financial institutions.Speaking about Openchain\u0027s launch, Flavien Charlon, founder and CEO of Coinprism, explained:The main difference between Openchain and bitcoin\u0027s blockchain, Charlon said, resides in the type of assets that his product is designed to handle.According to Charlon – previously a software development engineer at Microsoft – bitcoin \"is a very special asset ... built for censorship resistance\".He added:Similarly to bitcoin\u0027s blockchain, Charlon claimed Openchain is both fully transparent and auditable.\"Anyone can connect to a validating node, and receive a real-time copy of the transactions being validated,\" said the founder, adding: \"Openchain is also secured by digital signatures, which make it impossible to counterfeit a transaction.\"One notable difference with bitcoin, Charlon said, is the way in which Openchain deals with transactions to avoid confirmation delays:\"Openchain gets rid of blocks, and chains transactions directly to each other, which means you can get instant transaction confirmation.\"Distributed ledger technology has become increasingly popular in recent months, with various companies such as Digital Asset Holdings – which acquired Hyperledger – emerging in the space.ItBit also revealed details about its top-secret Bankchain project, a private consensus-based ledger system which also targets financial organisations.Speaking about its competitors, Charlon said:Although he declined to divulge specifics, Charlon said a few companies had already experimented with a private beta of Openchain.\"The feedback we have received so far is very positive.

Here\u0027s CoinDesk\u0027s latest look at the top bitcoin and blockchain-related headlines from across the world.Writing for New York Business Journal, Michael del Castillo reported that UK bank Barclays had signed contracts with a group of companies that participated in its first-ever New York City FinTech accelerator, two of which were blockchain startups.Del Castillo added:\"The mood in the air isn’t surprising, considering that following the July accelerator in London, Barclays announced it was \u0027exploring opportunities\u0027 with seven companies, including one contract with Safello, a blockchain company.\" \"By comparison, today\u0027s large class of actual contract winners is especially notable due to what White [Derek White, Barclays\u0027 chief design and innovation officer] described as a steeper education curve around blockchain technology,\" he wrote. \"But he also said that while negotiating the blockchain contracts took time to execute, he believes the extra effort will pay off in the end.\" City A.M\u0027s Clara Guibourg wrote a piece titled \"Barclays is teaming up with blockchain startups Chainalysis and Wave as the bank\u0027s bitcoin experiment expands\". In her article, Guibourg said that Barclays had signed contracts with two blockchain startups in what the bank is calling a \"game changer\". Speaking about the difficulties facing companies in the space wanting to secure a banking partner, she added: \"This is one of the first times a major bank has opened up for such cooperation with blockchain clients, as many bitcoin companies have had difficult access to banking services.\" Barclay\u0027s partnership with Wave and Chainalytics should come as no surprise given the recent fascination with distributed ledgers among the world\u0027s banks.

During her speech in London yesterday about the government\u0027s technology drive, Harriet Baldwin MP said the government is working to create the right regime for digital currency businesses and to attract both overseas investors and companies to the UK. The secretary also touched upon the government\u0027s pledge to inject £10m – announced in March – into research addressing the opportunities and challenges of digital currencies and their underlying technology as part of its larger pledge to innovation in FinTech. According to Baldwin, the potential benefits of distributed ledgers include: \"The potential to facilitate the fast, efficient, and secure transfer of ownership of digital assets – including bonds, shares, and other financial instruments, over the internet; and the function of digitally \u0027signing\u0027 and time-stamping digital assets – helping maintain records of digital documents securely and efficiency.

The report, although largely positive about digital currencies, also noted the technology\u0027s nascent state and outlined the risks associated to cryptocurrencies. The publication of the report followed the UK Treasury\u0027s \u0027Call for Information\u0027 on digital currencies in June last year, which was an attempt to decipher the risks and benefits associated with this new payment technology. In response to this call for information, the UK\u0027s Home Office urged the government to consider creating its own digital currency, which would eradicate anonymity and pave the way for traceable transactions in a bid to reduce crime.

The transition finds these entities seeking to define the attributes of the bitcoin blockchain they prefer – its secure ledger and payments rail – and the ones they don\u0027t – its controversy-grabbing native asset and largely anonymous miners, while determining solutions that allow them to further define these needs.Entrepreneurs are now stepping in to facilitate this education process, attempting to serve a clientele that is unique from that of the industry surrounding the bitcoin blockchain. Among them are private blockchain firms such as Blockstack, Eris Ltd and Coin Sciences.Led by CEO and founder Gideon Greenspan, Coin Sciences recently launched a new solution this summer called the Multichain Private Blockchain. The product takes what could be described as a build-your-own blockchain approach that aims to free banks from the more rigid options of competing offerings.Greenspan believes there\u0027s potential profit in allowing banks to experiment with the technology while gleaning insights into their observations, telling CoinDesk:Multichain is the latest offering from Coin Sciences, following CoinSpark, a software tool for web assets and legal contracts on the bitcoin blockchain. The problem, Greenspan alleges, wasn\u0027t that financial institutions weren\u0027t interested in this solution, or removing intermediaries from financial processes, but rather they didn\u0027t believe the bitcoin blockchain was tested or stable enough for their needs.\"It became clear people are looking for things that are similar to bitcoin but different, rather than cryptocurrencies, traditional entities are more interested in the ledger,\" Greenspan said.In this light, Multichain emphasizes end-user choice, allowing customers to control whether the chain is private or public; the target time for blocks; who can connect to the network; how these entities interact; and the maximum block size and metadata that can be included in transactions, among other features.Moreover, Greenspan argues the offering is proving popular, having been downloaded nearly 850 times from mid-June to mid-Septemberr. He declined to mention any large financial clients that may be using the software.The alpha version of the platform is currently available, with a beta to be released in late 2015.As in the Multichain white paper, Greenspan is keen in conversation to elaborate on why his firm believes bitcoin is ill-suited for the needs of financial conglomerates, while steering clear of suggesting the bitcoin blockchain is not a needed innovation.The paper, for example, seeks to note that bitcoin currently supports only 300,000 transactions per day due to the current limit on how many megabytes worth of data can be processed on the network every 10 minutes. Further, it argues that bitcoin\u0027s fees – roughly 2.5 cents for a transaction at the time of publication – are set to rise as the number of new bitcoins produced to incentivize miners for transaction processing decreases, both factors that simply don\u0027t appeal to institutional users.Complicating matters, Greenspan argues, is that the blockchain is designed to move bitcoins, meaning that it can only effectively exchange a record of the asset, not the asset itself.\"That conceptual idea ... doesn\u0027t carry over to other assets. Unless another asset has been issued, like dollars onto a blockchain, you\u0027re never going to be directly an asset. You\u0027re always going to be owning a promise that that assets exists,\" Greenspan said.Notably, startups such as Symbiont are developing technology to represent asset ownership on the blockchain, though financial giants such as Nasdaq have offered a differing view. In a recent interview, Fredrik Voss, Nasdaq\u0027s head of blockchain strategy, for instance, argued that bitcoin representations of assets are still beneficial due to the tracking benefits shared ledgers provide.Multichain, however, believes its workaround will find a market. As described in the white paper, the technology aims to make tracking blockchain assets easier using bitcoin\u0027s scripting language to encode metadata in transaction outputs, which it argues allows miners to verify the quantity of an asset that differs from the network\u0027s native token in any transactions.Like other private blockchain solutions, Multichain aims to remove perceived problems associated with bitcoin by limiting the visibility of the ledger to certain participants, allowing institutions to set controls on transactions permitted and by forgoing distributed mining.On the subject of privacy, Multichain allows users to set a list of permitted users that can act as nodes that refer information on the network and \u0027miners\u0027 that verify transactions, including a method by which nodes can verify whether other nodes have been approved.Privileges are granted using transactions with special metadata, and the miner of the Genesis block, the first block on the blockchain, is given all established rights on the network and acts an \u0027administrator\u0027. This administrator can then appoint other administrators on the network, with any changes to consensus needed to be validated by a set number of participants.Permissions can also be grated on a limited basis, according to the white paper, or to a fixed range of block numbers.This differs from the current consensus strategy in bitcoin, in which a distributed community of developers must introduce changes that then require a majority or all of those processing transactions on the network to upgrade to new versions of the software.Though often not difficult technically, the challenge inherent in this approach was perhaps best exemplified by the ongoing debate on the size of blocks on the bitcoin network. Differing proposals have been introduced as far back as this summer, though no consensus on solutions has so far been reached.As miners on the multichain network do not need to conduct proof of work, Multichain has also introduced a novel way by which these entities can trust decisionmaking.Called mining diversity, the process enables miners processing transactions to approve transactions in a random rotation. Greenspan explained a situation in which a Multichain user set a blockchain network with 10 mining entities, and set a \"relatively high\" mining difficulty by which the approval eight of these entities would be needed for a block to be recorded.\"That means they have to wait eight more blocks before they sign another one. Having that, what it means is there\u0027s no possibility for a small group of miners to mine a chain in private, unless eight of them do it,\" he said.Greenspan argues that this structure allows more miners to participate in the approval of transactions, while ensuring there is no fixed order of verification that could be corrupted.Transaction fees and block rewards are set to zero by default in Multichain, though this is also customizable, as the white paper suggests participants could be charged a yearly service fee.Still, Greenspan believes that version of a private blockchain offers benefits over a centralized database, a claim often espoused by critics, contending that the benefits are that each participant retains full control over assets; control of the database is distributed across entities; and that, due to the mining diversity concept, the loss of any one server would not compromise the network.Multichain users also aren\u0027t limited to the number of blockchains they create, and further, they have the ability to connect their blockchains to the bitcoin network or to a bitcoin testnet, a version of the blockchain on which no real bitcoins move.Interoperability, however, is so far limited to bitcoin, as Greenspan said Multichain cannot connect to Ripple or Ethereum, which he said were \"in a separate world from Multichain\".\"Bitcoin\u0027s model is hugely more scalable,\" Greenspan continued. \"You can run many transactions in parallel as long as you can see they\u0027re not modifying the same data.\"In contrast to these alternatives, Greenspan still sees bitcoin as a preferred technology, basing Multichain off of a fork of Bitcoin Core, using the protocol and architecture as well as its command-line and API interface.In this way, the Multichain white paper positions private blockchains as an early version of a more robust, global bitcoin blockchain, one that can allow private institutions to begin working with the technology in the way that Intranets exposed entities to the Internet.\"Private blockchains will likely be a more attractive solution for financial institutions wishing to deploy this technology during the next decade,\" the paper reads, adding:Assembly image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Protocol, Technology, CoinSpark, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Oct 12, 2015 at 9:55 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/12/fix-trading-community-creates-digital-currency-working-group/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/CyqflcMp5gftpIUwZljX93NgTMQ\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/LM2JKBDTDRFWPIZCRNSWRBXQRQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Fix Trading Community Creates Digital Currency Working Group","INTRO":"Fix Trading Community, a global industry trading body, has announced the creation of a digital currency and blockchain technology working group.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Fix Trading Community, a global industry trading body, has announced the creation of a digital currency and blockchain technology working group.The non-profit organisation, which boasts some of the world\u0027s biggest banks as its members, is responsible for addressing business and regulatory issues impacting global multi-asset trading.Fix\u0027s new group will be chaired by Sean Ristau, head of wealth management and derivatives at Raptor Trading Sytems;

Here he argues that, due to the introduction of blockchain technology, corporations will see computers not only take over as employees, but as customers too.Corporations are devoting a larger share of capital to automation technologies within businesses across almost every type of industry and sector. Technological innovation, both by way of employee input and customers\u0027 expected output, is undergoing a transformation.It\u0027s an organizational change that reassigns the role of the employee and customer to the domain of computer technology outside the grasp of human intervention with the introduction of blockchain technology and smart contracting systems. Blockchain technology stands to radically transform our concept of the corporation where machines, not humans, are both the customers and employees.The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2027, 10% of global GDP will be stored on a blockchain network. In such a world, it will be clear that corporations are less reliant than ever upon humans to survive and prosper. If anything, this solidifies blockchain technology as the blueprint for a type of corporation that is light-years ahead of its 20th century predecessor in terms of resource allocation and communication methods.20th century business models were characterized by owning rather than sharing, specialization rather than automation, and centralized over decentralized decision making. The bitcoin blockchain economic model does away with all these conventional notions and provides us the blueprint for a 21st century digital paradigm – non-exclusive, decentralized, autonomous corporations.This type of corporate model is fundamentally different in its makeup and functionality because, among other things, it is independent of human intervention while simultaneously owned by no single party.In the bitcoin digital economy, machines are the employees rather than humans, which were in the industrial age. The role of the employee, and the producer of labour, falls solely on the cryptocurrency miner. In terms of the bitcoin mining function, the product of labour would be the hashing power necessary to verify transaction blocks. The compensation for each employee? The network pays each node compensation equal to the current block reward roughly every 10 minutes.When we come to understand this shift in the makeup of the corporation, we see that the core of its function has undergone a significant change. The blockchain network concept is such an altering framework for conducting business that it shakes the very foundations of what we believe to be a legitimate corporation. Truly, the blockchain network concept represents a milestone in technology innovation.While machines are now becoming employees, customers remain human, but these may soon become machines too, with the implementation of self-executing smart contracts.Networks of smart contracts have empirical objectives. That is, they\u0027re functionality will be understood through examination of the source code which it operates by. As it applies to smart contracting systems of the future, open-source systems make for an entirely transparent and uncheatable form of governance. The instances of misuse will come from failing to understand the objectives of the contract or network.It is crucial that we note the computing revolution is well past an inflection point. When such technologies first began use in universities and large organizations, they were under the control of many, many humans who all shared one machine. With bitcoin, we have one large, interconnected computer network which controls many, many human counterparts.More importantly, it controls one of the most precious aspects of our lives – financial livelihood. An exact reversal of how the computing revolution began is characterized by an inflection point of control which has just recently passed. First we shape our tools, thereafter our tools shape us. As Alan Turing said in his essay Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory, in 1951:You can be certain that, just as one computer would work for many humans in times past, many humans will come to work for one main network of machines. Computer technology is capable of achieving this dominance because it rewrites the laws of society with something based on mathematics and science rather than steel and paper.The blueprint of blockchain technology represents an important milestone in computing innovation – one which allows digital systems, whether they be for commerce or communication, to operate independently from conventional forms of law.As is with the current landscape of bitcoin today, the miners are the employees of the corporation. Mere years ahead however, lies a paradigm where smart contracting begins to populate the role of customer as well.Featured image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, News, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/08/ripple-releases-interledger-to-connect-banks-and-blockchains/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/JQdl4gDa9wRY3v-Tyy9p5fOiLYA\u003d/570x570/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/3E3YVFHV7FDZXA2JRPUJIT7XVQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ripple Releases Interledger to Connect Banks and Blockchains","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ripple Labs shortened its name to Ripple this week, a move which according to company officials, signals its products are now \"out of the lab\" and ready for use.Long one of the more well-funded startups in industry, Ripple was arguably the first to focus on use cases for distributed ledgers, introducing an alternative ledger that deviated from bitcoin\u0027s method for consensus and featured its own unique digital currency, XRP, as early as 2012.Since then, Ripple has increasingly put forth in its public messaging that it is seeking to realize an \"Internet of Value\", a term that denotes a time when money could move as quickly as information does today. As a building block for this future, Ripple has introduced the Interledger protocol (ILP), which intends to act as an arbiter for all types of ledgers, both those that are distributed and traditional centralized alternatives.Ripple CTO Stefan Thomas explained that ILP itself is not a ledger, as it does not seek consensus toward any state. Rather it provides a top-layer cryptographic escrow system that allows funds to move between ledgers with the help of intermediaries it calls \"connectors\".Further, ILP has no native token, so individual ledgers operating its protocol will still hold balances in their native units of account. Thomas contends such interoperability solves the issue of one specific payment network – be it Ripple or Visa – needing to reach global ubiquitousness.Thomas told CoinDesk:\"Interledger is a protocol in a true sense,\" VP of marketing Monica Long added. \"It creates ways for ledgers to interact. Bitcoin and Ripple are payment systems, [they] require everyone to adopt that system for users to interact.\"ILP is also a bid to offer Ripple\u0027s enterprise customers a solution that they argue maintains customer privacy, allowing users to keep aggregate transaction data off a public blockchain by using a connector to move funds between private versions of the Ripple network.With this in mind, ILP features two modes – Atomic and Universal – with the former using a selected group of \"notaries\" to approve transfers and the latter an incentive structure to allow untrusted institutions to fill the role.Ripple contends ILP is also easy for any of its partners to adopt. \"If you\u0027re PayPal, all you would need to do is add a new payment to your API,\" Thomas said.Today, Ripple said Interledger works with any ledger or payments system and that open-source reference implementations are to be released later this month.As described in the official white paper, connectors would facilitate transfers between ledgers, performing the same function that companies today might achieve with market makers when they exchange currencies for business purposes.Unlike traditional systems, however, Ripple says ILP removes the need for transaction participants to trust that the connector will not lose or steal the money, meaning such exchange doesn\u0027t need to be protected by legal contracts.\"Ledger-provided escrow guarantees the sender that their funds will only be transferred to the connector once the ledger receives proof that the recipient has been paid. Escrow also assures the connector that they will receive the sender’s funds once they complete their end of the agreement,\" the paper states.In interview, Thomas suggested entities acting as connectors would also benefit from lower barriers to access.\"In order to lower the barrier, the first thing you have to do is so the connector doesn\u0027t have to be trusted, they can provide liquidity without being that well-vetted,\" he continued.More uncertain, Thomas suggested, was who might serve as a connector on ILP, though he said digital currency exchanges could fill this role. \"Those kinds of systems could adopt the tech and adopt that standard to expose their liquidity in a standardized way,\" he said.In terms more familiar in the industry, Thomas compared ILP to Blockstream\u0027s sidechains project, which is seeking to extend the functionality of the bitcoin network by allowing bitcoin assets to be moved back and forth between altnerate cryptographic ledgers and the public blockchain.\"Interledger is a complement to sidechains,\" he said. \"Sidechains is about how do you create these ledgers, ILP is putting them together. At ILP we\u0027re mostly thinking about if you\u0027re trying to connect a bitcoin sidechain and a PayPal ledger, how do you get from one place to another.\"Ripple indicated that, while not affiliated with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), ILP grew out of its participation in its Web Payments Interest Group, which is seeking to develop standards for payments on the web.Founded by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, W3C is a member organization that connects Internet industry stakeholders in an effort to develop open standards for everything from online payments to connected cars.\"We\u0027ve been involved [with W3C] since 2013, and we\u0027ve been in touch with them based on the [ILP] idea, making a payments standard to create open, free payments,\" Thomas said.Currently, Ripple indicated it is workshopping the protocol in a W3C community group, with the goal for it to potentially be considered as a standard for web payments.Members include representatives from the National Association of Convenience Stores, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and Eris Ltd.Yet, the development also seeks to help enhance the competitiveness of Ripple\u0027s products, which Thomas said banks have criticized due to potential issues with scalability. Thomas indicated that banks believe that, as with the introduction of the Faster Payments network in the UK, lower costs systems inevitably produce a higher volume of transactions.\"When you bring costs down, volumes increase dramatically,\" Thomas said. \"The key to scalability is to have something that doesn\u0027t rely on one global system. That was also a great solution for some of the things W3C had.\"Thomas said that, as with sidechains in bitcoin, this would potentially enable \"horizontal scalability\" so that the global transaction system can increase its total processing power.Thomas and Long also expressed their belief that ILP – by placing ledger systems side by side in a market – would serve to highlight which of these are the most efficient, something they suspect will be advantageous to distributed ledger providers.Both solutions, Long said, are software products that interact with Ripple and are packaged together. Customers are able to purchase the products for a license fee. Ripple earns added revenue from integrations, and said pricing is currently customized depending on the partner.The products also position Ripple and its asset XRP \"as a bridge\" that can reduce the cost for cross-border settlement, according to the company. Long said that the Cross-Currency Settlement product, for example, would improve the information available for end-consumers in the foreign exchange process for when removing privacy restrictions is beneficial.\"Today, a bank can send payment instructions to a receiving bank, but there\u0027s no way for the recipient to send information back. The sending institution can\u0027t give its customer accurate pricing for the transaction and can\u0027t give the customer accurate confirmation that the payment got there,\" Long said.Given its status as an early partner for financial institutions, and the rising interest among these entities in blockchain and distributed ledger solutions, Long suggested Ripple sees developments in 2015 as a validation of its market strategy.Long claimed Ripple has 30 banks currently experimenting with its technology, and that the announcement on how this is being used would be forthcoming.Overall, Long spoke positively of developments such as R3\u0027s recent partnerships with major banks, indicating that both groups seem to be focused on separate use cases, Ripple on cross-border settlement and R3 more on interbank settlement.With the changes in the space, Long positioned ILP as part of the expanding use cases in the \"distributed financial technology\" industry, a definition she feels best captures projects that are not wholly blockchain-based but seek goals concurrent with the community.Long concluded:Connection visualization via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Ripple, Blockchain Technology,

impact.Major banks are now loudly proclaiming their love for the distributed ledger.However, the bank\u0027s love explosion for blockchain technology may not have been what Satoshi Nakamoto intended – or predicted – when bitcoin was first created.Despite this, this week\u0027s coverage was mostly about blockchain technology, as distributed ledger startup R3CEV caused a ripple of excitement again when it announced an additional 13 banks had joined its project.Elsewhere, a prominent science publication published a piece about the future of cryptocurrencies, focusing on bitcoin\u0027s origins, its association with illicit behaviour and the ongoing fascination with the blockchain.The Financial Times\u0027 Kadhim Shubber began his piece on R3\u0027s big deal, noting how Citi, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley had joined the growing and still secretive initiative.Shubber wrote:Blockchain technology has enjoyed increasing popularity among traditional finance institutions and executives. Earlier this year, Blythe Masters, a former JP Morgan executive shocked with her decision to join Digital Asset Holdings as the company\u0027s CEO.As Shubber points out, Digital Asset – R3\u0027s seeming competitor – is just one of many startups attempting to reduce costs in banking.\"Blockchain is the shared database technology beneath the currency bitcoin and is being touted as a way of overhauling outdated bank back-office systems. Its backers point to inefficiencies in the aging network of bank payments and settlements, where transactions in markets like syndicated loans can take 20 or more days to finalise,\" said the journalist.Writing for CNBC, Matt Clinch began his piece by commenting how the latest announcement suggested a wider acceptance of bitcoin.\"Rather than shunning potentially disruptive digital currencies,\" he said, before adding,\"the biggest names in the financial industry are looking at integrating the technology behind bitcoin into every day use\".The good news for bitcoin was short-lived as the journalist then duly noted, that the blockchain – not the digital currency – is what really seems to have captivated mass-attention.He said:The article then rounded off with a cautious conclusion.\"It might still be early days but the technology could effectively allow payments to be made instantly without a centralized authority and it would also be transparent with each bank being allowed access to the ledger,\" said the reporter.Oscar Williams-Grut alluded to the desirability of the banks\u0027 all star-team with the headline \"13 More Banks Just Joined The Finance \u0027Dream Team\u0027 Working on Bitcoin\u0027s Blockchain\".Taking the total number of bank partners to 22, Williams-Grut noted how the list read like a \"who\u0027s who of investment banking\".Similarly to his contemporaries, the journalist then went to outline the basic principles of blockchain technology:For these reasons, the journalist added, \"banks are keen to see whether it can be adapted for use with traditional currency, rather than just bitcoin\".On this note, Nasdaq\u0027s Martin Tillier wrote a piece titled \"The Irony Behind Banks\u0027 Interest in Blockchain\" where he noted the issues that may aries if blockchain development boosts the digital currency markets.He then noted: \"The possibilities if that is done are endless so that focus is understandable, but one of the side effects of all the publicity is to add strength to the currency, and that could end up having a detrimental effect on those very same banks.\"Nature, a prestigious science journal, published a piece detailing bitcoin\u0027s short, albeit eventful history.It began:The article continued: \"And its purpose seemed quixotic: bitcoin was to be a \u0027cryptocurrency\u0027, in which strong encryption algorithms were exploited in a new way to secure transactions. Users\u0027 identities would be shielded by pseudonyms. Records would be completely decentralised. And no one would be in charge – not governments, not banks, not even Nakamoto.\"Yet, the article adds, the idea caught on:Bitcoin aside, what really fascinates academics and entrepreneurs is \"the innovation at bitcoin\u0027s core\", the blockchain, reads the article, which cites Nicolas Courtois, a cryptographer at University College London, who says that bitcoin\u0027s blockchain could be \"the most important invention of the 21st century – if only bitcoin were not constantly shooting itself in the foot\".So there you have it, the blockchain is \"hot stuff\" and with little sign of banks\u0027 fascination with it abating, it is probably fair to say that October will see more blockchain loving.Heart image via Shutterstock.","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, Banking, Bitcoin in the Headlines, R3CEV, Companies, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Oct 2, 2015 at 6:03 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/01/head-of-london-fintech-hub-steps-down-to-lead-blockchain-lab/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/k2B7U-H-jDAKMD3Q-I1K5GgcC4M\u003d/570x355/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/SVXS5ZRNXRHKFKTX5XVQAQSGYI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Head of London FinTech Hub Steps Down to Lead Blockchain Lab","INTRO":"The head of Level39, one of Europe\u0027s biggest FinTech hubs, is stepping down to lead the development of a blockchain lab.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The head of one of Europe\u0027s biggest FinTech hubs is stepping down to lead the development of a blockchain lab.Eric van der Kleij, who led London-based Level39 for three years, is returning to Entiq, an innovation consultancy he co-founded in 2013, to explore the real-world applications of blockchain technology.The lab, van der Kleij said, will seek to help organisations gain a better understanding of distributed ledgers, smart contracts and related technologies.He told CoinDesk:Van der Kleij, a serial entrepreneur and former CEO of the UK Government\u0027s Tech City Investment Organisation, is credited with playing a pivotal role in helping Level39 become one of the most prominent accelerators in the European FinTech scene.The accelerator, located in London\u0027s business district, made headlines earlier this year when Swiss investment bank UBS announced the opening of a blockchain research lab to explore the application of distributed ledgers in the wider financial services industry.Canary Wharf image via IR Stone / Shutterstock.com","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, London, startups, News, Level39, Companies, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Oct 1, 2015 at 12:30 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/30/dutch-banks-innovation-chief-dismisses-bitcoin/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/tB-Xe-jYua9JAniYIKRZd-uwOO4\u003d/570x570/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/3UTBLGFDXJBK3AFH2BFSWPODZQ.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Dutch Bank’s Innovation Chief Dismisses Bitcoin","INTRO":"The head of innovation at ABN Amro has said the Dutch state-owned bank wants to stay away from bitcoin.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The head of innovation at ABN Amro has said the Dutch state-owned bank wants to stay away from bitcoin, but is interested in blockchain technology.According to a report, Arjan van Os, the head of the bank\u0027s innovation centre, cited the bitcoin\u0027s associations with drug trafficking and illicit activities as the reason behind the bank\u0027s decision to distance itself from the digital currency.He said:His comments follow an article, titled \u0027The Next Big Thing\u0027 and published on the bank\u0027s website in which he explained the basic principles of distributed ledgers and posed the question of how banks could remain at the forefront of innovation.\"[Blockchain technology] has been tested, it is proven that it works and is used.

The first, a non-profit called Blockchain Labs, was co-founded by Buterin, BitShares co-founder Bo Shen and Feng Xiao, vice chairman and executive director of Wanxiang Holdings, the company\u0027s investment arm.The Blockchain Labs launch is to be followed by the creation of a $50m venture capital fund that will invest broadly in applications for blockchain technology and for which Wanxiang will be the sole limited partner (LP).In interview, Chao noted that Wanxiang now has roughly 10 subsidiaries in financial sectors including insurance, banking, futures and asset management, and that the investments provide it with the ability to look for ways to apply blockchain technologies to its business lines.Chao told CoinDesk:Chao confirmed that, despite interpretations of announcements from the Ethereum project, the $50m fund will seek to support \"all crypto 2.0 projects\", a comment echoed by Shen.\"We maintain an open, transparent and equal spirit. Ethereum is definitely the leading project of crypto 2.0 on decentralized applications at the moment. We would not only say Wanxiang will be the only LP in the fund, neither is Ethereum the only project that will be funded,\" Shen said.The legal structure for both entities, according to Chao, is currently being established.According to Shen, Blockchain Labs will promote education about blockchain technologies and invest in research and experiments in the field. The venture is in the process of being registered as a Chinese entity.As part of the program, Wanxiang will donate $3m, or $1m over the next three years, to fund the project. Half of the funds for the first year, Shen said, were used to purchase Ether.\"[Blockchain Labs] will promote and give out ETH to community for non-profit purposes such as rewarding for projects that promote education,\" he said.The name of the $50m fund once legally established may be called Fenbushi, according to Shen, which stands for \"distributed \" in Chinese.While Chinese in name, Shen said Blockchain Labs is seeking to denominate one-third of its investments Chinese yuan, with the remaining funds being dispersed in US dollars.As part of its promotional efforts, Wanxiang is also backing a conference to be held in Shanghai on 15th and 16th October.Called the 2015 Global Blockchain Summit, the conference will feature guests from Deloitte, Huarui Bank and Shanghai Steel Union, among other institutions. Representatives from the wider bitcoin and blockchain community include Circle VP of trading Joshua Lim, Koinify CEO Tom Ding and Tether CTO Craig Sellars.Topics will include the use of blockchain technologies in payments, securities trading, digital asset management and global supply chains, which will be discussed in talks and in closed-door sessions.\"The problem here in China and in many other areas is that many professionals from conventional business don\u0027t understand much about blockchain,\" Chao said, adding:Hangzhou image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"China, Blockchain Technology, Ethereum, Crypto 2.0, Banking, News, investors, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 29, 2015 at 9:11 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/29/citi-hsbc-partner-with-r3cev-as-blockchain-project-adds-13-banks/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/DhhjT9_LeRBOcX1TYlE7AgrCL8U\u003d/570x269/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/75MCE26J4RBRJGU3U2T327AQNU.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Citi, HSBC Partner With R3CEV As Blockchain Project Adds 13 Banks","INTRO":"Thirteen additional major investment banks including Citi, HSBC and Bank of America Chase have partnered with distributed ledger startup R3CEV.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Distributed ledger startup R3CEV has added 13 new banking partners, bringing the total number of banks involved in its activities to 22.In a release, R3 revealed Bank of America, BNY Mellon, Citi, Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Morgan Stanley, National Australia Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, SEB, Societe Generale and Toronto-Dominion Bank had signed on to the project.R3 CEO David Rutter suggested in statements that the startups approach to collaborating with the market to lower the cost of delivering new blockchain initiatives was a factor in the deal.Rutter said:As previously noted, R3 will lead collaborations between its members on design, engineering, experimentation and research projects related to blockchain and distributed ledger technology.With the news, the 13 banks join nine previously announced partners including Barclays, BBVA, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Royal Bank of Scotland, State Street and UBS, which announced support in September.In a separate blog post, R3 director for market research Tim Swanson expanded on the vision for the startup and what it seeks to achieve with its new partners.Cautioning that he did not speak for the firm, Swanson distanced R3 from bitcoin and cryptocurrency, suggesting that the startup is not working with banks to develop a digital currency and that it is not working with the bitcoin network.\"Bitcoin solves a set of problems for a niche group of individuals operating under certain security assumptions (eg, cypherpunks not wanting to interface with banks or governments). Regulated financial institutions do not operate under those assumptions, thus axiomatically bitcoin in its current form is highly unlikely to be a solution to their problems at this time,\" he wrote.Rather, Swanson suggested that R3 was attempting to work with its bank partners to design a new blockchain ledger system tailored for the needs of the banking community and crafted with its input.He went on to suggest such a network may not need a mining or distributed transaction processing community, but that any efforts would likely seek to be open sourced to the community.\"After all, a foundation layer this critical would benefit from the collective eyeballs of the entire programming community,\" he wrote.The post concluded by noting that R3 is currently seeking to hire developers for its initiatives.Image via R3","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, National Australia Bank, Citi, Bank of America, Banking, HSBC, News, R3CEV, Deutsche Bank, Companies, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 29, 2015 at 2:54 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/28/ethereum-bitcoin-price-decline-created-9-million-funding-shortfall/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Su0aiLN73Ba3i8uj0Zh6xc9Ascg\u003d/570x277/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/RGSSPSP2T5FABHZOQXI2N2PYRQ.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ethereum: Bitcoin Price Decline Created $9 Million Funding Shortfall","INTRO":"Alternative blockchain project Ethereum has released new details about the state of funding collected during its initial crowdsale.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ethereum has released new details about the state of its finances, ending speculation about the project\u0027s financial health that has persisted among the technology\u0027s enthusiasts.One of the most successful token crowdsales in history by some metrics, the ambitious blockchain-based decentralized application platform raised 31,529 BTC, or roughly $18.4m at then market prices, through the sale of Ether, its native blockchain tokens last July.Of issue since has been the lack of clarity regarding how much real-world funding Ethereum and its related entities have had in reserve due to the subsequent decline in the price of bitcoin relative to the US dollar.However, Ethereum inventor Vitalik Buterin today revealed new details about the subject today in a blog post dedicated to providing an update on the state of the open-source project, launched to the public on 30th July with its Frontier release.Buterin wrote that the Ethereum Foundation, the Switzerland-based nonprofit that handles Ether\u0027s financials and manages development funding, is facing budget constraints due to the declining value of bitcoin against the US dollar.Buterin said:The former editor and founder of Bitcoin Magazine painted the project as in a time of \"complicated transition\" given that its needs have expanded along with its vision to launch a blockchain with built-in Turing-complete programming language.When asked about the foundation\u0027s hiring plans, Buterin told CoinDesk the group had \"already cut some, and [was] cutting some [more personnel] soon.\" However, he expressed optimism that as the Ethereum Foundation reduced its paid staff, developers and other employees would be hired by projects building on top of the platform.Overall, Buterin sought to suggest this was a natural transition for the project, one that would find it emerging from the incubation period supported by the initial funding, to a more open-source and varied funding model more comparable to the bitcoin network.Buterin stressed that the major news from the day\u0027s announcement was the financial support of Chinese multinational automotive giant Wanxiang, which is in the process of launching a non-profit called Blockchain Labs.Wanxiang representatives confirmed Blockchain Labs recently purchased $500,000 worth of ETH as part of its wider effort to support the technology.The post notably listed figures representative of what Buterin claimed were the project\u0027s holdings, equalling $2.52m held in 200,000 CHF, 1,800 BTC and 2.7 ETH. At press time, 1 ETH was trading at $0.70 on bitcoin exchange Kraken.These figures do not include a 490,000 CHF ($502,976) legal defense fund Ethereum said it is keeping on hold for possible legal defense.Buterin went on to suggest that the Ethereum Foundation and its subsidiaries \"do not have the manpower\" to complete the current vision of the project, but cautioned that he does not believe that this puts the open-source project in jeopardy.Monthly expenditures from the Foundation, Buterin said, are now due to fall from 410,000 CHF ($420,858) per month to 340,000 CHF ($349,201) on 1st October. The ultimate goal will be to reduce the Foundation\u0027s burn rate to between 200,000 CHF ($205,370) and 250,000 CHF ($256,818) per month.\"Assuming that we get there in three months and that ether and bitcoin prices stay the same, we have enough to last until roughly June 2016 at the 340,000 [CHF] rate, and perhaps up to Sep-Dec 2016 given planned transitions,\" the post continued. \"By that point, the intent is for the foundation to secure alternative revenue sources.\"According to Buterin, contributors to the Ethereum project are able to receive funds in ETH, BTC or CHF, though he was less clear about how such payments interacted with cryptocurrency markets, stating that ETH payments had not yet \"touched primary ether markets\".Buterin indicated that the Ethereum Foundation no longer had the funds to meet its hiring schedule in relation to project demands.\"A hiring schedule that was meant to last over three years ended up lasting a little under two (although bolstered by a \u0027second wind\u0027 from our ETH holdings),\" he wrote.The post speculates on potential ways for the Ethereum Foundation to continue to take in funding from the community, with possible revenue streams including developer workshops and conferences, efforts Buterin suggested were already underway.The project also committed to becoming more transparent about its finances as it seeks to work past short-term budgeting issues, suggesting it is working with Ethereum-based accounting software provider Consensys to record all its expenses in the blockchain.Confusion about the handling of project funds can be seen in interest group forums, where speculation has persisted that Ethereum\u0027s sale of bitcoin was having an affect on the bitcoin price as far back as last August. Further, details regarding how bitcoins raised as part of the effort would be used were scarce in its initial crowdsale communications.Of note regarding the project\u0027s future is that the price of ETH has declined in September, from 0.0059 BTC on 1st September to 0.0026 BTC at current market prices.Image via Ethereum","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 28, 2015 at 8:57 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/28/with-bitcoins-price-down-vcs-turning-to-blockchain-technology/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/jATGp4TSMj0QsGm0l039D9GrZ3w\u003d/570x419/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/THX2HSXHNBDSZMLF2QMVUTKLWQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"With Bitcoin\u0027s Price Down, VCs Turning to Blockchain Technology","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The rising interest in use cases for bitcoin\u0027s underlying distributed ledger, the blockchain, is influencing the investment strategies of venture capitalists, new interviews indicate.Speaking to CoinDesk, some of the ecosystem\u0027s most frequent and most vocal investors are suggesting they are now working more closely with banks and putting an increased emphasis on projects that use the bitcoin blockchain or alternative distributed ledgers as a payments rail or distributed database.For example, Bart Stephens, managing partner at Blockchain Capital, which recently rebranded its firm from Crypto Currency Partners, suggested the industry has \"evolved\" as awareness of the blockchain\u0027s use cases become more widely analyzed and understood.Stephens told CoinDesk:Others like Aleph Venture Capital partner Eden Shochat, whose investments include blockchain technology firm Colu, expressed more interest in distributed ledger applications, a part of the industry where new startups such as Blockstack, Eris and Multichain are now seeking to separate from a widening pack that lacks clear leaders.\"With bitcoin, we are less intrigued by quick in and outs of the bitcoin system, such as payment processing or remittance using bitcoin as a currency as an intermediate step,\" Shochat said. \"That\u0027s generally optimizing transaction costs, but there are bigger opportunities, such as replacing inter-company supply chains via bitcoin payments.\"Cross Pacific Capital\u0027s (CPC) Marc van der Chijs was more direct in his assessment of his firm\u0027s interest in the industry. \"We look more at blockchain startups, and not pure bitcoin payment companies like wallets and exchanges,\" he said.Van der Chijs suggested CPC is now focused on applications for the technology in international money transfer and for distributed databases. Still, not every investor agrees that these are the immediate opportunities.For example, Jeremy Liew, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, told CoinDesk he believes its use as a store of value is still the most compelling in the short term.Elsewhere, Stephens spoke to the general increase in interest of major banks in the technology, reporting he has briefed the board of directors at roughly 15 major banks.\"Two years ago banks were focused on bitcoin and were scared as to what that meant, they saw it as dangerous and were scared of how banks would work with bitcoin businesses,\" he said. \"Fast forward a couple of years, we\u0027ve seen banks increasingly focus on blockchain.\"Stephens said he has been spending more time introducing Blockchain Capital\u0027s portfolio companies to major banks. Blockchain Capital has so far made 37 investments in the industry, participating in funding rounds for major players including Blockstream, Chain, Circle and Xapo. He continued:Given the recent interest from major banks in bitcoin and the blockchain, many investors also believe financial entities will soon start looking to acquire industry firms.\"I believe banks can’t innovate and, once they realize this, they will start buying bitcoin and blockchain startups,\" van der Chijs said, adding that some will be bought for their intellectual property, while others for experienced teams.\"That will be the first wave of bitcoin exits,\" he said, though he noted this was not likely to occur within the next four to five years.Shochat was less convinced banks won\u0027t be able to innovate, suggesting he believes they can leverage their current knowledge to help startups solve problems in their value chain.\"There are so many opportunities, anywhere from clearing and vaults to bank-sponsored wallets and replacing SWIFT,\" he continued. \"This isn’t the same role as venture investors, but banks can significantly direct ventures toward the right use cases.\"Stephens further suggested he believes financial institutions are \"moving slowly\" and at this point, are just \"information gathering\" when it comes to the technology.Liew, an investor in firms including Blockchain, BTCC (formerly BTC China) and Ripple Labs, was more dismissive of the role banks would play in any larger technology transition, suggesting these groups are not likely to replace the role of VCs in the ecosystem.Despite a decline in bitcoin and blockchain VC investments in Q3, most investors surveyed reported this was unlikely a result of any waning interest in the industry.Shochat, for instance, said Aleph typically only invests in 3% of the companies it sees across all sectors, and it is actively looking for deals with bitcoin startups. Van der Chijs echoed this observation, noting that CPC is transitioning from an early-stage to growth firm, and is now focused on late-stage investments.Further, he suggested industry observers put the activity of VC firms in context of their overall deal flow. \"Four investments may not seem like a lot of investments, but given that we only do about five investments per year out of over 300 companies that we look at, it’s actually quite substantial for us,\" he explained.Of those surveyed, most reported they don\u0027t believe there\u0027s any significant funding crunch facing the industry. Despite the lack of major Series B and Series C rounds, Stephens attributed this to trends in the overall VC space, where seed funding is easier to obtain.\"In general in technology, you see a lot of seed-stage companies, but once you have that, it\u0027s challenging to get to a Series A or Series B,\" Stephens said. \"Bitcoin is somewhat out of favor. In the last 15 to 16 months, the price of bitcoin has dropped 65-75%.\"Stephens expressed his belief that savvy investors would continue to measure the ecosystem by factors such as wallet growth and GitHub participation, but suggested these are of less interest to the wider venture industry.\"The average VC is very focused on the price of bitcoin,\" he said, a remark echoed by Liew who said the \"flatness\" of bitcoin\u0027s price has created a decline in investor interest.Correction: A previous version of this article stated Blockchain Capital had made only 20 investments in the ecosystem.Businessman visualization via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Venture Capital, Blockchain Technology, investors-2, investors, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 28, 2015 at 9:36 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/24/world-economic-forum-survey-projects-blockchain-tipping-point-by-2023/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/lUKy5uUm8AlrfnnyqbqzW---rqc\u003d/570x388/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/RFNQTMEVYJFN7OVCNJD3YYKOBI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"World Economic Forum Survey Projects Blockchain \u0027Tipping Point\u0027 by 2023","INTRO":"The World Economic Forum (WEF) has identified blockchain technology as one of its six mega-trends in a new report.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The World Economic Forum (WEF) has identified blockchain technology as one of its six mega-trends in a new report broadly aimed at outlining the expected transition to a more digital and connected world.Compiled by the WEF\u0027s Global Agenda Council on the Future of Software and Society, the report included the results of a survey of more than 800 information and communications executives and experts. Perhaps most notable among the poll\u0027s findings is that those surveyed believe the \"tipping point\" for government use of the blockchain will occur by 2023.For purposes of the survey, blockchain technology was broadly defined as \"an emerging technology [that] replaces the need for third-party institutions to provide trust for financial, contract and voting activities\".In turn, the survey suggested bitcoin and the blockchain would reach a \"tipping point\", or a point at which it becomes broadly adopted, by 2027. Respondents were given a range of potential responses to survey questions, which included the ability to respond with answers such as \"it has already happened\", it will happen in \"20+ years\" or it will \"never\" happen.Of the respondents, 73.1% reported by that taxes would first be collected using a blockchain by 2025, while 57.9% affirmed they believe 10% of global gross domestic product (GDP) would be stored on a blockchain by this time. By comparison, 91.2% of survey-takers indicated 10% of people would wear clothes connected to the Internet by that year.The WEF also indicated that, should blockchain technology become mainstream, it would be likely that the traditional role of government and institutions would need to be reimagined, writing:Founded in 1971, the WEF is a 600-person independent international organization dedicated to improving the world through collaborations between the public and private sector. As part of its mandate, it holds an annual meeting on politics, economics and social issues.While 58% of survey-takers expect bitcoin and the blockchain to hit mainstream, accounting for 10% of global GDP, by 2025, WEF forecasted the expected date as 2027.\"Currently, the total worth of bitcoin in the blockchain is around $20bn, or about 0.025% of global GDP of around $80tn,\" the report read.The report went on to list the positive benefits of such a transition, which included:Smart contracts were further used as an example of the technology, as the report described how the the blockchain can allow two parties to create complex contracts without a middleman.The process of creating \"self-executing contractual states\", it continued, could eliminate the risk that comes from a reliance on third parties.The WEF notably projected that governments would begin leveraging the blockchain sooner than the mainstream public, with this expected transition occurring by 2023.By 2025, 73% of respondents expected this to occur.\"The blockchain creates both opportunities and challenges for countries,\" the report read. \"On the one hand, it is unregulated and not overseen by any central bank, meaning less control over monetary policy. On the other hand, it creates the ability for new taxing mechanisms to be built into the blockchain itself (eg a small transaction tax).\"The report suggested there were potential drawbacks to blockchain-based government systems, including an undermining of central bank and monetary policy, corruption, real-time taxation and changes to the role of government.Of note is that government experiments with blockchain technology are already underway, with the Isle of Man\u0027s Department of Economic Development announcing plans for a trial in May.For more insights, read the full \"Deep Shift: Technology Tipping Points and Societal Impact\" report.Image credit: Gil C / Shutterstock.com","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 24, 2015 at 10:07 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/21/verizon-ventures-blockchains-future-is-brighter-than-bitcoins/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/yFlQ8a2JfPIgg39xL30ODAHvw54\u003d/570x407/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/MPOKN4J4XVHG7MW7ITFN2YJA3M.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Verizon Ventures: Blockchain\u0027s Future is Brighter Than Bitcoin\u0027s","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Visa, Capital One, JP Morgan.While it may be expected that the world\u0027s leading financial firms would be interested in bitcoin and blockchain tech given its association with currency, the technology\u0027s range of potential use cases is attracting perhaps more surprising names.For example, Verizon Ventures, the venture capital arm of US telecommunications giant Verizon, recently invested in Filament, a Nevada-based startup seeking to use the bitcoin blockchain and Ethereum to enable Internet of Things (IoT) devices to both be tracked, and to transact, on a public ledger system.The investment was Verizon Ventures\u0027 first in the industry, but according to director Ed Ruth, it\u0027s unlikely it will be the last. Ruth believes blockchain tech has the ability to solve problems facing technology applications in the IoT and beyond.In an interview, Ruth indicated Verizon Ventures had been studying bitcoin for a year without much interest, but it was the larger implications of the blockchain, the digital currency\u0027s distributed ledger, that changed his mind about the available opportunities.Ruth told CoinDesk:While he suggested the use of cryptographic tokens as digital currency might find a fit in the third world, Ruth suggested the firm doesn\u0027t believe this use case is as compelling in developed markets like the US.Still, Ruth cautioned that his firm doesn\u0027t have an operating thesis on the technology, calling it a \"living and breathing\" project, adding that Verizon is paying attention to all aspects of the developing technology.\"I think the market is incredibly nascent,\" he continued, \"but we\u0027re interested and paying attention and we\u0027re learning through companies we\u0027re investing in.\"One of the largest cell phone carriers in the US, Verizon generated $87.6bn in wireless revenues in 2014, and boasts 6.6 million Internet subscribers.Ruth explained that, while Verizon Ventures is interested in blockchain tech, it\u0027s still a very general interest. As such, it was Filament\u0027s use of the technology for IoT, he said, that made the startup a compelling investment.\"We think of IoT as an extended new vertical for network infrastructure. We know it\u0027s going to be the backbone for a lot of the data that needs to transact in the cloud for smart cities, fleet management, and so on and so forth,\" he explained.Filament, he recently wrote, stood out for the way it combined IoT technology with its use of end-to-end encryption and ability to \"securely collect and consolidate data\" with its devices. The startup is set to release two devices in Q4 of this year, both of which advertise an ability to securely communicate, execute smart contracts and send microtransactions.Ruth said IoT has become a bigger point of emphasis for Verizon as it has recently sought to expand beyond telecommunications. For example, he noted Verizon\u0027s recent acquisition of AOL saw it entering the media business.\"We\u0027ve been traditionally a telco company and about a year and a half two years ago, we transitioned into a technology company,\" he continued. \"I think IoT is a means by which we can transform ourselves.\"Despite a heavy focus on IoT, Ruth said he does believe blockchain tech will impact other verticals, though he\u0027s not sure exactly which will be affected.For example, he suggested there may be use cases for digital currency in financial services and shared databases in regards to roaming agreements, where Verizon will extend voice and data services to customers by way of a local telecom partner.While Orange Telecom has honed in on the former use case for extending financial services, Ruth said the model doesn\u0027t quite make sense for Verizon yet given its US focus.\"For emerging markets, it\u0027s a bigger value than in stable markets with stable currencies,\" Ruth continued. \"Our initial thinking was that it didn\u0027t solve a large enough problem domestically.\"Going forward, Ruth predicts bitcoin and blockchain tech will continue to garner attention from major brands, given the support and capital leading VC firms such as Andreessen Horowitz have already extended.Still, he said incumbent companies are likely to be cautious as they explore the tech, concluding:Verizon image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Venture Capital, Blockchain Technology, Internet of Things, investors, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 21, 2015 at 1:55 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/18/researchers-tackle-tomorrows-blockchain-problems-with-bitcoin-ng/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/fxdFwQyZM2eRvbE8p3ekES10QwQ\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/MKLQZTDDVVGWDMS4636T3AGWJQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Researchers Tackle Tomorrow\u0027s Blockchain Problems With Bitcoin-NG","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The question of how to best increase the transaction processing capacity of the blockchain may be bitcoin\u0027s current crisis, but that isn\u0027t stopping researchers from working to solve more forward-looking issues.Held last weekend in Montreal, the inaugural Scaling Bitcoin marked the first major conference for developers, and as such, it featured a broad sampling of technical experts working on solutions to problems that may come to light as knowledge of blockchain technology advances.One of the more novel proposals to debut at the event was developed by Cornell post-doc student Ittay Eyal, PhD student Adem Efe Gencer, computer science professor Emin Gün Sirer and research scientist Robbert Van Renesse. Called Bitcoin-NG (the \"NG\" is short for \"next generation\"), the proposal is envisioned as a solution to \"inherent problems\" in blockchain design, both in bitcoin and alternative distributed ledgers such as Ethereum.Eyal said that behind Bitcoin-NG is the belief that there are more fundamental issues with the design of blockchains that will make scaling any implementation, public or private, a challenge.Eyal told CoinDesk:One of the most pressing problems, the team behind Bitcoin-NG argues, is that as the size of data blocks on a blockchain increases, so does the risk that the blockchain forks, resulting in competing versions of the public record of past transactions and inefficiencies in network communication.Bitcoin-NG, according to Eyal, was an exercise in identifying issues that arise when individual transactions and blocks of transactions are verified and propagated over a blockchain network, as well as the benefits that should be maintained in any redesign.Ultimately, the researchers behind Bitcoin-NG came to the conclusion that blocks on a blockchain have two separate functions – electing a \u0027leader\u0027 that decides which transactions are included in the main blockchain and distributing a reward to the miner.\"When you place a block in the [bitcoin] blockchain, then you implicitly say I\u0027m the leader from the previous block until now and that\u0027s the order of the transactions I decide for this period,\" he explained.Bitcoin-NG proposes composing a blockchain of two separate types of blocks: \u0027key blocks\u0027 that decide a \u0027leader\u0027 and \u0027microblocks\u0027 that feature transactions for a specific amount of time in the future.Leader miners would be awarded the entirety of the block reward, while splitting fees on transactions between keyblocks with the previous leader.Eyal indicated that it took the team a while to hone in on a central thesis for its research, that forks, while currently happening a few times a day in bitcoin, will be more common should transaction blocks be larger.The researcher suggested that this problem can\u0027t be solved by changing the block size or frequency of a given network, and that scalability will require greater changes. First, however, Eyal said metrics for the analysis needed to be identified.\"You need metrics to realize what you\u0027re trying to optimize and the metrics are intuitively very clear, you want a transaction to be placed in a blockchain as fast as possible, you want to see it there and you want to be able to place as many transactions as possible,\" he said.The most important metric developed during the process, according to Eyal, was the idea of \"consensus delay\", or how long into the past most nodes agree on the state of the blockchain.\"Everyone agrees on everything that happened in the blockchain history from one hour ago and back. But what about inside one hour? If there are forks and there are a lot of forks, then surely we don\u0027t agree,\" he continued.Additional metrics used by the researchers included \"time to prune\", or the time it takes for miners whether they are on the correct \"branch\" or version of the blockchain they are processing transactions. As block sizes increase, Eyal suggested time to prune increases.Also considered were mining power utilization, or the ratio of completed blocks that end up on the main chain, and \u0027time to win\u0027, the period of time before all miners agree that a given version of the blockchain is the longest so as to expend resources accordingly.As for inspirations, Eyal cited Greedy Heaviest-Observed Sub-Tree (GHOST), a research proposal that envisions how a main chain could be better selected from the variety of competing forks.Proposed by researchers Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar in 2013, GHOST was also considered during the development of the alternative blockchain Ethereum, which aims to serve as a network for distributed applications.\"There were two points made in the paper,\" Eyal explained. \"GHOST has a different way of choosing chains. In bitcoin, you choose the longest chain and it becomes the main chain. This is popularly known as an orphan block. This is the wrong word, it\u0027s a pruned branch. GHOST has a different way of choosing the longest branch.\"Eyal indicated that the longest chain doesn\u0027t necessarily have the most blocks, and that in bitcoin, one with less blocks, but more branches, could be selected.\"The other thing they add is the idea of inclusive blockchain where if you have a branch you can later merge transactions back into the main chain,\" Eyal continued.To better facilitate these processes, Bitcoin-NG\u0027s system is one in which keyblocks use proof-of-work like bitcoin and only leaders generate microblocks, though they come in shorter intervals. In the proposal, keyblocks are generated every 10 minutes, while microblocks are generated every 10 seconds.Sixty percent of mining fees generated during this time go forward to the next miner, Eyal said, motivating it to place itself in the chain as last as possible. The current leaders get 40% of fees.\"Why 40%? Because we have to make some assumptions about the size of the attacker, and we don\u0027t want the attacker to be motivated about mining multiple blocks, it becomes complicated. It could be 10%, but then larger miners might be motivated not to place transactions in blocks,\" Eyal said at the conference.To date, Eyal said that Bitcoin-NG has already been implemented on bitcoin\u0027s code case, and that this network has been the subject of some experimentation.Still, he said it would likely be some time before anything like Bitcoin-NG is implemented on the bitcoin network, mostly due to the difficulty of reaching consensus given the disparate stakeholders in the open-source project.\"In theory, it\u0027s possible to just fork bitcoin or hard fork bitcoin to use this new protocol and increase scalability for much better latency and bandwidth. As you saw with the blocksize discussion it is difficult to make changes, let alone major changes with this consensus mechanism,\" he said.Currently, Bitcoin-NG is operating as a testbed running 1,000 nodes. Eyal and his team are using a Cornell data center for the experiment, with 150 machines running seven clients.Going forward, he said the team hopes to conduct its work on a larger scale, publish a white paper and ultimately release Bitcoin-NG to the public.Though testing needs to be done, Eyal was optimistic Bitcoin-NG could contribute to the current blocksize debate through the metrics it used to determine its design, concluding:For more information on Bitcoin-NG, read the full transcript from Eyal\u0027s Scaling bitcoin talk here.Computer networking image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Protocol, Technology, Bitcoin, Bitcoin-NG, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 18, 2015 at 7:50 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/18/bitcoin-in-the-headlines-blockchain-good-bitcoin-bad/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/ZSUPCLKaZULJuS44xJieRyliQyY\u003d/570x429/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/ZJYJHIVXINFXVGD6NAY2BS5YTA.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin in the Headlines: Blockchain Good, Bitcoin Bad","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of bitcoin media coverage and its impact.The bitcoin and blockchain industry have a new major newsmaker: distributed ledger startup R3CEV.Leaving behind a week filled with impressive funding rounds, the coverage over the last few days has been largely dominated by the company\u0027s partnership with nine well-known banks including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs.Journalists from across the world jumped at the chance to cover the news – perhaps still a sign that mainstream media will deem industry events newsworthy if traditional finance is involved.In stark contrast, more negative news events received less attention, and were far more focused on the other half of the blockchain – bitcoin, the digital token for which the blockchain acts as a ledger.BitPay\u0027s phishing attack – which resulted in the loss of $1.8m – received less widespread, but more derisive coverage. Elsewhere, reports about Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles\u0027 charge with embezzlement carried over from last week.The news that nine of the world\u0027s biggest banks had partnered with distributed ledger startup R3CEV caught the attention of the Financial Times\u0027 Philip Stafford, who began his piece emphasizing the group\u0027s intention to drive the adoption of blockchain technology.Stafford wrote:Stafford continued to note that the blockchain, which he described as bitcoin\u0027s underlying \"computer network\", had caught the eye of the financial services industry in the past six months for \"its potential to overhaul the sprawling and complicated network of bank payments and settlements\".Interestingly, the journalist\u0027s assertions follow on from Blythe Masters\u0027 comments during a panel at Consensus 2015 – CoinDesk\u0027s inaugural conference held in New York last week – where she noted how distributed ledger technologies could serve to eradicate the pain points affecting the financial industry and its ecosystem.The article, which then went on to give an overview of the financial industry\u0027s interaction with blockchain technology, also noted:\"Banks, exchanges and settlement houses are exploring ways to harness the much-hyped technology to reshape many of their daily operations, from upgrading old back-office systems and outsourcing billions of dollars in costs to automatic execution of contracts.\"The Wall Street Journal\u0027s Paul Vigna was also quick to point out Wall Street\u0027s increasing interest in blockchain technology:Examples cited by Vigna included Blythe Masters\u0027 appointment as CEO of Digital Asset Holdings and itBit\u0027s plans to reveal its own distributed ledger, BankChain.Likewise, Russia Today, ran a piece titled \"Global banking giants join forces to make bitcoin technology mainstream\".Unlike the FT\u0027s piece, which was characterised by an absence of any notable bitcoin mentions, the outletonly indulged in a brief, negative overview of bitcoin:It continued: \"Not having a central authority means that an Internet-wide catastrophe would have to occur in order to compromise the integrity of the ledger.\"Although its description was not factually inaccurate, the report failed to move away from the negative connotations associated with the cryptocurrency.The BBC also referred to bitcoin in its coverage, noting its somewhat negative reputation whilst outlining some of the vulnerabilities of companies in the space:Further proof that blockchain technology continues to captivate mainstream institutions was provided by IBM\u0027s announcement that it is working on a new blockchain-based smart contract system.Bloomberg\u0027s Luke Kawa was one of the journalists who reported the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\u0027s (CFTC) ruling that bitcoin met its definition of a commodity, a decision that speaks to how the agency will likely regulate the technology in the future.\"Virtual money is officially a commodity, just like crude oil or wheat,\" said Kawa.As noted by commentators, the CFTC\u0027s decision is specific to the agency only, meaning other agencies are still able to come to decisions regarding how uses of the technology may fall under their jurisdiction.Still, there was widespread confusion about the implications of the announcement.Writing for ZDNet, Corinne Reichert incorrectly suggested that the move would more broadly affect bitcoin companies not involved in the sale of options, futures or derivatives, implying they must now ensure that their companies are legally registered with the CFTC.Reichert added:The ruling more specifically relates to issuers of bitcoin futures contracts seeking to find a market with industry companies looking to hedge against the fluctuating price of the asset.As stated in past analysis on CoinDesk, the CFTC has the power not to regulate commodities themselves, but to regulate commodities futures and other similar financial contracts.Negative news drew less attention this week, but most was focused on older startups seeking to use bitcoin as a digital currency.For example, Motherboard ran a piece about BitPay\u0027s phishing attack, titled \"How a Clever Hacker Tricked a Major Bitcoin Company Out of $1.8 Million\".The piece said:The hack, the author added, was never made public by bitcoin payment processor BitPay, but was revealed by court documents which the startup filed against an insurer.The story that was picked up by a variety of news outlets including American Banker and the Atlanta Business Chronicle, but was largely bypassed by more major media outlets.On the topic of scandal, this week\u0027s coverage also regurgitated Mark Karpeles\u0027 charge with embezzlement, widely covered towards the latter half of last week.

Industry is seeing that potential and is looking to see how it and the markets might benefit,\" he continued.Medcraft moved on to note the various ways in which regulators are responding to blockchain technology, saying:Although he said it was not currently possible to know exactly how blockchain technology would evolve, he believes it will continue to do so.Medcraft also said the implications for regulators were profound, but should not hamper innovation.\"As regulators and policymakers, we need to ensure what we do is about harnessing the opportunities and the broader economic benefits – not standing in the way of innovation and development. At the same time, we need to mitigate the risks these developments pose to our objectives. We also need to ensure those who benefit from the technology trust it,\" he noted.Medcraft said ASIC was working to ensure the opportunities around innovation were being harnessed and in so doing was focused on five key areas, which included the education of market participants.Additionally, the chairman noted that ASIC was also engaging with, and providing guidance to, industry players.\"I want to mention two particular activities. The first is our cyber resilience work ... the second is our Innovation Hub ... designed to make it quicker and easier for innovative startups and FinTech businesses to navigate the regulatory system we administer,\" he added.The chairman also believes surveillance is key, explaining that ASIC monitors the market to understand not only how investors use technology and financial products, but also the risks that arise. He added:Lastly, Medcraft highlighted ASIC\u0027s role in enforcement and issuing policy advice whilst pointing out the commission\u0027s intention to continue monitoring regulation:\"We will continue to review the current regulatory framework, analyse how new developments, such as blockchain, may fit into the framework and identify where changes may be required.\"The chairman\u0027s comments come after the Australian Senate Economic References Committee asserted that digital currency transactions should be treated in the same way as fiat transactions when it came to Goods and Services Tax.Australia flag image via Shutterstock.","TAGS":"Australia, Blockchain Technology, Regulation, News, ASIC, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 18, 2015 at 11:02 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2015/09/16/ibm-developing-new-blockchain-smart-contract-system/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/uEitZm24mRy02pUom2l2-HeGQ7E\u003d/570x416/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/ETB4WKMNWBGPZJVYXMVZFFSEJI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"IBM Developing New Blockchain Smart Contract System","INTRO":"IBM is reportedly working on a new project for smart contract creation using the bitcoin code base.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"IBM is working on a new blockchain project for smart contract creation.The Wall Street Journal reports the company’s research arm is using the basic bitcoin codebase to create a new blockchain system that will eventually be released as open-source software.IBM said that “dozens” of employees are involved in the initiative, and that the project is distinct from ADEPT, a proof-of-concept for the Internet of Things unveiled earlier this year.The Journal spoke with IBM research senior vice president Arvind Krishna, who told the newspaper that the company’s blockchain system won’t have an internal currency and will be designed to \"ensure that contract details remain private\" while making it easier for companies to \"embed business rules\" into smart contracts.One example given was that the software could automatically pay for a package upon delivery.Krishna said in an interview that the project could result in broader financial access for the unbanked, telling the Journal:A representative for IBM was not immediately available for comment.Image Credit: TK Kurikawa / Shutterstock.com","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, IBM, Technology, smart contracts, Companies, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Tech","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 16, 2015 at 6:31 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/14/bitcoins-future-moves-into-focus-at-scaling-bitcoin-day-2/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/tRYm9VKQB2-imYvPnNCoXl5Cj4M\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/L6PMHIC5LFCI3B7THTG3HWS47E.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin\u0027s Future Moves Into Focus at Scaling Bitcoin Day 2","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"If the first day of Scaling Bitcoin focused on fostering constructive dialogue, day two moved the conversation toward defining how that dialogue would proceed following the event and how such discussion could coalesce into a clearer vision for the open-source technology\u0027s future.Topics of discussion at the event still focused most directly on the larger question of how the bitcoin network could support increased transaction levels. However, these presentations were buoyed by musings on the trade-offs that will need to be weighed should the community want to honor the project\u0027s original democratizing vision.For example, some of the day\u0027s talks occasionally provided a broad, analytical look at current proposals, delving into the theoretical considerations such as how much capacity the bitcoin network would need to handle at scale and how the metric of scale could be defined.\"When people talk about how bitcoin will have to scale, people throw out something about Visa processing 20,000 transactions per second or something,\" Harry Kalodner, of Princeton\u0027s Security and Privacy Research Group, said. \"There are other relevant factors though.\"Kalodner went on to suggest using the bitcoin blockchain as a domain name storage system might add 294 million transactions to the network, a figure that doesn\u0027t include expected use cases such as in the Internet of Things. \"There are 245 million cars in the US,\" he added.In this light, sometimes contentious approaches to blockchain design such as the Lightning Network, which seeks to add payment channels to bitcoin, and BIP 102, a proposal to increase the blocksize to 2MB, were discussed but with the goal of providing clarity as to their intent.Paul Sztorc, author of the Truthcoin white paper, spoke about the existential issues facing the blocksize debate, and the need for arguments to be understood as the sum of underlying assumptions that must be qualified and stated clearly.Sztorc told attendees:Elsewhere, the afternoon sessions featured 12 roundtables held to address community challenges. Some moved toward solutions, such as a proposed set of principals that seeks to help the development community grow.\"We need to have better resources for new entrants to the community, so they can be onboarded to the community without negativity,\" one presenter said.The proposed principles are just one initiative that will be developed prior to being presented at a second Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong.To be held in December, the event is slated to feature presentations for scaling the bitcoin network, which will be evaluated against criteria developed at this weekend\u0027s event in Montreal.One of the day\u0027s more anticipated talks was by Bitcoin Core developer and BitPay employee Jeff Garzik, whose presentation was entitled \"Issues Impacting Block Size Proposals.\"This July, Garzik introduced BIP 102, a patch to the bitcoin software that would raise the blocksize limit to 2MB via a hard fork. The short-term solution would alleviate immediate worries about the network reaching capacity, though the specific pros and cons of the measure were discussed only tangentially.\"The trend is pretty clear that we are headed towards the 1MB block size limit,\" Garzik said, warning that user experience on the bitcoin network will decline when blocks hit capacity. This occurrence, he argued, that would necessitate that consumers pay fluctuating fees to execute transactions, something consumers and consumer products aren\u0027t yet equipped for.\"A wall at 1MB creates chaos as fees shift to a new higher equilibrium. When we hit that wall, businesses or users might be incentivized away from bitcoin by high fees,\" he said, adding:Garzik suggested that larger financial entities may be inclined to use the bitcoin network, but that they are currently confined to experiments because doing so would instantly cause the network to hit its transaction processing capacity.The talk perhaps best succeeded at showcasing Garzik\u0027s viewpoint that any and all solutions to bitcoin\u0027s current blocksize dilemma need to be considered.\"A second course correction hard fork is likely. All the world\u0027s coffee payments won\u0027t fit on the blockchain, you must have layer two and all the other scalability solutions,\" he concluded.One of the central considerations of the blocksize debate is how many transactions need to be recorded directly onto the bitcoin blockchain. For example, the Lightning Network, currently in development, proposes updating the protocol to support off-blockchain micropayment channels which would then settle on the blockchain.Led by Lightning developers Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja, the talk focused not directly on the project, but the implications for not scaling bitcoin to meet expected demand.\"The underlying assumption in these failure models is the assumption everyone would use bitcoin if they could,\" Dryja said. \"We\u0027re assuming everyone wants to use this.\"Dryja suggested that the community should start first by drawing rough parameters on the size of blocks it is willing to \"agree are crazy\", ruling out sizes of 1 kilobyte or as big as 1 petabyte.In between, Dryja spoke about a \"bathtub\" of outcomes, hypothesizing that if the block size were extremely limited, it would grow only 50MB annually.\"[In this scenario], you can run a full node on your phone. But 10 large institutions have private keys. This is a failure because users don\u0027t have the keys. That was the promise of bitcoin to be your own bank,\" he continued.In turn, Poon spoke about the technical limitations of the blockchain for micropayments today, suggested that the cost of using the network for a transaction is 3 cents, making smaller transactions cost-prohibitive.The talk was followed by a presentation by Come Plooy of Amiko Pay, a project that aims to be an implementation for Lightning that deals with routing data between payment channel nodes.The more experimental aspects of blockchain mechanics were discussed in a series of talks that included Ethereum researcher Vlad Zamfir, Blockstream co-founder Mark Friedenbach and BitFury chief information officer Alex Petrov, among others.Zamfir led off the section with a talk on \"sharding\" blockchains, a process by which nodes hold only a subset of the state and the blockchain. In bitcoin, nodes are currently expected to hold a complete version of the blockchain.\"[With sharding], instead of everyone redundantly doing the same work, we\u0027re going to share the load but still have an economic assurance even though we\u0027re not going to validate every transaction,\" Zamfir explained. \"We can get orders of magnitude of transactions per second if everyone isn\u0027t validating everything.\"Under the system, miners are assigned shards of the blockchain, he said, before explaining some of the issues inherent in coordinating parties within such a system.\"We need to sample the mining power, which presents a problem,\" he continued. \"We need to split the state space into shards, we need to process transactions within shards, and then deal with attack vectors where not everyone is checking everything.\"Elsewhere, Friedenbach spoke about the benefits of having a blocksize on a blockchain network, explaining why the measure was enacted, as well as some of the problems that have resulted from the decision.\"We want to do this because in the early days of bitcoin there are often certain kinds of transactions there are ways to slow down a validator by using a non-standard transaction or filling up a block with tons of spam,\" he said.While mostly well-received, the conference ended on a controversial note, with remarks by Nicholas Negroponte drawing the ire of more anti-government members of the bitcoin community.Founder of the MIT Media Lab and an investor in WIRED Magazine, he urged the bitcoin community to weigh the societal implications of the technology when making decisions.\"What is the difference between a mission and a market?\" he asked. \"If you\u0027re after a market, be my guest, but what is going to make bitcoin work is when you think of it as a mission. It\u0027s going to make the world a better place in a lot of different ways.\"Negroponte also chastised the community for its inclinations to treat the technology as a \"get rich quick scheme\" and to hoard bitcoin due to its expected future value.\"What\u0027s wrong with being run by the government?

Nonetheless, some of the more direct statements to the significance of bitcoin\u0027s challenges were made during the presentations on these roundtables.There, one prominent academic appealed to the overall spirit of the event, stating:Others spoke to the value of the day\u0027s denser, earlier topics including the need for a greater knowledge of how often inefficiencies in the mining network – such as orphan blocks not ultimately included in the chain – are produced, and the communications delays that result in miners in different locations globally receiving delayed information about the network state.Elsewhere, the need for continued communication among stakeholders at events such as Scaling Bitcoin was addressed.\"It\u0027s not just about changing the blocksize,\" a participant said. \"It\u0027s about proving that when critical issues arise we can resolve them.\"Perhaps the most newsworthy event of the day came during the \"Testing, Simulation and Modeling\" section of the day\u0027s content when Cornell computer science post-grad Ittay Eyal presented Bitcoin-NG, a new proposed solution to scaling the bitcoin network.Developed by Adem Efe Gencer, Emin Gün Sirer and Robbert Van Renesse, Bitcoin-NG seeks lower latency, higher throughput and better security on the bitcoin network by proposing changes to the bitcoin mining process.The proposal recommends breaking up the process by which miners are provided both a reward for finding a \"nonce\", the arbitrary number that decides who wins the 25 BTC reward distributed every 10 minutes, and the process by which those winning miners determine the transactions added to the blockchain.Bitcoin-NG would create two types of blocks: key blocks, which contain no content but elect a \"leader\"; and microblocks, which would contain only transaction content.\"Only the leader can generate the private blocks,\" Eyal explained. \"The interval between the key blocks would be 10 minutes, while \u0027microblocks\u0027 come in every 10 seconds.\"Under the system, keyblocks would be given the rewards from the mining block, while 40% of fees would go back to the leader and 60% to those who submit microblocks.The proposal is still in its early stages and no white paper has yet been released.The economics and incentivizes portion of the day saw three talks by BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen, physicist and entrepreneur Peter R and researcher Miles Carlsten.All three talks focused on how miners – the parties on the bitcoin network that process transactions – should be compensated, and how the larger network can expect these parties to behave when as existing incentivize structure may alter, whether that\u0027s as expected under the current bitcoin design or under an alternative proposal.Cohen\u0027s talk, entitled \"How Wallets Can Handle Real Transaction Fees\", focused on exploring how the bitcoin network might be shaped should the number of transactions sent to miners routinely passes the 1MB cap for information included in new blocks.Overall, Cohen was supportive of the idea that the community allows the cap to remain at 1MB on the basis that this would help ascertain whether fees could one day replace block rewards.Cohen advocated for upgrades to bitcoin wallets that would allow users to more flexibly interact with the bitcoin network by setting minimum and maximum fees and a length of time before the transaction would be canceled should the fee be too low to incentivize its inclusion in a block.Another interesting take on issues surrounding the network came during Peter R\u0027s talk on how the economics of the bitcoin network could be expected to work should the community decide to remove a blocksize limit, essentially restoring the network back to its state before the cap was introduced as a way to combat spam.\"Most people think miners find the nonce,\" Peter R said. \"Miners have another job as well, they produce a new type of digital commodity called block space, or \u0027room for transaction data.\u0027\"From there, Peter R delved into the economics of supply and demand, suggesting that the market could be expected to a find an equilibrium even without a cap on block size.\"Economists struggled with this problem, too,\" he said. \"They postulated a new law called the law of supply. It says producers will only plant more apple trees if they make more money for doing so. Supply and demand intersect at free-market equilibrium. Even though demand can be considered infinite, we still get finite amount of production.\"With this as a backdrop, Peter R ended by calling the blocksize a \"political measure\" that no longer had a clear benefit for the network other than reducing potential productivity.He ended the session by announcing the forthcoming launch of Ledger, a peer reviewed bitcoin journal that will seek to highlight the best white papers and research produced by the technology\u0027s enthusiasts.The imbalances that could be created by poorly aligned incentives in the network were touched on most directly by Miles Carlsten, who presented research conducted jointly with fellow Harry Kalodner and Arvind Narayanan.Carlsten discussed the non-network-related issues those who process transactions on the network face, including the cost of electricity and hardware. He evoked the idea of a gap that will occur as miners begin to selectively contribute to the network at times when the expected reward outweighs the cost.\"This issue is made worse by the fact that hardware is becoming commoditized, which increases vulnerability to attack,\" he said. \"With the majority of miners mining at some gap, if attackers start mining right away, what fraction of the hashrate do they need to perform 51% attack? The fraction of hashpower quickly drops from 50%. This is a real threat to the security of bitcoin, as blocks must be immediately profitable to mine.\"Most notable was Carlsten\u0027s contention that these issues could occur as quickly as in 2016 when the reward the network produces every 10 minutes will decline from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC.\"We think a gap will be profitable at next block halving,\" he said.Rounding out the day\u0027s session was a talk by activist and author Gabriella Coleman, who provided an overview of how open-source groups have historically responded to governance challenges.Coleman\u0027s work includes studies on universal operating system Debian and hacktivist group Anonymous.\"I was surprised to hear this was one of the first meetings where developers have come together,\" she told the crowd. \"It\u0027s pretty rare to have an open-source community that doesn\u0027t meet. Those that don\u0027t meet often crumble and fall away.\"Coleman suggested that, based on historical precedent, bitcoin is unlikely to function on a governance model in which a \"benevolent dictator\" can sufficiently oversee the project.\"Benevolent dictators can work if there\u0027s a founder, but usually that style of governance is matched with other types of governance,\" she said, adding:Presentations from the day\u0027s event can be found in both written and video form.Images by Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Mining, Technology, Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin XT, Events, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 13, 2015 at 1:10 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/10/coinalytics-raises-11-million-for-blockchain-data-platform/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Ptb8COQ-8p7l3-LBBKWN91zXWfI\u003d/570x505/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/NP42XDTTTVFILFIFUFSBHHPLKU.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Coinalytics Raises $1.1 Million for Blockchain Data Platform","INTRO":"Coinalytics has raised $1.1m as part of a seed round led by Palo Alto-based incubator The Hive.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Coinalytics has raised $1.1m as part of a seed round led by Palo Alto-based incubator The Hive.Founded in April 2014, Coinalytics describes itself as a \"real-time intelligence service\" for blockchain platforms.

Malmgren today acts as a consultant for companies and governments on international trade issues.In a recent interview published on Zero Hedge, Malmgren touched on the policy push by many governments worldwide to move transactional systems from those dominated by cash to those comprised of digital, trackable transactions. In his view, central banks, private companies and governments desire such systems because of the data that would be accessible to them.He cites blockchain technology as a major technological aspect of this drive, citing the work of Blythe Masters and her blockchain startup, Digital Asset Holdings (DAH), in developing such systems.Malmgren told Sinclair \u0026 Co\u0027s Erico Matias Tavares:Such an arrangement, he continued, would give rise to an environment in which \"significant financial flows and all debts and assets could be monitored in real time, enabling policies and regulations to be adapted to the realities of daily life\".This, he asserted, was at the heart of the work of DAH.\"The objective of the blockchain that Blythe Masters is pursuing is ultimately to put together a global blockchain, which is consolidated at any moment in time. Everything you have and everything you owe are visible,\" he stated.For Malmgren, the creation of a universal cashless system carries significant risks. Beyond fears related to data privacy, a no-cash framework could lend itself to sociological governance whereby regulators start trying to oversee daily activities more actively.\"If your funds are being used in a statistically abnormal manner then they can start routinely asking you for an explanation, if it was drug money or money laundering or purchases of regulated products like alcoholic beverages or firearms,\" he said.If used in that fashion, Malmgren noted, the blockchain would help create an environment in which regulators have vast troves of data with which to monitor, categorize and regulate spenders. This system, he argues, would also enable more direct financial engineering as central bankers saw fit.\"A complete ledger system would place everyone inside a precisely defined, monitorable box with defined set of rules of behavior,\" he said.Malmgren continued:\"One can understand the benefits, but there are potential negative consequences for individuals and businesses,\" he concluded. \"And the Social Contract between citizens and their governments would be threatened.\"Surveillance image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, Digital Asset Holdings, Companies, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Finance","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 8, 2015 at 8:33 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/09/04/timeline-what-central-banks-have-said-about-bitcoin-in-2015/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/_EpE4vMwFFXAkY8ftCxKBJfggzM\u003d/570x372/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/UE6ZBF3FAFE47K6P6GSE4M4KM4.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Timeline: What Central Banks Have Said About Bitcoin in 2015","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralised peer-to-peer payment protocol and one that would fall outside the control of both governments and banks.This, however, has not prevented central banks from voicing their opinion on the digital currency and its potential regulation.Although bitcoin regulation continues to be a contentious subject, some central banks have said it is necessary.

As such, he saw the opportunity in a partnership with Tierion for his organization to learn about unfamiliar emerging innovations.Carlson told CoinDesk:The DECD survey, according to Carlson, is currently being filled out by respondents, with all data expected to be collected by 11th September. He suggested the DECD remains actively interested in the results of the survey, but that the department may not necessarily be aware of any technology providers that facilitate handling of the data.Vaughan indicated that he had previously worked with the CTC at his former business, web development provider Fuscient, until he wound down activities at the firm in 2014.Vaughan suggested his interest in bitcoin and the blockchain began in 2013, when he decided to build his first bitcoin miner and began trading the digital currency.\"I got involved in trading because I felt the tech was really important. I jumped in,\" he continued, claiming that he even coined the term \"Willy\" for the bot network that was revealed to have been run by Mt Gox in the run-up to its 2014 collapse.Eventually, this interest turned to business pursuits, with Vaughan joining decentralized recordkeeping protocol provider Factom to help with its business development. Ultimately, he said he left the project over issues with its business model, including the project\u0027s choice of a public token sale as a vehicle for fundraising.\"The core utility of Factom, you just don\u0027t need Factom,\" Vaughan said. \"They could do a crowdsale, but it wasn\u0027t necessary for what they needed to accomplish. So in late 2014, I said, we\u0027re going to take this engine for collecting data and we\u0027re going to start anew.\"The decision led Vaughan to create Tierion, which recently published a white paper on its open-source technology, Chainpoint, in July. The paper was written by Vaughan, Tierion lead developer Jason Bukowski and Storj founder Sean Wilkinson.Tierion is expected to launch beyond an initial group of beta users later in September.Vaughan believes Tierion has so far received positive feedback on its technology, citing tweets or remarks from bitcoin core developers Jeff Garzik and Peter Todd.Described as a protocol for recording data on the blockchain, Chainpoint secures records every 10 minutes by taking a hash of each record and building a merkle tree, the root of which is placed in a transaction on the bitcoin blockchain.\"We use the information of each path to build a blockchain receipt and that contains all the information that you need to verify that that piece of data,\" Vaughan explained.The company contends that by taking this approach to securing records on the blockchain, it can record \"tens of millions\" of records on the ledger at a cost of 3 cents every 10 minutes.The blockchain will only store records of the data not records directly, a function Vaughan said would be completed using Microsoft\u0027s enterprise cloud computing platform Azure.Still, he emphasized that the intent is for the protocol to become more broadly useful other firms seeking to offer similar services.\"We want this to become a standard for anyone who is going to be creating a record of data. Anyone who is doing that with an application, we think that Chainpoint can be adapted for a wide variety of applications,\" he said.As for its business model, Vaughan indicated that Tierion will position itself as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) firm for anyone that wants to collect data and secure records against the bitcoin blockchain.Among its early prospective customers, Vaughan said, is a private equity fund that is seeking to organize its compliance data and a tax filing software firm that could blockchain records as a way to verify its communications with the IRS.As for a marketing strategy, Vaughan said that Tierion is seeking to partner with firms that rely on strong recordkeeping but that may not be familiar with blockchain technology and its potential benefits.\"There are lots of companies that make legal claims, accounting software, those companies are not clamoring to integrate the blockchain,\" Vaughan said. \"We\u0027re hoping the ability to create data without needing to rely on a third party will be of interest of them and they\u0027ll start to use our API and bake it into their software.\"Vaughan indicated that Tierion took particular emphasis with its user interface, suggesting that if users can \"make a contact form on a website\" they will be able to use its software.Tierion is currently bootstrapped with a team of two employees.Records image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Technology, News, Connecticut, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 3, 2015 at 8:48 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2015/09/03/ubs-sheds-new-light-on-blockchain-experimentation/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/dxD1bpmzciuKWHUx4fwie4pXG_Y\u003d/570x397/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/W6LN73NGHVB6ZMO3ZXW7DDDYPQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"UBS Sheds New Light on Blockchain Experimentation","INTRO":"Researchers at the London innovation lab of Swiss banking giant UBS are developing a new blockchain implementation for transaction settlement.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Researchers at a UK innovation lab operated by Swiss banking giant UBS are developing a blockchain implementation for settling transactions.As reported by Financial News, the lab, opened earlier this year, is currently at work on a cryptocurrency that would be \"linked to real-world currencies and connected to central bank accounts\".

Previous entries have spotlighted the technology\u0027s applications for remittances and among merchants.Elsewhere, the podcast discussed trends in finance including peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding and mobile payments, while focusing on the financial habits of millennials.Notably, Terry and fellow analyst Ryan Nash chose to describe this demographic as credit card and debt averse, stating that they believes these consumers better understand the cost of financial products, including the transaction fees associated with their use.The podcast found Terry addressing various questions about bitcoin as an implementation of blockchain technology as well, though his conclusions as to the viability of this application were markedly more negative.Terry indicated that he believes the adoption of bitcoin as a currency has been held back by its fluctuating price against fiat currencies.\"The volatility around bitcoin scares a lot of people, it was great in those periods when bitcoin only seemed to go up,\" he said. \"It\u0027s gone up, it\u0027s gone down and it\u0027s gone up.

Regardless, Lingham continues to be fascinated by bitcoin.In fact, it\u0027s fair to say his personal fascination with the digital currency led to Gyft offering it as a payment option in the first place.Lingham told CoinDesk:Lingham – a serial Internet entrepreneur – also noted bitcoin integration had acted as a catalyst for the company\u0027s growth, after the its decision to do so received a significant amount of media attention.\"So we rode out the bitcoin bandwagon for at least a year throughout various hype cycles and so a lot of people adopted bitcoin and they used Gyft ... and we became the de-facto standard for bitcoin usage,\" he added.Despite having a front seat to bitcoin being used in payments, Lingham doesn\u0027t see bitcoin as a currency – at least not yet.\"The reason for this is its just not stable and you can\u0027t price things in the currency ... right now it\u0027s being used as a medium of exchange, the same way you would use gold,\" he said.According to him, bitcoin will become a currency when its supply and demand are balanced and an industrial use-case is found.\"There\u0027s an unknown amount of demand, but a lot of speculation, so the price fluctuations are pretty intense and because the demand side of the equation is not fully calculated yet, this is why there is so much uncertainty in the bitcoin world,\" he added.Despite his initially pessimistic observations, Lingham seemed bullish when it came to discussing the digital currency\u0027s potential price mark, which he believes will reach $10,000.Lingham said:For Lingham, bitcoin is essentially a commodity – albeit the world\u0027s first digital commodity.Similar to his contemporaries, Lingham\u0027s views on blockchain technology revolve around the notion of using the distributed ledger as a database.Other companies who supply gift card services to merchants, he said, are storing them in their own proprietary databases.\"Why does that have to be the case? Why can\u0027t you store this information publicly in a public ledger or in a public database and so whoever owns that gift card has access to that data and owns that data,\" he added.This option, Lingham noted, would be cheaper, more secure and provide a better user experience.The company sets out to do this with Gyft Block – a gift card trading platform which leverages blockchain technology – created in partnership with API developer Chain.With Gyft Block, Lingham concluded, the company is showing how a neutral third party such as the blockchain can be used to track \"sensitive and financial data\".Vinny Lingham is speaking at Consensus 2015 in New York.

When you factor in the overhead and time spent processing check payments, their actual cost is about $8 per check, not including losses due to human error and fraud.All told, legacy payment systems are costing global businesses $550bn a year in direct expenses and inefficiencies.Instead of losing funds to a leaky payment system, that’s money that could be used to create more jobs, build better products and invest back into the economy.This potentially deadly combo of aging technology and mounting costs represents a once-in-a-century opportunity for businesses to modernize the way they pay each other, or risk joining the graveyard of corporate dinosaurs that couldn’t compete in the 21st century.There’s a lot of money on the table for companies that switch to digital – $57B in net cost savings globally each year, according to Goldman Sachs’ research.Although many Fortune 500 companies operate their payments on legacy systems that are the embarrassment of their IT staff, the ones that hold out the longest actually stand to see the most benefit from switching to digital.Just as some third-world countries skipped over landline telephones and went straight to cellular, companies that resisted pre-Internet EFT and other proprietary systems can leapfrog straight to digital systems that are optimized for today’s Internet and mobile infrastructure.They can even take advantage of developments of open, natively digital blockchain technology to slash the cost of payments even further.Wasted money is the elephant in the room with paper checks, but there’s another big problem with legacy payment networks that could do even greater damage in the long run—the inability to track information about payments throughout the supply chain.While organizations typically invest heavily in their ERP and accounting systems, the actual payment itself is usually not connected to these commerce engines.In this era of Big Data, payment systems that can’t provide automated, up-to-date and globally accessible tracking information spread inefficiencies not just to accounts departments, but to all areas of a business.So how can businesses be sure that when they move to digital payments they realize the most cost savings and be able to mine the wealth of data that payments can reveal about their operations?The answer may lie in an open Internet technology you’ve probably never heard of – FSML, or Financial Services Markup Language.Like HTML, FSML is a structured language developed specifically for financial transactions, including eCheck, the digital successor to paper checks.FSML makes it possible for eCheck transactions to carry an unlimited amount of data with them, structured in an open language that can be read and shared between databases and applications.This addresses a key limitation of analog check and legacy automated clearing house (ACH) and electronic funds transfer (EFT) transactions, which limit appended data to a handful of cryptic codes.When a company moves from paper checks to eChecks, they gain an opportunity to append their transactions with rich data that can be synced between ERP, CRM and vendor-facing websites. They can begin to connect the dots between procurement, accounts payable and payments, perhaps discovering inefficiencies, double-payments and even fraud along the way.The eCheck standard with its underlying FSML language is an open technology that businesses can use today to digitize their payments. But this is just the beginning of how open technology can reinvent payments.Looking out into the not-too-distant future, innovative businesses will begin to record their transactions on blockchain-like ledgers, opening up the possibility of completely automated payments between trusted parties and even between machines.Imagine a world where commercial agreements are executed by digital smart contracts. Where the contract and payments are actually tied together by mathematical rules of the blockchain.A commercial term like “Net-30” that obligates a business to pay its invoice in 30 days, could be automatically executed on the day it’s due. Or an agreement to pay on delivery could track that the product actually was received and signed off on as in good order, before payment is released.Escrow systems, third-party agents, and intermediary networks could be rethought to be far more efficient.Or perhaps even more exciting is the ability for business-to-business blockchains to enable digital native payment networks that can instantly settle funds directly between parties.Today, electronic payments are delayed as they batch-process through third party processors and legacy networks, like ACH.With a blockchain, rich data about the payment can be included, it can operate seamlessly across borders, between currencies and can be executed at the speed of light. Say goodbye to “the check is in the mail”.The race is on for businesses to claim their share of the $57bn of cost savings for moving to digital payments. The ones that really think through how to integrate payments with all the moving parts of their business, and embrace open technology standards they can customize and build on, will win the lion’s share.Check and dollar images via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Technology, Checks, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/08/28/usaa-bitcoin-and-blockchain-are-fintech-game-changers/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/1aISEt5yzVkc0qkEhtnt6M3HiyI\u003d/570x320/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/CWMNY6LZ6VG2DCZ3DG7NHH3K4M.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"USAA: Bitcoin and Blockchain Are FinTech Game-Changers","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Vic Pascucci is quick to use the phrase \"game changer\" when talking about bitcoin and blockchain technology.The current USAA head of corporate development and board member at its portfolio startups including Saffron, ID.me and Automatic Labs says he hasn\u0027t seen many technologies that meet this description during his nearly 20 years in the VC sector.Bitcoin and the blockchain, in his opinion, are very different than other areas of interest for the insurance, investing and banking firm, founded in 1922.\"I\u0027ve been working in technology since the early 1990s, I never thought I\u0027d see something as big as the Internet,\" Pascucci, who has been with USAA since he joined as legal counsel for its technology team in 2006, said in interview.However, he suggested he may be more optimistic about the technology\u0027s future than the US military-focused financial firm, which generated $24bn in revenue in 2014 and manages $26.7bn in net worth for its members.Pascucci told CoinDesk:This interest, according to Pascucci, is propelled by how well the financial technology hits on its three core areas of focus – finance, consumer Internet and digital capabilities. \"We look for those convergences that have that synergy,\" he continued.But while there is much speculation as to how USAA could ultimately deploy bitcoin-based services or blockchain technology, Pascucci remained tight lipped about what the team he said based full-time on the blockchain is currently developing.\"We want to be sensitive to how much we expose,\" he said. \"We experiment a lot, and if we come out too early, our members expect to see it. The last thing we want to do is mismanage our users\u0027 expectations, so we want to be sensitive to that.\"Pascucci did hint that the group is working on applications on both the bitcoin blockchain and on private blockchains that would potentially enable the company to track assets and claims and conduct real-time record-keeping.\"There are so many efficiencies we can unlock,\" he added.To date, USAA\u0027s biggest move in the space was its participation in Coinbase\u0027s $75m Series C round, completed in early 2015 – a move he attributed to an early meeting with the company.Pascucci said that, in order to keep pace with emerging technologies, his team makes frequent visits to the West Coast to meet with venture firms and FinTech startups.\"We sat down with [Coinbase co-founder] Fred [Ehrsam], Micky Malka from Ribbit Capital and just had a great conversation about bitcoin and the blockchain and the efficiency it would bring,\" he recalled.But it was the makeup of the bitcoin services firm\u0027s user base that ultimately convinced USAA to make Coinbase one of its estimated 10 to 12 annual deals, where it invests anywhere from $1m to $10m in venture capital.\"We saw an amazing index of USAA members using Coinbase,\" he said. \"We were one of the most active user groups, but we saw our members\u0027 accounts were twice the size and they tended to be twice as active.\"From there, Pascucci said USAA realized it needed to \"move fast\" to better understand the technology, investing because of the combination of market analysis and member association.As for whether it remains interested in subsequent investments in the space, Pascucci was optimistic if non-committal, adding:Right now, Pascucci said USAA is still working to develop a thesis on the technology, and it hasn\u0027t decided where it might be most applicable.Still, Pascucci acknowledged bitcoin and the blockchain could impact how USAA interacts internally, with other financial organizations, with its members and how its members interact with each other.\"It\u0027s that kind of constant balancing act as to where we\u0027re going to see the best benefit for our members and the cost,\" Pascucci said. \"It feels like bitcoin is most advanced but it feels like the enterprise capabilities are so vast, but it could all take time.\"More specifically, Pascucci deflected comments on whether it was pursuing blockchain-based recordkeeping technologies for use in its insurance claims process.Ultimately, Pascucci said USAA will continue to base its decisions on feedback from members, with whom he stressed the firm strives to maintain a dialogue regarding its decisions. Should users be uncomfortable with or unsure about the need for certain features provided by the technology, he suggested any interest could fall by the wayside.\"They could surprise us and say \u0027We like the set up the way it is,\u0027 he said. \"We see the capabilities and the power, but the members are going to tell us what they like.\"Pascucci suggested regulatory uncertainty surrounding the technology was another factor, citing discussion as to whether bitcoin is best considered a currency or security.\"My take on that is that the level of understanding has to be consistent with regulations,\" he continued. \"The regulations weren\u0027t designed for these types of things.\"As for the ongoing work at its facilities, Pascucci was less specific with details, noting that 90% of his team is working on the firm\u0027s venture arm and tracking emerging trends.\"I have a team of nine that works for me,\" Pascucci explained. \"Zach Gibson, our chief innovation officer, he has the tech resources to incubate ideas, they have a full team of people that\u0027s exploring disruptive technologies and we\u0027re working closely with that team.\"Pascucci said USAA has an equally strong interest in technologies that enable communication with its members, given that it has no physical branches. Cybersecurity, storage, networking and analytics also remain top priorities in the innovation lab.Cost, he suggested, would also be a factor in the company\u0027s decisions, and that ultimately any solution it pursues would need to balance expenditure with benefit.Pascucci concluded:Vic Pascucci is speaking at Consensus 2015 in New York.

For example, while Barclays and UBS are known to be experimenting with Ethereum, neither disclosed exactly how they are seeking to use the decentralized application platform.Blockstack.io, however, provided a deeper dive into its technology, describing its solution as a \"private, isolated blockchain\" with access to core \"blockchain functionality\" through APIs.The platform provides four functions, according to the team: a private ledger based on Bitcoin Core and optimized for high transaction volume; asset issuance to represent real-world assets; transaction management that allows users to describe transaction flows between parties; and multi-signature wallet security.\"Using these functions, a financial institution can model existing work flows in the lifecycle of common transactions,\" the company explained.While Shiau said it would consider adding support for other blockchains to its solution, he indicated that the bitcoin blockchain remains the best option for clients today.\"Bitcoin Core is proven software and we know that it works and we want to be able to take advantage of the improvements in the bitcoin ecosystem,\" he continued, calling it is the most \"robust and reliable\" blockchain to date.The firm\u0027s existing experience with bitcoin, he said, would further enable Blockstack.io to update client blockchains with the best innovations from bitcoin:Shiau also went on to address a lingering question in the bitcoin ecosystem, whether it\u0027s best to consider private blockchains as intranets, or private versions of a public good like the Internet that will eventually be replaced as users become more comfortable with the technology.For now, Shiau said he is unsure if private blockchains will want to connect with each other or with a public blockchain, like bitcoin. Ultimately, however, he suggested both \"flavors\" of the technology offer advantages. While bitcoin boasts security, he said private blockchains offer faster transaction times.\"The bitcoin network has its value, it allows you to exchange value in a trustless environment without counterparty risk. That was the original purpose in the paper, and to the extent that people want that, there is value in that,\" he continued.He suggested the sidechains project, currently being spearheaded by Blockstream, could increase bitcoin\u0027s functionality, but just as easily be replicated on other distributed ledger systems.Equally, Shiau said he sees value in permissioned distributed ledgers, cautioning that the systems are not mutually exclusive.\"You can imagine an exchange where commodities are traded, and an equity exchange, they might want to connect. You can imagine a world where these private isolated chains can talk to each other, because there have these different assets,\" he said, concluding:Downtown buildings image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, Wall Street, Technology, Companies, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Aug 27, 2015 at 9:42 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/08/18/filament-nets-5-million-for-blockchain-based-internet-of-things-hardware/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Fd-Nut1aYHkPYh8eTBLCkAxtPFc\u003d/570x404/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/W4SY3AEN25CZRD5W3DDSZ3EHP4.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Filament Nets $5 Million for Blockchain-Based Internet of Things Hardware","INTRO":"Filament, a blockchain-based tech provider for the Internet of Things, has raised $5m from Samsung Ventures and Verizon Ventures, among others.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Filament has raised $5m in Series A funding led by Bullpen Capital and including contributions from Verizon Ventures and Samsung Ventures.The decision by Samsung Ventures, the capital arm of consumer electronics giant Samsung, marks its first public investment in a blockchain industry firm and notably follows its participation in IBM\u0027s blockchain proof of concept ADEPT.Announced in January, ADEPT used the bitcoin and Ethereum networks to enable devices to communicate as part of a wider transition toward connected consumer devices known as the Internet of Things (IoT).Co-founder and CEO Eric Jennings framed Filament as a decentralized IoT software stack that uses the bitcoin blockchain to enable devices to hold unique identities on a public ledger. By creating a smart device directory, he said, Filament\u0027s IoT devices will be able to securely communicate, execute smart contracts and send microtransactions.Given this vision, Jennings sees his project as similar in ethos to ADEPT, even though it will target the industrial market, enabling large firms in industries such as oil, gas, manufacturing and agriculture to unlock new efficiencies.Jennings told CoinDesk:Filament will seek to market two hardware units: the Filament Tap, a sensor device that allows devices to communicate with phones, tablets and computers at distances of 10 miles, and the Filament Patch which extends the capabilities of the technology to custom hardware projects.By leveraging its blockchain-based technology stack, Filament said enterprise companies can better manage physical mining operations or water flows over agricultural fields without relying on centralized cloud alternatives or pen-and-paper methods that result in human inefficiencies.Founded in 2012, Filament was originally conceived as Scout, a wireless home security system built on mesh networking, before rebranding as Pinocc.io. After being accepted into the Techstars incubator last October, the company reemerged as Filament with a new focus on industrial use cases for connected devices.Crosslink Capital, Digital Currency Group, Haystack, Working Lab Capital and Techstars were also part of the Series A fundraising. With the funds, Jennings said Filament aims to scale its team from 15 to 30 employees, as it moves toward rolling out its hardware devices in Q4 2015.Behind this technology, Filament boasts the inventor of the communications protocol Jabber/XMPP Jeremie Miller as its CTO. Launched in 1999, Jabber was an open standard alternative to chat applications such as AOL Instant Messenger.Support for the protocol was eventually adopted to varying degrees by Facebook, Google and Microsoft, a success Filament aims to replicate with its platform.\"The lesson is that decentralized systems are more valuable to the company and the people that use them,\" Jennings explained. \"That’s the ethos we’ve learned, that decentralized systems with more equal footing between the users tend to be more valuable.\"Filament\u0027s thesis is based on seeking to unlock how a similar platform can be used to enable decentralized communications between connected devices, a vision Jennings argues is based in business logic rather than any ideological support.\"Decentralized isn\u0027t a tinfoil hat position,\" Jennings argued. \"Decentralized systems are more valuable to people that interact with them... It\u0027s a good reminder. \u0027Why it does it matter using the blockchain?\u0027 because it can make systems more powerful and more valuable.\"Filament\u0027s technology stack will use five layers – blockname, telehash, smart contracts, pennybank and BitTorrent. Filament\u0027s sensors rely on the first three in order to operate, while the final two protocols are optional for clients.The Filament Tap is the smallest unit offered by the company, which it aims to sell in units of 10 to those interested in testing the product\u0027s capabilities.Among the products benefits, according to Jennings is ease of use. \"Taps have sensors so they can be attached to devices in an office space and be up and running in 20 minutes. They can start monitoring infrastructure immediately,\" he said.Each device will be equipped with the ability to handle communications on all five of the company\u0027s protocols. Using blockname, devices are able to create a unique identifiers which are stored in a part of the device\u0027s embedded chip and recorded on the blockchain. Telehash, in turn, provides end-to-end encrypted communications and BitTorrent enables file sharing.\"In the blockchain, when the devices are manufactured, we store the unique hash of a network address. When we manufacture our devices, we create a unique global IP address and in blockname, we store where those hashes can be resolved,\" Jennings said. \"If device A wants to talk to device B, blockname will tell them how.\"Payment for the devices\u0027 use is handled by smart contracts, which allows the terms of payment and access to the device to be controlled programmatically.Jennings sought to stress that Filament\u0027s products and technology are blockchain agnostic, but they currently use the bitcoin blockchain. Jennings said data for contracts is stored using the 40 bytes of extra data added to bitcoin transactions.Jennings described Filament\u0027s PATCH product as the \"brain of the Tap\", which would be integrated into other hardware devices and stacks but use the company\u0027s technology.Of the five planned parts of the company\u0027s stack, Jennings acknowledges that IoT micropayments, or the ability of devices to transact, remains in the earliest stages.Filament will use a bitcoin-based protocol that it has developed called Pennybank for microtransactions on its platform, in part because of its unique needs. \"Our devices are not high power and they aren’t always online, so in order to allow these devices to transact, they can’t be a lightweight wallet,\" Jennings said.Effectively, Jennings said Pennybank creates an escrow service between two devices, allowing them to settle transactions when they are connected online.Jennings suggested early talks with clients lead him to believe enterprise firms want to pay on an ongoing, real-time basis. Here again, he suggested the only way to satisfy this market demand was by using blockchain technology.The ability for Filament devices to transact, he said, is also crucial to ensuring the network remains viable even if the company closes. Further, he suggested it would open up new opportunities for clients, who could sell their device data to others in a similar way.\"That’s the beauty of bitcoin and the blockchain in a lot of ways, you can’t go and change things, it’s established and locked in. If clients ask \u0027Are you going to be around in a year or two?\u0027, having the ability to answer that is a big sales benefit,\" he said.Still, Jennings sees Filament\u0027s role in the IoT ecosystem as connecting devices and parties but owning the smart contracts by which they interact.He concluded:Internet of Things image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"investment, Venture Capital, Blockchain Technology, startups, Technology, Internet of Things, Samsung, Funding, News, Digital Currency Group, Companies, investors, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Aug 18, 2015 at 11:30 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/08/17/microsofts-john-farmer-bitcoin-is-blockchains-least-interesting-app/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/iWJkWweYLv2y8GUgwn6B3XjwaGM\u003d/570x321/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/LNOO4LEVQ5FU7NOL6H6YUUBZC4.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Microsoft\u0027s John Farmer: Bitcoin is Blockchain\u0027s Least Interesting App","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"With the sound of New York traffic raging noisily in the background, former pro-baseball player John Paul Farmer tells me he’s intent on finding new ways in which technology can make a difference to people’s lives. Lucky for him, he has the weight of Microsoft behind him.Farmer, an ex-shortstop for the Los Angeles Dodgers, joined the tech giant last year, having spent four years working as a senior advisor for innovation at the White House.Joining a large company wasn’t really on his agenda – he considered joining a startup or even setting up his own company – but this all changed after he met with Microsoft’s general counsel Brad Smith and corporate vice president Dan’l Lewin.“Dan’l and Brad had this vision for how Microsoft – obviously a gigantic global company with billions of users – could engage in a really local way on civic issues. So, how could we use technology to address social problems?” he explained.Farmer said it struck him as a really important mission, especially for such a big company with a colossal reach.“The more I talked to them, the more I really came to believe that they had the right approach in mind.”He became the company’s director of technology and civic innovation, and now heads up a team of 10 people in New York.Farmer doesn\u0027t have much time for bitcoin, the currency. “I find that to be the least interesting part of what bitcoin and the blockchain can do,” he explained.He concedes cryptocurrency must be given some praise for bringing blockchain tech into the limelight, but he doesn’t spend much time thinking about that particular application of the technology.Farmer said, while blockchain technology has the potential to make a real difference in the developing world – helping the unbanked become banked for the first time – his interests lie closer to home.He explained that, recently, he heard 25% of African-Americans – around 10 million people – don’t have a government-issued identification card.“That is amazing, and there are states here that require you to show your identification card in order to vote. So the ability for these technologies to empower and enfranchise the disenfranchised here in the US and in the UK and in other developed countries, I think is also really really powerful.”Farmer and his team work with a wide variety of sectors, including governments, academics, startups, for-profits, nonprofits and simply “anyone who wants to solve problems”.He described the team’s work as being threefold: to participate, partner and produce.Firstly, they utilise their presence in New York, making sure they’re involved in and aware of the goings-on in the community so they can identify ongoing issues and work on solutions.In terms of developing partnerships to work on these solutions, Farmer said his team has been reaching out to other organisations, groups and individuals that are working on “interesting applications of technology”. Microsoft seeks to work with these people to bring their ideas to fruition.Farmer has been in talks with the team over at MIT Media Labs’ Digital Currency Initiative, which is headed by his former White House colleague Brian Forde. For the time being, they\u0027re still just engaging in early talks, but Farmer believes it\u0027s “highly likely” the two groups will work together on projects.He’s keen not to rushing into anything, taking his time to make sure his team forms partnerships with the right groups and projects within the blockchain space.“Obviously there are a lot of people doing a lot of things to do with the blockchain, but we’re trying to find the ones where there\u0027s a good fit and it makes sense, both for them and for us,” he explained.In terms of what the team is producing, it’s very much still in the R\u0026D stage when it comes to solutions based on blockchain technology. But any promising ideas will be trialled both within the company and within communities.“We produce prototypes of what could exist and then we share those with the community externally, but also internally to the various product groups of Microsoft, to help those product groups imagine what could happen and what could really benefit end users,\" Farmer said.Regardless of how much, or little, progress Farmer’s team has made in the blockchain space, he knows his counterparts on other teams within Microsoft have made some real headway.“They\u0027re all further along than we are in terms of how they are using blockchain and how they\u0027re thinking about integrating it. But our mission as a team within the company is very different. We\u0027re specifically focused on how to use it for social good,” he added.The company director said he’s been highly impressed by the innovation that has taken place in the blockchain arena so far and the calibre of people involved.There are people in the space that he knows from the traditional finance world (Farmer previously held roles at Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse) as well as highly accomplished academics, developers and \"hardcore technologists\".“It\u0027s not one-sided, it\u0027s not just one-dimensional, it actually bringing together people with a variety of perspectives and experiences, and that\u0027s going to drive us all forward that much faster,” he concluded.Microsoft image via pio3 / Shutterstock.com","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Microsoft, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Aug 17, 2015 at 9:41 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/08/13/itbit-reveals-bankchain-project-wont-use-bitcoin/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/hIOdFzuutomVkLMkpHx782fKOOY\u003d/570x378/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/V5GGPGNUQVEMXDR4DYHXH4Q4XE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"ItBit Reveals Bankchain Project Won\u0027t Use Bitcoin","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"ItBit has revealed new details about its formerly top-secret Bankchain project, a private consensus-based ledger system aimed at appealing to enterprise financial institutions.With the formal unveiling, the New York-based bitcoin exchange has joined the number of blockchain firms seeking to compete for the attention of banks that want to utilize the efficiencies of distributed databases without using bitcoin or its blockchain.In a new interview, Steve Wager, head of global operations for itBit, spoke at length about the project, rumors of which first began surfacing in late July. Speculation was followed by confirmation from the exchange it would host a private, one-day summit in New York to promote its release.Called the Bankchain Discovery Summit, Wager said the event drew 100 participants from 25 leading financial institutions, including custodians, broker-dealers and those providing infrastructure support for the industry.Wager said that itBit built Bankchain using insight from its team\u0027s history in the finance industry and input from Wall Street firms, who favor the idea of using a distributed ledger to tokenize existing assets.Wager told CoinDesk:As for market fit, Wager said Bankchain will seek to appeal to institutions seeking to leverage the blockchain for clearing, settlement and custody, though he was also scant in providing details as to any partnerships itBit has secured.\"We\u0027ve actually been focused on the custodian and broker-dealer community,\" he continued. \"We\u0027ve had over 200 unique meetings in New York and California, where they have expressed interest in clearing and custody.\"One of the older bitcoin exchanges in the ecosystem, itBit was also one of the first to raise a significant amount of venture capital, garnering $3.25m in late 2013 from investors including Canaan Partners, Liberty City Ventures and RRE Ventures then as a Singapore-based firm.ItBit most recently finalized a $25m Series A in May, at which time it relocated its headquarters to New York.Today, Bankchain remains in its infancy, with the platform being operated and used solely by itBit. Wager noted that Bankchain is being used for itBit\u0027s cash markets and that nodes on the Bankchain network are currently \"view-only\", meaning it is not yet accepting outside participants, as in the Ripple network.Wager sought to underscore that Bankchain is \"inspired by\" bitcoin\u0027s blockchain, but that it is a consensus-based alternative system. Upon release, he said itBit has no plans to open source the code or distribute it outside of participants in the network.Moving forward, Wager said Bankchain\u0027s underlying technology is currently being subject to peer academic review. Further, he asserted that itBit has received a \"soft commitment\" from as many as 15 firms that are considering implementing the technology.Still, he cautioned that itBit\u0027s potential clients are still learning about the technology, emphasizing the need for a potentially lengthy education phase. In addition, he said, itBit is still determining how it would go about integrating with enterprise clients.Wager expects any expansion of the project to be delayed until the end of 2015 or early 2016.\"Eventually down the road, we\u0027re also looking at running our exchange through it, so we\u0027ll be able to use the consensus mechanism and then we\u0027ll be able to issue tokens,\" he explained.While typically thought of as a bitcoin exchange, Wager said that itBit sees itself as capable of being competitive across multiple verticals.\"We have our cash bitcoin exchange, we\u0027ve rolled out an over-the-counter (OTC) marketplace and within our global community we will be offering a lending product for bitcoin,\" Wager said.As itBit has the ability to act as a custodian for both fiat and bitcoin-denominated funds, Wager said he foresees this being broadly useful, allowing it to serve as a repository for assets held in retirement or other investment accounts.Bankchain, however, aims to underlie all of itBit\u0027s services.\"People who interact with Bankchain will have a modular selection of capabilities that they\u0027ll be able to chose from whether its trading, clearing and settlement or custody,\" he continued. \"We believe that the tying in of different business models will increase our competitiveness in the bitcoin space.\"Wager further characterized Bankchain as being capable of satisfying the growing demand for settlement solutions on Wall Street, adding:When asked how itBit will handle market competition in New York given its newcomer status to the state, Wager was quick to note that the exchange is the only entity currently operating with a New York banking charter, though rival Gemini has applied.As such, he argues that itBit will be able to use this licensure to improve its Bankchain service, which in addition to tokenizing assets, will also allow these digital assets to be converted into US dollars.\"Moving assets across the chain is relatively straightforward,\" Wager continued, \"But being able to settle to US dollars on the back of that is a different situation.\"Wager said that the banking charter allows itBit to \"tie into\" the existing financial structure in the US, and potentially other national financial services, should it seek to expand abroad. He added:\"We can become a member of the national settlement service, and that\u0027s important because of the fact that most of the firms in blockchain tech have not been able to solve the problem in regards to delivery of a tokenized transaction.\"Wager was also quick to note that itBit is likely to benefit from the ongoing issues stemming from New York\u0027s enforcement of the BitLicense, its regulatory scheme for the industry.\"We can continue to service clients in New York state as well as the US,\" he said, noting that other exchanges, including market leaders such as Bitfinex and Kraken, have chosen to avoid the market rather than bear the cost of licensing.Still, while beneficial for itBit\u0027s prospects, Wager was sympathetic to the hurdle the regulation is likely to put in front of those seeking to compete in the ecosystem.He concluded:Additional reporting contributed by Stan Higgins.Top secret image via Shutterstock ","TAGS":"Exchanges, Blockchain Technology, itBit, Bankchain, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Aug 13, 2015 at 10:20 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/08/11/bbva-blockchain-tech-could-replace-centralised-finance-system/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/le5LCoik5ADx2j-gQjCY14vkOHw\u003d/570x379/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/JDX5IRLOJ5CU5GVCKQGSBQCLXA.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BBVA: Blockchain Tech Could Replace Centralised Finance System","INTRO":"Blockchain ledgers can potentially bypass today\u0027s centralised financial infrastructure, according to a report by BBVA Research US.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain technology could be used to bypass today\u0027s centralised financial infrastructure entirely, according to a report by BBVA Research US.The report, titled Blockchain Technology: The Ultimate Disruption in the Financial System notes that the application of blockchain technology would first be useful in the payments space, where it would eradicate the need for any intermediaries and significantly reduce costs for banks.However, decentralised public ledgers could disrupt the financial system as a whole, adds the report. \"Given that the majority of financial assets such as bonds, equities, derivatives and loans are already electronic it may be possible that someday the entire system is replaced by a decentralised structure.\"Touching upon smart contracts, the report also noted how being able to register and trade assets on a decentralised register increases efficiency.It adds:The possibility of a decentralised public ledger replacing the current centralised system, the report says, also comes with various risks and challenges.Firstly, a decentralised system would have to offer the same or a higher level of trust and protection than the current centralised financial structure.For this to happen, the report explains the decentralised system would have to concentrate a \"massive amount\" of computer power and in turn be able to cope with the huge energy consumption required to support it.Furthermore, the decentralised system would also have to deal with legal and regulatory concerns, as well as with matters of national security, such as money laundering, fraud, tax evasion or terrorism.The report notes that digital currencies could also suffer price volatility, which could have sizeable negative effects. \"These shocks could generate systemic risk and severe economic downturns ... in this scenario, monetary policy would not be able to respond effectively if it fails to boost demand among a large share of economic agents that use digital currencies.\"The risks aside, BBVA Compass believes blockchain technology has a bright future ahead. Its report concludes:BBVA Research is the economic research department of BBVA Group, but this is not the first time the global Spanish banking group has entered the crypto arena.BBVA Ventures, the private equity branch of BBVA, participated in Coinbase\u0027s $75m Series C funding round – the biggest investment in a bitcoin company at the time.Just recently, BBVA\u0027s Open Talent competition – a global fintech startup competition – included nine crypto startups in its three regional finals.BBVA Innovation Center also posted an online tutorial to inform consumers on the uses of digital currencies and give them a better idea of where these could be purchased.BBVA mage via Hadrian / Shutterstock.com","TAGS":"Research, Blockchain Technology, startups, Banking, News, BBVA, Companies, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Aug 11, 2015 at 12:15 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/08/07/vitalik-buterin-on-public-and-private-blockchains/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/nx4mirjRHnIvFhAuihg_zX_9J_8\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/YFSTE4T6IJCZHDPAQGNASDFW5Q.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Vitalik Buterin: On Public and Private Blockchains","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Vitalik Buterin is a programmer and writer. He founded Ethereum, a decentralized web 3.0 publishing platform, for which he won the World Technology Award in 2014. In this article, he explores the differences between public and private blockchains and the pros and cons of both.Over the last year, the concept of \u0027private blockchains\u0027 has become very popular in the broader blockchain technology discussion.Essentially, instead of having a fully public and uncontrolled network and state machine secured by cryptoeconomics (eg proof-of-work, proof-of-stake), it is also possible to create a system where access permissions are more tightly controlled, with rights to modify or even read the blockchain state restricted to a few users, while still maintaining many kinds of partial guarantees of authenticity and decentralization that blockchains provide.Such systems have been a primary focus of interest from financial institutions and have, in part, led to a backlash from those who see such developments as either compromising the whole point of decentralization or being a desperate act of dinosaurish middlemen trying to stay relevant (or simply committing the crime of using a blockchain other than bitcoin).However, for those who are in this fight simply because they want to figure out how to best serve humanity, or even pursue the more modest goal of serving their customers, what are the practical differences between the two styles?First, what exactly are the options at hand? To summarize, there are generally three categories of blockchain-like database applications:1. Public blockchainsA public blockchain is a blockchain that anyone in the world can read, anyone in the world can send transactions to and expect to see them included if they are valid, and anyone in the world can participate in the consensus process – the process for determining what blocks get added to the chain and what the current state is.As a substitute for centralized or quasi-centralized trust, public blockchains are secured by cryptoeconomics – the combination of economic incentives and cryptographic verification using mechanisms such as proof of work or proof of stake, following a general principle that the degree to which someone can have an influence in the consensus process is proportional to the quantity of economic resources that they can bring to bear. These blockchains are generally considered to be “fully decentralized”.2. Consortium blockchainsA consortium blockchain is a blockchain where the consensus process is controlled by a pre-selected set of nodes; for example, one might imagine a consortium of 15 financial institutions, each of which operates a node and of which 10 must sign every block in order for the block to be valid.The right to read the blockchain may be public, or restricted to the participants, and there are also hybrid routes such as the root hashes of the blocks being public together with an API that allows members of the public to make a limited number of queries and get back cryptographic proofs of some parts of the blockchain state. These blockchains may be considered “partially decentralized”.3. Fully private blockchainsA fully private blockchain is a blockchain where write permissions are kept centralized to one organization. Read permissions may be public or restricted to an arbitrary extent. Likely applications include database management, auditing, etc internal to a single company, and so public readability may not be necessary in many cases at all, though in other cases public auditability is desired.In general, so far there has been little emphasis on the distinction between consortium blockchains and fully private blockchains, although it is important: the former provides a hybrid between the “low-trust” provided by public blockchains and the “single highly-trusted entity” model of private blockchains, whereas the latter can be more accurately described as a traditional centralized system with a degree of cryptographic auditability attached.However, to some degree there is good reason for the focus on consortium over private: the fundamental value of blockchains in a fully private context, aside from the replicated state machine functionality, is cryptographic authentication.There is no reason to believe that the optimal format of such authentication provision should consist of a series of hash-linked data packets containing Merkle tree roots; generalized zero knowledge proof technology provides a much broader array of exciting possibilities about the kinds of cryptographic assurances that applications can provide their users.In general, I would even argue that generalized zero-knowledge-proofs are, in the corporate financial world, greatly underhyped compared to private blockchains.For now, I will thus focus on the simpler “private versus public” blockchain discussion. In general, the idea that there is “one true way” to be blockchaining is completely wrong headed, and both categories have their own advantages and disadvantages.First, private blockchains. Compared to public blockchains, they have a number of advantages:1. Rule changingThe consortium or company running a private blockchain can easily, if desired, change the rules of a blockchain, revert transactions, modify balances, etc. In some cases, eg national land registries, this functionality is necessary; there is no way a system would be allowed to exist where Dread Pirate Roberts can have legal ownership rights over a plainly visible piece of land, and so an attempt to create a government-uncontrollable land registry would in practice quickly devolve into one that is not recognized by the government itself.Of course, one can argue that one can do this on a public blockchain by giving the government a backdoor key to a contract; the counter-argument to that is that such an approach is essentially a Rube Goldbergian alternative to the more efficient route of having a private blockchain, although there is in turn a partial counter-argument to that that I will describe later.2. Known validatorsThe validators are known, so any risk of a 51% attack arising from some miner collusion in China does not apply.3. Cheaper transactionsTransactions are cheaper, since they only need to be verified by a few nodes that can be trusted to have very high processing power, and do not need to be verified by ten thousand laptops.This is a hugely important concern right now, as public blockchains tend to have transaction fees exceeding $0.01 per tx, but it is important to note that it may change in the long term with scalable blockchain technology that promises to bring public-blockchain costs down to within one or two orders of magnitude of an optimally efficient private blockchain system.4. Well-connected nodesNodes can be trusted to be very well-connected, and faults can quickly be fixed by manual intervention, allowing the use of consensus algorithms which offer finality after much shorter block times.Improvements in public blockchain technology, such as Ethereum 1.0’s uncle concept and later proof of stake, can bring public blockchains much closer to the “instant confirmation” ideal (eg. offering total finality after 15 seconds, rather than 99.9999% finality after two hours as does Bitcoin), but even still private blockchains will always be faster and the latency difference will never disappear as unfortunately the speed of light does not increase by 2x every two years by Moore’s law.5. PrivacyIf read permissions are restricted, private blockchains can provide a greater level of, well, privacy.Given all of this, it may seem like private blockchains are unquestionably a better choice for institutions. However, even in an institutional context, public blockchains still have a lot of value, and in fact this value lies to a substantial degree in the philosophical virtues that advocates of public blockchains have been promoting all along, among the chief of which are freedom, neutrality and openness.The advantages of public blockchains generally fall into two major categories:1. Users protected from developersPublic blockchains provide a way to protect the users of an application from the developers, establishing that there are certain things that even the developers of an application have no authority to do. From a naive standpoint, it may be hard to understand why an application developer would want to voluntarily give up power and hamstring themselves. However, more advanced economic analysis provides two reasons why, in Thomas Schelling’s words, weakness can be a strength.First, if you explicitly make it harder or impossible for yourself to do certain things, then others will be more likely to trust you and engage in interactions with you, as they are confident that those things are less likely to happen to them.Second, if you personally are being coerced or pressured by another entity, then saying “I have no power to do this even if I wanted to” is an important bargaining chip, as it discourages that entity from trying to compel you to do it. A major category of pressure or coercion that application developers are at risk of is that by governments, so “censorship resistance” ties strongly into this kind of argument.2. Network effectsPublic blockchains are open, and therefore are likely to be used by very many entities and gain some network effects. To give a particular example, consider the case of domain name escrow.Currently, if A wants to sell a domain to B, there is the standard counterparty risk problem that needs to be resolved: if A sends first, B may not send the money, and if B sends first then A might not send the domain.To solve this problem, we have centralized escrow intermediaries, but these charge fees of three to six percent. However, if we have a domain name system on a blockchain, and a currency on the same blockchain, then we can cut costs to near-zero with a smart contract: A can send the domain to a program which immediately sends it to the first person to send the program money, and the program is trusted because it runs on a public blockchain.Note that in order for this to work efficiently, two completely heterogeneous asset classes from completely different industries must be on the same database – not a situation which can easily happen with private ledgers.Another similar example in this category is land registries and title insurance, although it is important to note that another route to interoperability is to have a private chain that the public chain can verify, btcrelay-style, and perform transactions cross-chain.In some cases, these advantages are unneeded, but in others they are quite powerful – powerful enough to be worth 3x longer confirmation times and paying $0.03 for a transaction (or, once scalability technology comes into play, $0.0003 for a transaction).Note that by creating privately administered smart contracts on public blockchains, or cross-chain exchange layers between public and private blockchains, one can achieve many kinds of hybrid combinations of these properties.The solution that is optimal for a particular industry depends very heavily on what your exact industry is. In some cases, public is clearly better; in others, some degree of private control is simply necessary.As is often the case in the real world, it depends.This article was first published on the Ethereum blog and has been republished here with permission.Private sign and public sign images via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Technology, Ethereum, Distributed Ledger Technology, Features, Technology News, Cryptocurrency 2.0, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Aug 7, 2015 at 2:13 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/08/05/7-politicians-in-support-of-bitcoin-and-blockchain-tech/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/vC6uuzraFXFLZba6h44wqNlbCeU\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/BJ2WC3LDENHTPPII4FBO5LE66E.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"7 Politicians in Support of Bitcoin and Blockchain Tech","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"With FinTech playing an increasing role in global affairs, it is perhaps not surprising that some governments and politicians are embracing innovations such as blockchain technology.Just yesterday, CoinDesk reported Blockchain CEO Peter Smith was one of the 31 executives to participate in a trade delegation led by the UK\u0027s Prime Minister David Cameron to promote FinTech businesses in Southeast Asia.This, however, is not the first time bitcoin and politics have come face to face.Here\u0027s a list of some of the most high profile politicians to embrace bitcoin and blockchain technology to date.The US congressman first caught the attention of the digital currency community in March last year when he issued a satirical response to policy makers wanting to ban bitcoin.In a move that would see him gain significant following among bitcoin enthusiasts, Polis argued that the US dollar should be banned, not the cryptocurrency.During an interview with CoinDesk, he confirmed he would work to wade off the government\u0027s potential attempts to skirt bitcoin growth whilst in Congress.He added: \"If there was an agency that reacted in an irrationally negative way to digital currencies, I would be happy to rally support [in Congress] to restrict their funding.\"In July last year, Dan Elder – running for the US House in the state of Missouri – became the first Congressional candidate in the United States to fund his campaign solely in bitcoin.Speaking to CoinDesk, Elder highlighted the digital currency\u0027s potential, noting it was a unique way of bringing integrity back to the notion of money.The Air National Guard veteran and IT specialist said he saw bitcoin as a potential competitor against fiat, traditional centralised banking and the risky financial sector.\"I\u0027m accepting BTC donations to solely fund my campaign to take a stance against the Federal Reserve and its policies, which have weakened the US dollar.\"Across the pond, British politician George Galloway, Mayoral candidate for London, publicly announced his plans to leverage blockchain technology to track the Mayor of London\u0027s expenditure in a bid for greater transparency.Galloway is pledging to run the capital\u0027s £17bn ($26.4bn) budget on MayorsChain; a blockchain-based public expenditure management system.The eccentric candidate said on his funding page:Andrew Hemingway, a Republican running for Governor in New Hampshire, has also proposed the use of blockchain tech during elections.Hemingway spoke about the potential of distributed ledger technologies for voting after a Twitter follower asked about his views on voting IDs – a law that requires voters to have some form of identification before voting or receiving an election ballot.2) @KrisWilliams81 we could apply the #bitcoin block chain algorithm to help solve this problem. Use the principle of distributed consensus — Andrew Hemingway (@AndrewHemingway) July 10, 2014Elsewhere, blockchain tech is also being eyed by parties in an attempt to transform the way in which voting takes place. Denmark\u0027s Liberal Alliance announced it was using blockchain tech for an internal vote at the party\u0027s annual meeting in Copenhagen.Gulnar Hasnain, a Green Party candidate running for Vauxhall, a district in Central London, became the first mainstream political candidate to accept bitcoin in the UK earlier this year.Hoping to raise £1,000, Hasnain was taking donations from individuals using Onename and micro-tipping tool ChangeTip.In an interview with CoinDesk, Hasnain noted she would like to draw attention to the positive aspects of blockchain technology and its potential to “transform democracy worldwide”, adding there were many similarities between her party and the principles of distributed ledger technologies.“Surprisingly, the Green Party is vocal on the same issues as the bitcoin movement – more decentralised power, smaller government, a need for a shift in the concentration of power in the banking system and a more inclusive society.”Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, who officially announced his bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, started to accept bitcoin donations in April this year.Describing him as a \"firebrand libertarian\", The Washington Post also dubbed his decision to accept donations in the digital currency a \"genius political move\".The move – which sparked a media frenzy – came as a surprise to many as the candidate had previously shown a degree of skepticism about the digital currency.During a TechCrunch panel earlier this year, Paul said he was \"an outlier\" on \"the bitcoin things\".Paul confirmed his skepticism in a Bloomberg News report, saying: \"I\u0027ve been fascinated by the concept of it, but I never would have purchased it myself. I\u0027m just a little bit skeptical.\"Bitcoin welcomed another supporter from the political sphere just last month.US presidential candidate Rick Perry shared his stance on bitcoin during an interview with The New York Observer, in which he stated his support for \"regulatory breathing room\" for digital currencies such as bitcoin.While all the above politicians have talked the talk, we\u0027re yet to see whether they will walk the walk – will they take a pro-bitcoin or pro-blockchain stance if they gain a position of power? Or will all their encouraging remarks turn out to merely be one big publicity stunt?

For example, among the presenters were Swarm community manager Caterina Rindi and Silvio Tavares, CEO of the credit card industry group the CardLinx Association, who spoke about distributed ledgers from the viewpoints of innovators and incumbents, respectively.Keynote 2015 chairman Moe Levin perhaps best expressed the desired and ultimate outcome of the event in his opening address, remarking:Despite the difference in backgrounds, there was strong consensus in both camps that the blockchain will have a substantial impact, in some areas more than others.One of the most cited was the cross-border payments industry, an opinion that was put forth by speakers as diverse as Blockchain Capital partner Brock Pierce and Karla Friede, CEO of accounts payable solutions provider Nvoicepay.\"I believe cross-border payments will be the beachhead for bitcoin,\" Friede said. \"This sector has long been a source of exorbitant bank-based profits, making it a perfect starting point for distributed ledgers. In the world of foreign exchange, banks are making 150-300 basis points, those are extraordinarily high fees.\"This opinion was echoed by Pierce, who cited the sector as the one he believes will experience the most growth in the next 12–24 months.Elsewhere, the event\u0027s venue seemed intent on emphasizing the difficulties of even established technologies at achieving functionality, as fire alarms, light malfunctions and microphone hiccups interrupted conversations almost as frequently as speakers referenced technical issues with bitcoin and the blockchain.Organizers attributed the issues to a last-minute venue change for the conference.Given Keynote\u0027s goals and roots in the biannual North American Bitcoin Conference, the event gave first deference to speakers representing companies seeking to bring blockchain innovations to the FinTech sector.Swarm\u0027s Rindi, for example, opened the day\u0027s events by explaining blockchains in layman\u0027s terms, or in her words, \"without saying ledger, crypto or bitcoin.\" Her conclusion? Blockchains, including bitcoin\u0027s blockchain, are \"unalterable, dynamic, (sometimes public) online feeds, recording time-stamped data.\"She went on to give an overview of how blockchains could impact familiar business models, explaining decentralized e-commerce protocol provider OpenBazaar, decentralized ridesharing startup La\u0027Zooz and shared Wi-Fi provider BitMesh, among other examples.\"We\u0027ll get to that moment where blockchains are all around us. We\u0027ll know how to use them, but not how they work,\" she concluded.Following Rindi was Micah Winkelspecht, CEO of blockchain API specialist Gem, who gave an overview of the history of money. Gold, he suggested, emerged as a common store of value due to certain intrinsic qualities, attributes he argued are analogous to bitcoin.Winkelspecht\u0027s talk excelled when it addressed more current pain points, such as the resistance of banks toward working with bitcoin or its blockchain directly or at least openly.\"Bitcoin\u0027s identity crisis is a lot of people wanted to disrupt banking, and now the banking system is coming into the space,\" Winkelspecht said. \"But, many features bitcoin included are not appealing to large banks.\"Ultimately, however, he concluded that these new entrants will push the overall ecosystem forward.\"For the next few years, we\u0027re going to see a lot of advancements in distributed ledgers will come from the banking system,\" he added. \"Every single bank in the world has at least somebody looking at bitcoin.\"The most interesting new audience in the conversation was from the traditional payments industry, with speakers such as Cardlinx\u0027 Tavares, 2Checkout chief product officer Sean Harper and Nvoicepay\u0027s Friede providing different viewpoints on the technology.Tavares was the earliest and perhaps most bearish on the role of bitcoin as a currency in the online commerce ecosystem.\"The reality is that any technology that seeks to displace or work alongside credit cards has a really high hurdle,\" Tavares said, before outlining what he considers the myths about credit cards that propagate in FinTech.These included that credit cards are not anonymous or low cost, and that credit cards aren\u0027t beneficial for consumers. For example, Tavares outlined how the growing trend of card-linked accounts makes deals delivery easier for businesses.\"You can pay with Apple Pay on a completely anonymized basis by using a token,\" he said, leaving out how in such situations a third party payments firm is privy to information.Later in the afternoon, 2Checkout\u0027s Harper advocated that the audience refrain from writing off bitcoin as a consumer currency due to the chance it could provide cost savings and convenience as the bitcoin network scales.\"The interesting thing to think about is that bitcoin is a very easy analog,\" Harper said, comparing the process to established money-sending services such as Western Union. \"It\u0027s easy to send someone money using bitcoin.\"Harper also emphasized the potential of the next wave of bitcoin payments startups, illustrating how successful companies like Braintree, Square and Stripe have been by making relatively small improvements to the experience for developers or consumers.\"The difference between Square and VeriFone is one of ease of use, but it makes a hell of a difference,\" he said.The most vocal contingent at the conference in their support for bitcoin as a currency were the representatives of the venture capital space, including many who have made prior investments in such startups.Speakers on the investment panel included Blockchain Capital\u0027s Brock Pierce, Pantera Capital\u0027s Steve Waterhouse, VC Bill Tai and Cross Pacific Capital\u0027s Marc van der Chijs.While the speakers noted that the blockchain has emerged as a way to cut costs in the back office, Tai spoke to this conclusion most directly.\"Banks are measured on capital ratios and the efficiency of those assets. Blockchain is a supremely efficient way to keep track of your assets and quickly turn them over,\" he said.Waterhouse addressed the rising interest in private blockchains that use bitcoin\u0027s underlying data structure, without the currency token, expressing his belief that activities conducted on any bitcoin alternatives today will eventually be conducted on the protocol.\"Inside your company a printer has an IP address and it can see the Internet, but I can\u0027t see it,\" Waterhouse said. \"It will be similar to that, they\u0027re going to be able to see each other, but they\u0027re hidden to people at other organizations. Regardless of the currency that\u0027s used on one or the other, it will converge.\"Also discussed was whether these enterprise organizations are currently seeking to acquire startups in the blockchain space.\"Banks aren\u0027t looking to buy things yet, they\u0027re doing what they should be doing, getting smart,\" Pierce said.Gyft CEO Vinny Lingham was perhaps the most striking in his opinions, stressing that while there\u0027s \"no right answer\" to the question of whether bitcoin the currency, or bitcoin the decentralized ledger, will prove more successful at spurring innovation.His belief is that while the later presents a better opportunity today, but that the new activity on bitcoin\u0027s ledger could in turn bolster trading of what he called \"the world\u0027s first digital commodity\".Lingham was perhaps most bearish on bitcoin in the short term, a statement given added weight as his company is perhaps the most successful in the ecosystem at reaching consumers.Images via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, payments, Fintech, Keynote, Events, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Aug 4, 2015 at 1:02 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/08/02/eris-coo-private-and-public-blockchains-need-to-co-exist/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/HMyb8RlASsqJSxUp6pDKje5sHqo\u003d/570x293/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/5I7T3LP5AFCURHQ7GNDYWAEXII.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Eris COO: Private and Public Blockchains Need to Co-Exist","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"How seriously should you take a company with a marmot named Doug for a mascot?That has been the subject of debate surrounding Eris Industries and its blockchain solutions platform for some time. Founded in 2014, Eris has evolved to become one of the more novel projects in the blockchain space in terms of its operating thesis, officially launching in December with a goal toward a \"1.0 release\" this summer.In its short history, Eris has made a point to trumpeting its belief that bitcoin should be thought of as a shared software database, not as a network for sending money or value. In the process, it has successfully highlighted the evolving debate regarding how the technology and its capabilities should be conceptualized and articulated to the public.A focal point of Eris\u0027 view is that the same strong data management provided by the blockchain can be brought to \"virtually any other business process\".Of note is the somewhat antagonistic nature with which Eris has sought to stress its belief that blockchains can exist without bitcoin, meaning they don\u0027t need assets like bitcoin that are tradeable and that have a floating market value. This view has naturally clashed with proponents of bitcoin who are financially incentivized to see its tokens, worth nearly $300 at press time, used more widely.Given the hesitation by major banks toward the perceived regulatory risks of cryptocurrency, Eris has found a growing audience, and according to its claims, a number of business partners willing to use its blockchain tools.Still, Eris COO Preston Byrne argues that this early customer base doesn\u0027t define the project and its goals.He told CoinDesk:In candid conversation following Byrne\u0027s address at American Banker\u0027s Digital Currencies + the Blockchain conference Tuesday, Byrne is more effusive in his praise for bitcoin as a technology. During the conference, he gave a somewhat breathless overview of blockchains and the Eris view on their utility, issuing comments that clashed with those put forth by more long-standing industry advocates.\"We had to differentiate ourselves, but to be honest with you, the public blockchain is an essential component of the private blockchain infrastructure,\" Byrne stated. \"Bitcoin is the world\u0027s best, most resilient data source.\"If Eris\u0027 concept seems unique, its origins are just as unusual. The project was originally produced after a $100,000 bounty was issued by entrepreneur Olivier Janssens on Reddit.Though Eris won the contest by creating a way to decentralize the industry\u0027s leading trade organization, the Bitcoin Foundation, it eventually abandoned its focus on governance.According to Byrne, the big break from the original idea occurred when Eris began exploring smart contracts, agreements between parties that can be executed in code on a blockchain. To date, the most significant advancements in this technology have come from the Ethereum project, though Mirror has touted an unreleased smart contract system for the bitcoin network.The end result, he said, is that Eris wants to frame blockchain technology in the context of Internet architecture.\"If you look at bitcoin as a cash system, it disintermediates the IP of a financial institution. We\u0027re trying to make it possible to disintermediate servers on other types of computer networks where you need that consistency,\" he said.A smart contract for a loan on Eris, he said, might look like a traditional loan, but attached would be a dynamic registry of changes stored away from the blockchain so it could be altered more dynamically.\"With a blockchain, the problem is you can\u0027t go back and erase something and block something out. The only way you can do that is making sure that the blockchain has a directory in it and if you refer to it at any time,\" he continued.Byrne\u0027s view is that Eris is an attempt to turn an entire blockchain into a series of smart contracts, thereby allowing a forward momentum of data collection, history and management, but with the ability to change entries on the chain with more creativity.The company prefers to think of blockchains as \"distributed rulebooks\" that can track changes and write permissions using private keys to achieve more secure data management. Eris\u0027 goal is to create software that enables developers to control who can broadcast transactions, which actions can be performed and how data is referenced on a blockchain.Further, it seeks to enable blockchain structures to have more expansive coding for communication, ultimately using the collection of data into blocks as a way for those involved in the database management to agree on its history.In practice, Byrne says Eris is a set of tools that include Eris:db, a database and smart contract management system, and Eris Worker, which allows developers to build libraries of smart contracts and related applications.However, Byrne indicated that he can\u0027t \"go into specifics\" about the clients Eris claims as users.\"The use cases are far and varied,\" he said. \"This can range from asset trading to something like compliance functions.\"Because of its focus on non-financial applications of the blockchain, however, he said it is less involved with projects that involve asset trading, clearing and settlement.The COO was equally opaque about Eris\u0027 revenue model, which he characterized as \"service-based\".In practice, Byrne proves more moderate in his opinions than pundits such as R3CEV advisor Tim Swanson, though it\u0027s these critical takes on bitcoin\u0027s design that have helped to propel his company to the forefront of industry conversation.Rather than believing that private blockchains will replace bitcoin, Byrne believes bitcoin\u0027s killer use case will come from serving as a trusted way to verify that activities on these private networks are occurring as their owners claim.\"If you ask yourself, \u0027What do blockchains do that nothing else does?\u0027, it\u0027s you have a consistent web server or SQL application with no central server. What does bitcoin do that nothing else does in the blockchain space? It\u0027s the most resilient to destruction and attack,\" he said.These properties, Byrne said, would make a public blockchain like the bitcoin network an inexpensive way for companies to show proof their records have not been tampered with. As for what prompts users of private blockchains to use a public blockchain for this purpose, Byrne also has a clear thesis as well.\"If you combine a private blockchain with a public ledger verification mechanism, what you have is a very inexpensive way to create a data infrastructure without really doing a whole lot of scaling in a classical sense,\" he said, adding:Byrne also discussed the work currently being done by Blockstream, which is broadly seeking to improve the bitcoin protocol through efforts such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, the later of which seeks to allow users to create alternative blockchains which are then interoperable with the bitcoin blockchain.The COO suggested that he believes such projects, while well-funded, are perhaps misguided in their allocation of resources. As a competing system to cash payments, Byrne asserted, bitcoin needs more reasons for mainstream users to fulfill its original value proposition.He spoke out against the idea that everything on a blockchain needs to be tied to a token with independent value, a development he called impractical. That\u0027s not to say he doesn\u0027t see the need for systems that can creatively govern these types of assets.\"If you want a currency to be used you have to have an infrastructure in which it makes sense to use it,\" he continued, suggesting that projects like a distributed Reddit, YouTube or Spotify would prove the most valuable in onboarding new users.He believes that it is this application layer where the network can excel, as opposed to instances where data structures are less reliant on value, such as in corporate environments.Byrne concluded:Image via Sid Kalla for BTCGeek.com","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, Technology, Eris, Distributed Ledger Technology, Companies, Features, Technology News, Cryptocurrency 2.0, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Aug 2, 2015 at 12:00 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2015/07/29/ripple-labs-taps-us-treasury-official-for-advisory-board/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/RVymNnFqL3nXZyF1w8IdwMeymJM\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/IRNYF4Q4QBFWLBJBLSL6YVX4CE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ripple Labs Taps US Treasury Official for Advisory Board","INTRO":"Blockchain startup Ripple Labs has added a former US Treasury Department official to its board of advisors.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ripple Labs has added Michael Barr, a former US Treasury Department official, to its board of advisors.Barrpreviously served as Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions under President Barack Obama and as a special Treasury advisor to former President Bill Clinton.

Those who have photos or videos of crimes, for example the death of Walter Scott at the hands of a South Carolina police officer, could upload their evidence to a decentralised ledger. This evidence could not be tampered with after being uploaded and would help in the face of conflicting eyewitness statements.Another example Barabas presented was using the blockchain to distribute welfare payments.She explained the way the US currently distributes welfare looks very much the same as it did 100 years ago, emphasising it takes a lot of time and costs a lot of money.“Could we use the blockchain as the foundation for a digital payments infrastructure that would be much more efficient [and] cost less money also for the recipient?” Barabas asked.She envisions people being able to receive their welfare payments in a “secure and highly verifiable way” via their mobile phones.Another benefit of this system, Barabas claimed, would be the increased transparency, enabling people to see where exactly the government is spending its money and how it is handling the process.On the subject of governments, she revealed: “We have governments coming to us saying ‘hey, we’re really interested in being proactive about understanding this technology and using it to improve our ability to serve the public’.”Other use cases for blockchain technology were explained by Peter Kirby, CEO of Factom; Anne Kim, senior business operations lead at IDEO; and Ryan Shea, co-founder and CEO of Onename.Kirby explained Factom is examining the use of blockchain technology as a central land title database as well as in voting systems.Kim, however, emphasised IDEO is being careful to not “wedge the technology into a space” that doesn’t necessarily need it.One focus of her company has been to explore how the blockchain can facilitate frictionless transactions, which make it easier to give to charitable causes.She also believes the technology can be used in “democratising decision-making”, with citizens being able to have a say in the projects government funds are channeled to.Shea explained Onename hopes to use blockchain technology to provide official ID for those who do not possess government-issued ID.This has the potential to reduce identity theft as well as enable people to do things they weren’t able to do previously, such as open a bank account, receive government benefits and vote in elections.Farmer rounded off the event with a tribute to 29-year-old Faigy Mayer, founder and CEO of app-development startup Appton.“A lot of you may know her or have known her, she passed away last week and she needed help but didn’t get it. I want to encourage everyone in this room to give help and if you … ever need help, please ask.”Farmer encouraged the attendees to continue thinking about the topics raised during the event and to come up with their own game-changing ideas.“Please leave this room tonight thinking how might you come up with new, creative and innovative ways to use these technologies or other technologies to help people, because that’s what it’s all about,” he concluded.The full recording of the event can be viewed below:Event image via Livestream.","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, Technology, Microsoft, MIT, News, Events, Companies, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jul 28, 2015 at 3:32 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/07/27/accenture-directors-blockchains-must-move-beyond-bitcoin/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/XVpu2tPi2dYO0P6vedGQvxRGW6M\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/P3KOEB7R4VFG3D3TOYYUOC4VNU.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Accenture Directors: Blockchains Must Move Beyond Bitcoin","INTRO":"Two Accenture directors have published a new article suggesting that blockchains must operate without bitcoin to be used by major financial firms.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The idea that bitcoin\u0027s underlying distributed ledger technology can somehow be divorced from bitcoin\u0027s digital currency has been the subject of debate for some time, and was again the focus of a new article written by directors at technology consulting firm Accenture.In a new post for CIO Journal, Accenture managing directors Owen Jeff and Sigrid Seibold offered their thoughts on how institutions can begin leveraging the technology in \"corporate environments\" and \"financial marketplaces\".Jeff and Sigrid asserted that, due to the high cost of paying for transactions that require anonymous consensus, blockchains need to evolve beyond the need for a native token. The critique is notable in its similarity to arguments popularized by the industry\u0027s more critical thought leaders like Tim Swanson and Robert Sams that center on the cost of distributed mining.Jeff and Sigrid wrote:The Accenture representatives suggested one solution could be permissioned distributed blockchains, of which Ripple may be the most notable example.The piece goes on to ask a number of other questions that all hit upon a growing divide in the industry. Bitcoin proponents have long argued that bitcoin – or some cryptocurrency – is essential to the design of a blockchain, as blockchains require a mechanism to incentivize distributed recordkeeping, a process that on the bitcoin network is facilitated by largely anonymous miners.Financial institutions, however, seem interested in exploring alternative private networks for such functionality, or solutions that allow for transaction validators to be known.Accenture has previously made its interest in the technology public, most recently in its appeal for the UK government to more strongly regulate digital currency wallet providers.Obstructing the growth of the technology, the writers said, will also be key decisions by people outside the technology ecosystem. This includes overcoming what they called the lack of regulation surrounding the industry and a lack of clarity as to whether smart contracts would be enforceable by law.Of note given the recent interest by groups like Nasdaq is that the Accenture employees go on to raise the question of how traditional asset classes might be migrated to a blockchain-based network. Jeff and Sigrid, for example, asked how such assets could be given a clear title and when such a blockchain would begin its recordkeeping.Still, the authors were, on the whole, optimistic about the idea of distributed ledgers, concluding that the technology presents an \"enormous opportunity\" for the world\u0027s banks and financial institutions should it overcome these challenges.Ultimately, the writers went so far as to predict a future where those who did not investigate the technology early were ultimately unable to compete, concluding:Image via Flickr","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Technology, Accenture, News, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jul 27, 2015 at 8:45 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/07/27/8-banking-giants-embracing-bitcoin-and-blockchain-tech/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/XKxyD3dWdgjEhbGQlaYGSKCa-Bg\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/MVXQVJGTEFF7THIL7EG7NHRV6A.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"8 Banking Giants Embracing Bitcoin and Blockchain Tech","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In its relative short history, bitcoin – and its underlying technology the blockchain – have captivated thinkers around the world, but not everyone was quick to see the potential.Due in part to its initial billing as a threat to the traditional financial ecosystem, these institutions have perhaps understandably responded with sharp critiques and deep skepticism for the technology.While major institutions found that bitcoin was perhaps problematic as a currency, they seem to increasingly believe that the blockchain, the protocol that manages and facilitates the exchange of bitcoin, offers benefits over their closed database systems.With this in mind, big financial players have begun to come forward by discussing experiments with the bitcoin blockchain and other decentralized ledgers.Though it remains to be seen how these experiments evolve, it\u0027s clear that some of the world\u0027s most famous banks are moving to leverage the technology.Here are eight of the biggest institutions to go public with their interest so far:French bank BNP Paribas is reportedly looking into the possibility of adding bitcoin to one of its currency funds, according to International Business Times.The bank\u0027s possible involvement in the crypto space follows on from the publication of an article by one of its analysts, Johann Palychata. Writing for Quintessence, the bank\u0027s magazine, Palychata noted that the blockchain could either create \"total disruption\" or improve world trading.CoinDesk reached out to the bank for comment but no reply had been received at the time of press.Another one of France’s banks – the third largest in terms of assets – is looking to hire a bitcoin-focused developer.Société Générale (SocGen) posted a job listing on 2nd July for an \"IT developer on bitcoin, blockchains and cryptocurrencies\".According to the advertisement, the role would entail research and development involving both cryptocurrencies and blockchain.Although the advert failed to detail specifics and the bank did not immediately reply to a comment request from CoinDesk, it is believed to be looking to develop in-house software.CoinDesk first learned that Citi had told the UK government to consider creating its own digital currency through a Freedom of Information Request (FOI).Ken Moore, head of Citi Innovation Labs, later told International Business Times that the bank – the world\u0027s eight largest – had been exploring distributed ledger technology for the last few years.Moore also revealed that the bank had built three blockchains and was testing its own cryptocurrency – Citicoin – across them.A sponsor of Consensus, CoinDesk\u0027s first conference, Citi will be revealing additional information about its plans with regards to blockchain tech and digital currencies at the event in New York in September.Swiss investment bank UBS announced it was opening a blockchain technology research lab in one of London\u0027s major financial districts earlier this year.At the time, UBS said the work carried out at the innovation lab would seek to lessen the gap between banking and FinTech so as to determine how traditional banking could grow through innovation.Oliver Bussmann, group CIO at UBS, said in a statement:The news followed the publication of of UBS’ extensive report in March 2014, which outlined the widespread benefits the adoption of bitcoin’s technology could achieve.Just last month, Barclays, the British multinational bank revealed plans to trial bitcoin technology.As previously reported by CoinDesk, the bank signed off on a proof-of-concept following an agreement with Safello, a Sweden-based bitcoin exchange.The aim of the exercise, the bank said, was to investigate how blockchain tech could strengthen the financial services sector.Barclays has also supported crypto companies in the past. In March this year, the bank accepted three startups working on blockchain-related projects on to its Accelerator.A month later, Usama Fayyad, chief data officer at Barclays publicly praised blockchain tech, noting its “transformative” potential at SWIFT Business Forum in London.He stated:Goldman Sachs published a report on digital currencies last year which highlighted the potential of blockchain technology.Although this report initially dismissed the idea of bitcoin as a currency and labelled it a commodity, a report produced by equity research analysts the following year noted that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were part of a \"megatrend\" which could transform the way in which transactions were carried out.More recently, the American multinational investment banking firm, participated in Circle Inc\u0027s $50m investment round – its involvement in the funding sent the media into a reporting frenzy.The Spanish banking giant has been experimenting with blockchain technology.Although its head of research and development is due to reveal more details about its application of the technology at Consensus, we already have some insight into the bank\u0027s opinion on blockchain technology.A report produced by Santander InnoVentures – the bank\u0027s venture capital fund – Oliver Wyman and Anthemis Group said blockchain technologies could decrease infrastructure costs $15-20bn a year by 2022.In interview with CoinDesk, Mariano Belinky, managing director at Santander InnoVentures, said:Anju Patwardhan, chief innovation officer at Standard Chartered, recently took to LinkedIn to share her opinion on the bitcoin blockchain, noting how it could help reduce credit card, money transfers and remittance costs.Like others before her, Patwardhan said bitcoin was a distraction from the distributed ledger\u0027s benefits and it will never become a viable alternative to fiat currencies.Skyline image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Barclays, Goldman Sachs, UBS, Citi, Santander, BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered Bank, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Jul 27, 2015 at 6:26 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/07/24/bitcoin-in-the-headlines-blockchain-drumbeat-grows-louder/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/RLYU6AqVirqv7WXmQsFmlICVBho\u003d/570x398/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/FMSO6H7LFFHO7LEVB3L2QJISUU.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin in the Headlines: Blockchain Drumbeat Grows Louder","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Bitcoin in the Headlines is a weekly analysis of bitcoin media coverage and its impact.Despite setting off to a rather boring start, excitement peaked this week when reports surfaced that two former bitcoin exchange operators had been arrested on anti-money laundering (AML) charges in the US.Elsewhere, bitcoin enthusiasts were yet again confronted with the everlasting – and ever-boring – “chicken and egg” debate regarding the technology\u0027s expected advancement.Unlike last week, however, where mentions of the technology by financial bigwigs and political figures went largely unnoticed, the last few days have been characterized by media validation of \"blockchain technology\", often at the expense of clarity on the complexities surrounding the term.The sheer amount of coverage, however, seems to once again be affected by a case of Summer doldrums.It\u0027s not the first time that bitcoin has seen its reputation suffer as a result of its association with business owners who have been accused of illegal activities. Yet, this week found bitcoin taking the backseat in a high-profile case as major publications omitted prominent mentions of the technology from coverage.Fusion’s Rob Wileexplained how in 2014 hackers had gained access to customer information of tens of millions of JP Morgan accountholders.Why is this relevant? Well, it turns out that authorities in Israel and the US arrested four individuals believed to be connected to the hack earlier this week. “Two of them allegedly ran an illicit bitcoin exchange.”As reported by CoinDesk, the US Attorney’s Office of Southern District of Manhattan stated that Murgio and Lebedev – the exchange’s former operators – were charged with breaking AML laws by not running know-your-customer (KYC) checks on customers. The pair were also accused of being connected to bitcoin ransomware attacks.The news caught the attention of the The Wall Street Journal, but it omitted the bitcoin mention from its headline and subsequently buried it into the article, writing:Bitcoin, however, reentered the spotlight in a piece by the Washington Post titled “Why the Justice Department is going after this Bitcoin exchange”.“The Justice Department has arrested and charged two men in an \u0027underground\u0027 bitcoin exchange that allegedly helped tens of thousands of clients convert nearly $2m worth of the anonymous digital currency – illegally.”The mixed approach, however, may suggest some fatigue in the idea that bitcoin\u0027s association with criminal activities somehow separates it from other payments technologies.Bitcoin, blockchain or both?The media is still struggling with how to frame developments in the industry given that more enterprise institutions are expressing an interest in the capabilities of decentralized ledgers, often using the term \"blockchain\" to voice this enthusiasm.At issue is that often these \"blockchain projects\" use the bitcoin blockchain, which necessitates the use of bitcoin the currency or some other mediating digital token such as those offered by Counterparty and Factom to access the ledger.Such nuances are often lost in coverage, suffering from the lack of consensus on definitions for concepts relating to the early-stage technology.Reuters’ Jemima Kelly wrote a piece with “Betting on blockchain: firm seek fortune in bitcoin’s plumbing” as its headline.Kelly wrote:She continued: “Underlying the controversial web-based ‘cryptocurrency’ is the blockchain – a massive ledger of every bitcoin transaction ever made that is verified and shared by a global network of computers.”Kelly went on to note the endless possibilities offered by blockchain technology.“But the data that can be secured by the blockchain is not restricted to bitcoin transactions,” she said, adding: “Any two parties could use it to exchange other information, including stock deals, legal contracts and property records, within minutes and with no need for a third party to verify it.”Still, the press has shown an increasing willingness to favor a more general definition of \"blockchain\" even in cases when the institution is experimenting with bitcoin\u0027s blockchain.Such was the case when global stock exchange Nasdaq announced it intends to launch more blockchain projects, though it is currently developing a solution with bitcoin\u0027s ledger.Still, there was thoughtful coverage that explored how bitcoin could potentially be used as a currency, as the BBC’s Rose Eveleth attempted to connect the technology to the future of cash payments.\"It\u0027s tempting to forecast the demise of cash,\" she wrote. \"In fact, people have been predicting the end for physical money for nearly 60 years, with the rise of credit cards, contactless payments and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin the death knells have only gotten louder.\"Despite this, Eveleth said that predicting the complete disappearance of cash payments was premature given its continued popularity as well as the inability of alternatives to displace its position as the most widely used payment method.Currently, the author noted, we lack an alternative that “is as convenient, reliable and anonymous” to cash.Peer-to-peer payment systems like PayPal or Venmo, she added \"require apps and accounts, and are still easily traceable\".Psychological attachment to money, the infrastructure available to banks, and the need to create systems that are compatible with a wide range of merchants and consumers, “all make progress away from cash more of a slog than a spring”,\" she added.Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.Drumbeat image via Shutterstock.","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin in the Headlines, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Jul 24, 2015 at 4:34 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/07/24/shocards-quest-to-secure-identity-on-the-blockchain/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/VRUqFY_Ghx31Bszg2ydDrhXg_L4\u003d/570x381/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/VOOUTOVCHRDYTL3Y64SGW5VPNI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"ShoCard\u0027s Quest to Secure Identity on the Blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"It\u0027s perhaps best explained by a car crash.As veteran entrepreneur Armin Ebrahimi tells it in interview, his car was hit by a truck two nights ago. The driver had no insurance, and he had little reason to trust him because of the poor quality of his government-issued driver\u0027s license.\"The picture didn\u0027t really match him. It was difficult to know it\u0027s him, the picture was a little more clean cut. It\u0027s got a PO box address on it, so I took the information I could,\" Ebrahimi explained.Ebrahimi isn\u0027t just any driver. He\u0027s also the CEO of ShoCard, a blockchain technology startup that\u0027s seeking to harness the power of bitcoin\u0027s distributed ledger to solve pain points with authentication such as those in this process. Whether it\u0027s a true story or a convenient anecdote is unclear. Either way, the story cuts to the core of how ShoCard and blockchain technology can intercede and solve problems inherent in such an incident.ShoCard, Ebrahimi asserts, aims to function as a mobile ID that can be verified in real time using a combination of cryptography and the immutability of bitcoin\u0027s ledger. Perhaps most importantly, the company asserts identifying information could be verifiable without requiring users to give up control of their data.Investors are already convinced the company has found a powerful use case for the technology. ShoCard recently raised $1.5m in funding from investors including AME Cloud Ventures and Digital Currency Group.In interview, Ebrahimi provided a deeper dive into the underlying tech of the product he hopes will transform identity on the web, mobile and real world.Ebrahimi told CoinDesk:While top of mind given his recent experience, Ebrahimi sees ShoCard as effective beyond insurance incidents, impacting how people verify themselves to e-commerce providers, banks or any third party to whom they must prove their identity to.Though still in the pre-launch phase, ShoCard\u0027s digital ID provides details such as the full name, address, signature, date of birth and physical details of each user. While it looks like a mobile driver\u0027s license and contains the same information, the difference, according to Ebrahimi, is each field on the ShoCard is protected with cryptography.\"We create signatures for each field. We create a hash that encrypts the data that\u0027s on there, then we create a digital signature of it, then put it on the blockchain,\" he explains.ShoCard doesn\u0027t put the user\u0027s data on the blockchain, rather just its own cryptographic proof that the data is correct.\"All you can do is validate that later,\" he added. \"I would give you my public key and name and say here\u0027s my entry on the blockchain with a signature. You can use that data to go in and validate it, but I have to provide you my name to validate it.\"If both parties in the car crash were using the ShoCard system, Ebrahimi said, the app could be made to produce a QR code that when scanned could allow the users to pass the blockchain record of their identities to each other securely.\"My ShoCard would go in, pull the data out of it to verify that it is on the blockchain. Let\u0027s say [the truck driver] was certified by the DMV and his bank. I could look at those [certifications] and say that these are ones that I can trust.\"Additionally, users could have control over what they share. In the instance of a car crash, a user might need to take another party\u0027s name and address before submitting it to a third party like an insurance provider.\"I don\u0027t have to see everything else,\" he continued. \"I don\u0027t need to ask for his weight and eye color.\"A similar exchange, he said, could also take place without QR codes using a Wi-Fi transfer protocol such as Apple\u0027s AirDrop. Either way, digital data is validated securely using bitcoin\u0027s secure digital ledger.Still, Ebrahimi believes ShoCard will perhaps be most immediately useful online, where online authentication is increasingly handled by Internet giants such as Google and Facebook.Part of the current problem, Ebrahimi argues, is that these companies earn revenue from reselling data, and further, they have the ability to update their policies often, and in ways that might not always be friendly to users.ShoCard, Ebrahimi believes, could compete against these systems if it could achieve a similar scale because the blockchain would help return control to users.\"Until the blockchain there was no way to build the best infrastructure, keep it as secure as you can and make sure no one can compromise what\u0027s inside. There are so many public cases where credit card data is breached, we see that happen publicly over and over.\"A former CEO of Buysight and Advertising.com, Ebrahimi was also a platform engineer at Yahoo until 2008. There, he managed Yahoo\u0027s user ID and login strategy, insight which he says allowed him to see the benefits of bitcoin.\"I was very fascinated with bitcoin and the infrastructure beneath it,\" he said. \"What I found is it provides a dramatically different approach to solving the problem and that the solution could be uniquely different than what was possible.\"He argued the blockchain provides compelling benefits even when compared to two-factor authentication, which he said has recently proven susceptible to hacking and interference.The most pressing challenge for ShoCard isn\u0027t technology, Ebrahimi acknowledges, it\u0027s a question of scale. As the car crash analogy illustrates, ShoCard can only be as useful as the number of people and third-party institutions using it.Identifying this \"chicken-and-egg problem\", Ebrahimi said, was a key factor in ShoCard choosing to adopt a business-to-business (B2B) marketing strategy.\"The way we see this gaining traction is not us having end users download the product,\" he said. \"That\u0027s much more challenging because the use cases will be limited. What we\u0027re looking at is working with enterprises and having them be the ones who roll this out to their user base.\"Ebrahimi suggested ShoCard is already talking to banks interested in the technology, but declined to name potential partners. Presentations for the company suggest ShoCard believes its solution could be a compelling alternative to services like Verified by Visa, which while allowing major financial institutions to leverage access to user data, require them to store it in centralized databases.More immediately, Ebrahimi sees the service as potentially appealing to bitcoin companies that currently rely on two-factor authentication services or other tools.\"Identity has become significantly more important for bitcoin companies as they start expanding beyond early adopters,\" he said.Until those partnerships are secure, however, the ShoCard product, will be kept under wraps. \"That\u0027s how we can get a larger user base and those users will have a use case,\" Ebrahimi said.Still, the irony is that, while the blockchain is effectively a trustless system, ShoCard\u0027s partners still have to trust the system, something that has been difficult for institutions given the negative publicity surrounding bitcoin as a currency.Ebrahimi aims to overcome this with a two-pronged strategy. First, convince enterprise businesses that using the blockchain is more secure and efficient; second, use trusted brands as distribution partners to consumers.The first case, Ebrahimi suggested, will be easier given that enterprise companies are already trusting authentication providers with their data. If ShoCard was a traditional authentication company, he said, it would have its own database, meaning partners would have to trust that information therein is properly maintained and that it\u0027s not improperly modified or changed.\"The people we have to convince, most of them are interested in blockchain,\" he said. \"A bank would have a hard time trusting another database, but you don\u0027t need to trust us in storing or maintaining the integrity of the data, making sure it doesn\u0027t get hacked into. I can independently validate the data and insist on its accuracy with an open database.\"It\u0027s still too early, he said, for consumers to comprehend the blockchain. But, Ebrahimi believes consumers don\u0027t need to necessarily understand it as long as they can use the technology conveniently.He concluded:Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images for TechCrunch","TAGS":"Identity, Blockchain Technology, startups, Technology, Authentication, ShoCard, Companies, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Jul 24, 2015 at 9:06 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/07/23/survey-47-of-finance-pros-say-firms-exploring-blockchain-tech/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/jNLeQ5M6dUXnpmhHsDFcLl1XD94\u003d/570x379/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/7CSFG4NP4VBXZD5A6HOAXKI3LM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Survey: 47% of Finance Pros Say Firms Exploring Blockchain Tech","INTRO":"New data suggests that many financial professionals see their industry being reshaped by blockchain technology.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"New data suggests that many financial professionals believe their industry is being reshaped by blockchain technology.A survey conducted by market intelligence provider Greenwich Associates shows that a number of financial institutions are actively reviewing solutions using distributed ledgers.Few respondents indicated that their institutions were actively deploying blockchains at this time.

After days of meeting with numerous companies – in addition to back-and-forth trips on the highway – Rutter says that he had a moment of deja vu.“I had seen it before where a lot of money – a lot of California-based venture money – was being thrown at PowerPoints and half-baked ideas about how this new technology was going to change finance as we know it,\" he recalled.A 30-year veteran of Wall Street and former CEO of Electronic Broking at interdealer broker ICAP Plc, Rutter said that what came out of that trip to California was a decision to eschew the ideas of radical change enabled by cryptocurrencies to instead look for problems that could potentially be solved by the use of a distributed ledger.He told CoinDesk:In a new interview, Rutter and McDonald outlined how R3CEV has been playing a quiet yet concerted game to bring blockchain technology to the world’s largest banks and financial institutions.The difference between R3CEV and other distributed ledger startups, however, might lie in the strength of its team. The company boasts IBM executive architect Richard Gendal Brown, Open Mustard Seed chief architect Patrick Deegan, bitcoin industry pundit Tim Swanson and former Bank of America, Citi and Wells Fargo employee Raja Ramachandran among its advisors.In interview, both Rutter and McDonald suggested that it\u0027s too early to say how Wall Street institutions and financial companies might one day introduce or integrate blockchain technologies.R3\u0027s approach has involved hosting roundtable discussions with interested banks, seeding proof-of-concept initiatives and working directly with institutions on exploration projects.Specific projects teased by R3 include a peer-to-peer streaming network for US Treasuries. Rutter noted during the interview that among the potential uses of the technology for banks would entail same-day settlement of trades for Treasuries and other securities.Part of this process has meant operating somewhat in the background – a strategic choice that Rutter attributed to the team\u0027s desire to work rather that seeking any kind of limelight.\"There’s an awful lot of hoopla out there about what\u0027s going on in the space, and our view is that we want to make substantial progress that we can speak to,\" he said.R3 isn\u0027t the only firm in the space looking to capitalize on rising interest in blockchain technologies among the financial sector.Digital Asset Holdings, led by former JPMorgan exec Blythe Masters, recently unveiled a number of product initiatives that includes same-day settlement systems, and companies like Hyperledger, Ripple Labs and others have long targeted the financial sector as a key client demographic.At stake are the millions of dollars – if not billions – worth of new business models and financial products built using the technology. As such, players in the space are moving to establish influence among the institutions that could find see big changes in the decades ahead if blockchains and distributed ledgers see broader usage.Whether bitcoin or another implementation of the protocol will be utilized by one or another bank is still very much unclear.Rutter and McDonald stressed that they strive for a degree of agnosticism when looking at distributed ledger tech, eschewing the bitcoin maximalist view broadly propagated by others in the industry.McDonald characterized R3 as taking as a \"balanced approach\", one in which bitcoin as well as other iterations of the technology are equally weighed when looking at particular implementations or use cases.He went on to suggest that this view stands in contrast with the thinking of some in Silicon Valley:The key, the two stressed, was approaching applications from the perspective of a financial institution looking to experiment and integrate, rather than with how the technology could be used to augment the institution from the outside.These days, it seems harder to find a bank or financial institution that hasn’t committed resources to exploring bitcoin and its underlying technology.Numerous banks have made public their experimentations, and working groups and trade organizations have weighed in on how blockchain technology, if applied, could bring about lasting change to the financial system. Even central banks like the Monetary Authority of Singapore have begun devoting financial resources to exploring the blockchain.Many banks and financial institutions, it seems, are still in an exploratory phase, wherein the risks and rewards are being weighed on a case-by-case basis.Rutter explained:Rutter noted that, for a number of those on Wall Street, the ascendence of bitcoin has sparked a broader movement to embrace cryptographic solutions in finance.\"I think that it’s possible that these new technologies will provide ancillary benefits,\" he said. \u0027They\u0027re not specific to the distributed ledger, but people are thinking of applying mathematical, cryptographic solutions to existing problems.”Notable is the speed at which financial institutions worldwide have moved to understand the potential of distributed ledger usage, and the potential applications therein.“I think the education process and the interest has grown extremely rapidly in the past six months,\" McDonald said.Wall Street image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Wall Street, Technology, Tim Swanson, R3CEV, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Jul 21, 2015 at 8:05 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/07/21/research-banks-unprepared-for-digital-disruption/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/67MX9iHZkme9iDLJ6dxX_3f4j8I\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/47WJ2DHOERFLLOJ4654BUNPVXQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Research: Banks Unprepared For Digital Disruption","INTRO":"Banks are not prepared for the wave of disruption emerging from digital companies seeking to capture the financial market, according to new research.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Banks are not prepared for the wave of disruption from digital companies seeking to capture the financial market, according to new research.In a survey of senior executives from the UK\u0027s retail banking and wealth management sectors, digital innovation agency Adaptive Lab found that legacy technology and rapidly changing consumer behaviour were hampering innovation.Commenting on the findings, James Hayock, managing director at the firm, noted the disruptive potential of bitcoin\u0027s distributed ledger:Additionally, the research also revealed that banks currently place too much emphasis on compliance – both in terms of focus and resources – with it taking up between 50% and 90% of their IT budgets.\"It\u0027s plain to see that a perfect storm of competition, technology, shifts in customer behaviour and regulation looks set to wreak havoc on the businesses we trust with our money.

Its efforts have so far centered on communicating the potential benefits of the technology to banking and retail clients, while helping coordinate interactions between these entities and industry startups.The DCC, he said, has three mandates: educate Deloitte and its clients on opportunities in the space, investigate how the technology could improve existing services and explore future solutions built on the blockchain.The announcement follows written reports from Deloitte on various subjects including bitcoin\u0027s use as a money exchange protocol, a way to manage staff payments and the viability of a central bank-owned cryptocurrency.To date, many of Deloitte\u0027s clients are still in the exploratory phase of the technology, Piscini said, with most still attempting to determine the differences between bitcoin and other blockchains.Some, however, are moving to apply this technology to specific pain points, either to add additional revenue streams or cut costs. Piscini suggests a smaller percentage of clients have graduated to explorations of how the technology could be applied to specific business use cases.\"It\u0027s usually when they reach that third level that they start analyzing the technology stack and want to know how to deliver these businesses cases,\" he explained.Piscini indicated that these clients are currently exploring different protocols built on top of bitcoin, including Blockstream, Counterparty and Factom. A key question that persists for many is whether to partner with these firms or build a private blockchain.Alternative blockchains such as those managed by Ripple Labs or Ethereum are also being explored at this stage, he said.\"We have clients on both sides of the equation, who say, \u0027We want to use factom, it\u0027s a good enough solution, they put an abstraction layer between me and the blockchain, I don\u0027t have to say that I\u0027m using bitcoin, but I get the technology in the backend, the huge community, the huge mining network,\" he continued, adding:Piscini suggested Deloitte\u0027s New York banking clients, for example, were primarily interested in using the blockchain for the trade, transfer and settlement of transactions. Elsewhere, retail clients are interested in the use of the blockchain for rewards program management in a similar way as mobile gift card provider Gyft.As for its own projects, Piscini said Deloitte hasn\u0027t determined one specific working thesis for the technology, suggesting the firm is willing to select the blockchain best for its specific use cases.\"Our point of view, is \u0027Let\u0027s find use cases, where you can generate more revenue, generate a different customer experience or cut your costs.\u0027 Then we can find the technology stack to address them,\" he said.So far, Deloitte has launched Rubix, a software platform that allows its clients to build applications on top of blockchain infrastructure.The official website for the service lists four areas of interest, including reconsolidation between trading partners, real-time auditing, land registry and loyalty points. Internally, the company is focused on automating some of its auditing processing via a solution currently in stealth.\"It would accelerate the process and make it cheaper and more transparent and for regulators,\" he added.Still, Piscini pushed back against the idea that the peer-to-peer (P2P) nature of blockchain technology will render service providers such as Deloitte obsolete.\"The potential for disruption is limited, but the opportunity is significant. The example we had earlier is going to change the way we do that, but we don\u0027t think we\u0027ll be replaced, we think we can be more efficient,\" he said.In regards to its tax services, Piscini said it would likely gain business due to the lack of clarity still surrounding the technology. Further, he also sees opportunity in consulting.\"On the consulting side, I think we\u0027ll see the ecosystem adapt and change and move toward blockchain-based solutions,\" he continued. \"The potential for us is around the ability to source consulting services through a P2P crowdsourcing platform. Instead of saying, \u0027Deloitte help us with that strategy\u0027, you can request that service on the blockchain and the blockchain would match you with the right individuals to do that.\"Piscini added that this development is something the firm is \"taking very seriously\" given that consulting is increasingly an integral part of its operations.Perhaps most notably given its vantage point as a mediator between startups and enterprise companies, Piscini suggested that these two communities have not yet developed steady communications.More traditional companies, he said, still look at the tech community as \"geeks\" who may not understand the relevancy of the tech to their business. He also reported an equal but opposite reaction from startups.\"A lot of those startups don\u0027t have as much training yet and they don\u0027t know how to talk business with my clients,\" he said. \"If you don\u0027t use the right terminology, you don\u0027t get to talk more than 10 minutes.\"So far, this has resulted in larger companies making some \"wrong assumptions\" about the technology. For example, Piscini noted that it is still not proven whether blockchains can replace shared databases and be more cost-efficient.\"They\u0027re assuming that the blockchain is going fix a business or tech issue and they have some very high expectations. Sometimes we get back to them and say the blockchain will help you get there, but you should consider other options to fix that problem,\" Piscini said.For example, Piscini cited cross-border payments as a vertical that will, long-term, likely embrace blockchain solutions, but that has compelling solutions today offering by companies such as Paypal and Xoom.However, Piscini did express optimism that the dialogue is improving, spurred by the efforts of innovative firms such as Citi, JP Morgan and USAA, all of which have teams devoted to the technology, and the addition of financial industry veterans such as Blythe Masters to companies like Digital Asset Holdings.\"The expertise is moving into the tech because that\u0027s how they\u0027re going to be able to come up with the right solutions, but it may take years to get to a mutual understanding,\" he added.Piscini also indicated that he still sees payments as being a vertical that will be influenced by bitcoin and the blockchain, even if enterprise clients are currently interested in the broader applications of the technology.He suggested that, in Deloitte\u0027s view, bitcoin should be considered a technology for all transactions, including those that are not necessarily financial.\"Bitcoin is a technology that is interesting when you want to manage any type of transactions, it could be a transaction between me and you transfering bitcoin or asking a driver to pick us up at an airport,\" he said. \"Today I\u0027m using a ridesharing service, but tomorrow I might be using blockchain to do that.\"Over time, Piscini said he sees the blockchain becoming a foundational layer for asset transfer, smart contracts and voting, but that different blockchains may be created that specialize in each of these use cases. He also suggested that he sees cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin will likely continue to play a role in the management of blockchains.While Deloitte is working on more than 20 use cases for the technology, Piscini still cautioned that he doesn\u0027t know which opportunity might be the most immediate application of the blockchain, though he foresees a killer app being developed soon.Piscini concluded:Deloitte image via Wikipedia Commons","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Audits, Accounting, News, Deloitte, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Jul 14, 2015 at 4:55 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/07/10/chicago-gets-its-first-incubator-for-blockchain-startups/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/ca_EFQ5fLkT-HMbgwzXscGiC9-8\u003d/570x378/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/2MF7LFESFVF2JBCBGV7CFBAGWU.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Chicago Gets Its First Incubator for Blockchain Startups","INTRO":"A series of prominent Chicago entrepreneurs and investors have launched the Chicago Bitcoin Center, an incubator for blockchain technology companies.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A group of Chicago entrepreneurs and investors have launched the city\u0027s first bitcoin and blockchain hub.Opening today at Chicago\u0027s 1871 – an entrepreneurial centre home to 325 early-stage digital startups – Chicago\u0027s Bitcoin Center will provide a co-working space, mentorship, public relations and government affairs services to blockchain-focused startups.Matthew Roszak, CEO of the Chicago Bitcoin Center and founding partner of VC firm Tally Capital, said in a statement:The Center\u0027s inaugural companies include Bloq, a blockchain company; Glidera, a digital currency merchant services provider; Red Leaf, a bitcoin ATM operator; and OasisCoin, a bitcoin remittances company.The incubator\u0027s advisory board comprises prominent entrepreneurs including Andrew Filipowski – chairman of the centre and another founding partner of Tally Capital; Don Wilson, founder and CEO of DRW Trading; Jeff Garzik, bitcoin core developer and Luke Sully, director of advisory services at PriceWaterhouseCoopers.Alongside the launch, 1871 announced it will accept bitcoin payments, enabling its tenants to pay their rent with the cryptocurrency.Chicago image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Jeff Garzik, startups, Chicago, News, Fintech, Companies, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jul 10, 2015 at 2:30 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/06/27/how-bitcoins-technology-could-reshape-our-medical-experiences/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/UfcTv6cJ5MyMDkwRcSF93jhtGIw\u003d/570x340/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/O7PV2PNEQZFHNDOODNCAFL276Y.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How Bitcoin\u0027s Technology Could Reshape Our Medical Experiences","INTRO":"Matt Weiss, Dan Elitzer and Joe Gerber examine how the technology behind bitcoin could assist with emergency and long-term medical treatment.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"This post, which examines how bitcoin\u0027s blockchain could reshape our medical experiences, is part of the Humans + Bits + Blocks series. Read the previous post in the series here.Blockchains and health could be a happy marriage across a multitude of applications. From robust interoperable health records to proof of medication adherence, opportunities abound to create new value and enhance health-related experiences.For the purposes of making this exploration tangible (as is our goal with this entire series), let’s follow the journey of a person with a chronic condition we’ll call Screenoritis* in a future with blockchains.First, it’s important to know that Screenoritis is a troublesome condition. The prognosis isn’t fatal, but the symptoms of it are debilitating, ranging from sleeplessness to short-term memory loss. The good news? It is both treatable and reversible, though the path to recovery is not easy.Jane is 34. She loves her job as an animator and works way more than the average person. It’s Thursday afternoon, she’s totally worn out from a super challenging scene she just finished, and she decides to take a break. It’s beautiful outside, so she heads out for a run by the river. About two miles in, Jane starts to feel a bit nauseous and then lightheaded. She slows to a walk, but even so collapses 100 yards down the trail. A runner coming from the other direction finds Jane unresponsive on the ground and calls 911.When the ambulance arrives, the EMTs scan the fitness band on Jane’s wrist to retrieve her HealthChain ID, a unique public identifier used for health information. When Jane signed up for HealthChain, she created rules and named individuals who could verify access to her medical records. The EMT’s combine Jane’s ID with their own, which proves that they’re accredited emergency health responders.They then issue a broadcast on the HealthChain network, which automatically generates alerts to Jane’s four emergency contacts asking them to validate that the EMTs can access Jane’s records. Ten seconds later, after two of her contacts grant access, the EMTs are able to access her emergency health info.A few hours later, Jane wakes up in the hospital. She’s OK, but she’s shaken up and wants to understand what’s going on. The doctor on call sits down with her to explain her encounter with Screenoritis.After reviewing some of the facts, the doctor asks if she’s willing to share her anonymized information in the public research repository – this has become standard practice, and she has no problem with it. She’s willing to share her medical history, pertinent data about the event she just experienced, and results from the tests they’re currently running.Jane wants to learn what people like her have experienced and how she can get better. She and others have opted into share their information in order to participate in a private network. Compared to today’s self-guided searching, the doctor does a criteria match for her profile and finds an entire set of people who share many important characteristics with Jane, ranging from age to location to type of job.Although Screenoritis is fairly widespread and medications have been developed to treat symptoms, recovery is still difficult and treatment of the underlying conditions have gotten little attention from the medical community.As part of her initial research about the condition, Jane quickly discovers that there is a publicly crowdfunded bounty for the release of a treatment regimen that will treat the underlying causes of Screenoritis.Her contribution is governed by a series of smart contracts that provide conditional access to treatments once they’re released. Unlike traditional crowdfunding, her contributions are held in escrow by the contracts until the treatment is ready for her.Now that Jane has a solid understanding of her condition, she’s begun to see a specialist who has prescribed a daily physical routine for her in addition to well-known Screenoritis medications. Adherence to both is critical for recovery and also rewarded by her insurer. With a watch that can track her location and movements and pills that are instrumented to collect data, the information that the insurer and doctor needs is readily available. So long as Jane sticks to her agreed-upon treatment, the entirety of her bills are covered automatically — no paperwork needed.Health and blockchains turn out to be a great match. Together, they can usher in a patient-centric revolution in how we take care of ourselves and others. In our most vulnerable moments, we’ll seamlessly share permissions to access important information attached to our identity. We’ll make advance promises of payment in return for new treatments that we desire. Rather than opaque risk models and quotas, insurance payments will be triggered by our verified healthy behaviors.It’s time for health to get an upgrade. Far from state-of-the-art, our health is tracked, diagnosed and treated without the full benefit of technologies that we take for granted in other aspects of our everyday lives. The addition of blockchains could change that substantially, and we’re excited about these future opportunities becoming real.* Screenoritis is not an actual disease.Written by Matt Weiss, Dan Elitzer and Joe Gerber.

This will lead to a wide variety of potential uses in securities, syndicated lending, trade finance, swaps, derivatives or wherever counterparty risk arises.\" Blockchain technology could also increase investor confidence in products whose underlying assets are opaque or where property rights are made uncertain by the role of central authorities, the report says. Other \"attractive features\" of the technology include transaction irreversibility, near-instantaneous clearing and settlement and a reduced margin of error, as individual transactions are openly verified by a community of network users. \"Commercial banks, central banks, stock exchanges and major technology providers, such as IBM and Samsung, are all exploring the potential uses of distributed ledgers [...] It is only a matter of time before distributed ledgers become a trusted alternative for managing large volumes of transactions.\" The publication of the report follows Santander InnoVentures managing principal Mariano Belinky\u0027s statement at the FutureMoney conference that distributed ledgers have the potential to \"transform\" banking as we know it. Speaking to CoinDesk in April, Belinky claimed bitcoin\u0027s underlying technology would gain mainstream traction sooner than the digital currency itself.Santander InnoVentures\u0027 report on blockchain tech is the latest contribution to what is considered to be a growing trend among mainstream banks.Just last month, the Euro Banking Association (EBA), released a report which stated that distributed ledgers had the potential to lower costs, increase speed and improve product offerings.Similarly to Santander\u0027s report, the EBA publication highlighted that cooperation among Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and the crypto community was necessary as it would determine the future relationship between traditional banks and the \u00272.0\u0027 sector.Piggy bank image via Shutterstock.","TAGS":"Research, Blockchain Technology, Santander, Banking, Fintech, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Finance","CREATION_DATE":"Jun 16, 2015 at 11:15 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/06/09/smart-contracts-platform-symbiont-raises-125-million/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/mLPYKc8xLNlb3uGueXR2rQio4AE\u003d/570x382/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/2A3YYH576FGYHAXA5ZFMU2OQII.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Smart Contracts Platform Symbiont Raises $1.25 Million","INTRO":"Smart contracts platform Symbiont has closed a $1.25m seed funding round.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Smart contracts platform Symbiont has closed a $1.25m seed funding round.

The company recently came under fire for wrongdoings in its early days, paying part of a $700,000 fine for FinCEN violations.Today, Morton doesn\u0027t believe that Ripple\u0027s technology is ready for Seagate to use, but he argued that due to this enormous potential, his company was eager to participate in its $28m Series A fundraising announced this week.\"To be able to move our operational cash globally in a free way that is transparent is very important to us,\" he said.Seagate\u0027s business model would seem to lend itself to two popular use cases for blockchain technology: the ability to move payments and the ability to track the positioning of supply chains, as seen in California-based startup Skuchain.Morton sees Ripple\u0027s platform as one that would let Seagate keep an eye on the development of both use cases, maintaining both are \"very interesting\".\"We have 3 million components a day in flight, so you can just imagine the power that this can possibly have down the road from a supply chain perspective, whether that be cash flow or economics,\" he said, adding:When asked why Seagate wouldn\u0027t yet seek to use the technology, Morton suggested that the murky legal status of blockchain technology around the globe was a deterrent.\"Obviously we would like to be a key user. We\u0027ll work with the proper authorities and companies and our own providers, our banks,\" he remarked.Morton also touched on why, in his opinion, the \"agnostic\" nature of Ripple has a competitive advantage over the bitcoin network.\"You can do commodities, dollars, yen, euros versus it being just bitcoin. We want to take more of a holistic approach,\" he said, adding that he remains a fan of bitcoin.In this light, Morton said Seagate remains primarily interested in seeing whether blockchain technologies can help solve real problems for its business, whether that solution comes from a provider like Ripple Labs or an alternative.\"Reduction of friction, this is the immediate need within our space,\" he explained. \"As we get more and more global, this is going to be something that folks are very interested in solving.\"Morton concluded:Dave Morton image via LinkedIn","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Ripple Labs, Seagate, Skuchain, Distributed Ledger Technology, Features, Ripple Labs, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"May 21, 2015 at 9:38 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/05/20/internet-security-pioneer-unveils-project-at-blockchain-university/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/rqenAvUBwnOuKmW-lMImOlFdtgM\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/2BR6ZHIDVBHK5IJ2IDYSUVY5JA.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Internet Security Pioneer Unveils Project at Blockchain University","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A project led by a pioneering developer of the Internet\u0027s secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol was among the standouts at Blockchain University\u0027s second demo day.Held in Mountain View, California, on Monday, 18th May, the event featured presentations from roughly 10 projects created at the pre-accelerator during a six-week period beginning in April. Launched in December 2014, Blockchain University is aimed at promoting interest and innovation around blockchain technology and distributed ledgers.Blockchain University\u0027s second demo night successfully showcased how nuanced projects can now be quickly built on a broad range of blockchains and developed with the aid of APIs from bitcoin industry businesses.Among the early speakers and sponsors perhaps none illustrated the recent increase in focus on blockchain technology better than BitPay developer Eric Martindale, whose company was among the first to bet big on the widespread use of the bitcoin blockchain as a facilitator of payments.Martindale told the audience:BitPay senior software engineer Gregg Zigler and Monkey Inferno product manager Elyse Lefebvre went on to present Carrot, a project that enables a bitcoin wallet to accept an email address and replace it with a bitcoin address, all without needing any action from the user.The project uses the bitcoin blockchain to move funds and the namecoin blockchain to guarantee that wallet names are unique.\"What we wanted was an open protocol that minimizes trust in third parties and maximizes the use of the familiar,\" Zigler said.Elsewhere, Collectible sought to use blockchains to both authenticate and create secondary markets for baseball trading cards, while Chainmail aimed to assist lawyers by making it easier to authenticate emails for later use in court cases.While all these are examples of the types of projects created, none were among the most lauded by judges SKBI research fellow Tim Swanson and Coinalytics CEO Fabio Federici.We review the top three projects as selected by event judges below:The most polished project in the cohort, Revoke SSL succeeded by demonstrating its strong knowledge of a niche market (e-commerce checkout security) in need of a specific solution (the ability to signal quickly when HTTPS security has been compromised).In particular, co-founder Matthew Schutte was able to illustrate how trust within this small but vital commerce system is in need of an overhaul.For example, he explained how communications between browsers and websites can continue under the guise that a compromised certificate is valid, sometimes for weeks or months due to the difficulty of revoking certificates provided by third-party certificate authorities such as Trustwave and VeriSign.The group also boasts unique experience tackling similar issues.In addition to team members Jarod Holtz and Matthew Schutte, original SSL contributing developer Christopher Allen helped produce the product. Allen developed a reference implementation for SSL 3.0, the first successful version of the protocol and one on which newer updates have been based.Though other presenters attacked small markets, Revoke SSL seemed the most serious about moving forward with the project following graduation, showcasing how it might evolve into a scalable and commercially viable business.Potential clients contacted, they suggested, had expressed an interest in paying $150 for revocation services on a $500 certificates.Squirrel aims to use blockchain technology and smart contracts to remove risk from global supply chains.In a traditional supply chain, project leaders Jack Parkin and Sujata Meno argued, manufacturers take on unnecessary risk to ensure they are covered if vendors never fulfill orders. As a result, manufacturers struggle to gain the financing they need to produce new orders, thereby creating an expensive cycle of risk management.To attack this issue, Squirrel developed a system by which parties could enter into a purchasing agreement at a lower risk level. Funds, the team proposed, could be sent to escrow accounts by both manufacturers and vendors. Squirrel, in turn, could act as a source of capital and security so that projects can be produced.\"A contractor is building a tree house and getting wood from a vendor, and they need $100 to get the wood, but only have $50. Squirrel can do a credit check and agree to match,\" Parkin explained. \"Money stays in escrow for everyone to see.\"From there, Squirrel uses the Thingchain blockchain developed by startup Skuchain as a means of tracking supply codes.As the products are shipped, supply codes would be intermittently validated, with funds being released to parties when the initial supplies and finished goods pass through predetermined checkpoints.\"A small penetration of this market would be bringing quite a bit of returns,\" Parkin concluded.The issue of ownership and security was attacked again by the Blocknotary team, albeit in one of the more humorous presentations.Created by Igor Barinov, David Bently, Roman Storm and Lilian Chan, Blocknotary allows those using cell phone cameras to attach a form of copyright to their creations. What separated the Blocknotary team, however, was how they had integrated this process in the traditional user experience.Built as an iPhone app, Blocknotary allows users to access its service as they would email or Twitter when looking to share a photo. Alongside familiar options such as \u0027Assign to Contact\u0027, \u0027Print\u0027 and \u0027Use as Wallpaper\u0027 in an iPhone display, would be a Blocknotary button.Someone taking a selfie, the team joked, would then put a description into a field, select \u0027Submit\u0027 and a copy of the photo would be made on the blockchain.\"[The user is] going to submit this to the blockchain and what will be in the OP_RETURN is the embedded date and time,\" a presenter concluded.Images via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk","TAGS":"Bitpay, Exchanges, Blockchain Technology, Blockchain University, News, Events, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"May 20, 2015 at 9:45 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/05/15/bitcoin-in-the-headlines-the-chicken-and-egg-debate/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/w0rpRIqWenJk-SnAjCmwtLDx0YM\u003d/570x379/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/JHWDT3ML25DCZLBVMYFWI2SAKM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin in the Headlines: The Chicken and Egg Debate","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Bitcoin in the Headlines is our weekly look at bitcoin news, analysing media and its impact.It\u0027s the classic philosopher\u0027s dilemma, the chicken and egg.

In doing so, they often fail to notice – or admit – the digital currency\u0027s co-dependency with its ledger.In a Wired piece, titled \"Bitcoin May Never Make It to Wall Street, But Its Tech Will\", author Cade Metz, began by citing James Angel, a professor of finance at Georgetown University who compared bitcoin to MySpace.The comparison to early, but failed, social networks is not new. But, it served to drive home the message that some pundits are not yet convinced that bitcoin is anything more than an inherently flawed first iteration of a distributed public ledger.Unsurprisingly, this mixed message from Nasdaq was attacked by non-profit bitcoin advocacy group Coin Center, which noted that bitcoin\u0027s ledger requires a healthy currency to operate.Still, Angel spoke about the need for distributed ledger technology to perhaps provide increased privacy, illustrating why there continues to be a drive to discuss \"blockchain technology\" more generally.The strongest and most widely used distributed ledger today happens to be bitcoin, but many investors, Angel noted, prefer to keep transactions private. As such, attributes might exist that necessitate the rise of other blockchains, or distributed ledgers, he argued.Bitcoin\u0027s supporters, in turn, will have to keep advancing the argument that its ledger is best-suited to become the most widely used.Liz Peek, a former Wall Street research analyst and the first woman to become a partner of a Wall Street firm, took a somewhat pessimistic stance on the technology this week.Detailing bitcoin\u0027s flaws in a Fiscal Times piece, she arguably confused the bitcoin protocol\u0027s safety with that of the businesses operating with the technology.Peek is by no means alone in doing so.Questioning Wall Street\u0027s and the government\u0027s desire to legitimise the digital currency in the eyes of consumers, Peek wrote:She continued: \"By requiring bitcoin exchanges to register and granting them legal status, the government is signalling to users and backers what may prove an unrealistic promise of transparency and security. ... At least, regulators need to affix flashing red warning lights to every bitcoin undertaking: consumers beware.\"Peek\u0027s reference to regulation, it soon became clear, followed on from itBit\u0027s announcement that it had received a trust company charter.A timely news story, no doubt, but the misleading information just kept on coming, as Peek continued her crusade against bitcoin, citing a an MIT Technology Review article which said that academics had spotted flaws in Nakamoto\u0027s math, enabling \"cheats\", concluding:\"High risk isn\u0027t a completely incorrect definition of bitcoin right now,\" said Peek. \"And yet, not only are regulators lending bitcoin legitimacy, Wall Street heavyweights have virtually guaranteed it.\"Peek\u0027s story also referenced the ongoing mystery surrounding Satoshi Nakamoto, the author of the bitcoin white paper, a subject that was further attacked by Nathaniel Popper this week.Writing for the New York Times, Popper outlined evidence to suggest that Nick Szabo, the noted cryptographer, was quite possibly behind the digital currency\u0027s creation.\"Mr. Szabo is nearly as much of a mystery as Satoshi. But in the course of my reporting I kept turning up new hints that drew me further into the chase\", he noted.The resulting piece relays a conversation between Popper and Szabo, that while inconclusive, provides an interesting look at the reclusive cryptographic and his continued work in the bitcoin space.Neither Peek nor Popper are the first to delve into bitcoin\u0027s origin\u0027s in an attempt to decipher the identity of its mysterious creator – or creators, or to point to the mystery as one of the technology\u0027s shortcomings.Though an intriguing narrative, however, such storytelling may get in the way of the more compelling reality. Propelled by big players like Nasdaq, bitcoin\u0027s chicken-and-egg issues are well on their way to an aisle near you.This report was co-authored by Pete Rizzo.Newspaper image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin in the Headlines, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"May 15, 2015 at 4:35 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/05/14/how-blockchain-tech-is-inspiring-the-art-world/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/St_UO6ufYYVj6lKGHwKd_e4phdo\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/WUQQASGM6NBQDBM33HV3EBCPZQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How Blockchain Tech is Inspiring the Art World","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Since its creation in 2009, bitcoin\u0027s blockchain has proved that value can be moved across a network that cuts out the traditional \u0027middle men\u0027.While the broad strokes of distributed ledger technologies like bitcoin are a hot topic, it\u0027s not just Wall Street or multi-national corporations that are paying attention.Artists are also exploring how the experimental technology can provide new ways to track and verify ownership through tools like smart contracts – authenticated by cryptographic data.Stephan Vogler, an artist and entrepreneur based in Germany, thinks the blockchain may be the answer to the art world\u0027s perennial problem, authenticity.Forgery is rife in the art world. While traditional forms of licensing would create a tradable commodity, he said, buyers could not be certain the license was authentic – nor would they be able to assert whether the author had created multiple copies of the piece.\"Bitcoin offers a solution to this problem. Just like bitcoin can replace banknotes, it can replace the piece of paper with the license text on it. I see great potential in bitcoin and its technology.\"He continued: \"The blockchain is the first decentralised trustable database, which can track the ownership of virtual properties in a reliable way.\"By placing a hash value – a set of cryptographic functions that enable people to identify data – of his digital artwork on the bitcoin blockchain, the artist enables potential buyers to verify that the artwork has been licensed.Every one of Vogler\u0027s pieces is published under a license which transforms its usage rights into a legally limited and tradable virtual asset using blockchain technology.According to the artist, the traditional licensing of digital art is opaque and often relies on some kind of physical materialisation – limited edition prints, paper certificates, printed and signed licenses – creating scarcity, a pre-requisite for market value.Scarcity also destroys the digital character of the work and with it many special properties strictly inherent to digital art, such as easy worldwide transmission or the possibility to prove the authenticity of digital signatures, he said.Samuel Miller, a London-based artist, has a rather imaginative way of explaining how the distributed ledger works.Miller has always been interested in power, power relations and self-governance, he said, and was first attracted to bitcoin because it coalesced with these subject matters in \"weird and wonderful ways\".Though his lack of technical expertise was a hinderance at first, Miller seems to have finally found the solution that he was searching for. \"When things are recorded in the blockchain, you can trust them.\"Speaking about the blockchain\u0027s potential for licensing content, Miller concluded: \"It just kind of can be used for anything, to get rid of lawyers, to bypass copyright law – which is obviously really important for artists. It [the blockchain] will completely empower artists.\"It\u0027s not just individuals that are exploring the technology, institutions within the art world are taking note, too.Austria\u0027s Museum of Modern Art (MAK) made the headlines earlier this year when it became the first museum to purchase a piece of art with bitcoin.Speaking to CoinDesk, Marlies Wirth, a curator at MAK, said:Commenting on the existing – and the evolving – bond between art and blockchain technology, Ruhry said that there is a number of people and organisations which are looking into Certificates of Authenticity based on the ledger\u0027s technology.For example, Berlin-based Ascribe services artists, galleries and collectors to allow them to register, transfer or archive digital art using time-stamped cryptographic ownership certificates on its blockchain-based Ownership Registry.Ascribe is joined in the space by Monegraph, a collaborative venture between a New York University professor and a technologist, which enables artists to secure digital property on the namecoin blockchain.Although it is still early days and crypto 2.0 is still in its relatively nascent stage, it seems that distributed consensus ledgers such as the blockchain will continue to gain momentum among artists, who are typically interested in ways of eradicating the middle-men to gain greater control over their work and their profits.Paintbrush image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, smart contracts, Crypto 2.0, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"May 14, 2015 at 7:25 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/05/13/blockchain-tech-could-improve-banking-says-eba-report/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/8Cyi4nc8LeQ9km3QzHi7D1jEsJQ\u003d/570x378/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/XHXNMJEQYVB37H3IOQU4ZHCKRU.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain Tech Could Improve Banking, Says EBA Report","INTRO":"The Euro Banking Association (EBA) has explored the short-term implications of blockchain technology in its most recent report.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain technology has the potential to reduce costs, improve product offerings and increase speed for banks, according to the most recent report from the Euro Banking Association (EBA).Founded in 1985 and supported by the European Commission, the EBA is a practitioner\u0027s body for banks and other service providers that promotes a pan-European payment system and business practises.Despite mostly dismissing digital currencies – the report notes they differ from \"legitimate fiat currencies\" – it asserts their applications are essential for \"gaining more advanced knowledge of crypto technologies\".These technologies are likely to be integrated with the existing financial system in the next one to three years, the EBA says.According to the EBA, cooperation, adoption and their two respective sub-drivers (communication and regulation) will be decisive factors in the future of the technology.Here, the report says that the level of cooperation between Payment Service Providers (PSPs) and the crypto technology community – also between PSPs themselves – will determine the future relationship between banks and \u0027crypto 2.0\u0027 companies.Notably, it draws parallels between the concerns and industry dynamics that surfaced when voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) applications such as Skype launched approximately ten years ago.EBA\u0027s report also speaks of two-fold benefits for PSPs and crypto businesses.If regulation is favourable, PSPs may benefit from entering into partnerships with the crypto technology community, as they would be able to get a first-hand idea of long-term developments and would be better positioned to take advantage of the latter when the technology reaches the desired level of maturity.In turn, it notes how the crypto technology community would benefit from the PSPs\u0027 legitimacy and procedural knowledge, concluding:Though it is difficult to predict the way in which crypto technologies will the existing financial infrastructure, the report adds that further developments – and progress – can be expected.The report groups blockchain technologies into four key categories: currencies, asset registries, application stacks and asset-centric technologies. It notes, however, that the lack of regulatory and technical maturity diminishes the use-case for the first three, adding that they still warrant close monitoring by industry players.A chronological representation of the four development categories of crypto technologies, according to EBA\u0027s report. With this in mind, the paper describes four real use cases where blockchain technology could improve foreign exchange and remittances, real-time payouts, documentary trade and asset servicing – concluding that asset-centric developments were potentially the most interesting for transaction banking and the payments industry.Progress in the other three areas has been hindered by technological and regulatory challenges, the EBA says.The paper suggests that the banking and payment industries should attempt to \"reach, conversion and cost advantages of currencies and reductions in auditing and governance expenditures from asset-centric as well as radical innovation from application stack technologies\".The EBA\u0027s report follows on from a European Central Bank publication, which described digital currencies as \"inherently unstable\" but potentially transformative in the realm of payments.Prominent bankers, such Santander’s Mariano Belinky and Barclay’s Usama Fayyad have commented on the ledger’s transformative potential and Swiss investment bank UBS recently opened a blockchain technology research lab in London to see how it could be applied in the wider FinTech community.The blockchain has also captured the attention of companies from outside the banking space. US insurance giant USSA is allegedly pouring resources into investigating how to incorporate the blockchain into its existing infrastructure.","TAGS":"Research, Blockchain Technology, Europe, EBA, Crypto 2.0, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Yessi Bello Perez","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"May 13, 2015 at 1:27 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2015/05/11/nasdaq-becomes-latest-firm-to-trial-blockchain-technology/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/tNc7XNCm5Fvxr-hT18m-2ZCiJcs\u003d/570x321/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/downloads.coindesk.com/arc/failsafe/placeholders/16x9.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Nasdaq Becomes Latest Firm to Trial Blockchain Technology","INTRO":"Nasdaq OMX Group Inc is reportedly exploring how a blockchain-based solution could change the way shares are transferred and sold manually.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Nasdaq OMX Group Inc is reportedly exploring how a blockchain-based solution could change the way shares are transferred and sold manually.The company will trial the technology in Nasdaq Private Market, a capital marketplace launched in January 2014, which sets out to connect private companies and global investors, allowing the latter to purchase shares which may eventually go public before they do so.Nasdaq chief executive Robert Greifeld told The Wall Street Journal:He added that the technology held the potential to \"benefit not only our clients, but the broader capital markets\".The company has appointed Fredrik Voss, vice president and deputy head of commodities, as its new blockchain technology lead.Nasdaq OMX Group, which owns and operates the Nasdaq stock exchange, is the latest to explore the cryptocurrency space.Swiss investment bank UBS announced the opening of a London-based blockchain technology research lab to explore the application in the financial services industry just last month.Bankers from traditional finance have also previously praised blockchain technology, highlighting its potential to transform the industry.Ex-JP Morgan Chase \u0026 Co executive Blythe Masters joined bitcoin trading platform Digital Assets Holdings LLC as chief executive in March.

If people use it, then it has a future,\" he said.Writing for Fortune, Chris Matthews made a few retaliatory – albeit valid – points. He noted:Matthews continued: \"This is illegal behaviour by any other name, but Argentines, like bitcoin broker Dante Castiglione, aren\u0027t worried.\"Still, he was quick to note the perhaps more negative connotations of its support, concluding:Popper\u0027s piece also discussed the role that banks may decide to play in determining if disruptive technologies such as bitcoin and the blockchain can have lasting value outside of perhaps more troubled countries like Argentina. Mike Orcutt, from MIT Technology Review, weighed into the debate with his piece \"Why Bitcoin Could Be Much More Than a Currency\", noting what many bitcoin aficionados have argued in the past: it is not believed that the blockchain could survive without bitcoin. He added: \"One twist, though, is that bitcoins themselves are still inherent to the process: they provide the incentive for people to help make all this happen. Verifying transactions and storing their data in the blockchain earns miners newly minted bitcoins.\" Orcutt continued: \"In other words, any service that aims to use the blockchain as a general-purpose database will have to pass a bitcoin (or a fraction of one) around in the process. Or it will have to find some other way to motivate miners to put the information into the ledger.” A piece in The Economist, titled \"The Next Big Thing: or is it?\" looked into the blockchain\u0027s application by traditional finance institutions such as banks, echoing Orcutt\u0027s thoughts about the underlying principle of incentivisation. The article concludes by citing Patrick Collison, co-founder of Stripe, a payments processor, who said: “Just because bitcoin didn’t succeed as a currency doesn’t mean blockchain will succeed as a technology, but the experiment is important to run.\" The possible uses are legion, but the killer app is still missing, concluded the article. Of course, maybe bitcoin is just a sign we\u0027re all doomed.Bitcoin has previously been associated with the Antichrist, with Christian blogs and forums making the connection between the digital currency and the Apocalypse.The Book of Revelations, in the Bible\u0027s New Testament, provides ample evidence to suggest that both a \"one-world government\" and a \"one-world currency\" will come to exist under the rule of the Antichrist, and his sidekick, Satan.We can all rest assured, however, because this week, Newsmax, a right-wing political site, discerned that there was no such link between the digital currency and the Antichrist.The piece, aptly titled \"Bitcoin and Bible Prophecy: 5 Reasons the Cryptocurrency Shouldn\u0027t Be Considered the Mark of the Beast\", began:\"The Mark of the Beast is thought to be among the characteristics of the \u0027tribulation years,\u0027 and some believe bitcoin is in a position to fulfil the prophecy by coming or morphing into the one-world currency the anti-Christ will use to gain economic control worldwide.\" For those not in the know, the Mark of the Beast refers to the a term that is associated with the Beast of Revelation. In most manuscripts of the New Testament and in English translations of the Bible, the number of the Beast is 666.The article caught the attention of Fusion\u0027s Kevin Roose, who said:The writer, referred to the Newsmax article, adding:It concluded: \"It\u0027s also a decentralised, peer-to-peer currency, which means that even if the Antichrist did try to use bitcoin to hasten the end of the world, it would be difficult for him to gain control of the entire blockchain.\"Even with bitcoin\u0027s potential still being hotly debated, it seems we can take comfort in the fact that it is likely not a spawn of the devil.Newspaper image; heaven image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Argentina, Bitcoin in the Headlines, Nathaniel Popper, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"May 8, 2015 at 5:01 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/05/03/the-value-of-replicated-shared-ledgers-from-first-principles/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/DPXFT8D0Kf8AV6TpqLZHtKorsX8\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/SV6SXZDBJJFUJPD5OVQUADUIC4.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The Value of Replicated, Shared Ledgers from First Principles","INTRO":"In this post, Richard G Brown develops an argument for replicated shared ledgers from first principles.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"\u0027Digital currencies\u0027 aren\u0027t needed to explain why distributed ledgers are important. In this post, IBM\u0027s Richard Gendal Brown develops an argument for replicated shared ledgers from first principles.This is intended to be an \u0027education piece\u0027 aimed at those, particularly in the finance industry, who prefer explanations of new technologies to be rooted in a description of a real-world business problem rather than beginning with a description of a purported solution.So, in this piece, you’ll find no mention of digital currencies, because it turns out you don’t need them to derive an argument for distributed ledger technologies.Start by thinking about today’s banking systems. In what follows, I use a bank deposit and payments example. But the same logic applies everywhere you look, as I’ll argue later.Let’s imagine a world with three banks: Bank A, Bank B and Bank C and two customers, Customer A and Customer B. Each bank runs their own IT systems that they use to keep track of balances. This is a world very much like today.So Bank A’s systems record the balances for Bank A’s customers, Bank B’s systems record the balances for Bank B’s customers and so on.Perhaps the picture looks something like this:Two immediate observations jump out:So we have two interesting phenomena: deposit-makers have to trust their banks to be good for the money and to account for things correctly. And the banks themselves have to spend a lot of time and money developing systems that all do pretty much the same thing – and then spend even more time and money checking with each other to make sure their systems agree on common facts.Even in our simple example, there are potentially seven separate matching entries to be verified.Banking \u0027facts\u0027 are usually recorded by at least two different entities and an expensive process of reconciliation is needed to make sure each party’s view of the world is the same.This story is about bank deposits. But exactly the same story could be told about securities systems and derivatives systems.Indeed, in the latter case, the problem could be even worse: not only do we need to be sure everybody agrees on who has done which deals with whom, we also need to be sure that their systems agree on the resulting obligations that arise – they also have to agree on the business logic.Think about how many near-identical systems exist across the financial landscape, each one working slightly differently and producing ever-so-slightly different results that have to be investigated and resolved. It’s hugely expensive.But let’s focus on the banking example for now.You can do something really interesting with the five ledgers we’ve been working with. You can write them a different way, with all the same information stored in a single table, rather than spread across five different tables:The five separate ledgers on the left can be written, exactly equivalently, as the single table on the right – and vice versa. You can derive one from the other. The only difference is that the table on the right has an extra column so we can record both the issuer and the holder of a claim.In other words, rather than having a partial view of the world held by each bank, we could have a single table that records everything and achieve the same outcome.This raises an interesting question. If it’s so expensive and complicated for each bank to run its own system that contains its own narrow view of the world – and then have to check it matches the other systems where the facts overlap – why not just pay somebody to run a single ledger that everybody agrees will be authoritative?After all, as we showed above, any bank that wanted to could easily derive its own view of the world from this mega-table, completely trivially.Of course, we’d have to give thought to how to mediate access to the ledger – who is allowed to observe or update which records – but we know how to do that … and it’s not an impossible problem.Are you mad?Now, it is tempting to say that such a thing would be insane: imagine how powerful would be the firm who ran such a system. And imagine the catastrophic implications for the world if there was a system outage!Perhaps the expensive, error-prone, but fundamentally decentralised and robust (anti-fragile?) system we have today is a price worth paying.But an interesting question arises: what if there a way to achieve the benefits of a globally shared system but without having to grapple with the difficult political question of how to control an all-powerful operator or how to deal with the risk of an outage of such an important, central piece of infrastructure?Perhaps we can achieve this…Remember what we achieved in the diagram above: we created a single table that could describe all bank balances and which was inherently shared: different actors had different permissions to update different parts of it.But the worry in the section above was that a shared global ledger would be controlled by a single powerful entity and that this centralized system could be a systemic risk. So can we make two tweaks to the model?If so, perhaps the picture would look like this:If a single copy of the global, shared ledger is undesirable or risky, then replicating it to all the participants could give the best of both worlds. Now the problem becomes one of automatically keeping the systems in sync rather than manually reconciling and dealing with breaks.The picture above looks superficially like the one I drew at the start of the article. But there’s a critically important difference. In this model, all participants have a copy of the ledger but only have the right to amend entries pertinent to them. So it is both replicated and shared.And so this is why I call this concept the \u0027replicated, shared ledger\u0027. I think this wording is better at evoking the right mental model than \u0027distributed ledger\u0027, for example.And depending on whether you want to model balances, other assets or even agreements between parties, there are startups working on a project. I wrote a piece last year that attempted to make sense of the various players out there – and many more have emerged since then.It it worth paying particular attention to the idea of adding business logic to this concept: so that the \u0027facts\u0027 being recorded aren’t just who owns what but actual agreements between parties.This opens up the intriguing possibility of \u0027smart contracts\u0027: a world where derivatives counterparties agree that a shared piece of code represents the agreement they have made with each other and they execute it on the shared, replicated ledger – perhaps completely eliminating the need to build, maintain, operate and reconcile their own proprietary derivatives platforms?Maybe even allowing the code to take custody of assets on the ledger, to manage cashflows and margin automatically?I should stress that this approach raises lots of technical questions: it’s not an unambiguously good idea.For example, do we know that the underlying replication technology works as described? Under all plausible threat scenarios? How can we be sure that one bank (or customer) can’t see (or amend) another’s information? How much data would such a system hold? Would it scale? Is it really a good idea to model legal agreements in code rather than English?There do appear to be multiple examples of expensively duplicated systems in multiple areas of the banking system.The idea of a shared ledger holds promise, with replication by participants being a mechanism to reduce risk and mutualise its operation. But whether this argument holds in practice needs to be tested.

He was also quick to disregard its unstable price, adding that markets for crude oil and silver were just as volatile.The majority of necessary work will take place on the blockchain, he said, because that is where the computational power is:Smargon weighed into to the debate clarifying that the term bitcoin was fairly definitive, whereas blockchain continued to be somewhat vague.Despite initial optimism about bitcoin\u0027s growth, Gledhill seemed to side in \u0027camp blockchain\u0027: “I talk to a lot of my peers and we all get really excited about the intricacies of how the blockchain works as a disruptive potential,\" he said.Sams echoed the sentiment of many naysayers who claim that bitcoin is still in its infancy, adding:With this in mind, the panel moved on to discuss consumer adoption. Gledhill said that the cryptocurrency space had yet to see \"that killer app\" that would set the tone for future use cases.Unsurprisingly, the technologist spoke of risk adversity and his bank’s role in safekeeping customers’ funds. He said:Gledhill continued: \"So unless there is a killer use case for customers that is above what they are using at the moment, then I don’t believe they want it [bitcoin],\" concluding, \"it doesn’t solve a problem and its potential could introduce risk, so why would we adopt it?\"Matonis countered that bitcoin adoption was not going to take place in the developed world. Instead, its real potential lies in parts of the world such as Africa or Argentina, he said, where monetary issuers are unstable and a large of part of the population is unbanked.One area of conversation focused on whether or not tokens on a blockchain will come to represent real world assets and obligations.\"Right now bitcoin is not an efficient way of storing data, but also storing valuable data in a centralised database poses certain requirements that may be even more complex,\" said Smargon, adding: \"We are also researching use cases which are not financial, because the concept is so big.\"Looking to the future, Colu’s co-founder said that bank hacks would increase, and that this security issue would drive the financial institutions to bitcoin. However, he added that existing technology was not yet sophisticated enough to overcome these issues.Gledhill seemed unconvinced by the proposal of a decentralised register being used to transfer money, although he did note that blockchain technology was a good way of tracking assets.He was also vocal about how the buzz around blockchain technologies had created a \"real pressure\" to take business cases and move them on to the ledger, sometimes unnecessarily.The panel agreed than not all use cases require decentralised solutions, or anonymous validation. However, Sams added:\"The global state of who owns what is arrived at through layers of reconciliation, message passing – it takes days. Whereas, with distributed consensus you can reach global consensus in minutes.\"— roberta profeta (@robbieprofeta) April 21, 2015Brown’s panel was not the only time the buzz surrounding the blockchain appeared during the day-long event.Executives from some of Europe’s top banks, including RBS, Lloyds Banking Group, Intesa Sanpaolo and Santander, also discussed the disruptive potential of distributed ledger systems during a wide-ranging discussion on innovation in banking.Towards the end of the panel, moderator Mateo Rizzi, general partner at SBT Venture Capital, questioned whether banks have a fear of missing out rather than a \"desire to embrace a radical change\".Belinky, who noted that distributed ledgers could \"transform\" banking, replied: \"We are all very aware that trust is shifting. We [banks] are on the defensive. FinTech and innovation have been accelerated in the last 5 years or so. It’s the topic of the hour.\"\"Stay tuned because we will continue doing more things,\" he concluded.","TAGS":"Innovation, Blockchain Technology, London, Jon Matonis, Banking, News, Events, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Apr 22, 2015 at 3:28 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/04/02/ubs-to-research-blockchain-technology-in-london-lab/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/SlOU6-Z7845m45yTIIY0oLoa0zY\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/HYS2W2K6QVCTHDJUARXZ4OCCWY.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"UBS to Research Blockchain Technology in London Lab","INTRO":"Swiss investment bank UBS will open a London-based research lab to explore the application of blockchain technology in the fintech industry.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Swiss investment bank UBS is set to open a London-based research lab to explore the application of blockchain technology in the financial services industry.The innovation lab, due to open later this month, will be housed at FinTech accelerator Level39 in Canary Wharf – one of London\u0027s major business districts.A group of financial technologists will lead the initiative, which attempts to bring together experts from both the banking and FinTech sectors to examine how traditional banking can drive business growth through innovation.Oliver Bussmann, group CIO at UBS, said in a statement:\"We are moving away from a purely in-house innovation strategy, optimising collaboration opportunities with the growing FinTech business, start-up and investor community in an open and transparent way,\" he continued.The news comes after the Swiss banking giant published an extensive report in March last year outlining the widespread benefits bitcoin\u0027s technology could offer if it was co-opted by the traditional banking system.Level39, credited with being Europe\u0027s largest technology accelerator for the financial and cyber industries, noted the \"far-reaching\" potential of blockchain technologies on its website:The accelerator attracted media attention in August last year when George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, withdrew £20 worth of bitcoin from an Robocoin ATM at its London\u0027s office during the Innovate Finance conference.— Innovate Finance (@InnFin) August 6, 2014Guest speaking at the event, Osborne outlined ambitions for the UK to become the centre of FinTech, including the UK Treasury\u0027s programme of work to assess the benefits and risks of digital currencies.He said: \"My message today is simple: we [Britain] stand at the dawn of new era of banking.

It\u0027s unlikely to completely go away,” she explained.According to Lee, Gibson Dunn is also interested in other applications of bitcoin’s underlying technology, the blockchain, and she sees many applications other than currency coming to the fore this year.“We think that some of the most interesting applications, from a legal perspective, are the potential use of blockchain technology for smart contracts, securities, property registers, IP and the storage of other data,” she told CoinDesk after the webinar.Speaking about what else 2015 has in store for the digital currency space, Lee said she is certain there will be continued growth and acceptance by large mainstream retailers.However, she believes it is likely there will also be more headlines centered around price volatility, security breaches and bitcoin’s use in illicit activities.With this in mind, Lee is confident more regulation related to digital currency will be created in the near future:Arthur Long, partner in Gibson Dunn’s New York office – one of 18 across the globe – also took part in the webinar and spoke specifically about regulation in New York State and across the nation.He said the state’s proposed BitLicence shows that “New York really wants to reach out and firmly establish control over virtual currencies”, adding that he believes many other states will follow the same approach.He told CoinDesk:Long, who is also co-chair of the Financial Institutions Practice Group at Gibson Dunn, believes this will slim down the number of players in the space, resulting in a only a handful of regulated exchanges operating in the US.“I think this will mean participants with the most financial backing and the most ability to deal with multiple regulatory requirements will come out on top over the next few years,” he said.Jeffrey Steiner, counsel in Gibson Dunn\u0027s Washington, DC, office, rounded off the webinar by discussing the general attitude the firm\u0027s clients have towards digital currency.He said many have expressed a desire to learn more about how digital currencies and blockchain technology can work in the context of their business operations.“There\u0027s certainly a lot of interest,” he concluded.","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, New York, US, Regulation, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Mar 15, 2015 at 1:30 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/14/bitcoin-and-igaming-disruption-comes-from-your-blind-spot/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/iruiPy0voEe4h4MvnV_hdZ5ocvs\u003d/570x350/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/XTMWFWXQMRD65NZQFTZDUS5A5U.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin and iGaming: Disruption Comes From Your Blind Spot","INTRO":"Bitcoin technology is set to disrupt online gaming and the big players had better start paying attention, says Jon Matonis.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"It has often been said that bitcoin is the ideal digital casino chip. But what does that really mean?For starters, it means that online gaming, more than anything else, is all about the customer experience.Whether it\u0027s a land-based casino or an online casino, gamblers want a seamless experience with immediacy and privacy, and operators want an irreversible payment method. Bitcoin provides all three.Of course, the mainstream online casino operators don\u0027t see it that way and I wouldn\u0027t expect them to. They have a profitable and expanding business model with national fiat currencies. Why would they want to disrupt that revenue stream?Funny thing about disruption though is that it rarely comes from within. Disruption comes from your blind spot.While major iGaming and industry gambling conferences in the west have paid lip service to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as alternative payment methods, they have simultaneously relegated it to a niche solution where presentations are neatly tucked away in a side corner. Kodak did the same thing after surprisingly inventing the first digital camera in 1975.The grand opportunity with bitcoin is not with the major operators, which is exactly why I predict that half of the top 10 iGaming operators will soon be bitcoin-only.New bitcoin gambling operations will evolve in that way organically – they will not be the major operators of today shedding their national fiat currency businesses. It will occur more along the lines of how Sony and Canon exploited Kodak\u0027s weak spot.The major differences between bitcoin-only operators and the majors are a stark reminder of how complacency for something unusual and new can threaten an entire business model. The differences are revolutionizing the playing field.For instance, bitcoin operators do not need to maintain a bank account anywhere in the world. If structured carefully, operating expenses can be covered entirely in bitcoin, including salaries and even real-time payouts to the all-important affiliates.And probably most important, solving the payment dilemma in parts of the world under-served by banks or restricted by traditional payment networks opens up the world\u0027s vast unregulated gambling markets.While some licensed and national currency gambling sites attempt to push funding compliance to bitcoin wallet providers, other gambling sites are moving forward now by accepting bitcoin directly from customers. Indeed, bitcoin\u0027s strengths and speed-to-market play very well in this fertile and untapped ground.These startling innovations will likely reshape the market for iGaming around the world, creating a new set of skills required for the industry, but that is not yet realized by today\u0027s mainstream market leaders.The management team decisions that bitcoin operators need to be focused on include:With the bitcoin network just a little over six years old, the current statistics related specifically to bitcoin and gaming are impressive.One hundred percent of the world\u0027s countries can be reached via the bitcoin payment option and no other payment method can make that claim. It has been estimated by Coinometrics and others that approximately 40% of bitcoin network transaction volume is related to payments for online gaming. Bitcoin-only casino operators lead the field for the bitcoin-related web advertising market. And, there are over 150 bitcoin-only casinos and gambling sites operating today.AnoniBetclaims to be the \"first bitcoin sportsbook and casino\" operating since 2011 and the original SatoshiDice pioneered the field of blockchain betting.Since the field is moving so rapidly, bitcoin gambling directories and lists have sprung up, with sites like my favorite Bitcoin Gambling Sites and the more objective Bitcoin Gambling Wiki. Some bitcoin gambling sites are simply too new to be listed, such as BurnTurn poker and the promising Augur project for a decentralized prediction market.If you want to see where the innovation in gaming occurs today, the bitcoin and blockchain sector is the place to look.My advice to bitcoin gaming businesses? Ignore the regulators.By that I mean the gaming commission regulators at least while the industry is in a grey area. They don\u0027t know what they are doing with respect to bitcoin and, out of apathy, they frequently push the opportunity to the financial regulators who end up delaying implementation.Bitcoin suffers from an outright usage ban or threatened ban in only three countries: Bolivia, Ecuador and Russia, which is still considering the final ban legislation, but blocks access to bitcoin-related websites in the meantime.Regulators are not leaders, they are followers. Don\u0027t count on them to be insightful and innovative. Their primary job is to slow you down.Do what you do best and build lasting and profitable businesses. Maybe even launch a skunkworks business within your organization. Failing that, perhaps acquire one of many bitcoin-only gambling operators from the industry lists above. Ultimately, it may assist in the upcoming drive to remain relevant.Follow the author on Twitter.Gambling image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Gambling, Blockchain Technology, Lifestyle, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/12/wedbush-teraexchange-execs-form-wall-street-bitcoin-advocacy-group/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/t22MBP1gWLIiBk_WfoNtz4Wfxtc\u003d/570x381/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/N7XRSILLB5A4FNLO6UWDGK2CIQ.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Wedbush, TeraExchange Execs Form Wall Street Bitcoin Advocacy Group","INTRO":"The Wall Street Bitcoin Alliance (WSBA) has launched to promote digital currency and blockchain technology adoption in the financial markets.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The Wall Street Bitcoin Alliance (WSBA) has launched to promote digital currency and blockchain technology adoption in the financial markets.

Her ex-husband, Daniel Masters, a former commodities trader at JP Morgan Chase \u0026 Co, set up the first regulated bitcoin fund, GABI, in Jersey last year.Speaking with CoinDesk in September, Masters echoed his ex-wife\u0027s statements on the future of cryptocurrency:Despite support from two of JP Morgan\u0027s former heavyweights, not everyone at the organisation agrees on bitcoin\u0027s potential.Jamie Dimon, the bank\u0027s chairman and CEO, has been famously dismissive of the technology: \"bitcoin developers are going to try and eat our lunch and that\u0027s fine.\"Imagevia Shutterstock.","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, Wall Street, Technology, JP Morgan, News, Digital Asset Holdings, Companies, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Mar 11, 2015 at 1:56 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/06/bitcoin-friendly-game-store-coinplay-relaunches/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/tNc7XNCm5Fvxr-hT18m-2ZCiJcs\u003d/570x321/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/downloads.coindesk.com/arc/failsafe/placeholders/16x9.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin-Friendly Game Store CoinPlay Relaunches","INTRO":"CoinPlay, the online PC game store that lets developers and publishers get paid in bitcoin, has relaunched following a series of design improvements.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"CoinPlay, the indie game site that lets developers and publishers get paid in bitcoin, has relaunched following a series of design improvements.Shane Park, CoinPlay\u0027s co-founder and CEO, told CoinDesk the relaunch was an important step for the company to move away from third-party solutions and implement its own e-commerce platform.\"The storefront will do a better job of showcasing games,\" he said, adding that \"game keys will be redeemed on the site to reduce email clutter and users will start earning Reward Coins (reward points) for every purchase they make\".CoinPlay accepts bitcoin, dogecoin and litecoin via payment processor GoCoin.Park added that the Kansas-city based company is monitoring trends in the bitcoin space and hinted at other potential digital currency initiatives in the future.He said:","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Gaming, startups, Blockchain, News, Companies, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Mar 6, 2015 at 2:03 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/26/blockchain-project-aims-to-bring-speed-transparency-to-wall-street-trading/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/xe3BPkT9oNQsp_sZV9Js_2H684k\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/EMGBFCB73JF5XJ7WNMZGFH7THI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain Project Aims to Bring Speed, Transparency to Wall Street Trading","INTRO":"Coinsetter has launched Project High Line, a blockchain-based technology that aims to improve how trades across Wall Street are executed.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Coinsetter has launched Project High Line, a blockchain-based technology that it claims will improve Wall Street\u0027s \"outdated\" trading system.The New York-based firm says that the project will help to attain a \"stark transparency\", replacing Wall Street\u0027s current settlement rails with a traceable blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) system, giving market participants further control of their assets.The High Line Project\u0027s \"On-Blockchain Settlement\" will also enable clients trading on the exchange to view their funds on the blockchain in near real time, without the need for an intermediary.Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of Coinsetter, said:The exchange says that the project is a \"shift from the status quo on Wall Street\", which aims to solve the problem of having to place trust in an exchange or intermediary.The news comes after Coinsetter announced that it intended to divide a 10% stake in the company\u0027s business among interested market makers willing to add liquidity to its order book at the end of last year.Wall Street image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Exchanges, Blockchain Technology, Coinsetter, New York, Wall Street, Technology, News, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 26, 2015 at 11:17 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/20/blockai-launches-netscape-for-bitcoin-with-blockchain-browser/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/EQP0i4FulN0Eh2dNKxMrg_oVvCQ\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/S3RM4USHTJEH5GI6UPJLVSUVLU.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockai Launches \u0027Netscape for Bitcoin\u0027 With Blockchain Browser","INTRO":"Blockai is seeking to make the blockchain more discoverable and shareable with the launch of its beta browser.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"“It was awkward and it was a viral loop. People tipped $150,000 in 10 days, and then a lot of people who got bitcoin... it sat there and they didn’t do anything with it, ever.”Blockai CEO Nathan Lands is referring to the spike in interest in first bitcoin project, QuickCoin, a Facebook-integrated wallet that sought to entice new users. That project has now evolved into Blockai (pronounced \u0027block-i\u0027), which takes a similar approach to spreading bitcoin, although it places more emphasis on the capabilities of its blockchain rather than its use as a digital currency.While resembling a social stream – more of a “frontpage for the blockchain” according to Lands – Blockai is a single application that seeks to merge a traditional Internet browser with a publishing tool. Using Blockai, users can read and comment on messages embedded into bitcoin blockchain metadata and also write and share their own creations.The end result, according to Lands, is that Blockai will help people find the blockchain, while allowing them to easily visualize its capabilities beyond bitcoin as a currency.Lands explained:To start, users will be able to post permanent messages, sign and timestamp documents and declare their love on the blockchain using Blockai’s tools. Once users create an account they select a username and add a profile photo, before adding funds to their wallet address.Perhaps most critically, it also includes a social sharing button and \u0027love button\u0027 that enables content creators to reward each other with tweets and micropayments.Lands went on to describe the project as one that could become a “trojan horse for bitcoin”, solving issues that led to difficulties with his first venture.“QuickCoin was amazing at getting bitcoin to people, but then there was nothing, it would die right there. You have to do something that’s a lot more meaningful,” Lands said.On a technical level, Blockai is a fully functioning bitcoin web wallet that is also used for reading and interpreting confirmed bitcoin blocks. This means that what users see on its colorful screen is a stream of the bitcoin network’s metadata.Blockai’s wallet software then runs in the browser and posts via a third-party blockchain API. Transactions are scanned and confirmed by its servers.“Everything you read or write on Blockai are full on-chain bitcoin transactions and we hold no privileged position. Anyone could create their own software that reads and writes the same data,” explained Blockai CTO William Cotton.To use the service, users send bitcoin to their Blockai wallet at no cost, although the price for sending messages and time-stamping documents is set at a price of 10 bits (around $0.002).As for how much control users have over the wallet, Cotton indicated it is now not possible for users to import or export private keys to another application, though he said such functionality could be added this year.“We\u0027d rather not give our users the option to import keys until we\u0027re assured that we\u0027ve got a secure solution in place,” Cotton added.Lands is keen to position Blockai as a Netscape-type breakthrough, referring to the pioneering browser that is credited with helping the world discover the potential of the Internet.“We want to show the world how to use the blockchain,” Lands said of the beta version of Blockai. “Obviously it’s a browser in terms of we’re digitizing the blockchain as a stream.”Over time, Lands sees Blockai evolving into more of an app store, allowing users to potentially discover other bitcoin applications and more easily understand how they are used with the help of a visual aid.“If your idea is you want to submit a document, maybe that’s how you’re going to use it. But different people are going to use it in different ways, the same way people are going to use the iPhone in different ways for different applications that are relevant to them,” Lands added.The Blockai team intend to keep their approach to the project open, and while they have ideas for new applications, Lands indicated they would be keen to respond to user feedback so that the service could evolve organically.Throughout the interview, Lands stressed that Blockai is only in beta, meaning that the initial set of capabilities it enables are more novelties, examples of how the service could evolve, and thus not indicative of its potential usefulness.For example, Lands noted his background at gamification startup Gamify, as well as Cotton’s prior experience in the music industry as factors that would influence how Blockai intends to diversify in the coming months.[post-quote]Regardless of the service, however, the intent is that Blockai enables content creators to use the blockchain as a means of publishing, so that the viral growth that propels social platforms can bring added attention to the blockchain.“We don’t have a lot of viral features in there yet, but obviously it’s going to be improved,” Lands said, arguing that, whatever the service adds, these tools will at least appeal to users who may not have been persuaded to investigate bitcoin as a currency.“I really think that not everyone is going to get into bitcoin because of speculation,” he explained. \"You can send bitcoin to someone with no purpose, but I think those things are going to result in bitcoin spreading at an OK rate, versus if you try to give people interesting things to do with bitcoin and then invite them to spread it.”Given that Blockai is seeking to take advantage of bitcoin’s metadata, however, the service is likely to stir up debate regarding whether the blockchain should be used principally for financial use cases.For instance, critics have long argued that non-financial uses \u0027bloat\u0027 or spam the blockchain with unnecessary transactions. However, Cotton and Lands don’t see their service as one that will be problematic for the network as a whole.“We\u0027re currently not doing anything to prevent either spam or bloat, as neither have really become an issue just yet,” Cotton said. “There are only around 17,400 total transactions with OP_RETURN data. These transactions account for around 700kb of data embedded in 16mb of transactions. This is a drop in the pond compared to the rest of the blockchain.”Nonetheless, they acknowledged their methods might be controversial, adding that they’ll be “actively monitoring” the effects of their service on the blockchain when such issues “become more than just speculation”.Of course, given that Blockai is making metadata visible in the blockchain, there arises concerns about whether bitcoin users would be unknowingly making certain materials discoverable to the tool’s users.Lands said that while, in theory, users could have the option to hide metadata transactions from Blockai, such a capability is not yet on the horizon for the product. First, the project will look to implement filtering features for users, so they can uncover more relevant information on the blockchain.“They\u0027ll start off with simple filters, which we\u0027ll be implementing pretty soon,” Lands said. He added that, as with Internet browsers before it: \"Over time we\u0027ll want to give you better ways to see more relevant data.\"Images via Blockai; Browser image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Technology, Social Media, News, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 20, 2015 at 2:03 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/20/philippines-startup-lets-coinbase-users-remit-cash/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/tNc7XNCm5Fvxr-hT18m-2ZCiJcs\u003d/570x321/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/downloads.coindesk.com/arc/failsafe/placeholders/16x9.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Philippines Startup Lets Coinbase Users Remit Cash","INTRO":"Coinbase customers in 24 countries can now use a cash-to-cash remittance service based on the blockchain to send money to the Philippines.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Coinbase customers in 24 countries will now be able to use a cash-to-cash remittance service based on bitcoin\u0027s blockchain to send money to the Philippines.By employing Coinbase\u0027s API, Philippines-based Coins.ph is allowing the wallet and exchange platform\u0027s two million registered users to send pesos to recipients in the Southeast Asian country through a variety of delivery methods.To use the service, users must place a sell order directly on Coins.ph and pay with their authorised Coinbase wallets in USD.

One way or another, they all cooked the books to hide their true financial position, at the expense of investors, customers, and sometimes, the tax payer. Could the blockchain be used to stop corporate fraud?It’s unlikely that large organizations would begin trading entirely in bitcoin, but some believe that distributed ledgers could be used to \u0027bake\u0027 verified transactions directly into a company’s accounts, even if those transactions are conducted in fiat currency.Charles Hoskinson, former CEO of Ethereum, believes that accounting is one of the next big opportunities for the blockchain.Hoskinson said:One of the biggest advantages that the blockchain brings to cryptocurrency transactions is that the transaction and the record of the transaction are the same thing. When you send someone bitcoin, the blockchain not only makes that transfer, but provides an eternal, immutable record of it.Marrying the transaction and the record would be invaluable when a company came to audit its transactions. So explained Roger Willis, a UK-based tech entrepreneur with an accounting background who has written about the value of merging the two together.“You can embed the accounting for the transaction within the transaction, and you can get participants for these networks to approve these transactions as they happen,” he said.This has several benefits for companies needing to audit their books.The first is broad integrity across all transactions. Today, auditors will typically only be able to verify a small sample of transactions in a large company, Willis said. They approve the rest based on statistical probabilities. Merging transaction and record together creates a more comprehensive and explorable view of an organisation’s transaction history.The other benefit is continual auditability. Auditors could come in and do a complete spot-check audit at any time, because the record would always be complete up to the current point. It would be a ‘clean as you go’ approach to auditing.“Audit hasn’t changed for a long time, and it needs to. The tech revolution went past audit and accounting and never looked back,” said Willis, suggesting that the big four auditors have little incentive to change the status quo.Willis doesn’t think the public blockchain is a good fit for this task, though, citing the privacy of transactions as a concern.Instead, TriplEntry, the system he is currently building, uses a central server as an intermediary between senders and recipients of invoices. They both digitally sign an invoice, and TriplEntry\u0027s server provides the third signature, acting as a trusted third party.Others are more positive about the use of public blockchain technology as a distributed ledger for accounting. Blockstream founder Austin Hill is already experimenting with it.“Blockchain technology by its nature is public. If you’re running a private alt chain, there’s no guarantee that you can’t play all sorts of games,” he said. The greater and more distributed the blockchain’s hash rate, the more trustworthy it will be, he suggested.Hill acknowledges that privacy would be a problem, however, and suggests that one-way homomorphic encryption would be a useful way to protect the privacy of transactions in a public blockchain ledger.“You can hide the value of a transaction so that only authorised people can see its value, but it would still be recorded in a public ledger” he said. “This would allow the accounting systems, or potentially risk managers looking at a company’s stock, to say ‘the books add up, but we\u0027re not allowed to know the values’.”Insurance companies could prove that they hadn’t violated reinsurance rates, without having to reveal the full value of their portfolios, for example.Getting all those transactions onto a large blockchain like bitcoin is where Blockstream hopes its system will come in. The firm uses sidechains technology to offload transactions from the bitcoin blockchain. Another alternative could be the use of a \u0027notary chain\u0027, as offered by Factom.The problem here is the merging of an accounting transaction and a record in a journal, as Willis describes, so that one becomes the other. If companies are making transactions in cryptocurrency, that’s easily done. But what about those that aren’t? Most companies trade in fiat currency, or stocks, or property, or other assets.Simply merging accounting systems with a distributed blockchain ledger wouldn’t be enough to validate transactions. To be truly verified, those transactions, rather than just the records of them, have to be recorded in the blockchain too.Let’s say two companies make a transaction, with one selling something to the other in US dollars. Who’s to say that they couldn’t collude, to make that record in their accounting system far smaller or larger than they actually were?Unless the payment system that was used to send the fiat currency from one to the other was also writing to the blockchain, then you’re just relying on the two companies’ word for it. Lies encoded into the blockchain are still lies. They’re just immutable lies.This is the larger challenge, says Hill. “Companies receive payment via SWIFT, via business-to-business checks, or card data. [However,] I’m aware of a business-to-business checking company that’s trying to replace paper-based cheques in parts of the developing world. They want to replace cheques with blockchain transactions,” he said.“If those kinds of services evolve, where we see more of the payment networks moving to technology, then we could have a far larger majority of a company’s business affairs being conducted on the blockchain, and auditable a priori,” he continued.This isn’t something that payment networks will necessarily do on their own without help. Blockstream is already building a software stack that, Hill says, will allow developers to build out solutions.We’re a long way from a point where non-cryptocurrency payment networks all write to the blockchain, but Hill maintains that allowing developers to build out sidechain solutions will begin to draw payment networks towards this approach. He would like to see global remittance networks, forex exchanges and asset-to-asset exchanges hopping on board too.One of the first places this could start is bitcoin exchanges, which still face a challenging audit problem, especially given the historical issues over cybersecurity and the integrity of their reserves.The broader opportunities are far greater, Hoskinson said, suggesting that if we can pull this off, it could create a useful means for investors to analyse accounts across different organisations more effectively.He said:While bitcoin continues the uphill journey from speculative asset to everyday means of exchange, the real opportunity for businesses may lie with the technology underneath it. Although human ingenuity being what it is, crooks may always find a way.Audit image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Technology, Audits, Blockstream, Accounting, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"Feb 7, 2015 at 11:56 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/15/how-bitcoins-block-chain-could-stop-history-being-rewritten/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/gunjlxiiGXTXIo_1mr8ebfZTXGk\u003d/570x366/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/VYH23JWU7JCTREJO65CT7AUPLA.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How Bitcoin\u0027s Block Chain Could Stop History Being Rewritten","INTRO":"Bitcoin\u0027s block chain can store more than transactions. According to Julian Assange, it provides a way to preserve history.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Despite the recent drop in bitcoin\u0027s price, cryptocurrency startups are now attracting more investment than ever and stories about major developments in the bitcoin ecosystem are being picked up by mainstream media on a regular basis.The New York Times reported the news that popular bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain had raised $30.5m in financing. Last week, Time published an article titled How Bitcoin Can Save Journalism and the Arts, exploring bitcoin’s micropayment capability for creating a new model of content distribution that is free from advertising.Yet, long before this new interest and innovation sparked outside the tech community, WikiLeaks editor-in-chief Julian Assange was seeing the promise of the bitcoin technology beyond currency.The confluence of this stateless digital currency and the iconic whistle-blowing site first emerged when WikiLeaks faced a financial blockade by Bank of America, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Western Union, which reportedly blocked 95% of their revenue.Bitcoin was used to circumvent the banking blockade. Here the advocates for the free flow of decentralized currency joined the fight for free speech.In his conversation with Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt documented in his new book When Google Met WikiLeaks, Assange described bitcoin as “something that evolved out of the cypherpunks” and explained in detail the underpinning technology that made it possible for WikiLeaks to counteract the state’s economic censorship.However, it seems this is just the tip of the iceberg of the WikiLeaks-bitcoin alliance and the revolutionary potential hidden within the encryption-based network. The ramifications of bitcoin technology go far beyond the economic domain.Appearing in the form of a hologram at The Nantucket Project conference, Assange spoke of the significance of the block chain, the underlying technology of bitcoin, particularly in relation to journalism and holding those in power to account.Assange addressed the use of the block chain to create an historical archive. Calling bitcoin “the most interesting intellectual development on the Internet in the last five years\", he described how the underlying architecture can be used for “providing proof of publishing at a certain time”.See a video of Assange\u0027s comments below:The block chain’s premise seemed to unite with WikiLeaks’ mission. In April 2010, Assange took the stage at the Oslo Freedom Forum, where he warned of the enormous force of control and power within the Internet and increasing censorship that threatens the free flow of information.He spoke of the vital role of human intellectual content in civilization and described how, in this age of technology, everything is moving to digital. This power, often accrued by an unelected few, has increased through control of digital storage and access to information. This makes possible the erasing or altering of information that is critical to the historical record. He pointed out:Dismantling this force of control has been WikiLeaks’ mission. By employing its method of transparency in the form of \u0027scientific journalism\u0027, they aimed to open governments and reveal their actions behind closed doors.Through liberating the flow of information that had been stagnated by secrecy, complexity and manipulation, the organization strove to break Orwell’s dictum and bring the power to shape history into the hands of ordinary people.Four years later, WikiLeaks is still on the front lines of this battle. In his new book, Assange again addressed the escalating implementation of Orwell’s dictum.Giving an example of an incident where the Guardian pulled six articles from 2003 without explanation, he emphasized how WikiLeaks’ primary focus was to preserve “politically salient intellectual content while it is under attack” by going after information that has been suppressed or deleted.Assange found a solution in the evolving block-chain technology. This provides decentralized solutions to the problems of centralized time stamping, as this requires trust in central authority, making it susceptible to third-party alteration and intervention.Bitcoin’s distributed trust network can offer immunity from central control of any historical record. Assange described the basic premise of this technology as a network of consensus where “you can prove a particular statement, particular consensus and particular contract that happened at a particular time globally and it requires the subversion of every single jurisdiction where people are running bitcoin to overturn that”.[post-quote]In a nutshell, he noted: “bitcoin’s underlying technology breaks Orwell’s dictum”.Some people have already used the block chain to store more than just transactions. In his blog, Ken Shirriff documented the result of his search through the block-chain \u0027database\u0027, reporting his discovery of interesting things including Satoshi Nakamoto’s white-paper, an image of Nelson Mandela and a 2.5-megabyte WikiLeaks cablegate backup. This information is now securely documented and cannot be erased or modified by anyone.Proof of Existenceis an example of the application of decentralized proof. This online service provides a way for people to publicly prove the existence of documents without revealing the data or their identity through bitcoin’s decentralized trust network.It is a continuation of the earlier waves of decentralization of information seen in the last decade with the rise of Wikipedia, through its open-source collaborative production of a historical record – an online decentralized encyclopedia.Just as the Internet brought the everyday person the power to create their own narratives, the invention of the block chain further empowers people and challenges the insidious culture of ownership and control.With unprecedented currency crises and government corruption, people are increasingly looking for alternatives to state and corporate control. As more begin to move into bitcoin to avoid government debasement, it isn’t far-fetched to imagine how this stateless public asset ledger could also become a new safe haven for investigative journalism and whistle-blowers.A lot has happened since that day in Oslo when Assange identified the conundrum of our age. As the battle to break Orwell’s dictum intensifies, we now have in our hands a great tool to open up society.Bitcoin can not only be used to fund revolutionary journalism like WikiLeaks, but also offers a decentralized platform for anyone to directly combat state censorship of information and create transparency for those in power.The invention of bitcoin is just one crest of the continuous waves of a cryptographic revolution. As Assange said, this could free us from Orwell’s dictum.In a time of seemingly universal deceit, reclaiming our past on the block chain is quickly becoming a revolutionary act.Disclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of, and should not be attributed to, CoinDesk.Locked file image via Shutterstock.","TAGS":"WikiLeaks, Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Protocol, Julian Assange, Bitcoin, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Oct 15, 2014 at 10:46 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/14/imf-and-world-bank-panel-bitcoin-block-chain-could-boost-financial-inclusion/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/sXO6kRqszzXEWBRF95xVz2fsUqM\u003d/570x318/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/AAUU4P63KFH5BFGHATCN4E6B5Y.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"IMF and World Bank Panel: Bitcoin Block Chain Could Boost Financial Inclusion","INTRO":"An International Monetary Fund and World Bank panel looked at bitcoin\u0027s potential role in financial inclusion this week.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"This weekend private and public sector delegates convened for a panel discussion about technology’s role in achieving greater global financial inclusion as part of a four-part seminar series at the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group in Washington, DC.The panelists included Standard Chartered Bank group chief executive Peter Sands; Colombian Minister of Finance and Public Credit Mauricio Cárdenas; Visa global head of strategic partnerships Bill Gajda; JPMorgan Chase global chair of technology, media and telecom and investment banking Jennifer Nason; and professor of economics at Yale University Dean Karlan. Vice chairman of the US Federal Reserve board Stanley Fischer moderated the discussion.At the outset, Sands spoke generally about the need for business model reforms to allow the operational and commercial impact of technology’s promise in the financial services industry.“What we haven’t seen is this kind of sweeping, total transformation of the business model that you’ve seen in industries like music or publishing – and the reason I talk about those is that they’re digital industries and there is nothing about banking that is inherently physical,” he said, adding:Sands was also the one that later introduced the matter of “cyber currencies – bitcoin and so on” and the only delegate to voice his position on them. He said he is unconvinced that they will be more than a niche application, but called the underpinning block chain technology “a true computational innovation that could be very powerful in the context of financial inclusion”.Gajda echoed Sands’ sentiments about the business model, saying there is a lot of work required to address things like transaction costs for micropayments and issues of interoperability.While the delegates from the banking and payments industries gave favorable responses to the wave of new technology and innovation so ingrained now in financial services, he said that interoperability will be key in driving the next level of scale. To get there, Gajda concluded, would require some business model innovation from everyone.The Visa executive didn’t speak about digital currencies specifically, though one could apply many of his points on how to use technology to help financial services grow and move towards alleviating global poverty to bitcoin itself.Gajda noted:There is a counterpart to the financial aspect of financial inclusion: fundamental property rights.Sands appeared enthusiastic about the potential of bitcoin technology and its potential to reform titled property, which he called “the most bureaucratic, inefficient mechanism there is” in Western countries as well as the developing world.He explained:If people are going to become economic actors, he added, they must be enabled to establish and transfer property rights, especially as they acquire entrepreneurial tools and skills and eventually become small business owners.“That’s where I think actually some of these block chain technologies could be really powerful,” Sands concluded.Cárdenas focused more on the currency aspect of digital currencies, maintaining a critical attitude toward the technology during his remarks.When discussing inclusion, he put particular importance on the need for a money transfer system in which the sender isn’t required to pay up to 10% in related transaction fees.“We need to make sure that people who are using those services that are so overpriced have access to technologies where they can take advantage of these efficiencies,” he said. “And that means using less cash.”However, he added that when he thinks of bitcoin, he also thinks about the value of controlling money “in the broad sense”, placing a lot of weight on policy as a means of stabilizing any economy, generating the conditions for growth and low inflaton, and doing so “under the traditional payments system”.To this, Fischer responded:Image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, IMF, World Bank Group, News, Events, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Oct 14, 2014 at 11:00 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/10/04/ibm-executive-highlights-block-chains-utility-for-internet-of-things/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/rtAxc-JrH09vBLQA7oAPMdAE-Uw\u003d/570x314/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/O7VZHU7Y4VAXTILNFUYUVGQBRE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"IBM Executive Highlights Block Chain\u0027s Utility for Internet of Things","INTRO":"IBM internet of things guru Paul Brody discusses how the block chain could revolutionize large-scale device networks.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Precisely what the so-called \"Internet of Things\" will look like five or ten years from now is difficult to say, but it’s not out of the question that a block chain may be behind some of the next-generation technologies that companies like IBM are developing in order to build what may also be called the connected economy.Regardless of the phrase or buzzword, the concept envisions a world in which all devices, places and people are interconnected networks, sharing data and information at lightning speeds among one another. Mobile devices, smart appliances, vehicles, even homes – the Internet of Things may come to be known as the Internet of everything in certain areas of the world decades from now.How does the block chain – the underlying distributed ledger of the Bitcoin protocol – fit into the Internet of Things? Some see the block chain acting as the spine for a distributed network of devices, with each device acting as a miner of sorts to transmit data between all the points on the network. For IBM, which is developing its a proof-of-concept called Adept, the block chain holds the key to creating a feasible and functioning distributed network.Paul Brody, IBM vice president and North American leader for mobile and Internet of Things, told CoinDesk in a new interview that there are companies and organizations all over the world that have a real need to be able to connect devices or appliances in order to gather data. He gave an example of a health organization that used sensors placed on faucets to track hand washing rates in order to develop future policies.Yet the cost of maintaining this type of framework makes it expensive and impractical for broad deployment. Brody said that IBM began to look at other solutions that were both more cost-effective and secure. He cited security as a necessity, given the risks associated with large-scale central data control, particularly if that information is sensitive or financial-related.Brody told CoinDesk:The quest to create a distributed network of devices capable of communicating with each other reliably is decades old. The Byzantine generals problem, in which a spread-out army is unable to trust its corp of separate generals given the risk of sabotage, lies at the heart of why, for many years, computing has operated around centralized structures.Brody said the block chain solves these problems by creating an environment in which only a majority (rather than all) of the nodes have to be trusted. He predicted that its ability to create large, low-cost networks will make the block chain in high demand as a technology backbone.“I think that demand for the block chain technology, the programmable ledger, autonomous distributed systems is going to be colossal,” he said.Self-regulation and maintenance is another big draw of the block chain from IBM’s perspective. Brody said the block chain can eliminate nearly all the costs of running a centralized device network structure:Brody said that the secretive block chain project IBM is working on with Samsung is affording the two companies a deep look into exactly how this technology might work in a real-world setting. He declined to give further details, but told CoinDesk that the goal remains to have a demonstrable proof-of-concept sometime next year.Brody said that it’s too early to say what the practical characteristics a block chain-powered network of devices might have, but he did give a glimpse into some of the conceptual ideas IBM is playing with.He said that smart contracts or programmed transactions could be used to interact with home appliances or even to enter the residence in the first place. A smart watch may contain smart contract triggers that detect a beacon placed in the doorway that triggers the latch and opens it once the micro transaction from the watch is received on the home’s block chain.Brody explained:One problem, he continued, lies in the speed of transactions. A homeowner wouldn’t want to wait five minutes in order to unlock their door or turn on a light every time they come and go. Brody said that one solution IBM could use involves programming a home’s “family of devices” to remember the source of a smart contract.Brody said repeatedly that the goal is to build a smarter network of devices that are capable of sharing energy and bandwidth, making decisions and squeezing every ounce of efficiency out of themselves during operation.He explained:From there, one can create autonomous systems that operate in tandem, capable of making collective decisions based on an operational need. Using a washing machine as an example, he said that smart appliances can receive data from an outside source and adjust their power consumption or change their settings in order to be more efficient.Brody added that it’s feasible that hundreds of billions of devices could one day be connected on a single block chain or network of block chains, all of which communicate with each other via automated transactions. He envisioned an ecosystem of both centralized and decentralized systems based on security needs, but ultimately, pushing automated system intelligence to new heights.Image via Shutterstock, YouTube","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, IBM, Internet of Things, Samsung, Companies, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Oct 4, 2014 at 1:09 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/16/university-of-nicosia-issues-block-chain-verified-certificates/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/r52ABxSM-IH9BplQ0icCUxtpKQU\u003d/570x458/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/OJ2IXEU6KJFAFKSBY44XFRADYY.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"University of Nicosia Issues Block-Chain Verified Certificates","INTRO":"Students completing the University of Nicosia\u0027s digital currency course have had their certificates preserved on the block chain.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Certificates for a pioneering course on cryptocurrencies by the University of Nicosia in Cyprus were recorded on the block chain yesterday, allowing anyone to verify their authenticity.The free online course, titled DFIN-511: Introduction to Digital Currencies, was taught by Antonis Polemitis and Andreas M Antonopoulos.The duo published a comprehensive explanation of how they designed the certificates to be block chain verifiable. This means that course graduates no longer have to rely on the university to verify that they completed the course successfully.\"Even if the University of Nicosia and its website were to disappear, so long as the validated hash still exists as a public record, people can [...] authenticate any certificate,\" the course website said.— Digital Currency (@MScDigital) September 15, 2014Verifying the university\u0027s certificates relies on the OP_RETURN field that is contained in each transaction. The field was designed to allow a small amount of extra data to be stored in the block chain, as a first step towards allowing assets like property or documents like contracts to be exchanged using the protocol.The course instructors created hashes of the PDF versions of each certificate, collated all the certificates into an index document, and then generated a hash of that. This hash was then entered into the OP_RETURN field of an unspendable transaction.Hashes are unique strings of characters that can be generated by any input, using an algorithm. In this case, the SHA-256 algorithm, which is also used in the bitcoin protocol, was used. Hashes are only one-way, so someone with a particular certificate can replicate a hash using the algorithm, but that hash can\u0027t regenerate the certificate.The instructors have published the hash of the certificate index on the university\u0027s website. Anyone who wishes to verify a certificate must first check that he has the correct index document. This is done by checking the OP_RETURN field of the particular transaction sent by the instructors.Once the index has been verified, then individual certificates can be verified. This is done by creating a SHA-256 hash of a given certificate, and then comparing it against the hashes listed in the authenticated index document.The hash of the index document is published on the University of Nicosia website, along with the specific transaction containing this data. The hash contained in the transaction\u0027s OP_RETURN field can be seen at sites like Coin Secrets.For the validation process to work, the index document has to be readily available. The course instructors note that students are encouraged to host the index document themselves to reduce reliance on the document located on the university\u0027s website.The course instructors also announced that the course completion rate was over 20% from a cohort of 615 students. The next session of the course is scheduled to start on 15th October.The University of Nicosia is a visible proponent of cryptocurrencies, accepting bitcoin for tuition fees and offering a masters degree in digital currencies.","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Andreas Antonopoulos, University of Nicosia, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 16, 2014 at 12:49 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/10/ibm-sees-role-for-block-chain-in-internet-of-things/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/_lzuQUl3WVMtKPdMkJIef2tP3EY\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/22HYMHTBW5CCZBZCGYKV7TMXDE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"IBM Sees Role for Block Chain in Internet of Things","INTRO":"IBM researchers are looking into the possibility of using block chain technology to underpin the Internet of Things.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"IBM researchers are looking into the possibility of using block chain technology for the Internet of Things (IoT) – a term for the growing network of devices with basic computer-like capabilities that communicate over the web.The IoT is likely to bring a major change in the way we use technology, with interaction between connected everyday devices (such as pacemakers, fire alarms or air-conditioning units) and humans increasingly becoming the norm.Now IBM is examining the use of block chain technology for an IoT distribution platform, backed by other peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies.The system, dubbed \u0027Adept\u0027, will rely on three different technologies to resolve a number of issues related to IoT development and commercialisation.Although it was conceived in IBM’s labs, Adept is not an official \u0027Big Blue\u0027 product. Instead, it is open-source software to be released on GitHub.Adept will employ block chain technology in its distributed transaction processing engine that will allow IoT devices to communicate and interact with one another.Paul Brody, head of mobile and Internet of Things at IBM, told Gigaom that block chain technology can allow IoT devices to ‘understand’ what other devices around them are up to and it can support different kinds of instructions and permissions.The block chain could allow devices to track other devices and their relationship to them, while maintaining security and offloading the power-hungry authentication process to the block chain network. The devices could store their ‘relationships’ with other devices via the block chain, allowing them to authenticate other devices and users.IBM plans to use another P2P technology to ensure connectivity. BitTorrent – a protocol commonly used for file sharing – could be used to move packets of data on slow networks. Since many IoT devices will not have a wasteful high-speed modem and always-on connectivity, a P2P system like BitTorrent would provide a more robust network, the team says.The third technology to be employed in Adept is Telehash, a private messaging protocol with end-to-end encryption. Other services can be built on top of it, allowing secure communication between various IoT devices.Brody said there are two main reasons behind his team’s decision to use P2P technologies. Cost is the primary factor, as managing all IoT devices in a centralised cloud would simply be too expensive in the long run. IoT devices are envisioned as low-cost, low-maintenance devices that should run for years if not decades.The sheer number of devices represents a big challenge too. Speaking at the Intel Developer Forum 2014 on Tuesday, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said the company expects as many as 50 billion connected devices will be deployed by the end of the decade.Market research firm Gartner has given the more conservative estimate that 26 billion IoT devices will be installed by 2020, but said even this number will generate incremental value exceeding $300bn. With such figures in mind, it is clear that Brody’s decentralised peer-to-peer system could tap into a huge emerging market.Another factor is the business model itself. IBM\u0027s Brody said the block chain could lead to new business models for all companies involved in the space, allowing IoT devices to share data, processing power, bandwidth and even electricity.Brody outlined his vision for a decentralised Internet of Things in a Gigaom podcast earlier this week. In essence, the block chain approach proposed by Brady would not have to rely on scarcity like bitcoin, which means it could operate without industrial-scale mining which is slowly taking over the bitcoin network.Internet of Things image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, IBM, Technology, Internet of Things, News, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 10, 2014 at 1:16 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/09/03/why-new-forms-of-spam-could-bloat-bitcoins-block-chain/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/TWH01793NcSDBDIf1GXZlbaovXA\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/ZQIFIXDE3ZDYPKI2B3UTG4REOE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Why New Forms of Spam Could Bloat Bitcoin\u0027s Block Chain","INTRO":"The block chain has potential uses beyond storing transactions, but could they pose a risk to bitcoin?","DETAILED_CONTENT":"New technologies bring the promise of exciting new services, but they also encourage those looking to make a quick buck at the expense of others.Email is a prime example of this. When the Internet began its rise to popularity in the 1990s, it was obvious the technology could be utilized to provide an easier way for people to communicate.However, email\u0027s no-cost model enticed many people who saw it as a cheap advertising medium, quickly creating a plague of annoying spam messages that advertised often-undesirable products.More recently, bitcoin\u0027s public ledger, the block chain, has been recognised for its potential to serve as a low-cost means of recording cryptocurrency transactions and also other types of digital information.Some, though, fear that unscrupulous actors will leverage this feature to turn the block chain into a cheap place to publish new types of spam, and that it could become \u0027bloated\u0027 as a result – in effect, overloaded with data that has nothing to do with its primary purpose.Dogecoin co-founder Jackson Palmer sees the issue as a potential problem:The block chain’s ability to use cryptographic hashes as a permanent and public way to record and store information is impressive.This, in turn, has attracted the efforts of projects such as Monegraph and Proof of Existence, which provide software to help people hash things such as art or software to prove authorship of the works.Now there is concern that, while the above concepts are being created to utilize the block chain in a positive way, others might try to use it as a wasteful advertising method.Marcell Ortutay, a developer who has built an open-source bitcoin microtransactions platform called Coinwall, thinks that some efforts to exploit the block chain may go too far:While that website\u0027s ability to hash messages to significant others is an interesting experimental use case, the application of such probably doesn’t justify merit on the bitcoin block chain.Ortutay dismisses sites like thenoteblock as a problem that will just go away on its own: “No special action is needed to prevent these messages; they will stop once demand dries up,” he said.In fact, some kind of protection is built in to the bitcoin system too. One effort made known on Reddit regarding the sending of 0.00000001 BTC to addresses advertising a bitcoin gambling service did not receive confirmations from the network because miners received no fees.What may be considered more problematic are tokens that use the bitcoin block chain to gain some measure of legitimacy, and some people already consider these tokens as a form of spam.“Most controversial [are] things like Counterparty and Mastercoin”, said Coinwall’s Ortutay. “They try to use the block chain as a datastore for various protocols, where things like bids/asks are embedded in bitcoin transactions.”Scott Li, a co-founder of block chain API company Hello, block!, agrees:Changes are afoot, however, and the ability to store data in the block chain was actually reduced by the bitcoin core developers earlier this year with the release of the Bitcoin Core version 0.9.0.Li says experimentation into these types of data storage concepts could be tested via side chains – linked \u0027shards\u0027, or copies, of the block chain that provide the same functionality, but avoid inundating bitcoin\u0027s only public ledger.“I\u0027m optimistic about side chains, which could be a clean experimentation ground for ‘bitcoin 2.0’ protocols and remove the spam,” said Li.Bitcoin, in particular, has a system in place that discourages people from spamming the block chain. Attacks can be carried out via a variety of methods, including one known as a \u0027dust attack\u0027, in which the many transactions sent are so small that miners have no incentive to hash.Bitcoin\u0027s transaction fees were actually lowered earlier this year, due to the rise in price, but even that has not invited spammers to think the block chain is a place for unsolicited advertising yet.There have been rumblings that, eventually, a floating fee structure may be put into place that will create a kind of market around the confirming of transactions, thus further preventing spamming.Additionally, some, like Palmer, don\u0027t believe that bitcoin\u0027s proof of work (which creates the need for bitcoin mining) is the best way forward, and all sorts of different scenarios could be introduced to replace it.Palmer told CoinDesk:This could usher in more experimentation with consensus, using totally different incentive structures, and could even include the creation of specific disincentives for data that bloats a ledger.Marc Andreessen proposed in his widely-read New York Times piece Why Bitcoin Matters that bitcoin could help solve problems associated with email spam.Ironically enough, though, bitcoin could have problems of its own in terms of being able to limit spam-like issues in the block chain.Interestingly, it has been the work of Google, in collaboration with non-profits like the Spamhaus Project, that has provided technology that can reduce the amount of email spam users actually see, making unsolicited emails largely an issue that only technology professionals must contend with.As far as bitcoin goes, whether it is through a side chains or a brainwave from some startup developer, a method to eliminate the threat of cryptographic-based block chain spam will be developed.Companies like BitHalo, for example, are already trying to avoid block chain bloat by using a peer-to-peer system to connect one party to another for the distribution of smart contracts.This is an interesting idea, but, for bitcoin, the bigger problem to contend with right now is achieving mass consumer adoption. Of course, increasing user numbers could provide extra incentives for block chain spammers.The question, in the end, may come down to the future of mining fees, given that they are what will end up supporting the future network when block generation is no longer a revenue stream for miners. This will likely be the ultimate factor in determining bloat, which transactions will be confirmed – and which ones will not.Information flow image via ShutterstockDisclaimer: The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of, and should not be attributed to, CoinDesk.","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Technology, Spam, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Sep 3, 2014 at 7:20 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/27/blocksign-utilises-block-chain-to-verify-signed-contracts/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/xbjnbZ8VR2h8WY7kpzzlZvXAMNk\u003d/570x420/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/VL453H4HZ5EKBHW2CACGPIWYAA.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BlockSign Utilises Block Chain to Verify Signed Contracts","INTRO":"BlockSign allows documents to be digitally signed online and preserves a verifiable record in the bitcoin block chain.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A new company, BlockSign, lets customers digitally sign legally binding contracts and preserve them in the public domain.Running on the block chain, the decentralised public ledger that records transactions on the bitcoin network, the BlockSign platform provides a way to sign, timestamp and later verify documents on the web.From a user perspective, BlockSign works as a web application. A PDF signed with the program will indicate where a signature is to be placed, and the user places a stamp in a stylized font there. Into this signature is encoded an email address and the date.The BlockSign service then creates a cryptographic hash of the entire document, which it stores in a 40-byte slot included in every bitcoin block, called OP_RETURN. That slot can be used for storing messages and other arbitrary data.That means that the hash is logged in the block chain. “We verify the document, running it through the hashing function, and we search the block chain for the string to see if it has been logged,” said founder Nicholas Thorne.A verification record stored by the company on the user’s behalf enables users to check that a particular document is signed and valid.The system’s security relies on two-factor authentication. It sends a confirmation request to the user via email to confirm their identity. Of course, email is notoriously insecure, so Thorne hopes to use private keys at some point.Not all developers are enthusiastic about the idea of using bitcoin for timestamping documents.“In my opinion, ideally the bitcoin block chain should be used for bitcoin payments,” says Adam Back. He developed Hashcash, the algorithm bitcoin uses to generate and verify currency, and has also been working on a system for application-specific block chains, linked to bitcoin’s own.OP_RETURN’s 40 bytes were originally meant to be 80 bytes. Today, the 40-byte limit compares to an average recent transaction size of 570 bytes, which makes its theoretical limit roughly 7% of the average block size.BlockSign doesn’t use all of that OP_RETURN space. It only uses 32 bytes for its hash – and the slot is not used by many people at all today. Roughly a quarter of blocks used OP_RETURN in a recent 80-block block chain sample.Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn isn’t worried about more companies using OP_RETURN for their networks.“Bitcoin’s limiting factor today is actually growing legitimate usage and traffic,” he said. “The more users we have, the more political immunity we have, so if some of those users care more about time-stamping documents than buying things, that’s OK by me. I’m sure bitcoin can scale to accommodate everyone.”Having said that, if use of OP_RETURN for applications like BlockSign\u0027s caught on, it could be more expensive, Hearn said. \"Like any bitcoin transaction, you have to pay for it using either fees or coin priority. If some company were to start using lots of these transactions, the fee costs would start to increase.\"Both Hearn and Back recommend using a Merkle tree structure, which enables many timestamps to be compressed into a single OP_RETURN output. \"This would be a way to save money for only a little bit of extra code,\" Hearn says.However, Thorne says that the team hasn\u0027t used the Merkle tree system in its first release, arguing that the company wanted to get a product out there that was simple to use. However, the team is considering Merkle tree storage for a future release, he says, arguing that the venture doesn\u0027t yet have the volume to make it an issue. BlockSign will have to swallow more transaction fees in the meantime.There is another question, however: should companies piggyback private, for-profit activities on the block chain without investing time in supporting bitcoin development?Thorne admits that his team of three developers isn’t contributing to bitcoin’s open-source project.“They would love nothing more than to be able to push up a change that was accepted, and I think they’re working hard to do that, but they probably just haven’t done it yet because they’re still learning a lot and building this one implementation,” said Thorne, adding:Bitcoin core developers have complained about the lack of help from for-profit businesses in the past, and Hearn has pointed out multiple times that protocol development is suffering.Bitcoin’s lead developer Wladimir van der Laan echoed the need for more support. “There are huge investments in bitcoin companies, but only very little of that ends up helping bitcoin core development,” he said.Thorne’s team was originally formed a couple of years ago, as part of Basno, a digital badge company that Thorne founded.That team raised $1.225m in a seed funding round in summer 2013. Basno is now a revenue-generating business, and the company is using the funding at a “pretty slow burn rate,” Thorne said, adding that BlockSign is a subsidiary of Basno.Not contributing to the bitcoin protocol\u0027s core development while aiming to use it for profit isn’t something unique to BlockSign by any means.Van der Laansaid:The question for readers is this: is this a situation which needs rectifying?Disclaimers: This article should not be viewed as an endorsement of any of the companies mentioned.

It would be controlled by the Mexican central bank – making block chain technology legal technology – to strengthen the country’s democracy and transparency.Beltrán said:The first block chain would be modeled off of bitcoin’s, allowing anonymous, transparent and irreversible transactions of the peso between two people without any intermediaries.The second would be integrated with the BdM’s Interbanking Electronic Payment System (SPEI) – an open protocol \"large-value funds transfer system in which participants can make transfers among themselves on behalf of themselves or their customers – for a monthly service fee. Beltrán said that applying the block chain to SPEI could be the project’s most complex element.Each digital wallet, he suggested, could be linked to users’ bank accounts or SPEI addresses. This would give the advantage of cash distribution and round-the-clock transaction availability. The level of implementation of this block chain is, perhaps, the most complex element.The third could automate the tax process by fully integrating with the second as well as the private key and the FIEL (Firma Electrónica Avanzada), a secure and encrypted digital electronic signature.Beltrán said:The main goal of the Peso Digital project is to implement the block chain as a resource of trust for Mexicans.Beltrán said:Figures from 2011 data show that of the OECD’s 34 member countries, Mexico has the lowest total tax revenue – 19.7% of GDP, compared to the US\u0027 24% and the UK\u0027s 35.7%.And in a report titled “Mexico: Illicit Financial Flows, Macroeconomic Imbalances, and the Underground Economy”, its authors at non-profit research and advocacy group Global Financial Integrity found that the country lost $872bn in financial flows between 1970 and 2010.Pablo Gonzalez, CEO of Mexico-based bitcoin exchange Bitso, said that Mexican authorities have pushed to reduce cash use and increase bank transactions over the last decade, for two reasons: “as an anti-money laundering precaution and to reduce tax evasion”.He added:Mexico is recognized domestically and abroad for its rampant government corruption. It rates 106 out of 177 countries and territories in Transparency International’s 2013 Corruption Perceptions Index.Government corruption has a significant impact on the structure of government expenditures, the GFI report indicated. For example: large telecommunications companies like Telmex – who controls 80% of the landline market and whose parent company América Móvil 70% of the mobile market – are likely to offer public officials better kickback opportunities than smaller, more competitive firms with lower profit margins.The opacity regarding this kind of beneficial ownership in Mexico is what allows multinational and domestic corporations, their subsidiaries and high net worth individuals “to transfer profits abroad in order to reduce tax liability or to circumvent local tax and exchange regulations (or capital controls) in developing countries,” the GFI report said.Gonzalez said:He added that the digital peso “system” could be used for elections, passing bills through congress and other democratic purposes.Gonzalez emphasized that with the digital peso system anyone can have access to the currency because the technology is open source.Bitcoin’s potential in the remittances market has been one of the more compelling cases for digital currency.Last year, Mexico was the fourth largest receiver of remittances in the world, a Pew Research study showed. However, a World Bank report said that 57% of all municipalities in the country lack access to any bank or microfinance instituion.Further, 98% of remittances to Mexico come from the US, but Quartz reported earlier this month that many US banks are getting out of that business, citing Bank of America as saying that it retired its cheap money transfer service to Mexico for reasons of “limited demand”, and another World Bank report that presents banks\u0027 reporting discrepancies.Gonzalez said:This March, the BdM issued its first statement on digital currency use via its website, in which it restricted the use of digital currencies, including bitcoin, by financial institutions regulated in Mexico, translations suggest.Like central bank advisories issued in other countries the restrictions seemed to be more cautionary than discouraging. The BdM has remained open to bitcoin dialogue.In the month following the warning, Mexico became the site of the Bitcoin Foundation’s third international chapter, Fundación Satoshi Nakamoto. The founders created the group to learn more about the bitcoin technology, and have since identified the main players in the bitcoin ecosystem that will help move their organisation forward.The group has already created a broader understanding of the digital currency’s advantages for consumers, media outlets and regulators.Méxican peso image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Tax, Blockchain Technology, Remittances, Mexico, Bank of Mexico, Peso Digital, Regulation, News, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jul 26, 2014 at 6:00 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/16/keybase-project-plans-to-make-cryptography-as-easy-as-twitter/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/dV5GkQRbkQjQ6Ivc6Nmx_p2dY60\u003d/570x287/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/JPQQWL7CUJH2ZFFG3HFB2SWFGE.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Keybase Project Plans to Make Cryptography as Easy as Twitter","INTRO":"Cryptographic keys are confusing to use and proving ownership is tricky, but a solution is in the pipeline.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A new project called Keybase is attempting to make cryptographic keys, like those used for bitcoin wallets, easier for everyone to use.One of the most important elements of bitcoin is arguably the cryptographic key pair, and every wallet has two keys: a public one as an advertised address, and a private one that controls it.Yet, the system is not perfect. Key pairs are confusing for many users and there isn\u0027t yet an effective, decentralized way by which keys can be linked to an identity, thus proving ownership.Keybasebelieves it can help make using keys more secure and understandable by providing what\u0027s known as public key infrastructure (PKI) for cryptography.Chris Coyne, who runs the Keybase project along with colleague Maxwell Krohn, said:The concept for Keybase came from the desire to make public key cryptography more social media friendly. While a grad student at Carnegie Mellon University, Krohn said he tried to come up with a viable PKI-related Facebook project, but couldn\u0027t find one interesting enough.\"The dream of a working PKI is as old and important as the idea of public key cryptography itself,\" said Krohn.Coyne said Keybase also drew from his experience with problems using bitcoin. When downloading Bitcoin-QT, the currency\u0027s basic wallet, for the first time, he realized how difficult it was to find out who actually signed the underlying code.However, with Keybase, Coyne said:And when the price of bitcoin started to rise to higher levels, Coyne realized the need to publicly verify addresses to which people send BTC.A Keybase profile looks like any other social media profile. The attached cryptographic keys can be used for communication, code signing, bitcoin – the technological applications are numerous.To endorse proof, Keybase requires verification. Members can post a tweet linking back to their profile, or create a GitHub public gist with identifying information.— Daniel Cawrey (@danielcawrey) July 15, 2014In order to maintain proof, Keybase regularly checks to ensure verifications still exist. Furthermore, all of the Keybase information is stored on a bitcoin address as unspent transactions, creating public proof that anyone can see via the block chain.\"Anyone can write a client that polices Keybase,\" said Coyne. \"And if it ever catches a lie, it will be provable, since all these statements are signed by Keybase, with its public key.\"Technologies like Keybase could be a way to access the full spectrum of what cryptography can do for people.\"This is all very powerful stuff, but the general public has almost no access,\" said Coyne.The Keybase idea is reminiscent of Coinbase\u0027s recent launch of Payment Pages, a way to put a face and a name – a profile – to bitcoin wallets.However, unlike consumer-focused Coinbase wallets, Keybase has no illusions that it first needs to influence the developer community in order for its idea to take off. That\u0027s why its website is designed to encourage coders to develop around Keybase\u0027s concept to begin with.\"Without a good way to map identities to public keys, most interesting crypto-based systems can\u0027t get off the ground,\" said Krohn.Attaching monetary value to a cryptographic system like bitcoin might be the answer to further adoption for Keybase. If there\u0027s a way to make the system easy for anyone to use crypto, Keybase may be on to something.Coyne said:Binary code image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Identity, Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Protocol, Technology, Keybase, PKI, Bitcoin, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jul 16, 2014 at 3:23 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/04/bitcoin-a-means-for-global-independence/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/iiIJEVWZM3venfAsFh99-xkyqro\u003d/570x270/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/MZEH4YHMMNHCJNKXVHDCPB2NN4.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin: A Means for Global Independence","INTRO":"As America celebrates Independence Day, CoinDesk looks at how cryptocurrencies are building a more independent financial world for everyone.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"With some research and a little technical aptitude, distributed forms of money such as bitcoin can be used as the digital equivalent of cash, offering the potential for anyone to theoretically bank themselves without relying on traditional financial institutions.Additionally, innovative wallet technologies mean anyone can store vast amounts of value without the need to trust governments or banks. From brain wallets to paper wallets, multisig to BIP32 hierarchical deterministic technologies, the ability to store cryptocurrency value independent of a third party is becoming more sophisticated by the month.This all adds up to a revolution in personal finance that can be attributed to smart and enterprising developers who see digital currencies as a means for independence that has never before been possible.The 4th July holiday is known for being a mid-summer soiree of fireworks, sun and socialising, but many forget that, 238 years ago, on 4th July 1776, the founders of America signed a document proclaiming independence, sovereignty over its land.At that time, the founders faced the threat of war from a king very far away and it took over eight years in the Revolutionary War – a war against ‘rebels’ as the British called Americans during that time – before complete independence from Britain was secured.The Americans who fought in the Revolutionary War believed that they could create a new country with equality and liberty as its keystone.Now, another revolution is underway, with similar ideals. Distributed currency makes possible the independent safekeeping of monetary value previously strained by physical limitations. When fiat currency first became prevalent, banks were tasked with the security and accountancy of money.Today, now that most value is relegated to the role of a database store, cryptocurrency can free those who distrust the motives of third parties, namely government and the banking industry it controls.This is the mantra of so-called crypto-anarchists and many libertarians. But political aspects aside, at the very least, bitcoin and its variants bring a new concept to the mind of the traditional banker: competition in the form of a totally new type of money.The Federal Reserve, with its ability to control monetary policy with the pulling of a few levers, believes it can compete as a capable adversary. It will be interesting to watch how this saga unfolds.A startup environment is quickly evolving around bitcoin, for the most part, but other cryptocurrencies too. These small companies are embracing the upsides of decentralized technology and are starting to change the way people think about financial businesses.The proof of a revolution can be found in the resistance, and that exists in the current financial situation, with many bitcoin companies still struggling to get bank accounts.Very few US-based bitcoin enterprises, for example, are able to easily convert cash from a customer’s bank account into bitcoin, like Coinbase does.The problems of failed bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox are likely to have exacerbated this issue in 2014. Many nascent companies wishing to start bitcoin-related enterprises even have problems getting bank accounts just for payroll purposes because their website contains the word \u0027bitcoin\u0027.Incumbent financial institutions are afraid, with big concerns about what bitcoin and its alternative counterparts might mean for their business prospects.They are at the behest of regulators, and because there still is not clear regulation – despite some states like California making bold moves on the cryptocurrency front – there is caution towards decentralized systems that are so innovative that the old ways of doing things could disappear, if they don\u0027t adapt, at least.The United States, from its founding to the end of World War II, established itself as a global power. But the country\u0027s ability to wield financial and traditional wars appears to be waning. New, distributed disruptors have wreaked havoc on America’s traditional way of combatting enemies.Many divisive issues such as same-sex marriage and marijuana legalization have been meted out to be contested at the state level. And the issue of terrorism is being fought with a deployment of not people, but swarms of disparate drones that can incisively target and take out nefarious and often singular actors.The world that exists today rewards systems of distribution. Power is being held more by individuals than, perhaps, most realize.In places where corruption is rife, uprisings such as the Arab Spring have shown that people with technology in the palm of their hands can start a revolution against government suffrage.If George Washington had had that sort of technology in the Revolutionary War, perhaps the insurgent battles with a far-away foreign power would have been decidedly more favourable in terms of less lives lost.The block chain is still a very new example of this idea of complete, yet public, distribution. Its technology has been in use for years now, but it has taken that long for many to fully grasp its true power.From certification of public proof to tracking down hackers to stymieing corruption, the block chain, separate from monetary value, may have more value to change balances of power than anything before it.The 4th July is a time to celebrate and ponder American independence. It is a time for reflection on how systems that don’t require third-party trust can foster a healthy dose of individual autonomy.Reliance on technology is something that humankind deals with on a persistent and prevalent basis. It\u0027s important to remember, however, that leveraging new technology such as an imperturbable block chain can help everyone achieve a higher level of financial independence than ever before.Consider poorer neighbourhoods all over the world that suffer from being underbanked. Or the vast majority of people in developing economies that are completely unbanked.There’s no reason why cryptocurrency can\u0027t give everyone the ability to better control their own money – improved financial independence – without the complete reliance on a government or financial system that has sometimes clearly been a complete failure.The unfortunate juxtaposition to bitcoin innovation is that it is happening mostly in developed countries. This is for a variety of reasons, but largely because that is where the expertise is, and investment in good ideas is common practice.However, there is no doubt that the risk-taking and innovative ideas of digital currencies will spread money-based sovereignty to every corner of the globe.That’s one good reason for cryptocurrency enthusiasts to think about independence on 4th July as a global prospect for financial access for everyone – something that should be a right for all individuals, no matter where they live.Declaration of Independence image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Technology, Unbanked, Independence Day, Lifestyle, Regulation, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jul 4, 2014 at 3:02 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/06/27/dna-block-chain-project-boosts-research-preserves-patient-anonymity/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/VWMtyAUpDlAjqqLcW_VIfs0GQWA\u003d/570x371/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/ZE3NJMDGN5CBRDXG4E32DPDYJE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"DNA Block Chain Project Boosts Research, Preserves Patient Anonymity","INTRO":"Publishing genetic records on a block chain could help researchers design better drugs, while still maintaining patients\u0027 privacy.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Justin Zimmerman leads business development at Black \u0026 White Technologies (BWT), which works on merchant acceptance, remittance and smart contracts in the cryptocurrency space, and also consults on Japanese-Israeli market entry.Israeli startup DNA.Bits has announced plans to store genetic and medical record data using block chain technology similar to that which underpins the bitcoin network.The novel concept will make the genetic information fully accessible to the researchers who need it, while using strong private keys to maintain digital DNA-wallet privacy and individual anonymity.Dror Sam Brama, DNA.Bits’ CEO, is a local leader in a global revolution to give medical patients an unprecedented level of privacy, access and control over their personal medical records and genetic data – while simultaneously making the genetic data of the human race accessible to all.Hospitals will still be able to monetize that patient data, meaning healthcare systems will be better equipped to heal patients, and by receiving access to such data, pharmaceutical companies will be able to produce superior drugs.Patient data would live on a \u0027side chain\u0027, and when there is a need for a monetary transaction, it would move onto the \u0027main\u0027 (ie: bitcoin) blockchain.Possible revenue streams for DNA.Bits would be licensing of the platform to data hosts, or a percentage of the contracts that run on the platform. There could also be market-maker revenues from the connections between holders of medical data, holders of genetic data, health organizations and consumers.Brama sees the company\u0027s potential customers as the holders of those records and anyone conducting research, whether they be genetics companies, pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions or government public health departments.The global pharmaceutical market is now worth $1tn. In the US, close to 20% of drugs are bioengineered products and, every year, the specialized genetic medicine market grows by 18%.The pharmaceutical industry, in addition, is enormously hungry for patient genetic and medical-record data. DNA.Bits is building a system to funnel that data to the researchers who need it, but in a way that prevents patient privacy rights from being trampled.Smadar Horowitz-Cederboim from The Jerusalem Center for Genetics and Society (JCGAS), said:Dr. Efrat Levy-Lahad from the Shaare Zedek Genetics Institute said, in Israel, approximately 1,000 women die from breast cancer every year, for example. With a nationwide DNA screening and analysis programme, experts at Jerusalem\u0027s Department of Medical Genetics at Shaare Zedek Medical Center estimate that up to 200 lives could be saved annually.What holds true for breast cancer in Israel is also applicable to countless other diseases across the world. The main stumbling block for such programmes, though, is the question of privacy.Patients, of course, have no reason to trust governmental agencies, hospitals, insurance companies, healthcare companies, pharmaceutical firms, or even non-profits with their private data.The beauty of block chain technology is that it enables the building of \u0027trustless systems\u0027 that remove the need for patients to put their faith in institutions or individuals.Israel is probably the perfect place for a project like DNA.Bits to get off the ground. The country is often regarded as one of the most innovative on the planet. This is true for technology in general, but these days it is also being applied to the nascent field of block chain technology.It\u0027s not just about novel digital currencies, either – Israel was one of the first communities to lead the surge into use of the block chain for non-currency focused activity.So far Israel has given the world the mastercoin protocol, the colored coins project, Xennet, Lazooz, along with some academic innovation for online privacy, such as ZeroCash, Ghost, and Snark.Elsewhere, other companies are also employing block chain tech outside of the world of finance.CoinDesk recently reported on how Proof of Existence is allowing content providers to publish their work on a block chain to protect their intellectual property rights.

Despite early promise, there are obstacles ahead.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In the digital age, it seems strange that people all around the world still use paper to vote. Of course, given bitcoin\u0027s promise to remove paper from the financial system, many in the industry are beginning to ask if the same block chain technology can be applied to help modernize the democratic process.Some might argue that the paper voting system could use a little digital efficiency. Internet voting might not only be more accurate, but it could also be more frequent. Organising a paper-based vote on monthly issues would be impractical, but voting from your tablet or mobile phone on, say, whether to allow your local MP or senator to continue in their role might encourage a little more accountability in the seat of power.Forget it, says Barbara Simons. \"At this point we cannot do Internet voting securely,\" warns the former IBM computer scientist who has conducted extensive research into Internet voting. Readers will point out that Internet voting is already happening, but she\u0027s saying that we cannot guarantee its integrity.Simons, a former president of the Association for Computing Machinery, participated in a National Workshop on Internet Voting commissioned by former US President Bill Clinton, and authored a book, \u0027Broken Ballots\u0027. She is a long-standing critic of online voting, and her research caused the US Department of Defense to nix an Internet voting system it was considering.\"A lot of people think ‘I can bank online, so why can’t I vote online?’,\" says Simons. \"But, millions disappear from online bank accounts each year.\"There are several challenges facing Internet voting systems. One of the biggest is auditability. How can you prove that a vote was cast the proper way?Sending your vote from a kiosk, mobile phone or home computer to a server - or even selecting options using an automated phone-based voting system - doesn’t guarantee that it gets registered properly at the other end, or even registered at all. The voter doesn’t have access to that server, or to the network along which their vote travels. And when it comes to a recount, there is no paper trail.\"The beauty of paper ballots is that you can do recounts,\" says Simons.Some are mulling block chain-based systems to help solve the tangled problem of Internet voting. Block chains are already used to encode information from - and about - a particular source, made at a particular point of time.Blocks in a block chain are ‘sealed’ with a cryptographic hash, which can be used to verify the contents of that block at a later date. If anyone tries to alter the historical record of transactions in a network, or to introduce new ones, then they’d have to go back and alter that block in the block chain. That would create a new hash that wouldn’t match the existing hash on record for that block.The fraudster could simply replace that hash with a new one, but it takes a lot of computing power to calculate a hash on the bitcoin network. And the hash for a bitcoin block is used to help compute the hash of the next block in the block chain. That means that the further back in time you try to alter a transaction, the more hashes you’d have to recalculate, and the more computing power it would take.That is how bitcoin is able to guarantee its validity as a public ledger for all transactions in its history. But, if you can do that for financial transactions, the argument goes, then why can’t you do it for votes? After all, votes are another kind of transaction that has to be recorded. The Liberal Alliance party in Denmark is said to be in favour of a block chain-based vote.BitCongressis using the Ethereum platform to build a scrypt-based altcoin called votecoin, that will use its network to hash and verify votes. It will use an application, Axiomity, both to organise and decide the parameters for votes, and to handle the voting process, explains founder Morgan Rockwell, who is also behind Bitcoin Kinetics.Rockwell told CoinDesk:He added that votes will be hashed into a block chain.A block chain-based system might provide a useful way to prove that a particular vote was cast by someone with a specific private key, and thereby guarantee the integrity of the votes once they were cast. But, what about guaranteeing the integrity of the voting process itself?The big problem with Internet-based voting software, experts say, is that it’s difficult to prove that the voting machines themselves have not been compromised.\"If we\u0027re doing remote internet voting on the voters own machines, then we need some assurance that those machines aren\u0027t owned,\" says Christopher Camp, founder of Restart Democracy, a nonprofit organization focused on driving innovations in technology to help promote democracy.Camp explained:How might a client-side compromise work? Let\u0027s say that Bob is about to vote on the next president. Bob is using a PC-based system, with open-source code that anyone can inspect and the machine is under his control. Bob uses biometric authentication to prove to the voting program that he is who he says he is.Bob then enters his private key - securely stored on a piece of paper in a locked safe - to access his votecoin and cast his vote. Using the public key, he votes for Jane to be president.So far, so good. But, a rookit installed by Jane\u0027s opponent Mike via a drive-by download has altered the software’s functionality. The software uses Bob\u0027s carefully-validated ID to alter the vote. That vote, fully authenticated, is then hashed into the block chain for posterity - as a vote for Mike.This is not far fetched. Similar things happen in banking all the time, says Simons:Zeusdoes that by waiting for the victim to authenticate themselves to the bank, and then carrying out its own actions using that authentication.But, surely the same software used to vote could scan the block chain and double-check that Mike’s vote was cast correctly? Perhaps. But then, if the software is running on a compromised machine and has been altered to tamper with a vote, then it isn’t to be trusted. Banking trojans also rewrite bank statements to fool users, after all.Rockwell doesn’t have an easy answer for this.\"The reality is that problem cannot be easily solved by any electronic method,\" he says. \"BitCongress is not being created to replace all forms of voting; it is merely for a simple block chain-based option to give a public ledger of votes to the public eye.\"Some have tried to solve these problems using end-to-end auditable voting systems, which at least try to facilitate electronic voting, if not Internet voting.Typically, votes are made via a kiosk, which produces some kind of paper record of the ballot, but they allow votes to be processed electronically rather than hand-counted, for efficiency and expediency. An E2E verificable system will typically cryptographically encode the physical ballots somehow, so that a later audit can be conducted if necessary to match the paper ballot with the registered vote.Scantegrity, a system used to cryptographically verify optical voting records, tries to solve the problem of verifying physical ballot validity by including a cryptographic code printed on the voting ballot. Auditors can use the cryptographic code later on to check that the vote registered on the system corresponded with the vote on the ballot.But, Scantegrity relies heavily on data registered before an election (such as unique codes that can be used by voters, for example). What if an election official added more codes to the list of allowable voting codes, and then \u0027stuffed the ballot\u0027 to make new, fake votes?Jeremy Clarkof Carleton University and Aleks Essex at the University of Waterloo hope to use block chains to solve that problem. They published a paper describing commitcoin. This is an implementation of a system that uses cryptographic proof of work systems to prove that they committed a message before a certain date.The pair have suggested that this system could be used not to manage an entire voting system, but rather to prove the integrity of election data (such as a list of valid voting codes) before an event. That way, if someone tried to add more voting codes, it could be compared with the original, verifiable list.Clark has also worked on a remote voting system known as Remotegrity. This allows voters to use the Internet, though it relies on the postal system as a side channel. Voters can’t rely entirely on the voting system, but must instead receive lists of candidates via the mail.The candidates are represented by numbers, randomised across different mailings and they use these numbers when voting on the Internet. That prevents a compromised computer from changing their vote.Clark explained:The block chain may be a useful means of guaranteeing vote integrity at the back end, but as these experts point out, guaranteeing vote integrity from end to end is a sticky problem - especially if you’re trying to make push-button democracy a reality.On the other hand, in an electoral system where a quarter of eligible US voters aren’t even registered, rootkits are one problem in a constellation of democracy-threatening issues.Digital voting image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Protocol, Technology, Voting, Bitcoin, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jun 16, 2014 at 10:05 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/22/chains-api-takes-the-hard-work-out-of-bitcoin-app-development/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Drhe9wqe8ndj86TQ63z7qiB3TBg\u003d/570x357/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/QRYQPVHZBZFJTALPA2KGNSXFPM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Chain\u0027s API Takes the Hard Work Out of Bitcoin App Development","INTRO":"The new block chain API could make it far easier for developers to build on top of bitcoin technology.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Developing for bitcoin can be a bit of a slog. The protocol was designed with transactions, not applications, in mind, and getting to grips with the technology can be intimidating, not only for the general public, but for developers too.All of that may be about to change thanks to Chain, a new bitcoin infrastructure that could make it easier than ever for developers to build on top of the technology.Enthusiasts often dream of the applications that could be created with bitcoin\u0027s technology; Chain could finally attract the critical mass of developers needed to turn that dream into reality.Bitcoin is often talked about it near-messianic terms as a technology. Much of it is deserved: bitcoin really is an incredible innovation in terms of creating decentralized digital infrastructure and, for the first time ever, we are able to have a decentralized digital form of money, for example.When it comes to the code itself, however, bitcoin developers are more sober.At the Bitcoin2014 conference, the Bitcoin Foundation’s Lead Scientist Gavin Andresen quipped that “Satoshi gave us a bit of hairball”, and later said that “the very first version of bitcoin was horribly unsecure [sic]”.Even downloading the block chain, the ledger of all transacations, can be a painful task, as lead developer Wladimir van der Laan told CoinDesk in April:Although the code is constantly being improved, Andresen is clear that the focus will continue be to ensure “the core bitcoin network processes transactions as reliably as possible.”That leaves the door open for someone else to instead focus on making the core bitcoin network as easily accessible to developers as possible.“There\u0027s nothing broken per se about running your own bitcoin infrastructure. It\u0027s just very time consuming, very cumbersome and very expensive” said Chain’s Adam Ludwin, who is perhaps most well-known for being an early investor in Vine. “That has limited the number of developers who are willing to jump in and build something on nights and weekends.”Instead of each developer having to start from scratch, Chain will do a lot of the heavy lifting for them. In effect, Chain is a copy of the data on the block chain that is organized and saved in a way that\u0027s less optimised for processing transactions and more optimised for building applications.“The [bitcoin] community is better served, in our opinion, by having one company that\u0027s well understood, trusted, open source and who does nothing but focus on the reliability and strength of this [new data] layer,” argues Ludwin.Launched this week, Chain currently provides three basic functions for developers, returning details for addresses, transactions and blocks, and so far only supports bitcoin.Developers can expect over a dozen more functions and support for litecoin, dogecoin and namecoin in the future, said Ludwin:To ensure that it will be as secure as possible, and to give the community confidence about that security, Chain will be entirely open source.\"We\u0027re not fans of centralizing a service and introducing new risks to the ecosystem,\" Ludwin said.Chain is currently free, but business applications of the API will be charged for in future. The team is also building SDKs (software development kits) for bitcoin developers on Android.Currently comprising eight members, including an alumni of cloud platform Heroku, Chain was formerly the team behind Albumatic – a photo sharing app that attracted a lot of coverage, but failed to reach critical mass.It then morphed into Koa.la last November and began building apps for messaging platform Kik, on whose board of directors Ludwin serves.Around January this year, however, the team was expanded as part of a hard pivot to Chain, which has carried forward Albumatic’s $4.2 million series-A funding from investors including Thrive, SV Angel and RRE Ventures, where Ludwin is a venture partner.Later this year, the Chain team will be heading to bitcoin conferences and university campuses to demonstrate the potential of their API. With Chain, student developers will be able to build bitcoin applications over a single weekend, said Ludwin:If Chain is successful in encouraging more and more developers to start working with bitcoin, maybe we’ll really start to see what’s possible with this technology.","TAGS":"Developers, Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Protocol, startups, Technology, Applications, Chain, Bitcoin, News, Companies, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"May 22, 2014 at 2:38 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/15/how-monegraph-uses-the-block-chain-to-verify-digital-assets/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Keyl-Ta4LMbBJuFfGfRZ3N1fNs0\u003d/570x341/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/5PJLO4BXI5BOPEJOJBIVJS3TCM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How Monegraph Uses the Block Chain to Verify Digital Assets","INTRO":"A collaboration between an NYU professor and a technologist has resulted in a new way to secure digital property.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Monegraph, a collaborative project between a New York University professor and a technologist offers a radical new way for artists to secure digital property – by logging it in the namecoin block chain.Kevin McCoy is the NYU professor that worked with Anil Dash to create Monegraph. An artist himself, McCoy said he had considered building Monegraph for some time:The Monegraph concept was turned into something real by McCoy and Dash as part of an event called Seven on Seven. The purpose of the symposium, held at the New Museum in New York City, is to pair artists with technical professionals to build a project within one day.\"I think the event organizers put us together because they knew that we had been thinking about these ideas. We were able to come up with a working model of it relatively quickly,\" said McCoy.Dash is known for being involved early with blogging and social media. The pairing of Twitter for verification with Monegraph is likely a nod towards such experience.Using existing social media as an identity that appears on the namecoin block chain is certainly a unique approach.The ability to verify digital item via a public general ledger is a concept that could gain traction in the cryptocurrency community. Another project called Proof of Existence is used by developers, for example, to create unique hashes for each version of code that they create.Monegraph builds on this idea, but is geared towards digital media already posted on the web. One application for users would be to create a hash that combines a Twitter account with a public image of themselves posted on the web as a method of verifying identity.— Daniel Cawrey (@danielcawrey) May 13, 2014The ability to use block chain technology to prove ownership of a digital asset could be useful to protect intellectual property. While, legal complexities exist for the time being, courts around the world will eventually need become familiar with the use of cryptographic hashes as a form of verification.McCoy realizes that mediation of ownership disputes is still a concern with this technology, but he believes that the best way for block chain certification to gain traction is through making projects like Monegraph.The more that the idea of block chain\u0027s power to prove ownership is exposed to the public, the better:The use of namecoin\u0027s block chain for Monegraph is a telling signal that it is not just bitcoin that has value. McCoy says that the use of namecoin was a \"practical matter\" – it\u0027s an altcoin that can be used to verify DNS registrations in a decentralized way.Despite namecoin\u0027s different use case, the developer community has not been particularly busy working on its core client when compared to bitcoin or dogecoin.Furthermore, it\u0027s not easy for people to obtain namecoin, compared with other cryptocurrencies. Then there is the thorny issue getting the general public to understand how this form of digital asset verification works.McCoy is aware of these issues, noting Monegraph was built in a day.It\u0027s not the coin that matters, he says – rather, it is public ledger technology that could turn this idea into a new method of proof. He knows, though, that it has to be super-simple for people to use decentralized ownership concepts, saying:Digital Art image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Namecoin, Blockchain Technology, Technology, Monegraph, Intellectual Property, Copyright, Regulation, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"May 15, 2014 at 11:34 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/14/are-off-block-chain-transactions-bad-for-bitcoin/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/D42fskwC_cKg_AtA9iC9rtFJKsI\u003d/570x322/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/ZSXAR56BZJHHTMGESZWNRDDPJA.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Are Off-Block Chain Transactions Bad for Bitcoin?","INTRO":"Faster off-block chain bitcoin transactions are increasingly popular, but that may not be a good thing.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Bitcoin was designed to be a decentralized and trustless payment network – with the power to do this provided by the block chain and its ability to publicly confirm the digital currency\u0027s digital transactions.Rather contentiously, however, as the bitcoin economy expands, more and more transactions are being carried out off the block chain.Such transactions are tracked on private databases instead of the block chain, and cannot be publicly tracked.There are pros and cons to both systems. So, which are better? Off-block chain or on-block chain transactions?Legitimate use cases for on-block chain transactions include those that must be shown publicly for particular reasons, such as to facilitate larger payments.Many users might not mind smaller transactions off the block chain, but bigger transactions can receive public verification with bitcoin\u0027s general ledger. So, on-chain is insurance of sorts – proof that a payment exchange between parties did happen.Marcell Ortutay is the developer of Coinwall, which relays bitcoin microtransactions on the block chain for the purpose of paywalls for online content. He said that, in light of nefarious actors in the cryptocurrency space, on-block chain transactions are a better verifier of sorts:Perhaps the most noteworthy example of a hosted wallet gone awry would be Mt. Gox. Despite all the warning signs of that exchange\u0027s mismanagement, Ortutay points out people still had faith in the Tokyo-based company:A number of consumer-based bitcoin companies are focused on off-block chain transactions, including Coinbase, Circle Internet Financial.These companies are facilitators of everyday payments between parties and, as a result, they have decided to keep transaction speeds high by keeping most payments internal – that is, off the the public block chain.Scott Robinson runs bitcoin initiatives at the Plug and Play startup accelerator, which has headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. He says this issue is a factious subject within the community:Robinson says that at Plug and Play\u0027s cafeteria there is a bitcoin-accepting point of sale (POS) system, and he has seen why companies like Coinbase want to run transactions through their own system, off-chain.Simply, it\u0027s faster to use Coinbase-to-Coinbase, for example, than relying on Coinbase-to-block chain. Plus, \"issues arise with miner fees,\" Robinson noted.Transaction off the block chain do not incur the small amount of BTC that miners are paid for their services in verifying the ledger. Hence, transaction are a little more expensive on-chain.Robinson believes the issues with transaction speeds on-chain need to be worked out, and suggests doing so with trial-by-fire:There is another reason why companies use their own database systems to move bitcoin around: the potential scaling problems that could result as transactions on the bitcoin network increase.Blocks are only being generated every 10 minutes, which makes confirmation a major issue.That\u0027s why, for larger transactions, bitcoin on-chain makes sense, but less so for smaller payments, which are more often regular and frequent.The bitcoin network, as it is currently, just cannot support thousands of transactions per second like traditional payment systems. Therefore, there is a strong incentive for companies to go off-block chain instead.Bitcoin cannot compete with other coins on block generation speed. Litecoin mines blocks every 2.5 minutes, and dogecoin completes a block roughly every 60 seconds.There are some proposals that could help give bitcoin a speed boost, however.Perhaps the most intriguing of these would involve a more trustless system by implementing payment channels in a hub-and-spoke design. This is one theoretical way to counter the problems with transaction and block chain size growth.Catheryne Nicholson, co-founder of BlockCypher, a cloud-based block chain service provider, thinks that bitcoin\u0027s infrastructure needs to be performance optimized.BlockCypher, as a result, is building scalable solutions to help keep the system on-chain, she said, adding:Jesse Powell, the CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, said that his company uses on-block chain transactions. \"We operate under the presumption that, when you are sending money out, you’re withdrawing. It’s to your own wallet.\"The reasoning behind that is purely for regulatory reasons, he explained. Off-block chain movement of cyrptocurrency, in Kraken\u0027s view, has compliance issues:Ortutay, the on-chain micropayment entrepreneur, thinks that some bitcoin companies may have other, less desirable reasons to transact off-block chain:Many in the bitcoin community realise that off-chain is quickly increasing in popularity. The problem, however, is that bitcoin stands to lose a portion of one of its key benefits – its decentralized nature.Ortutay believes that that could, in the end, deliver a blow to bitcoin\u0027s early adoption. Bitcoin as a payment mechanism may face a marketing problem when it appears to be doing the same thing its competitors are, he explained, saying:Bitcoin chain image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Exchanges, Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Protocol, Litecoin, payments, Kraken, Plug and Play, startups, Dogecoin, Technology, Bitcoin, Altcoins, Companies, Features, other-public-protocols, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"May 14, 2014 at 10:00 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/10/a-network-analysts-view-of-the-block-chain/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/5TtanRgxVkqr0CXCwKdCAedPWsY\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/P5ZXCTAXY5BLFA7PEQX6CSYOYM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"A Network Analyst\u0027s View of the Block Chain","INTRO":"Analysing the block chain\u0027s network structure can help us grasp bitcoin\u0027s usage patterns, economy and growth.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Martin Harrigan is a computer scientist and software developer. He is the founder of QuantaBytes, an Irish startup developing a suite of tools for analyzing and visualising bitcoin\u0027s block chain. He is also the co-author of one of the earliest academic papers to study the network properties of the block chain and its implications for anonymity.The block chain is a decentralised, consensus-driven ledger of every successful bitcoin transaction to date. As of the 300,000th block, the ledger includes over 38 million transactions.Aside from being a monumental technical achievement, the block chain is a fascinating dataset. We can use it to create a transaction network that models the flow of bitcoins from the creation of the genesis block to the present day.In this network, every node represents a transaction, and every (directed) edge represents a flow of bitcoins from an output of one transaction to an input of another. This large, complex network has over 38 million nodes and 85 million edges.Network scienceNetwork science is the study of complex networks. It provides theories, techniques and tools that help us understand the structure and evolution of a network. The bitcoin transaction network is a prime example. Its basic building block, the transaction, can be combined to produce complex transfers of value. This is reflected in the topological structure of the transaction network.The network as a whole is too large and complex for most network visualisation tools. However, we can measure various structural properties of the network. For example, transactions can be characterised by their varying numbers of inputs and outputs. But how are these numbers distributed in practice? In the transaction network, we can analyse the in- and out-degrees of the nodes. We can plot the in- and out-degree distributions. They show, for each possible degree, the number of times they occur in the network.In both cases, we observe inverse relationships between these numbers. The lower the degree, the more frequently the nodes with that degree occur; the higher the degree, the less frequently they occur. There are many outliers. The outlier in the out-degree distribution with out-degree equal to two is due to an abundance of transactions with exactly two outputs.Suppose we were able to visualise the entire bitcoin transaction network. It would probably resemble a \"hairball\". These visualisations suffer from cluttering and over-plotting to an extreme that makes them unusable for any practical purposes. However, they do provide one key piece of information. Are we dealing with one large connected component or several smaller connected components?A connected component is a group of nodes and edges that are all connected to each other, either directly or indirectly. If a network has a giant connected component, this means that almost every node is reachable from almost every other node. If we ignore the direction of the edges in the bitcoin transaction network, then it does indeed contain a giant connected component covering over 99.9% of all nodes. The second largest connected component has just 71 nodes.Six degrees of separation is the theory that everyone on the planet is connected to everyone else through a chain of acquaintances with no more than six hops. In network science terminology, this translates to the theory that the social network of the human race has diameter six. Facebook reported that the effective diameter (covering 90% of all pairs of users) of its social network is five and is decreasing with time.The equivalent number for the bitcoin transaction network is fourteen and is increasing with time. That is, across 90% of all pairs of transactions, the shortest path between them in the transaction network, ignoring directionality, is at most fourteen hops. The increasing value is likely due to the fact that, unlike the Facebook social network, there is no preferential attachment. New nodes are connected to existing nodes whose corresponding transactions are not yet fully redeemed. In other words, the transaction network is growing at the frontier only.Surprisingly, bitcoin is not the first currency with a ledger from which we can model the transfer of value. The Tomamae-cho community currency was introduced into the Hokkaido Prefecture in Japan for a three-month period during 2004-05 in a bid to revitalise the local economy. The Tomamae-cho system involved gift certificates that were reusable and legally redeemable into yen. There was an entry space on the reverse of each certificate for recipients to record transaction dates, their names and addresses, and the purposes of use, up to a maximum of five recipients.Researchers collected these certificates in order to derive a network structure that represented the flow of currency during the period. They showed, for example, that the network had small world properties.The block chain is a digital equivalent to the Tomamae-cho certificates. It does not contain information such as names and addresses or the purposes of use. However, it has other properties that make it suitable for analysing the transfer of value including its accuracy, size, and completeness.The application of network analysis to the block chain is an under-explored, yet fascinating area. There are a handful of academic studies but very little in the way of software and tools to open it up to a wider audience. QuantaBytes is an Irish startup, founded by the author, developing a suite of tools for analysing and visualising bitcoin\u0027s block chain. By understanding the structure and evolution of the block chain, we can better understand bitcoin\u0027s usage patterns, economy, and the growth of the system as a whole.Network image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Features, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"May 10, 2014 at 11:00 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/08/how-bitcoins-technology-could-revolutionize-intellectual-property-rights/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/kDU_3HfzlSeVteZ-LSnOawZk66s\u003d/570x342/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/LLIWANYLQFGQLHFW7LDVI2LFSY.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How Bitcoin\u0027s Technology Could Revolutionize Intellectual Property Rights","INTRO":"The block chain is more than the bitcoin ledger – it offers potential for other radical new services too.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The bitcoin block chain is well known for its use as a ledger for digital currency transactions, but it has the potential for other, more radical uses too – uses that are only now beginning to be explored.The online service Proof of Existence is an example of how the power of this new technology can have applications far beyond the world of finance, in this case, giving a glimpse of how bitcoin could one day have a substantial impact in the fields of intellectual property and law.Although in its initial stages, Proof of Existence can be used to demonstrate document ownership without revealing the information it contains, and to provide proof that a document was authored at a particular time.Manuel Aráoz, a Buenos Aires, Argentina-based developer, who built Proof of Existence as a decentralized method of verification, a kind of cryptographic notary service explained:While the prospect of the block chain providing key evidence in legal disputes may seem far-fetched today, such a leap in thinking is akin to the work being done by developers of digital currency projects around the globe.As projects like OneName and BitID are proving, decentralized, digital verification is a concept that many proponents of distributed systems see as a natural, if as-yet-untapped, application of the technology.Proof of Existenceallows users to upload a file and pay a transaction fee to have a cryptographic proof of it included on the bitcoin block chain. The actual file is not stored online and therefore does not risk unwanted publication of the user\u0027s material.After anonymously uploading the document and paying the network fee, a hash of the document (or any other type of digital file) is generated as part of the transaction.This, in effect, uses the public and ledger-like nature of the block chain to store the proof of your file, which can later be verified should an issue of authorship or dating arise.\"Basically, by inserting the cryptographic hash of the document in a transaction, when that transaction is mined into a block, the block timestamp becomes the document’s timestamp,\" said Aráoz.As well as time-stamping, Proof of Existence is also a way to make sure that files are what they are supposed to be.As Proof of Existence says: \"All we store is a cryptographic digest of the file, linked to the time in which you submitted the document. In this way, you can later certify that the data existed at that time.\"Developers, for example, can use the service to later verify versions of their code, inventors can prove they had an idea at a certain time and authors can protect their works.And this is can be verified via the hash generated during a block chain transaction, said Aráoz:Aráoz indicated that there are a number of potential applications for the service given its ability to prove that a document or piece of code was verified at a point in time and that the bitcoin ledger is perfectly designed for the task.Effectively, the scripting capabilities that exist within bitcoin\u0027s block chain allow for transactions to have no output. This means that, while a small amount of bitcoin goes into the system (currently a 0.0001 BTC fee for miners to confirm the transaction within a block), no BTC needs to be sent to a recipient.Hence, the block chain has the built-in functionality to incentivize miners to carry out the necessary hashing to verify a document.This functionality is key to utilizing the block chain for reasons other than just moving BTC, and it is clear that this no-output design has potential to power innovative ideas beyond just virtual money.Given this potential, it\u0027s possible that the implications of solutions like Proof of Existence might be even more valuable than the per-bitcoin price many investors are fixated upon today.Digital property can sometimes also be considered intellectual property, and block chain technologies could essentially prove ownership of such digital property, according to Aráoz, who explained:Verification is example of the block chain\u0027s potential outside of just monetary innovation.That\u0027s something venture capitalist Fred Wilson is interested in, and recently said:The block chain could help to better prove digital identity and property, giving people more ownership of personal data.Companies like Google, for example, promote the ability for users to control data from its services. Facebook recently added the option to login to services anonymously to reduce the possibility of user data being spread out among third-party applications.However, the fact of the matter remains, those services are centralized and always will be, while block chain technologies are better suited for distributed cryptographic trust systems.The question raised by the service, however, is how quickly institutions such as the US legal system will adopt this new type of public validation and identity.Given that the implications of bitcoin in the world of finance are difficult for many to comprehend, realizing the power that the block chain holds as a record of fact might be even harder. Aráoz understands this is currently an issue and said:However, all it would take for acceptance is a favourable ruling in one case where the block chain certifies that something happened at a particular time.When (or if) that happens, it might allow bitcoin\u0027s general ledger to be used as a mainstream method of verifying document authorship and contents or software versioning.Court rulings in the US have made headway in making bitcoin as a currency more tangible, at least from a legal standpoint.Last year, a Texas Court ruled that bitcoin is a form of money, which then gave the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the means to justifiably prosecute a man in a purported bitcoin-based Ponzi scheme.There will be more court rulings like this, and if courts around the world start to look favourably on distributed systems like bitcoin that can offer undeniable verification of existence, that will ultimately validate this concept as something that has real-world and mainstream applications.Digital information image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Protocol, Technology, Proof-of-Existence, Bitcoin, Regulation, News, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"May 8, 2014 at 9:56 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/05/vc-fred-wilson-block-chain-could-be-bigger-opportunity-than-bitcoin/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/iWPQIb862WyTHJqW5DTSbRRfjgw\u003d/570x377/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/FXT34P6ZWJEKBOP4FCXBVG5XRA.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"VC Fred Wilson: Block Chain Could be Bigger Opportunity than Bitcoin","INTRO":"The Union Square Ventures founder says the bitcoin protocol has bigger potential in key fields like Internet identity.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt on 5th May as part of the conference\u0027s opening fireside chat, Union Square Ventures founder and bitcoin enthusiast Fred Wilson opened up about the kinds of digital currency investments that he and his firm are currently considering.Despite a suggestion that Wilson may be interested in some of the larger names in the space like Coinbase, the MIT and University of Pennsylvania graduate indicated that what is perhaps most intriguing to him is the long-term impact of the bitcoin block chain.While he did note that his interest remains strong in bitcoin and related companies and services, he said that the bitcoin protocol has perhaps far bigger ramifications in key fields like Internet identity:While he did not release any new information about prospective projects, Wilson was confident that a worthy player would emerge from the digital currency community to disrupt the online identity space.Notably, one company that received a namecheck was OneName, an open-source platform provider that uses both the bitcoin and namecoin block chains with the end goal of providing a new kind of identity service to developers.That project launched in late March and gained more publicity for its primary use case, simplifying bitcoin addresses with usernames.Though Wilson has been one of the more outspoken VCs about the potential of bitcoin and the wider industry, at the conference, Wilson moved to downplay expectations that he would perhaps be seeking to encourage growth through upcoming investments.Rather, Wilson indicated that Union Square Ventures would continue its current approach to the wider tech space with the bitcoin industry by refraining from early seed-round investments:For more on Wilson\u0027s views regarding bitcoin and its potential to transform the global Internet, read his most recent article on CoinDesk.For more on TechCrunch Disrupt NY, see the full schedule of events here.Image via TechCrunch","TAGS":"Venture Capital, Identity, Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Protocol, Technology, Fred Wilson, investors-2, Bitcoin, News, Events, investors, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"May 5, 2014 at 3:58 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/27/scams-hacks-and-poor-management-life-after-silk-road/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/7aqoORRv2a3Pub0POz7fqLuVB40\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/UTSDMGKGLNDWZDKIFTVVZPLKSE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Scams, Hacks and Poor Management: Life After Silk Road","INTRO":"Following Silk Road\u0027s demise, some users (and even law enforcement officials) wax nostalgic about the \u0027original\u0027 Dread Pirate Roberts.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When US authorities busted up the Silk Road and arrested alleged kingpin Ross Ulbricht last fall, it didn’t mean the end of online drugs-for-bitcoin markets. Alternative trading posts popped up immediately, and existing ones expanded to accommodate displaced buyers and sellers. However the sites have been rocked by thefts, more arrests and other troubles, leading some customers and even investigators to wax nostalgic about the \"original\" Dread Pirate Roberts, as Silk Road\u0027s founder called himself. One customer, who goes by the nickname \u0027hugs\u0027, wrote in a message to CoinDesk: \"[Chaos] is the word that I would choose to describe the landscape as it has morphed and changed after SilkRoad\u0027s seizure. Many sites have come and gone [...] many of them developing quite a following before being shut down or hacked. Buyers and vendors alike have been on a constant search for a stable market, one that will be around for longer than a couple of months.\" One law enforcement source said the new markets are barely worth investigating at this point. He raised February\u0027s heist of thousands of bitcoins from Silk Road 2.0 as an example of bad management: “When the original Dread was running it, that never happened. It\u0027s not being run as well.” The law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was involved in the original Silk Road investigation, but now is just keeping an eye on Silk Road 2.0 in the background. In fact, he’s not sure any law enforcement agencies are making Silk Road 2.0 or other online drug markets a priority. Silk Road 2.0\u0027s first admin styled himself as Dread Pirate Roberts, just as Ulbricht is alleged to have done, but he disappeared from the scene after three of the site\u0027s alleged moderators were arrested in December, and the site\u0027s new administrator calls himself \u0027Defcon\u0027. Other sites to position themselves as Silk Road alternatives include the Sheep Marketplace, Black Market Reloaded, Utopia, Agora, Pandora, BlueSky and many others; some of these sites have shut down, others are still accessible on the deep web via the Tor browser. Of the current crop, \u0027hugs\u0027 named Agora as the most stable, saying its administrators appear to be working diligently to gain user trust. But so far, no would-be mastermind seems to be able to fill the shoes of the original Dread Pirate Roberts. For one thing, many have failed to keep users’ bitcoins safe. In addition to the Silk Road 2.0 theft, another deep web trading post, Sheep Marketplace, reported a $6m heist and shut down in late 2013. In March, the market known as Pandora reported a theft of $250,000 in bitcoin, promised repayment, and stayed open. Because of the anonymous nature of these markets, it’s difficult for users to know if the sites were really hacked, or if the administrators just absconded with their bitcoins. The law enforcement source added: “Either the administrators don\u0027t have the level of expertise or the dedication to the web site that [the original DPR] did, or it could be that they\u0027re running a scam.” Users have tried following bitcoin movements through the block chain for clues, but that is probably a futile pursuit according to University of California-San Diego cryptographer Sarah Meiklejohn. She wrote in an email: \"It would be difficult to verify just from block chain analysis if a theft were carried out by external thieves or by the owners of the service, since the movement of the bitcoins would presumably be the same either way. If you saw the bitcoins deposited into an exchange, and then asked that exchange who the real-world owner of that account was, you might learn something, but (1) that\u0027s not something that most users can do, and (2) operators of dark marketplaces are almost certainly not using their real names anyway. So basically, that doesn\u0027t seem possible.\" This leads users to be a bit jumpy. When a market has a temporary outage, threads pop up on reddit speculating whether the site\u0027s organizers have taken the money and run. When Sheep Marketplace claimed it was robbed, users had already been speculating for days that a scam was in the works, since they had been unable to withdraw bitcoins from their accounts. Silk Road 2.0 administrators appear to be making good on promises to reimburse users for losses following the alleged transaction malleability attack that hit the site in February. Defcon posted on the site\u0027s forums in early April that half the victims had been fully repaid, and that 100% had received at least a partial payment. He set 9th June as a rough target for full repayment. A number of Silk Road 2.0 users commented in the forum that they had indeed received payment, however, a few said they had received nothing as of early April. In turn, many users have not yet logged in to claim their reimbursement, according to the site\u0027s administrator. Other markets have handled things far differently. Sheep Marketplace\u0027s admins vanished after claiming theft. And the admin of Project Black Flag openly admitted pocketing users\u0027 bitcoins when he shut down the market last fall. “[It] makes us realize once again how cool and proper Ross Ulbricht (allegedly) was. He could have fleeced people but instead he empowered people. Sad loss,” reddit user \u0027bitchrome\u0027 commented in a discussion about the Sheep Marketplace shutdown. Another reddit user, \u0027JAMDIAM\u0027, sounded fed up with post-Silk Road markets: “I don\u0027t eff with these markets anymore for two reasons: 1) They\u0027re clearly crawling with Feds. 2) The management of these sites will never match the original DPR (aka Ross Ulbricht).\" Ross Ulbricht denies the FBI allegations and is currently in a New York detention centre awaiting trial. To prevent future thefts, Defcon removed Silk Road 2.0\u0027s centralized escrow system, writing on the market\u0027s forum that \"Centralization makes a market a huge target for attackers, and a huge target for dishonest administrators.\" Instead, Defcon said the market will move to a multi-signature escrow system, in which a single person cannot move funds without agreement from one or more other signers. BlackBank, Cannabis Road, Cloud-Nine, DarkBay, Hydra, The Marketplace and Tor Bazaar are all listed as multisig markets on the darknetmarkets subreddit. Dark market shopper \u0027hugs\u0027 clarified: \"I think that within the next year we will see [multisignature escrow] become the standard for markets across the board. Vendors are tired of having their hard-earned money stolen or hacked, as are users. There are enough stressors in this business without the constant worry of dishonest or incompetent market admins to add to the list.\" \u0027Hugs\u0027 added: \"My hope is that multi-signature escrow will work to alleviate the fear of market scams. Although traditional escrow is currently much less complicated and more convenient for the average buyer, I think we\u0027ll soon begin to see multi-sig simplified and implemented in a way that even the most technologically deficient buyers [such as myself] can still take advantage of its benefits.\" Of course, if the illegal marketplaces succeed in gaining customer trust – and, as a result, higher sales – they will also become a much larger target for law enforcement. “I don\u0027t know how much interest law enforcement has in Silk Road 2.0 right now. When they get up and start running hard, maybe they\u0027ll start taking a harder look at it,” said the Silk Road investigator.

Despite obvious buzz appeal, it’s a serious question with profound implications. How alike are bitcoin and the Internet, and what conclusions can we draw from the comparison? Within the world of monetary theory and finance, bitcoin is unprecedented. It is such a radical concept that many in the field are sceptical that the kind of decentralization bitcoin represents is even compatible with the modern economy.The Internet thus provides an obvious reference point for a technology that seems utterly similar in its decentralization, open-source code, state of development, and most importantly its potential to disrupt on a global scale. Indeed, if nothing else, the comparison can help effectively communicate the magnitude of bitcoin\u0027s technological achievement. Chris Ellis, the co-founder of feathercoin, captures this sentiment eloquently: “The first thing that humanity has built that humanity doesn’t understand, the largest experiment in anarchy that we have ever had.” That’s actually a quote from Eric Schmidt, talking about the Internet or the \u0027network of networks\u0027. Every network it touches it liberates: already we’ve seen publishing, education, retail, and most famously music and film changed in ways we could not have imagined. Does bitcoin represent a similar moment for banking and finance? Given the fact that bitcoin cannot be centrally regulated, \u0027an experiment in anarchy\u0027 seems like an apt description. However for any bitcoin/Internet comparison to be truly useful and tell us where the technology can go from here, we need to compare characteristics in greater detail. Although bitcoin and the Internet are both decentralized, they serve rather distinct purposes.The Internet evolved as the general purpose infrastructure for a limitless amount of applications and traffic, such as email. Bitcoin on the other hand has a very specific core purpose, a \u0027peer-to-peer electronic cash system\u0027 as described in the title of Satoshi\u0027s original whitepaper.Ultimately, most services built on top of bitcoin are meant to help it achieve its primary goal as a medium of exchange in one way or another. It exceeds this function by leaps and bounds – accomplishing what the current financial infrastructure is incapable of. However, as a general platform for new applications to run on bitcoin currently has severe limitations. Mastercoin, Counterparty, and others have attempted to build additional functionality on top of the bitcoin protocol with limited success. While the bitcoin block chain does contain properties that allow it to be used for third-party purposes, the resources are limited and have led to conflict in the past. Bitcoin simply isn’t designed to function as the flexible infrastructure for a wide range of applications like the Internet is. However, the potential exists to use the fundamental technology underlying bitcoin, the decentralised block chain, to build numerous decentralized applications.Decentralized applications have been getting much media attention as of late as the true revolution behind bitcoin, and where we’ll see the most groundbreaking innovation.It opens the doors to decentralized email, domain names, smart contracts, and even Decentralized Autonomous Corporations. As David Jonston, Executive Director of BitAngels, put it:Even Goldman Sachs remarked that the underlying technology behind bitcoin holds promise. Systems designed with the bitcoin blueprint can be extremely specific in nature, or instead provide a backbone that can support as many programs and applications as human creativity can generate – much like the Internet and web. Ethereum is currently being built on that very premise.Bitcoin itself however remains first and foremost a means of exchanging value. While its block chain technology holds the potential to create a new platform of permissionless innovation, this platform has, until recently, seemed destined to be divorced from the main bitcoin chain and functionality. In the context of the Internet comparison debate, new side chain proposals have great significance.If implemented into the bitcoin core code by the open-source community, it would enable anyone to create a side chain that can interact with the bitcoin block chain via two-way pegging. Coins can be moved from one chain to the other, allowing decentralized systems to be built that are interoperable with bitcoin.[post-quote] This means that new decentralized applications won’t require their own native unit of exchange and thus can avoid a new \u0027race for scarcity\u0027, as well as the extreme volatility that comes with a new, small market cap currency. Instead, such systems can utilize the rapidly maturing and more widely-accepted bitcoin as their native means of exchange and operation. In turn, the utility of such systems will directly add to the value and staying power of the bitcoin network. The implications of this are huge, as side chains will allow the general purpose infrastructure needed to allow the permissionless innovation the Internet and web are famous for. All tied in the end, to bitcoin. Side chains could be the last piece of the puzzle that links together the bitcoin currency, to the limitless possibilities its block chain technology holds. This would make bitcoin not \u0027merely\u0027 a new e-cash system that far outperforms the capabilities of modern financial infrastructure. It would make bitcoin the de-facto currency in a new decentralized online economy of unbound utility and possibility.An economy of decentralized applications that can’t be shut down, regulated, or censored by governments or even traditional corporations. All exchanging a similarly decentralized transnational digital currency.Thanks to side chains, bitcoin could become a frictionless global payment system, and a platform for decentralized innovation all in one.\u0027Bitcoin is the next Internet\u0027 has been a useful slogan to gain mainstream attention, and underscore bitcoin\u0027s potential impact on the world. However when we take a more systematic view of bitcoin\u0027s growing evolution as a whole, a more appropriate comparison becomes readily apparent.Rather than the next Internet, bitcoin can become the next killer app for the Internet, much like the web before it. A massive network of decentralized applications run by instant microtransactions rather than the exploitation of users\u0027 personal information and more.A new web with new rules, and new possibilities.Bitcoin image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Protocol, Technology, Marc Andreessen, Bitcoin, News, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Apr 27, 2014 at 11:10 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/21/decentralized-internet-project-maidsafe-to-raise-funds-via-safecoin-sale/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/6HMBua3kiggz28oWKz_0s-jiqYA\u003d/570x456/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/MXQEWAVKVRHTJD7ISIMA4UI4GE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Decentralized Internet Project MaidSafe to Raise Funds via \u0027Safecoin\u0027 Sale","INTRO":"The organization working to create a decentralized Internet starts its native payment system with a crowd-sale starting tomorrow.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Starting tomorrow, decentralized Internet platform builder MaidSafe will hold a crowd sale of currency-like tokens called \u0027safecoins\u0027 to support its enabling software.MaidSafe, over seven years in development, aims to create no less than a fully peer-to-peer and decentralised Internet platform, in which all data is \u0027shredded\u0027, encrypted and distributed to an extensive network of computers around the world.The technology allows developers to build applications in which all data is completely secure, private, and protected from deletion.During the initial sale, safecoins will be made available via purchase of a \u0027proxy token\u0027 called MaidSafeCoin. These are recorded on the bitcoin block chain and available from buysafecoins.com at a price of 17,000 for 1 BTC, or 3,400 for 1 MSC (Mastercoin).Initially this will raise funds for the project, but the safecoin tokens themselves are a kind of altcoin for developers and users to \u0027buy\u0027 access to network resources.The sale begins at 9am GMT on Tuesday 22nd April.Once the MaidSafe network itself goes live, holders of MaidSafeCoins can swap them for \u0027regular\u0027 (ie: no longer on the bitcoin block chain) safecoin tokens at a 1:1 ratio.MaidSafe, which stands for \"Massive Array of Internet Disks, Secure Access For Everyone\" is a 100% open-source project aiming at keeping all data free from malicious intruders and eavesdroppers, at the same time increasing access speed and protecting against hardware failure.Development of the network is also known as Project SAFE.Said David Irvine, MaidSafe\u0027s founder and CEO:The organization, a 14-member team based in Scotland, was founded in 2006 and has received $5m in funding to date. It has the ambitious goal of replacing all existing major Internet protocols, including HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and DNS.Since MaidSafe is a platform, use of its protocols is all based on a voluntary \u0027contract\u0027 between self-authenticating users and the network itself, without the participation of other humans or the need for passwords to be transmitted across any part of the network.It uses unused storage space and computing resources provided by users themselves, or \u0027nodes\u0027, to store and run the repetitive and encryption-based tasks that power the system and allow the rightful owners to access or share their data.File data is also shredded, encrypted by using its own data to generate keys, and sent to numerous physical locations.This redundancy ensures data is never accidentally lost due to deletion or hardware failure. Physical access to a complete file is impossible, locking out snoopers and data thieves. Denial of service (DOS) attacks are, according to MaidSafe\u0027s explanation, \"thwarted and useless\".MaidSafe\u0027s architecture features \u0027intelligent caching\u0027, which actually increases speed and network performance to the most-accessed data as more users join, rather than slowing it down due to server pressure on the existing Internet.Software running on the various nodes allocates and optimizes network resources, and routes around failures or machines that happen to be offline.The network\u0027s nodes are chained together in a cryptographic consensus model similar to a block chain, in which they watch (anonymously) each others\u0027 behaviour and raise the alarm in case of any discrepancy.As well as open-sourcing all the code that enables the system, MaidSafe has released all its patents and algorithms for public use at no cost. The patents are officially owned by a registered charity called the MaidSafe Foundation, and are to be used \"only in a defensive capacity\".Developers can access the open API to build decentralized applications that are fully secure and private.MaidSafe sees its system being used for any communications requiring this level of security and privacy, and suggests it for sharing scientific research data, whistleblowing activism, and more prosaic uses such as personal data storage, social networking, and simple communications like messaging, email and video/voice chat.\"Real sharing will defeat many global issues,\" says MaidSafe\u0027s introductory video.The safecoin/MaidSafeCoin crowd-sale will continue for 30 days or until 10% (429,496,729) of the total tokens are sold, whichever happens first.Bonus MaidSafeCoins will also be allocated on a sliding scale to early buyers, with first-weekers earning an extra 40%. The bonus drops 10% per week after that until the end of the initial sale.Once the MaidSafe network is live, users can still earn the remaining safecoins through the system\u0027s \u0027proof of resource\u0027 (POR) system known as \u0027farming\u0027, by contributing part of their computers\u0027 resources as a node on the network and using fewer resources than they contribute.Fifteen per cent of all safecoins earned will be contributed as an incentive to the pool of developers, or \u0027builders\u0027, who create the applications necessary for ordinary users to utilize MaidSafe\u0027s features.","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, startups, Technology, MaidSafe, Safecoin, News, Companies, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jon Southurst","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Apr 21, 2014 at 7:01 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/10/bitcoin-core-developers-weigh-in-on-side-chain-proposal/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/5UaZWyWQbrSG_syl-MawthBtBsI\u003d/570x480/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/IT3CLEME5RF43F3RW2KT73OQYM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin Core Developers Weigh in on Side Chain Proposal","INTRO":"Would bitcoin benefit from having multiple extra blockchains? Two influential figures think so.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"These days, everyone wants to add new features to the bitcoin block chain, but now one team thinks that it\u0027s found a way to do it responsibly - by creating \"side chains\" that can interact with bitcoin.The process, known as \u0027two-way pegging\u0027, has some hefty backing. It is supported by Adam Back, the developer of the HashCash, the algorithm bitcoin uses to generate and verify currency.On the business side, it has Austin Hill, a Canadian entrepreneur and angel investor who in 1997 founded Zero-Knowledge Systems, an anonymous networking and privacy technology company. Hill, who raised more than $80m for the endeavor, likes to say it was Tor, before Tor was invented.Clearly, the money and the technical know-how are there. So, how will it work?[post-quote]There have been two different approaches to expanding bitcoin\u0027s functionality in the past. One has been to introduce new features that piggyback on it, using the bitcoin block chain\u0027s existing resources. Counterparty is one example of this, and Mastercoin is another.The other is to just create whole new frameworks for next-generation cryptocurrencies outside of bitcoin. Examples of these are NXT and the still-unlaunched Ethereum proposal.The problem with completely separate altcoins and frameworks, says Hill, is that they they are not interoperable. They create new \"races for scarcity\", with each one representing a new asset in short supply.But, there are several problems with bitcoin, too, says Hill, which is why exchanges like Coinbase generally run their own transactions outside the block chain.Hill told CoinDesk: \"There is a practical reason why some of those things can\u0027t operate on the block chain, and that\u0027s because at peak, they\u0027re doing more transactions than bitcoin can support right now.\"Instead, Back and Hill want to \u0027shard\u0027 the block chain, creating another block chain, which has a two-way relationship with bitcoin\u0027s own.This will have two major benefits, Hill suggests: functionality, and scalability.And secondly: \"By sharding, you can have orders of magnitude faster transaction processing and you can start to scale bitcoin.\"In October, Back had proposed a concept called one-way pegging, in which bitcoins could be \u0027moved\u0027 from the bitcoin block chain to another block chain called a side chain, that was merge-mined with bitcoin. Bitcoins would be marked in the bitcoin block chain as having been transferred. Another coin in the new block chain would be marked as a representation of the transferred bitcoin.Then last year, bitcoin core developer Greg Maxwell figured out a method for two-way pegging, in which bitcoins could be moved back and forth between the side chain and the block chain.This would allow them to be transferred at will, so that the bitcoin network wouldn\u0027t lose its bitcoins forever when they were transferred, but could get them back if the owner decided to transfer them back into the bitcoin block chain.Bitcoin would be \u0027firewalled\u0027 from the side chain, meaning that any security issues that arose in a side chain wouldn\u0027t affect people who were only involved in the bitcoin block chain.This opens up some interesting possibilities, says Back:The advantage here is that, unlike altcoins, they would all be interoperable, with the bitcoin block chain (or, as he calls it, the \"main chain\", used as a common point of transfer.So, that takes care of functionality. But what about throughput? The current transaction rate on the bitcoin network is relatively low, at something under seven-to-nine transactions per second, which is why all of those off-chain transactions happen, in exchanges and elsewhere.The downside of that is that they become difficult (but not impossible) to audit in any publicly visible way.Says Hill: \"You are still having to extend and move your coins off the block chain into a trust me security model. That has led to huge amounts of theft.\"So, that\u0027s the proposal. What do core developers think?\"In particular the notion that a different chain might be designed to natively support things like smart contracts is funny, given that Bitcoin already supports them,\" argues Mike Hearn, the brains behind BitcoinJ, and a core developer since bitcoin began (he spoke about them as early as 2012, arguing that all the pieces of the puzzle were in place).The recent introduction of 40 extra bytes into bitcoin transactions for arbitrary messages (such as those associated with smart property or smart contracts) supports that view, although third parties have asked for more space.Hearn also doesn\u0027t think that alternative side chains can solve the scalability problem, which in any case is solvable purely within the bitcoin network, he argues.\"It\u0027s not as if there\u0027s some impossible limit beyond which Bitcoin can\u0027t go,\" he protests, pointing to the Bitcoin Wiki\u0027s scalability page, which breaks down how much further we can push the network.Gregory Maxwell, who first proposed two-way pegging, says that it could provide some relief for bitcoin, though:Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik argues that off-chain transactions are an enabler, not a problem.Garzik describes himself as a fan of off-chain transactions and points to his own side project, payment channels, as an example of setting up high-volume transactions with other systems outside the bitcoin network.So, some experts believe that two-way pegging could provide some useful respite for bitcoin from a scalability perspective, if side chains were able to connect with audit-able, fraud-proof private chains designed for high throughput. Those side chains could also be many and varied, each designed with their own specific properties for tasks like microtransactions and derivatives, say.But, for two-way pegging to work, changes have to be made to the Bitcoin protocol. Will Back and Hill\u0027s venture be accepted by the bitcoin open source community?Said Garzik:Once a concrete proposal appears in a pull request, then we can give a reasonable comment based on engineering evaluation.\"If the changes necessary to allow bitcoin to talk to other side chains are made, then it could relieve the bitcoin developer community of requests to tweak the blockchain to suit third-party purposes.Maxwell calls it the one change to rule them all.Hill and Back, who claim to have some core developers supporting their venture, plan to announce the full details - and its official name - by mid-May.Chains image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Protocol, Technology, smart contracts, Bitcoin, News, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Apr 10, 2014 at 7:31 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/25/developers-battle-over-bitcoin-block-chain/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/rI_ulhUhJ-jsU8pZGOStjxrrHJY\u003d/570x570/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/ZPZEIUYYENHG5J2AHQFWWOYHJE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Developers Battle Over Bitcoin Block Chain","INTRO":"Third-party service developers want bitcoin\u0027s developers to open up the blockchain.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"It\u0027s surprising what worm-filled cans a new version of the bitcoin protocol will open. The core developers released a much-anticipated update to the core software - version 0.9.0 - last week. Now, a third-party developer group is already lobbying for change.Counterparty, a financial trading platform built on the bitcoin block chain, issued an open letter to the Bitcoin protocol\u0027s core developers last week, urging them to reconsider a key component of the protocol\u0027s latest release. That component is called OP_RETURN, and it is a new feature designed to allow people to store extra data in the block chain.OP_RETURN was originally meant to store 80 bytes of extra data in a bitcoin transaction, but the core developers slashed it to 40 bytes. This upset Counterparty, because as a financial trading platform that allows people to create new asset classes and financial derivatives to be traded on the bitcoin block chain, it says that it needed those 80 bytes to store its data.The other option is to use another feature of the Bitcoin protocol, called multi-signature outputs. These involve more than one signature for a particular bitcoin transaction, and are designed for features such as escrow payments. But that second signature can be used to store data instead.\"If the data cap is left at 40 bytes, we will be forced to use such awkward constructions to accomplish our goals,\" the Counterparty letter said. Instead, the organization wants the core devs to play ball, and restore the original 80-byte cap.In a discussion on the Bitcoin Talk forum, core developer Jeff Garzik makes an argument for why they shouldn\u0027t. He warns that when a transaction is processed on the bitcoin network, everyone processes it, which means that the data you\u0027re storing has to be stored by everyone.He accuses Counterparty and Mastercoin - another service that also uses the block chain for its own purposes - of having \"simply flipped an \u0027on\u0027 switch and started using bitcoin P2P nodes as unwanted data stores.\" And they didn\u0027t engage the community before doing it either, he complains.Is it really the core developers\u0027 job to make it possible for others to build extra services on top of the block chain? It had better, if it wants to stay relevant, says \u0027PhantomPhreak\u0027, a core developer for Counterparty.PhantomPhreak argues that both parties get something from this kind of relationship. By piggybacking on the bitcoin block chain, Counterparty and other new services get pre-baked services including trusted timestamping, proof of publication, peer discovery and anti-DOS measures.Bitcoin, in turn, gets to stay relevant, (s)he argues: \"Bitcoin can be very conservative with the kinds of functionality that it directly supports, while still rapidly acquiring the new features that it needs to stay relevant and useful.\"So now, Counterparty (which hasn\u0027t contributed to the bitcoin core\u0027s open source effort), and the bitcoin core (which has stated that it needs people using the protocol to pitch in) are stuck with each other, and neither is happy. Phantomphreak says that \"a few of the Bitcoin developers are trying to prevent us from using the protocol as it stands, with all of the flexibility that it naturally provides.\"Core developer Mike Hearn has an idea to cut through the whole tangled mess. In fact, he had it in 2012, before Counterparty or Mastercoin even existed. Instead of trying to store lots of data in a special field in the block chain, why not simply store a pointer to a third party, P2P data storage pool, he asks? This could be achieved using something called a distributed hash table (DHT).Talking of fights, more tensions emerged among the core devs last week, and they\u0027re indirectly related to this question of who gets to use the block chain for what, and why.0.9.0 reduced the transaction fees - the money paid to get a message processed by the network - tenfold. This is a good way to encourage microtransactions on the network by keeping the costs of a single transaction low, so that you could, say, pay pennies for downloading a single story.Peter Todd, a contributor to the bitcoin code, told CoinDesk that he was worried that this would open the network up to spam and denial of service attacks, because people could use the cheap transaction fees to flood the network.[post-quote]Gavin Andresen, the Bitcoin Foundation\u0027s chief scientist and lead developer of Bitcoin Core, says that there are plenty of ways to slow down bitcoin transactions with DoS attacks - but he argues that they generally don\u0027t happen, primarily because the attackers would have little to gain. \"I have never said that bitcoin is directly suitable for transactions less than a dollar; I think the jury is still out on how low we can go,\" he says.Vitalik Buterin, developer of the soon-to-be-launched Ethereum project, argues that the concepts of transaction fees and storing messages on the block chain are connected. Transactions are badly thought out in the bitcoin protocol, he says. Some core developers have admitted this to CoinDesk, which is why they\u0027re working to change it using \u0027smart\u0027 fees.If transactions were better managed, then people could just pay for what they wanted to store, Buterin says. Then, there would be no \u0027free rides\u0027.It doesn\u0027t seem as though the core developers are about to change the OP_RETURN parameters to allow more data to be stored in the network. If they don\u0027t, then Counterparty has some options.It can hack together an inelegant use of the multi-signature protocol to store its data. It can explore Hearn\u0027s idea of using pointers and distributed hash tables. Or it can simply jump ship and either build its own block chain, or use someone else\u0027s service. Perhaps Ethereum\u0027s for example.But, PhantomPhreak isn\u0027t ready for that. \"Ethereum is not really an alternative to Bitcoin for our purposes,\" PhantomPhreak told CoinDesk. It isn\u0027t tried and tested yet, the anonymous developer contends.For now then, at least, some forward-thinking initaitives that want to expand beyond bitcoin\u0027s core services still feel as though they need the bitcoin protocol to do it. And it looks as though that\u0027s going to generate tensions, workarounds and in-fighting for some time to come.Chain link image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Protocol, Technology, Counterparty, Bitcoin, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Mar 25, 2014 at 8:05 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/07/113-million-in-gox-bitcoins-believed-to-be-moving-through-blockchain/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/nrRS80wpsSAOBkqKeEy8m0P5uqU\u003d/570x570/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/4IHREDWQCRDU5PMPPA2AH2VR5A.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"$113 Million in Gox Bitcoins Believed To Be Moving Through Blockchain","INTRO":"Is Gox moving money through the bitcoin block chain? If so, why?","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Large amounts of bitcoins previously handled by Mt Gox, which have lain dormant for years, have started moving on the block chain.Since the exchange blew up at the end of last month, people have been wondering where the stolen coins went, and have tried to trace some movements between Gox addresses. One participant on the bitcoin talk forum recalled an IRC conversation between Gox CEO Mark Karpeles and various users, which allegedly took place on June 23, 2011.During their conversation, Karpeles (a.k.a. MagicalTux) offered to demonstrate that the exchange owned large numbers of coins, by sending a uniquely identifiable amount to a given address. He sent 424242.42424242 bitcoins to a specific address beginning with 1eHhgW6vquBY. Sure enough, they showed up.A few weeks later, that large amount of bitcoins was broken into two smaller amounts. Then, more transactions occurred, peeling off 50,000 bitcoins at a time into separate wallets, possibly as a means of moving them into cold storage.Most of these 50,000 bitcoin wallets were recombined on 16 November, 2011, into two separate wallets. One of these contained 500,000 bitcoins, while the other contained 50,000.The 50,000 bitcoin address was created on that date, and was then dormant until July, 2012, when it began receiving small transactions along with several other outputs. However, no coins left that wallet, until today, when its 50,000 bitcoins were sent to another address, as part of outputs from various bitcoin addresses totalling 180,000 bitcoins ($113 million).Since then, these coins have been rapidly splitting, with coins being subdivided repeatedly. One branch was found to have been splitting every 30 minutes in what appeared to be an automated fashion. This suggests that there may be some code splitting the coins.We don\u0027t know for certain that the 50,000-bitcoin address is indeed owned by Mt Gox, but it seems likely. The other, larger, wallet went through several transactions, with the bulk of the coins being sent to an address that was verified as Mt Gox-owned on the block chain.The leaked Mt Gox crisis strategy document claims assets of 2,000 bitcoins, contained in a hot wallet, adding that the cold storage had been wiped out.So, why is this happening now? One explanation is that it makes the coins easier to use for a high volume of transactions. When bitcoins are sent, all the funds held in a particular address are sent, and the \u0027change\u0027 – the part that is surplus to requirements – is sent to a change address, usable by the sender. However, the block chain has to confirm that the change has been returned before it can be reused.If you were to try and send bitcoins to lots of users very frequently from one address containing a lot of bitcoins, then you would have to wait 10 minutes or more for the block chain to confirm your returned change, before conducting your next transaction.Core bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell also suggested that this was a Mt Gox transaction, based on interactions that he had with the Mt Gox API.Maxwell also argued that the splitting behaviour is consistent with a function in the leaked source code from Mt Gox. This suggests that some of the coins have been dropped into the Mt Gox online wallet, and that the system is now automatically breaking them up, he said.Money maze image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Mt Gox, Exchanges, Blockchain Technology, Wallets, Bitcoin, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Mar 7, 2014 at 11:24 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/23/ethereum-launches-cryptocurrency-20-network/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/KYKdfZJk8kba3YliZk52_7nVx08\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/YHRKPIMFOVDLJBZPUPPD6S7Y54.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ethereum Launches ‘Cryptocurrency 2.0’ Network","INTRO":"Ethereum is no altcoin; it is an operating system for altcoins, say developers.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"This Saturday, a group of cryptocurrency advocates will unveil a new system that they hope will rewrite the rules of cryptocurrency.Officially titled Ethereum, creators are calling it \"Cryptocurrency 2.0\". It\u0027s a decentralized mining network and software development platform rolled into one, and it will allow people to create their own altcoins, among other things.The project, which will be unveiled at the North American Bitcoin Conference, is the brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine, who has also been working on competing browser-based wallets Dark Wallet and KryptoKit. He wants new altcoins to be written for, and run on, Ethereum:The Ethereum network uses its own mining technology, Dagger. It utilises some of the concepts in the scrypt mining algorithm to keep the mining process even and fair.Scrypt (which is used by altcoins like litecoin), was designed to be more friendly to CPUs (and unfriendly to ASIC miners), so that a core elite of powerful ASIC users didn\u0027t get an unfair advantage. Slowly, people are circumventing that protection, and developing powerful mining hardware for ASIC, so Dagger tweaks those concepts in an attempt to make things more democratic once again.Dagger is an initial proof of concept, and the Ethereum team is considering a contest for the best possible ASIC-resistant proof of work. The developers are also looking into proof of stake, and they have developed a new PoS algorithm called Slasher. It solves many problems associated with older algorithms.So, Ethereum is a mining network, but it\u0027s also a kind of operating system, on which cryptocurrency \u0027apps\u0027 can run. People write those apps using a programming language designed by the Ethereum team. Then they publish it on the system, in the form of a \u0027contract\u0027.A contract is an automated agent on the Ethereum network, with an Ethereum address. It can receive and send transactions, and it stores the balances of those transactions.If I create \u0027dancoin\u0027, and publish it as a contract on the system, and give you a dancoin address, then you can send me dan coin. Rather than sending it directly to me, though, you send a message to the dan coin contract\u0027s address. This message will contain my address, and a value. The contract – which is effectively an app, remember – processes the code, and stores the value.This makes it possible to create sub-currencies backed by assets, anything from gold and other currencies, to digital property or even securities.It opens up lots of possibilities, according to the white paper here. One of them is the creation of colored coins, which are altcoins marked with certain properties to reflect digital or physical assets (a stock, a derivative, a car, or a house). Ethereum will be able to overcome some basic shortcomings that have hindered the development of colored coins, says the paper.Custom currencies are potentially extremely powerful in e-commerce, explains Buterin:Financial derivativesare another interesting option. They can be implemented in a few different ways and tied with various contracts. This makes complex transactions not only possible, but relatively simple and automated to a degree. One point to note: since there is no enforcement on the network, all financial contracts need to be fully collateralized.Ethereum can also be used in identity and reputation systems, simply by designing the necessary contracts. It can also be employed in decentralized autonomous organizations, peer-to-peer betting and online gambling, prediction markets, on-chain stock markets or in the insurance industry.One of the major uses of Ethereum will likely be standardised contracts that will employ specialised data feeds, allowing developers to peg currencies to other currencies, commodities or securities.Although Ethereum designed to be much more than a currency, the network does feature its own currency, too, dubbed ether. Ether is rewarded to miners and it also serves as a mechanism for paying transaction fees and eliminating spam. It will be sold in an initial fundraiser, but from then on it will be mined, resulting in a permanent linear inflation model. There is no cap, says Buterin.So, how does the platform actually work under the bonnet? A contract can be found at its address on the Ethereum network, but what\u0027s sitting at that address? The contract\u0027s code is there, along with the current state of all its addresses, and the transactions they made in the current block.But an address is a logical thing: where is this data actually stored? It\u0027s stored in every block mined on the Ethereum block chain. And a new block will be mined every minute.[post-quote]The most obvious worry is that this would create a massive block chain. Every full client will have a copy of the Ethereum block chain (although not smartphones). If that block chain includes lots of altcoin contracts, each with thousands of individual addresses, that\u0027s a lot of data.Buterin says the team has avoided this using functional data structures. Ethereum stores all of its data as branches of a tree. Only small changes will occur on the tree from block to block, and the system will store the common data between versions of the tree in a highly compressed way.Ethereum also dispenses bitcoin\u0027s input and output-based mechanism, instead just storing one object with a balance, per address.The group is working on clients for Ethereum in at least three languages, Buterin says. Windows, OSX, Linux and likely web browsers and Android will be supported.When asked how securities regulation might affect certain types of Ethereum contracts, Buterin explained that the most interesting legal challenges will revolve around decentralized autonomous corporations (DACs). The trouble with DACs is that nobody owns a traditional stake and the ownership is allocated by the Ethereum networks, or other decentralized application platforms. Buterin continued:He also pointed out that Ethereum plans to participate in the Consortium of Decentralized Applications (CODA).The people associated with the project give it traction. Buterin is one of four core developers, all of whom will get a cut from the initial fundraiser.One of these developers is Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Bitcoin Education Project, and now-departed co-founder of Invictus Innovations. Another is Anthony Di Iorio, founder of the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada, who is also founder of KryptoKit, which Buterin says will become an Ethereum wallet.The team is also working closely with several other players. Humint, the branded coin project, are considering basing their platform on it, Buterin says. he says. The fourth core member of the team is Mihai Alisie is the creator of Bitcoin Magazine, where he works with Buterin.Buterin has been a prominent member of the bitcoin community since 2011, and last year he quit university to pursue bitcoin opportunities full time. He also spent a lot of time working on colored coins and Mastercoin last year. However, he left when Mastercoin decided to work on top of Bitcoin.“The projects were being significantly hampered from reaching their full potential. So I came up with the idea for Ethereum in November to fix these issues, and create a superior platform for these kinds of protocols to develop and grow on,” Buterin told CoinDesk. Hoskinson added:Ron Gross, head of the Mastercoin Foundation, said he would publish his views on the initiative in the next few days on his blog.Buterin likes to point out that Ethereum development at a bare minimum level is easy, since much of the work has already been done, allowing users to employ off-the-shelf clients.“The challenge is making the client actually modular, scalable, and most importantly of all secure. That will be the bulk of our efforts over the next few months; continually refining the client, and at the same time continuing to tweak the protocol, so that we can create a cryptocurrency that can actually survive the challenges of real-world usage levels, and real-world attackers,” he said.This isn\u0027t a direct attack on the bitcoin network, but there\u0027s no doubt that the group is trying to introduce a host of new features that aren\u0027t in the protocol. In fact, they\u0027re trying to re-engineer things at a far lower level, creating what the white paper calls the \"Lego of crypto-finance\".Bitcoin\u0027s core developers seemed mostly bemused, although several of them rate Buterin highly.\"Many altcoin experiments pop up seemingly almost daily. We can wait until the dust settles, and incorporate any highly desirable features into a future bitcoin revision,\" said Jeff Garzik, a Bitcoin developer. He added that the Internet was \"the greatest test lab in the world.\"Story co-authored by Danny Bradbury and Nermin HajdarbegovicLego and Network Images via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Technology, Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, News, Distributed Ledger Technology, Technology News, Cryptocurrency 2.0, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jan 23, 2014 at 11:00 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/17/reality-keys-bitcoins-third-party-guarantor-for-contracts-and-deals/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/M0121MMhGJh3Kga345O7QaKpm0E\u003d/570x378/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/42GLHBGOZ5FHTFFAPXPSUQZ6SE.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Reality Keys: Bitcoin\u0027s Third-Party Guarantor for Contracts and Deals","INTRO":"A new bitcoin service will help you settle bets, make predictions and hedge positions without human intervention.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Brace yourselves for the next wave of bitcoin startups, and prepare to be surprised: they may not have much to do with bitcoin as a payment mechanism at all.We usually see bitcoin as disruptive to the payments industry, as its technology greases the wheels of transaction, and eliminates the need for currency conversions and hefty fees.We think of banks and credit cards. But just as we\u0027re getting used to that idea, the next wave of disruption is coming – with new targets.This wave takes aim at those who hold money for us as guarantors for contracts or deals we\u0027ve made: escrow companies, betting agencies and bookmakers.Digital currency technology has the ability to secure and enforce a whole range of digital contracts all by itself, performing functions that have previously required a trusted (human) third party with access to the deal-makers\u0027 money.Futures contracts, world event prediction exchanges, insurance, even your last will and testament can now be settled in this manner. If the subject of the agreement is something that can be factually proven with a specific time set for the decision, it\u0027s possible.Enter Reality Keys, a new service by Tokyo-based startup Social Minds due for public launch on 20th January. Reality Keys provides real-world data in a form that can be used to complete or disregard bitcoin transactions, based on quantifiable facts.Users then specify a date at which they would like to confirm the status or outcome of a particular event, and two cryptographic public keys are provided: one for if the event happens and another for if it doesn\u0027t.At the specified date, a private key is released corresponding to the outcome that occurred.Intrade, which took bets in US dollars on real-world events and was known to be quite accurate at predicting them correctly, was also the subject of regulatory action by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Similar companies have since risen, like Predictious, which takes bitcoin bets on anything \"from presidential elections to the Oscars, to the sales of the iPad.\" The catch is that you need to deposit your money with a third party, Predictious itself.Two examples in which Reality Keys could be used are:1) Currency hedging. You\u0027re an American importing wine from France. But fluctuating currency values hit your expenses hard as the Euro suddenly shoots up, and you must still pay your staff in US dollars.2) Event prediction and betting. You\u0027d like to put a wager on Hillary Clinton winning the 2016 presidential election.In both scenarios you deposit a certain amount (let\u0027s say 1 BTC) into an address that required two of three keys to spend: your key, the other person\u0027s key, and the Reality Key for one of those scenarios becoming true (i.e., the US dollar is worth less than the Euro, or Hillary Clinton wins the election). If the prediction indeed comes true, the 1 BTC is paid to you. If not, and you lose, it\u0027s paid to your betting partner.\"The rise of bitcoin owes a lot to with the failure of trusted third parties that were supposed to be looking after our money for us,\" said Edgar.\"But a lot of bitcoin services have ended up embracing the same model. I think we\u0027ve seen enough people lose their hard-earned bitcoins to prove that this model has to change.\"By limiting its role to providing data and making it usable on the block chain, Reality Keys empowers users to create their own digital contracts and transact directly with each other.It is all, of course, anonymous. Reality Keys provides only the keys, and has no interest in or knowledge of the nature of the contract or the amounts of bitcoin at stake. \"I wouldn\u0027t even call it a platform – just an information service,\" Edgar continued. Should one layer of digital signature protection not be enough, they can even structure their transactions to use additional signatures provided by other external parties, providing layers \"as deep as you like\" of assurance that don\u0027t depend on Reality Keys or any other single company or individual.Edgar said that, although this capability has existed within the bitcoin protocol for a while, it is limited by a lack of software client support and the logistics of brokering and setting up transactions. Blockchain.info supported multi-signature transactions for a short while but has since withdrawn the feature, citing low usage.\"We decided to go ahead and build our little part of the infrastructure we think the community needs, so people working on the other parts can build their parts too,\" he added.Edgar sees most use of the service to come via its \"simple, really accessible API,\" as developers build it into their own projects. It can also be used directly through its own web interface.Reality Keys is free for anyone to use, but charges a fee if you somehow require human intervention (e.g., if a data source like Freebase produces incorrect information that needs correction).Edgar said he is keen to expand the service to provide other kinds of data for a potentially huge ecosystem of peer-to-peer distributed markets.\"Our service doesn\u0027t really care what data it is providing. If you can point us to a data source with a public API and reasonably friendly Terms of Service, we can monitor it and plug it into the block chain,\" he concluded.Keys, Tokyo and Maths Images via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Derivatives, Blockchain Technology, Japan, startups, News, Companies, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Jan 17, 2014 at 11:30 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/still-dont-get-bitcoin-heres-an-explanation-even-a-5-year-old-will-understand/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/1feIws66FviMoW2FPL18v44xiLU\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/MLTHG5HVLNAXVAEVE4IJRYAD3Q.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Still Don\u0027t Get Bitcoin?

It’s a great day. I have one apple with me, I give it to you.You now have one apple and I have zero. That was simple, right?How to Store Your BitcoinWhat if we gave this ledger  to everybody? Instead of the ledger living on a Blizzard computer, it’ll live in everybody’s computers. All the transactions that have ever happened, from all time, in digital apples, will be recorded in it.You can’t cheat it. I can’t send you digital apples I don’t have, because then it wouldn’t sync up with everybody else in the system. It’d be a tough system to beat. Especially if it got really big.Plus, it’s not controlled by one person, so I know there’s no one that can just decide to give himself more digital apples. The rules of the system were already defined at the beginning.And the code and rules are open source – kinda like the software used in your mom’s Android phone. Or kinda like Wikipedia. It’s there for smart people to maintain, secure, improve, and check.You could participate in this network too – updating the ledger and making sure it all checks out. For the trouble, you could get like 25 digital apples as a reward. In fact, that’s the only way to create more digital apples in the system.I simplified quite a bit … But that system I explained exists. It’s called the Bitcoin protocol. And those digital apples are the bitcoins within the system. Fancy! So, did you see what happened?Read more: Bitcoin 101: How do Bitcoin Transactions Work?1) It’s open source, remember? The total number of apples was defined in the public ledger at the beginning. I know the exact amount that exists. Within the system, I know they are limited (scarce).2) When I make an exchange I now know that digital apple certifiably left my possession and is now completely yours. I used to not be able to say that about digital things. It will be updated and verified by the public ledger.3) Because it’s a public ledger, I didn’t need Uncle Tommy (third-party) to make sure I didn’t cheat, or make extra copies for myself, or send apples twice, or thrice…Within the system, the exchange of a digital apple is now just like the exchange of a physical one. It’s now as good as seeing a physical apple leave my hand and drop into your pocket. Just like on the park bench, the exchange involved two people only. You and me , we didn’t need Uncle Tommy there to make it valid.In other words, it behaves like a physical object.But you know what’s cool? It’s still digital.We can now deal with 1,000 apples, or 1 million apples, or even .0000001 apples. I can send it with a click of a button, and I can still drop it in your digital pocket if I was in Nicaragua and you were all the way in New York.I can even make other digital things ride on top of these digital apples! It’s digital after all. Maybe I can attach some text on it – a digital note. Or maybe I can attach more important things; like say a contract, or a stock certificate, or an ID card …So this is great! How should we treat or value these “digital apples”? They’re quite useful aren’t they?Well, a lot of people are arguing over it now. There’s debate between this and that economic school, between politicians, between programmers. Don’t listen to all of them though. Some people are smart; some are misinformed. Some say the system is worth a lot; some say it’s actually worth zero. Some guy actually put a hard number on it: $1,300 per apple. Some say it’s digital gold; some say it\u0027s a currency. Others say they’re just like tulips. Some people say it’ll change the world; some say it’s just a fad.I have my own opinion about it, but that’s a story for another time.Hey kid, you now know more about Bitcoin than most.Originally posted on Medium","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nik Custodio","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":""},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/20/tulips-pigs-and-eternal-graffiti-bitcoins-colourful-week/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/BVow4ZMRwpTAGXyJOyNu6AWv19A\u003d/570x386/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/NECDTTNXGNC7TGLSDFI5BFSK7Q.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Tulips, Pigs and Eternal Graffiti: Bitcoin’s Colourful Week","INTRO":"This week John Law grapples with Tulip Mania, block chain graffiti and the murky world of FUD.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 20th December 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.“Bitnot. Bitnot. Bitnot ...” The normally affable John Law could be heard angrily muttering this strange word under his breath for much of the week, as what should have been an agreeable round of festive engagements turned into a stream of “Ah, Law! Told you that bitcoin thingy was just tulipomania! Never did trust it.”This is all courtesy of our friend the Chinese state, of course, which has cut off BTC China’s ability to exchange bitcoin for yuan, largely shutting down the cybercurrency’s largest market and prompting a rapid halving in its dollar value.John Law’s chortling friends - alongside quite a lot of the media - have taken that as a signal that bitcoin is following the tulip mania speculative bubble model, referring to the famous events in Holland in the mid 17th century. Hence the invention, in self-defence, of the word \u0027bitnot\u0027: Bitcoin is not a tulip.Which isn\u0027t to say that recent events are not tulip-scented: people have certainly been buying bitcoin in unreasonable expectation of rapid profits, because unreasonable profits have been available. Doubtless some still smart from this week’s Chinese takeaway. But bitcoin as a whole ain’t no flower, baby.The tulip madness - in any case, a more complex set of events than those in popular understanding - saw large swathes of the population buy and sell contracts for future delivery of bulbs.The bulbs themselves didn’t matter: they could have been anything for which fashionable taste had ascribed an arbitrary value. But bitcoin is a fundamental invention that actually does something new; moreover, a lot of its usefulness is pretty much decoupled from whatever speculative value it has at any one time.If you’re using bitcoin to buy and sell stuff, as opposed to heap up value, then it doesn’t matter enormously whether one bitcoin is worth ten dollars or ten thousand. The person you’re buying your stuff from will give you a price in bitcoin that’s the dollar equivalent at the time of sale, so the amount of bitcoin you send will be worth that much.As long as you and the vendor can exchange bitcoin for dollars efficiently on-demand, and as long as the price of bitcoin isn’t fluctuating wildly over the course of the transaction, everything works without drama. Things aren’t there yet, but that’s usually unrelated to systematic issues with bitcoin.In other words, bitcoin isn’t the tulip - it’s the tulip and the system of contracts and the money flowing through the system. While bitcoin can create the illusion of far more value than exists - and remove it, cruelly, when the fantasy topples into instability due to some outside factor - it’s not alone in that, nor is that anything more than one aspect of a much bigger picture. Which will endure.Meanwhile, John Law is imposing a new rule for party-goers: anyone mentioning the wretched flower without backing it up immediately with an intimate knowledge of the structural failings of the Windhandel contractual environment owes him a bottle of decent claret. To be delivered on the spot. Claret futures will not be entertained.Banks and governments alike seem to be in the same club. When it comes to official policy on bitcoin, the first rule is don’t talk about official policy on bitcoin.This was demonstrated twice last week, first in the way that the Chinese state banking system without any public announcement put the kibosh on bitcoin exchanges, and then in the way Barclay’s seemed to be hopping from one foot to the other on bitcoin transactions.Can a company not trading in bitcoin, but working for one that is, use a Barclay’s account? Yes, providing you don’t talk about it. Can a Barclay’s retail customer send money to a Bitcoin exchange? No, but nobody’s talking about it.While John Law is entertained by the parallels between capitalist banking and authoritarian state socialism - he is reminded, as so often, of the Animal Farm\u0027s ending, where pigs and humans became indistinguishable - he does recognise FUD when he sees it.FUD is an old IBM acronym for Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt; it’s a potent weapon for paralysing the competition without having to do anything so uncouth as actually producing competitive products or services.The way it works is simple. You find the people who may be about to go to your competitors, and make them believe that they’re about to make a really bad decision. This can be by badmouthing the competition: \"Their stuff doesn’t work, and you’ll be in so much trouble if you go with it.\" Or by talking yourself up: \"Wait and see what we’ve got coming, you’ll look really stupid if you don’t.\"Or you can make vague, threatening predictions: the whole market is moving away from what you’re looking at, you’ll end up out on a limb. But the key is not to come out with any specifics: the woolier and more ambiguous your ‘information’ is, the better it sucks all the logic and evidence out of the decision making process.Done skillfully enough, this can not only paralyse an entire market for long enough to kill competition, it can also excuse a large organisation from actually having to make any decisions, thus covering up internal conflicts and systematic lack of clue - sometimes for decades.John Law would not like you to think that the banking system and the Chinese state are necessarily driven by internal power struggles and pervasive executive incompetence. They might be. You just can’t tell.But the real problem with FUD is that markets don’t like stasis. IBM got tripped up after decades of controlling the mainframe computer market, because small, nimble, smart companies just created their own new market in minicomputers and used new technology to change the rules. Microsoft ruled computing in the 90s: new technology from the Internet changed the rules and lanced the FUD boil.It might seem unlikely that anything as mighty as the interlocking global machinery of state regulation and the banking sector can be bypassed with new technology: cybercurrency must play their game or get out.Yet while they’re reacting with FUD and not even saying what the rules of the game are, history predicts that the rest of us will get tired of waiting and jump ship sooner or later.While the rest of the world is lollygagging about trying to work out whether bitcoin is a flower or a threat to global finance, Bitcoin is quietly ironing out its bugs and dealing with problems. Along the way, it’s showing some interesting behaviour that nobody would have predicted.Most of this is in the areas of privacy, anonymity and criminality. Bitcoin is built on the idea that nobody needs to know who you are or why you’re doing something: what you’re doing, however, is entirely open. But can you link all of that together?Sometimes, if you go to Mt. Gox to buy some bitcoin, and then go straight to Silk Road to buy some drugs, then it’s safe to infer why you made the Mt. Gox transaction – and, because Mt. Gox will know who you are, there’s now a route for the state to put its size 13s through your front door.That may be your just desserts. but the same techniques may mean your colleagues can find out how much you get paid (if you’re silly enough to get paid in bitcoin: it still astonishes John Law that people seem to think this a good idea).Meanwhile, straightforward theft and extortion involving bitcoin remains incredibly difficult to trace back to source.All this reflects the eternal tension between law and freedom. Should you be banned from doing things because they might cause damage, or be allowed to do them provided you accept the consequences of the damage done?One way will inevitably stop people from doing things that should be done, out of a surfeit of caution; the other will allow damage to happen that could have been stopped, out of a surfeit of carelessness.In real life, across history and society, there is no one right answer: a working mix of liberty and control, privacy and publicity, is constantly tried and tinkered with. So it is with bitcoin; this week saw some detailed musings from developer Mike Hearn on keeping your salary private, and more on chasing criminals across the block chain from researcher Sarah Meiklejohn.John Law has always learned more about the true potentials and pitfalls of cryptocurrency by reading up on what goes on in the engine room than hanging around with the Winklevii or axe-grinding doomsayers. If nothing else, you come away with some delicious little details.Meiklejohn had a lovely one: because it’s been possible to identify the wallet the FBI is keeping the confiscated Silk Road bitcoin in, people have been able to send it tiny donations - with globally visible notes attached.These range from spam to trenchant observations via jokes in dubious taste - but because they’re now part of the global block chain and that is designed to be an everlasting record of all transactions, these snide little snippets will last as long as bitcoin itself.As writing itself evolved from accountancy, there is a delicious resonance here between the very latest, fantastically complex technology and the very first, disarmingly simple business of clay tablets and styluses from 3,000 BCE Mesopotamia.Whether bitcoin will still be here in 5,000 years, John Law will not speculate – but if it is, so will people’s opinions of the FBI.Progress.John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.

Namely, with online black markets becoming the prime target of law enforcement, will those who participate in such actions face repercussions for their involvement?University of California, San Diego researcher Sarah Meiklejohn recently completed a paper that traced the movements of bitcoin in April using heuristics, a specific problem-solving technique that allowed her to trace individual bitcoins from consumer-facing exchanges like Mt. Gox to marketplaces such as Silk Road.Her comments to CoinDesk suggest that the answer is no, and furthermore, the US could take actions against past users. Meiklejohn said:In an exclusive interview, Meiklejohn discusses how her research was able to prove to reporters that coins seized from the account of Ross Ulbricht, the accused Dread Pirate Roberts, had passed through Silk Road. Meiklejohn also discusses if it will be possible to prosecute bitcoin users in connection with the Silk Road case and whether it\u0027s possible to hide criminal transactions using the block chain today:CoinDesk: If it\u0027s so hard to stay anonymous with a large amount of money, how are people getting away with large-scale theft?Sarah Meiklejohn (SM): The point of the work was not to completely de-anonymize users. At best, what we can do is cluster these addresses together and say, \u0027These are all one user\u0027 but we still don\u0027t know who that user is.The point was that this might erode your anonymity sufficiently to the point where an agency with subpoena powers would be able to step in.For example, the thing we identified the most was transactions with services. Deposits into Mt. Gox, withdrawals from Mt. Gox, deposits into Silk Road, withdrawals from Silk Road.Obviously, with all these transactions, we can say: \u0027look, there is an individual depositing bitcoins into Mt.Gox\u0027, but we certainly can\u0027t say which individual, unless that individual has identified their addresses publicly, in a forum or something.In and of itself, we\u0027re not de-anonymizing the thief or the user, but the thing is – once you start transacting with services that know your real-world identity, you\u0027re making yourself vulnerable to these agencies that are going to that service or exchange and saying: \u0027I need to know who this is\u0027.We\u0027re not getting you all the way there but we\u0027re following these bitcoins to the doorstop of Mt. Gox. One of the most frustrating parts of bitcoin is that you can see this happening and there\u0027s nothing you can do about it.I\u0027ve had people email me and say, “I had these bitcoins stolen, can you help?” and I write back and say, “I can track them, but it\u0027s not clear what that\u0027s going to do for you.” If I say, “I saw your bitcoins go to Mt.Gox, it\u0027s not clear what that buys you.”CoinDesk: Have you worked with law enforcement so far, and are they interested in this work?SM: I\u0027ve talked to a few different law enforcement agencies. Yep, there is definitely interest.CoinDesk: Do you know of any bitcoin thieves who have been prosecuted successfully?SM: No, but I have a favorite story about stolen bitcoins. In April, the mining pool Ozcoin had mined a block, and they wanted to pay their miners. Then someone hacked their script to steal the bitcoins.Apparently the operator of this mining pool was a nice, respected guy in the bitcoin communtiy, and people really rallied around it – starting this witch hunt to follow the stolen bitcoins.They didn\u0027t go very far. They went one hop, and then another hop to Strongcoin. Luckily Strongcoin is very identifiable, because all of their transactions go to this one strong address. The bitcoins then sat in Strongcoin, and the members of the bitcoin community really pressured the owners of the Strongcoin wallet service to turn the bitcoins in.When the thief tried to spend the bitcoins, Strongcoin somehow hacked their own system so that the bitcoins went back to the owner, Ozcoin.So this wasn\u0027t law enforcement, but this was kind of a sign that if you can track these flows of bitcoins and identify what they\u0027re doing, then you can implore that service to step in – and they did.CoinDesk: I know you were not involved in the FBI\u0027s investigation of the Silk Road. But describe what you\u0027ve observed with the Silk Road addresses since the case became public. Does that give you any insight into the FBI\u0027s work?SM: I confirmed for some reporters that the funds flowing to the seized coins/FBI address were directly from the Silk Road, and that some of the coins flowing to Dread Pirate Roberts\u0027 seized coins were from Silk Road.With these volumes of bitcoins flowing through the network, it\u0027s impossible to miss. 26,000 BTC flowing into an address within a few hours, that doesn\u0027t happen all the time.CoinDesk: Has anything interesting happened with these addresses since then to make you wonder what the FBI is doing?SM: The most interesting thing with those addresses will be in years when the case is over. For now, they have to keep those bitcoins in those addresses for evidence.Once the trial is over, it sounds like what they\u0027re supposed to do is cash out, liquidate the assets. That\u0027s going to be interesting to see. Cashing out that volume of bitcoins now would take months, given the volume of trading. And who knows what bitcoin will look like in a year or two or whenever the trial is over. That will be something interesting.In the meantime, the thing I find the weirdest about those addresses are these protest messages. I call it spam or graffiti. You ping the address with some tiny amount of bitcoins, and you attach a public note.It ranges from advertisements for gambling sites to anti-government protest messages. It\u0027s kind of funny. The block chain is the global history of bitcoin, and that graffiti will be around forever.CoinDesk: Do you expect a lot of individual Silk Road customers to be prosecuted?SM: I would be surprised if some of the bigger drug dealers were not prosecuted, because it seems so easy at this point.The FBI now has all the data for Silk Road, they can see how much these guys earned, and they can see the addresses they used. So it really seems like they have a lot of what they need to be able to prosecute them. I would say probably small-time individual users, just buying a little bit of weed, are probably not going to be prosecuted.CoinDesk: What does the Silk Road case say about bitcoin crime? Do you feel like this case is showing people that the party\u0027s over? Or will the criminals just become more clever?SM: If you know how bitcoin works and are very motivated to protect your anonymity, that is possible. The problem is there are more people who don\u0027t know.We saw a lot of people buy their bitcoin from Mt. Gox or another exchange, then transfer the bitcoins that they just bought directly from their Mt. Gox address to the Silk Road account, and that\u0027s how they buy the drugs.We saw a lot of that, and that\u0027s the biggest mistake – not understanding that hopping directly from an exchange that knows who you are to the site where you want to buy drugs is probably not a good idea.CoinDesk: More sophisticated criminals would do what?SM: Let\u0027s say you\u0027re a drug dealer. You\u0027ve taken in a bunch of bitcoins, now you want to cash out. The first thing would be to withdraw to an address that you own that is outside of Silk Road and outside Mt. Gox. Then you would want to mix those bitcoins. Right now, this is somewhat tricky to do at scale.Our experience with mix services was not great – one service stole our bitcoins and with the other one, they didn\u0027t come back very mixed. One of them was fine – but we only tried to mix 1 or 2 BTC. So who knows, once you scale.Once you\u0027ve mixed your bitcoins, you could drop them into an exchange and cash out.That would be it. We wouldn\u0027t be able to track that. I don\u0027t know if I really want to be advertising that to future criminals, [laughs].There\u0027s this tension between privacy and anonymity, and then usability. If you\u0027re not super into bitcoin, if you\u0027re just doing this as a way to make money, at some point, doing what I just described might be unattractive. That might be enough of a deterrent to not bother.We\u0027ve actually been looking into a form of ransomware recently. The idea is, someone holds something hostage and demands payment in bitcoins. I was trying to look for information about this, and I found a bunch of users online complaining about being held ransom – not that they were being held ransom, but that dealing with bitcoin was such a pain.CoinDesk: What kind of things were they being threatened with if they didn\u0027t pay?SM: This ransomware can come in a bunch of different forms. The most direct thing is, they just lock down your computer and say, \u0027Give us 2 BTC at this address and we\u0027ll unlock your computer\u0027. It\u0027s a form of malware.They\u0027ve infected your computer, but rather than monetizing it using one of the ways that botnets typically do, they monetize very directly – by getting you to give them money in exchange for getting your computer back.Our group just had a paper accepted [\"Botcoin: Monetizing Stolen Cycles,\" lead author Danny Yuxing Huang, published 6th December] exploring bitcoin mining and the usage of botnets to mine bitcoins. The classic way that botnets make money is to send spam, do port scanning or steal credentials.But it\u0027s this long-term process of monetization. And now there\u0027s ransomware – that\u0027s a more direct way. This other thing we\u0027ve been seeing [over the past 18 months] is probably the most direct form you could imagine, which is just mining bitcoins.So, I compromise your machine, and then I use your machine to mine bitcoins. I\u0027m literally minting bitcoins with your infected machine.We wanted to look and see how common that was, how much money these botmasters could make doing this, and get a sense of the landscape. It\u0027s definitely happening, and it definitely seems profitable.Some of the pretty big botnets like ZeroAccess were doing this. [According to lead author Huang, hundreds of thousands of infected computers or more are mining bitcons, yielding hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit.]This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

One of those places, however, is University of California-San Diego (UC-SD), which is home to researcher Sarah Meiklejohn.Law enforcement agencies and media outlets turn to the PhD candidate to trace bitcoin movements, because Meiklejohn – along with a team including other UC-SD researchers and those from George Mason University – has dug deep into the block chain, following the money and challenging the notion that bitcoin transactions are anonymous.Meiklejohn\u0027s paper, “A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men With No Names,” provides a snapshot of the bitcoin economy as of April 2013.The paper also describes how Meiklejohn\u0027s team sleuthed out bitcoin addresses by making transactions and deposits, then used heuristics to link clusters of addresses, following money from a supposedly anonymous marketplace such as Silk Road all the way to an exchange such as Mt. Gox, which if subpoenaed would have to turn over users\u0027 real names to authorities.In light of these findings, we sat down with Meiklejohn in an antique shop/cafe in San Diego to talk about her dealings with bitcoin and whether the currency can truly be used anonymously.CoinDesk: Do you own any bitcoins yourself?Sarah Meiklejohn (SM): We bought a bunch of bitcoins with the grant money... one of the things I bought was 10 of the physical bitcoins, Casascius Bitcoins. We have these weekly reviews so we decided to give out a bitcoin to whoever gave the best presentation.But if you gave any presentation, that was the best one by default. So we had to stop giving out the bitcoins, because we were giving people like $80 [the exchange rate at the time] to show a graph.I earned one of those bitcoins for my presentation. I cashed out right away... and got 80 bucks. [laughs] I guess I could have waited and done better.When we first bought bitcoins, [the exchange rate] was like $5 a bitcoin, so we\u0027ve done well for ourselves there. [On Nov. 8, when this conversation took place, one bitcoin was worth $288.71.]We bought a bunch more later, probably at more like $15. The rise in the price has been pretty outrageous. We bought about 25 bitcoin [and still have many of them].CoinDesk: What will your research group do with them?SM: That\u0027s a good question. I\u0027ve been talking to people about different follow-up projects. But it\u0027s not clear that any of it will involve actually spending bitcoins.For this project, we didn\u0027t really have to spend much. Our biggest hit was Bitmix, one of these mixing services, which just stole 10 bitcoin from us. [CoinDesk attempted to contact Bitmix but so far has not received a response.]But all the stuff we bought was kind of junky, it didn\u0027t cost all that much. For the exchanges, we didn\u0027t even need to spend anything, it was just deposit/withdrawal.CoinDesk: Can you sum up your bitcoin research for us?Sarah Meiklejohn (SM): The two broadest questions we were trying to answer were, one, what are people using bitcoins for? There are all these legitimate vendors - BitPay signing up companies like WordPress - and we wanted to see how prevalent that was relative to anything else.The second question, which was more security focused, surrounded bitcoin\u0027s potential for anonymity. Bitcoin uses these pseudonyms, and in theory the behavior of your pseudonyms doesn\u0027t have to be linked – if you\u0027re careful. But the question was, how much is this potential for anonymity actually achieved?CoinDesk: What did you learn about the whole bitcoin economy landscape that surprised you?SM: It\u0027s really concentrated in a small number of places. Our numbers are from back in April - I would expect that things have shifted at least a bit, just because of changes that have happened in bitcoin over the summer.As was pointed out by an older paper by [Dorit] Ron and [Adi] Shamir, the majority of bitcoins are not moving; they\u0027re sitting in these addresses. You can speculate however you want about what that means – either they\u0027re hoarded, they\u0027re lost, they\u0027re the cold storage for different exchanges, we don\u0027t know.There\u0027s no way of knowing. We did see some movement in these, I call them “dinosaurs.” When they did their research, in May 2012, Ron and Shamir said about 76% of bitcoins were being hoarded, and even when we re-did their analysis this year, it was already down to 64%. I expect that number to keep changing, especially given what\u0027s happening with the exchange rate.So first of all, the majority of bitcoins aren\u0027t even circulating. The other thing was how quickly the remaining bitcoins were circulating.If there are only 4 million BTC in circulation, we saw - again this is all back in April - that a total of 1.2 trillion BTC had been transacted. So that means that all these circulating bitcoins have been spent many, many times over.The other phenomenon that we had to include in the paper, just because it was so outrageous, was SatoshiDICE and dice games in general. The transaction volume completely dwarfs everything else, but then at the same time, the amounts that are being spent are tiny - it\u0027s fractions of bitcoins. That was fascinating.The other thing that I thought was interesting - and again I\u0027d expect to have changed even since April - is this rise in instantaneous transfers.With SatoshiDICE, the second you click send, you get your (winnings) back. They\u0027re taking this double-spending risk here... as a result there has been some double spending on SatoshiDICE - a small amount.It\u0027s the same with BitPay - the second you click send, they say, “We got your bitcoins.” That\u0027s actually a nice trend - as long as you\u0027re a big company and you can build this into your cost of doing business, it really provides a big service to your users.Because when we were doing our transactions, depositing into an exchange, withdrawing them, sitting there and waiting an hour before we could move them again was a real pain.CoinDesk: As far as anonymity, you came to the conclusion that it\u0027s not that easy to stay anonymous with bitcoin?SM: Actually, I\u0027m not sure that that\u0027s the right conclusion. I think that if you are motivated and if you understand how the Bitcoin protocol works, you can stay anonymous.The caveat there is that you have to try to stay anonymous at scale. If you have a bitcoin, then sure, you can stay anonymous. If you understand the protocol, if you use mix services or other crazy stuff, you\u0027re going to do fine.The problem is when you try to scale this up, if you have millions of dollars worth of bitcoins, then it\u0027s going to become a lot harder to hide that number of bitcoins in the network.When we ultimately went to track some of these big thefts, we saw these attempts to do crazy things like splitting the bitcoins, then peeling them, then aggregating the bitcoins back together - but ultimately the fact that every transaction was publicly available was going to shoot you in the foot when you try to obscure the flow of large amounts of bitcoins.CoinDesk: Getting back to your “Fistful of Bitcoins” paper, can you sum up, in layman\u0027s terms, how your research followed bitcoins from one transaction to another and partially broke through the anonymity of bitcoin?SM: We did a two-pronged methodology. The first thing we did was pretty dead simple. We just did a lot of transactions. We signed up with like 30 different exchanges, deposited bitcoins into the accounts, then withdrew the bitcoins; a fancy re-identification attack.The idea was that if I\u0027m depositing, then Mt. Gox will give me a deposit address and I\u0027ll say “Oh, that\u0027s Mt. Gox\u0027s address”. I can then label that as definitively belonging to Mt. Gox.Similarly, when I withdraw the bitcoins, I can go look at the transaction and see the sender and say, “That\u0027s Mt. Gox too”. This basically allows us to identify a very minimal amount of ground data.We next tried to cluster different addresses together, using two clustering heuristics that we described in the paper.The first one was really standard, a lot of people have used it, and the idea was that if any addresses have been used as inputs to the same transaction, then they have to be controlled by the same user.[For example,] someone needs to send someone 5 BTC and they have 1 BTC in each of five addresses, and they pool those addresses together to pay it. This is kind of a standard thing in the protocol... this is a very safe heuristic, there are very limited cases in which this heuristic would be violated. It\u0027s acknowledged in the protocol by Satoshi.The second one is based on the idea of making change. Let\u0027s consider, I still need to send someone 5 BTC, but instead of having 1 BTC in each of five addresses, I have 6 BTC in one address.By the properties of the Bitcoin protocol, I need to send those 6 BTC all at once. I can\u0027t just spend 5 of them. What I can do, functionally, since obviously I don\u0027t want to overspend, is create a transaction with two outputs.One of the outputs is the legitimate recipient, for 5 BTC, and the other output is an address I own, to which I send the excess 1 BTC. That\u0027s the change address.Again, this is a well-established property of bitcoin that these change addresses are going to be prevalent. The heuristic is: The change address in the transaction belongs to the same person as the sender. That\u0027s great - if you can identify change addresses. That is the really tricky part, and probably the bulk of the work of the project went into making this heuristic conservative.This heuristic was really helpful in identifying certain patterns in the network.For example, what we call in the paper, peeling chains. The idea is, I take a big amount of bitcoins in one address, I spend a tiny amount and I peel the bulk of the coins off to a change address and that continues.For example, think about a mining pool getting the 25 BTC reward and then paying its miners. This pattern is really common in the bitcoin network, and the idea is that without identifying these change addresses you can\u0027t follow the money at all.CoinDesk: Are there cryptographic technologies that people could be using to make bitcoin more anonymous?SM: There was this paper published this year, “Zerocoin: Anonymous Distributed E-Cash From Bitcoin,” out of Johns Hopkins University that layered certain cryptography technologies on top of bitcoin to give provably secure anonymity guarantees. Unfortunately, the big caveat with their work is that it\u0027s a lot less efficient.In some sense, bitcoin was this big slap in the face to traditional cryptography. On its face, bitcoin shouldn\u0027t work. It\u0027s just signatures and hashes, and it\u0027s really amazing that it works, and I think the design of it is incredible.It\u0027s kind of dead simple. I also think that that\u0027s part of the reason that it actually got widely adopted -- anyone can understand it, if you take 10 minutes and explain how it works.It\u0027s intuitive, and it makes a lot of sense. Whereas, traditional cryptographic e-cash doesn\u0027t make as much sense. Bitcoin is an interesting wake-up call as a cryptographer.Another project I\u0027m interested in is exploring the provably secure aspects of bitcoin, and the relation between bitcoin and existing cryptographic e-cash schemes that use a lot more heavy machinery.CoinDesk: In light of your research, how do you feel about the future of bitcoin? Do you feel more confident about this system, or less, after examining it?SM: The thing that makes me the most nervous right now is this volatility and this low trading volume, and the fact that these big whales with thousands of bitcoins can really affect the price single handedly.That kind of stuff makes me a little nervous. It\u0027s a chicken-or-egg problem. You need more people to adopt bitcoin in order to stabilize this, but people are shying away from bitcoin because they perceive it as volatile and as a risky investment.The other thing is, it would be important to see more legitimate uses of bitcoin. Its biggest problem right now is there\u0027s no clear reason why I should start using bitcoin. I\u0027m happy enough with my credit card.Unless you really, really care about privacy, the barrier to entry for bitcoin is pretty high. It\u0027s not that usable, you can\u0027t walk into a coffee shop - at least outside the Bay Area - and buy stuff with bitcoins. I know there have been startups geared to this, but right now it\u0027s a little clunky.Even if I can walk into a coffee shop and buy something with bitcoins, there\u0027s not a great mechanism for doing that. Unless you\u0027re both using the same wallet service and they have great Wi-Fi, it\u0027s a little tricky right now.I think the usability will have to be higher, I think there will have to be more legitimate services that accept bitcoins, and I think the volatility will have to be lower.I think that people aren\u0027t adopting bitcoin because these things aren\u0027t happening, and these things aren\u0027t happening because there are not enough people using bitcoin.It\u0027s tricky. I don\u0027t know what will happen to bitcoin. I think it\u0027s a nice first step in a certain direction – and maybe it\u0027ll be more than that.You can now read the second part of the interview, where Meiklejohn discusses her findings related to Silk Road and online black markets.","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Protocol, SatoshiDice, sarah-meiklejohn, Technology, Bitcoin, News, Features, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Dec 8, 2013 at 6:47 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/06/questions-for-cash-chains-of-command-and-with-this-coin-i-thee-rob/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/LLYaBNsVAZ37xKtuLqdi33a0sLQ\u003d/570x380/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/UC2EJ672AJELLETI3OE5LPRNZI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Questions for Cash, Chains of Command, and with this Coin, I Thee Rob","INTRO":"John Law ponders BTC-e\u0027s credentials, block chain security and hiding bitcoins from divorce lawyers in his weekly review.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 6th December 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law. Bitcoin in its present form has a number of weak points, but the most notorious – and weakest – is the exchange mechanism that converts bitcoin into real-world currencies. Like the transporter system on the Starship Enterprise, you’re not always guaranteed to get out what you put in, arrive where you expected, or even get through at all.This is partly due to the uncertain and frequently hostile regulatory environment of the existing cash control networks. This environment makes it hard to run an exchange which has normal bank accounts and legal safeguards in all the markets where you’d like to exchange your bitcoin.This is also due to the currency\u0027s \u0027frontier\u0027 nature: a great deal of its attraction lies in its extra-legal aura. However, the exchanges themselves do not always avoid the same shimmery vagueness.This week’s worry is BTC-e, Europe\u0027s second-biggest exchange, which is seeing a lot of consumer dissatisfaction because, well, their money isn’t turning up. Fierce debate continues over where exactly the problems lie on the spectrum of overloaded systems through to out-and-out mobsterism. BTC-e isn’t helping matters by not having a bank account, not answering questions and not revealing who’s behind it. If you don’t plan to turn your bitcoin into fiat cash - the part of the translation that always seems to cause the most problems - then you needn’t worry: if you’re holding it for fun or if you’re using it to buy stuff from bitcoin enabled retailers, then none of this is your problem. However, if you do need to see the hard stuff, then for your future happiness,you may wish to apply some simple tests to anywhere you’re planning to send large amounts of money. Who are they, what are they going to do with your money, when will they do it, and what do you plan to do if they don’t? Failure to get a decent answer to any of those questions and just remember there’s a reason Kirk always took a phaser and two redshirts into the transporter booth with him before energising. But, alas, such questions don’t always help. John Law remembers one online discussion he was part of a few years back, where a blatant too-good-to-be-true online deal was being offered on some particularly desirable mobile phones. The website owners didn’t check out, the contact details weren’t valid, the company was unknown and the prices were so far below wholesale that even if the goods were actually as offered, they had to be hooky. John Law and others searched out and provided all this information, and presented absolute cast-iron reasons why none of this could be remotely true. “Yes,” said one online denizen. “I know. But I’m going to send them my money anyway. It might be true, and if it is - wow, what a deal!” There\u0027s only so much you can do to keep the redshirts away from the Klingons. A typically balanced piece by the Economist on bitcoin canters calmly over familiar territory - is bitcoin safe, does the maths work, is there a bubble, and so on. But it also raises two questions connected with mining, one also familiar – but one less so, and worth a good look. The familiar one is that the arms race among miners is making it impossible to invest the time, energy or custom hardware costs to see a decent return; for now, the bubble-icious nature of the beast is keeping people keen. But that’s not guaranteed. The less familiar, and more intriguing, question is about the block chain. It records all transactions, which is dandy, but as bitcoin gets more popular the block chain grows like Topsy. Currently at 11GB, this is now a seriously large chunk of data to move about the place – and it does have to move about, as multiple nodes have to keep copies to keep things verified. Yet there’s no obvious motivation or reward to node owners to participate; miners, yes, but as noted that’s not guaranteed to remain a widespread activity. The Economist notes that a number of proposed fixes are in the works – so nodes could be paid a tiny fraction of each transaction – and that the protocol now has a track record of successfully overcoming problems. But it frets, as only the Economist can, that it’s all a bit fragile and run by people who can’t control it. John Law cannot predict the future. But he does remember the past: in particular, the past evolution of the Internet. As he has repeatedly noted, many of the same issues now confronting bitcoin were previously raised as serious reasons why the Internet itself would fail. Nobody controlled it. It didn’t have the capacity to carry huge amounts of data – for graphics, say, or audio, or even (as some visionaries recklessly claimed) video. It couldn’t cope with the huge numbers – some thought there might be millions – of users if it was opened up to the general public, and the economics just couldn’t work. As you will have noticed, none of this actually broke the Internet. Threats do remain, but they aren’t technological – they’re more along the lines of corporations and governments trying to balkanise the Internet for reasons of control and profit, and trust being lost due to spooks and crooks mucking about where they’re not welcome. Expect the same basic class of threat to be the biggest real issues bitcoin – or bitcoin-like systems – face, and expect them to be fiercely resisted, much as the elder tribes of the Internet are even now marshalling their forces to make the place secure, private and impossible to traduce. In this wicked world, money and sin are often found in bed together. And thus the question arises: is bitcoin a sensible place to hide assets from the law – especially when one is preparing to divorce the other half while keeping rather more than your half of the marital assets.The question has been answered: no, not really. Hiding stuff from courts is all perjury-fraudery jaily-waily, and you’ll have to answer embarrassing questions about where it’s all gone no matter how you’ve tried to disguise your intentions. John Law would put bitcoin quite a long way down the list of portable high-value disguises for cash, independent of whom you are trying to hide it from. Traditional and more congenial alternatives include diamonds, gold and art – the latter especially tempting at the moment – provided you always establish a conduit in good time into which regular, large sums of cash can vanish in an untraceable way. Get known as a bon viveur with a taste for expensive booze and slow horses. (The real specialists appear to sink so much money into these and other reprehensible hobbies that their spouses divorce them for recklessness, which makes it twice as hard to argue that the dosh still exists somewhere.) For those with stronger nerves, however, bitcoin does offer an intriguing possibility: you could short yourself. The principle’s simple. Openly buy a bunch of bitcoin. Immediately sell them, and stick the resultant cash in a sock somewhere. Then, when bitcoin crashes, buy back the number you first thought of. You still have a fully-stocked wallet when the lawyers come knocking, but your real stash will be silently waiting for you after the dust dies down.Of course, if you get your timing wrong or bitcoin never crashes you’ll end up with an empty wallet and no way to buy back enough bitcoin to replenish it. In that case, you can sadly reveal you bottled out early, and cough up. And if you have no fraudulent intent - you’re planning a nice surprise for your golden wedding anniversary - then sell high, buy low is a perfectly respectable investment strategy. John Law earnestly recommends you do none of the above, and conduct both fiscal and marital matters with utmost probity. Personally, he has his hands entirely full doing just that without introducing any complications to do with bitcoin, perjury and general dodginess, and can assure all concerned that any cash that appears to vanish in large quantities into the bank accounts of the wine merchants of Soho is doing precisely that.

These satellites can be launched into space cheaply by piggybacking on other payloads.Garzik estimates that it would cost just $2m to get one into orbit. Once in space, it would serve as an alternative way to distribute block chain data. “Information wants to be free,” Garzik said in his post about the project.But can’t it be free on the ground? The Internet already does a pretty good job of letting around 5,000 bitcoin nodes distribute information. It was built to route itself around damage, and we rely heavily on it.If the Internet ever failed, we’d presumably be too busy trading chickens to worry about whether we could confirm cryptocurrency transactions.Garzik explained that a bitcoin node depends on other nodes for its view of the network, he said:One such attack, named a Sybil attack, focuses on peer-to-peer networks like bitcoin. In an attack like this, malicious nodes surround a victim node and pass it false information.“Bitcoin nodes are ultimately at the mercy of the data they receive from outsiders,” Garzik says.“All it takes is one honest source of block chain data to defeat a Sybil attack and similar attacks. Eventually, the honest block chain with the largest proof-of-work will win the day.”That honest source would be in orbit, and it’s better to put it up there because satellites are great at one-to-many communications. It could beam blockchain information to any node that wanted to communicate with it.The bandwidth required for this satellite wouldn’t be huge, 1MB per minute should do it.The cubesat would get its data from multiple groundstations, which would act as normal peer-to-peer nodes, but would verify that the block chain information was correct before transmitting it.That data would initially be the latest bitcoin block, which the satellite would broadcast repeatedly. In the future, it would broadcast recent chains and transactions.Garzik has two mission profiles for his satellites. One will involve between four and six of these devices, with which he believes he can get full earth coverage (or at least major continents).The second would see a single satellite go up. He’s hoping that the satellite(s) would help to serve bitcoin users in remote areas where traditional connectivity is patchy.Even if the full network didn’t deploy, bitcoin users would at least be able to access stellar block chain data for a small amount of time each day, and this would still carry significant value, he says.“Any bitcoin participant on the ground can still have significant value from reading even 25% of the satellite broadcast,” Garzik reasons.“The point is to discover ‘honest’ blocks with valid proof of work. The network is self-correcting, even given a reduced trickle of valid blocks.”There are multiple phases to Garzik’s project.Phase one will see the creation of a team – which will flesh-out the cubesat specifications, price-out leased bandwidth, and workout specific data needs. Phase two will see the build and launch of the first satellite.The money for the second phase isn’t coming through the block chain just yet. Garzik posted about the project on 15th November, announcing a donation address and two sponsors: himself and Bitcoingrant.org. At the time of writing, the wallet address was yet to receive more donations.Nevertheless, there is sufficient interest to get the project moving. Garzik says:He hopes to have a demonstration satellite in orbit by 2016-18. “Additional interest and funding will dictate how large the network may grow,” he added.He claims to have verbal commitments for full cubesat construction in phase two, and says that these commitments also cover around 25% of the launch\u0027s costs.Earth in Space Image via Shutterstock","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Protocol, Jeff Garzik, Space, Technology, Bitcoin, News, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Dec 6, 2013 at 4:00 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/02/directoryio-prank-proves-bitcoin-protocols-strength/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/xgG2uLOOgh4yWk-CtG_HnykH68g\u003d/570x428/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/MDFJAEDQYREBVMOKPIMWW4G76E.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Directory.io Prank Proves Bitcoin Protocol\u0027s Strength","INTRO":"A website that listed bitcoin private keys with corresponding public addresses has been revealed as a prank.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Bitcoin users around the world can relax: reports indicating thousands of private keys were released into the public domain have been dismissed.A site called directory.io caused a brief panic yesterday when it supposedly listed every bitcoin private key alongside its corresponding public address. Headlines around the web proclaimed bitcoin doom, with some speculation that bitcoin’s minor drop in value was a direct result. It was, however, quickly revealed to be a false alarm, and then, a joke.Reddit user fiveturns, claiming to be behind the site, said:“All of these keys (apart from zero) are valid. It is simply a joke. Remember when you\u0027ve been told that it is almost impossible to generate a key-pair identical to somebody else’s? This is a visual representation of that improbability. Look how many pages there are!” he added.The site’s lengthy header should have been a giveaway: as fiveturns wrote, the site features a list of computer-generated private key addresses that correspond to nothing in particular. Thus, there is no chance of your address being in there.[post-quote]Directory.io is actually a worthwhile demonstration of how strong the Bitcoin protocol is, and the (incomprehensibly massive to non-mathematicians) numbers protecting it too. In all those pages, there isn\u0027t a key that matches any existing bitcoin key.A better guide on your chances of finding someone else’s private key can be found here.Generating the directory.io list “could be done with a 50 line script,” according to one expert. While they are genuine bitcoin private keys, they are all empty. This was quickly discovered once users attempted to import the keys to their own wallets.Essentially, every time you create a new bitcoin address you’re doing what directory.io did, on a much smaller scale.While bitcoin addresses, or ‘public keys’ allow users to send money to one another more smoothly than email, it’s your ‘private key\u0027 that determines how much bitcoin you have, and whether you have the right to spend it.Private keys are (hopefully) guarded securely by wallet software or printed on ‘paper wallets’, as anyone who discovers that key can access all the bitcoins stored at its corresponding address.Having your real private key published on the internet would indeed be catastrophic, especially if you’re holding a large amount of bitcoin there.Losing your private key (either by deleting it or throwing it somewhere you can’t retrieve it) means the bitcoins linked to that address are gone too – both to you and the world.It’s important to remember that, despite exchange heists, wallet shutdowns and individual hacking crises, the Bitcoin protocol has remained rock-solid since going live in 2009 and (as of December 2013) has never been successfully compromised.The bitcoin wiki says it all:Directory.io’s creator even managed to earn some bitcoin for the work, and posted:He added that his donation link was there \"for people that found it funny – some people did :)”.Security Image Via Shutterstock ","TAGS":"hacking, Blockchain Technology, Wallets, Bitcoin, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Dec 2, 2013 at 4:24 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2013/11/23/194993-btc-transaction-worth-147-million-sparks-mystery-and-speculation/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/6x6DSW6f_aZJ0kDs2mH6MQtQgIQ\u003d/570x377/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/BKDRLUM65ZDWVIY2FTBLYFPYUM.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"194,993 BTC transaction worth $147 Million sparks mystery and speculation","INTRO":"Bitcoin internet hangouts were buzzing today after noticing someone had shifted 194,993 BTC in one transaction.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"UPDATE 25th November, 12:16 GMT: We contacted Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrič to ask whether there was any truth in the rumour that the transaction was made by his company, but he declined to comment.Bitcoin internet hangouts were buzzing today after noticing someone had shifted 194,993 BTC (over $147m on CoinDesk\u0027s BPI) in one transaction.The transaction, tagged \"Shit Load of Money!\" by its mystery originator*, appeared on Blockchain.info early in the evening of 22nd November. It is one of the largest transactions in bitcoin\u0027s history, by far the largest under bitcoin\u0027s recent high prices, and represents 1.6% of all bitcoins now in circulation. (*Correction: as pointed out in the comments below, the tag was attached to the receiving address and not by the originator.)Bitcoin\u0027s distributed nature ensures all transactions are visible on the public record, though users are identified only by 30+ character addresses (and any tags they choose to add). If the address is not already known and the user does not identify themselves in an obvious way, they remain anonymous without analysis or detective work.Unsurprisingly, a transaction of that size has prompted the bitcoin community to do some analysis and detective work. The transaction involved a large number of sending addresses, with some of them from blocks mined in February 2010 or even earlier, prompting excited speculation they might be from Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin\u0027s absent (and likely pseudonymous) founder.Or was it Richard Branson, who caused his own digital currency frenzy today by announcing his company Virgin Galactic would accept payment in bitcoin?Satoshi Nakamoto is unlikely to reveal him/herself in such an ostentatious manner, and early coins may have changed hands several times. More possibly the lucky owner is a miner from bitcoin\u0027s early days, or a business moving the amount to a more secure form of physical storage. The Washington Post\u0027s detective work, done by a researcher into how much block chain information may reveal about users, speculated the transaction might be exchange Bitstamp moving its own funds between addresses.While 194,993 BTC was moved, it\u0027s important to note it has not been exchanged for any fiat currency... that we know of. \u0027Dumping\u0027 such a large amount at once would probably have a negative impact on bitcoin\u0027s value.On the bitcointalk forums, some users were less interested in the owners\u0027 identity and more impressed by the infrastructure that allowed such an amount to be transferred without any regulatory hindrance, lawyers, or fees (the user paid no transaction fee at all). Even handing over that amount in hard cash would be a logistical challenge.\"Beautiful, so effortless to move so much money...

Bitcoin’s lead developer Gavin Andresen made the announcement yesterday in his fifth Core Development Update.The latest update uses a new type of transaction to give people the chance to associate their own data with their bitcoin transactions, which is something that wasn’t explicitly allowed before. The team is doing this by enabling OP_RETURN, a transaction parameter that will let people embed a tiny 80 bytes of data into a blockchain transaction record directly.80 bytes may be tiny, but it is enough to create a hash. Hashing is a way of producing a unique output that can be proven to represent a much larger piece of data, and it is one of the basic techniques in the bitcoin protocol’s toolbox.Core developer Jeff Garzik says that this could be a good way to enable smart property in the bitcoin network. “The hash is a hash of an ownership token representing a car, or a house, or a stock or bond,” he says. “Using the blockchain, you may securely exchange these tokens for payment (bitcoins), or exchange them with another user, without involving a third party.” This sounds a lot like colored coins, doesn’t it?There is clearly a demand for embedding data in transactions, because as Gavin Andresen says in the Core Update document, people already use all kinds of bizarre hacks to tie data to their bitcoin transactions.For example, some may send money to a bitcoin address that isn’t complete or accurate, and which doesn’t actually exist, explains Mike Hearn, another of the core developers. By sending money to a malformed address, they force clients to register it in a part of a transaction known as an unspent output set (UTXO). The bitcoin network has to keep UTXO data immediately available to everyone, because it is an important item when checking that transactions are valid. It has no way of knowing when UTXO data is a malformed address, so it keeps it in fast, quickly-accessible storage.Hearn said:That’s a good thing, because the UTXO data set currently constitutes about 250MB, compared to the blockchain’s entire 10GB now, according to core developer Pieter Wuille. The UTXO set may only be a 40th of the blockchain’s size, but that’s still significant.“Access to the blockchain doesn\u0027t need to be particularly fast or indexed – it just needs to be available,” he says. “The challenge is the database of unspent transaction outputs. It must be accessible in a fast way for any fully validating node, forever. So the more data that can be offloaded from the unspent transaction records to the rest of the blockchain, the better.”Some (including Wuille) worry that people will use this new transaction type for storing messages or memos. This isn’t what it should be used for, but we have already seen people using bitcoin transactions where possible to send messages to others. Blockchain.info’s wallet has a special feature (non-standard to the bitcoin network) that allows people to attach messages to transactions being sent to blockchain.info bitcoin addresses. When the FBI nailed Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, it was used to taunt the FBI by sending tiny transactions with abusive messages.There’s a chance that users could start trying to use OP_RETURN type to send messages and other data that it wasn’t intended to be used for. But given that people are doing it anyway, it’s best to try and limit the effect of it, Garzik says, calling it a ‘lesser of two evils’ approach.The other big announcement was around smarter transaction fees. The network uses a set of heuristics that have evolved over the last four years to determine how much is charged (if the user opts to pay a transaction fee at all).This means that the network can start doing strange things. “The current fees are hard coded,” said Hearn. “When the value of BTC/USD went up by 20x, so did the transaction fee, for no real good reason.”Andresen calls it a ‘complicated mess’ and he has vowed to replace it with a better system. He is teaching the bitcoin wallet software how to estimate how low a fee a transaction needs, so that it can be accepted by miners when a transaction is sent. This will make it far more dynamic than the current method for charging fees.Brian Armstrong, the co-founder and CEO of web-based wallet and bitcoin payment system Coinbase, liked the idea. Transactions between Coinbase users are all conducted off-chain, and fees are only applicable when payment is made from a Coinbase wallet to an external wallet. Coinbase pays those fees, which costs it 50 BTC each month, he said, adding:Stephen Pair, co-founder and CTO of payment processor BitPay, said that the current design of the bitcoin network hasn’t allowed for efficient fee discovery. “An efficient market for the work of transaction processing and security will eliminate the guesswork in applying a transaction fee. It will allow the parties of a transaction to determine fees that are appropriate for the nature of the transaction,” he said.There were several other announcements in the Core Update, including a faster way to get the important information from a blockchain node when downloading the blockchain for the first time, and a way for bitcoin clients to function in no-wallet mode, making startup faster.When will it be released? “When it’s ready,” said Andresen. It’s the testing which takes a long time, and they don’t want to cripple the network with a critical bug. If you can code well in C++, and you’re good at testing, they want you as a volunteer.","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Bitcoin Foundation, Bitcoin Protocol, Jeff Garzik, Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin, News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Oct 25, 2013 at 4:30 a.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/28/feathercoin-secures-its-block-chain-with-advanced-checkpointing/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/U6hwVcyIS94_WZL4Iz_FK2TEizY\u003d/570x307/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/U2LXH3TFV5EWZD4P6M2BRVBQU4.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Feathercoin secures its block chain with advanced checkpointing","INTRO":"Feathercoin has announced advanced checkpointing in its block chain to protect against 51% attacks.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Feathercoin has announced advanced checkpointing in its block chain to protect against 51% attacks. The advanced checkpointing (ACP) feature will remove the need for changes to client software by publishing a feed of checkpoints, via a central node.Checkpointing is a lesser known part of cryptocurrencies. It\u0027s a way to maintain the integrity of the block chain by recording blocks out of it. In bitcoin, checkpoints are stored in the code of the client. This enables it to verify its checkpoints against the copy of the block chain it has downloaded, ensuring that block chain has not been retroactively rewritten in a 51% attack.This means that as the block chain grows, client software has to be updated to store new checkpoints within its code. This leaves clients that have not been updated for a long time vulnerable to attacks on the block chain.The Feathercoin team has sought to solve this problem by separating the checkpoint record from the client software. The team have created a \"master node\" and updated its client software to version 0.6.4.3, which will publish the series of checkpoints for Feathercoin clients to check against.While it would be difficult for a 51% attack to be carried out against a network as large as bitcoin\u0027s, Feathercoin has already suffered a 51% attack. The basic checkpoint system that was in place at the time fortunately helped prevent long term damage to the currency.\"I am trying to make a safe environment for miners and merchants. We had some large scale attacks when our hash power was much less than we see now. During that time, miners had a large number of blocks orphaned. Some lost days worth of mining,\" said Feathercoin founder, Peter Bushnell. \"This is unacceptable and considering the scale of these attacks I think it is absolutely important to make sure that the attackers are not able to take control of the network like this again.\"He wants ACP to be distributed as this would provide an effective solution that is closer to Satoshi\u0027s original idea that bitcoin has to remain decentralised. \"However, there are trade offs even in bitcoin – there are checkpoints in the bitcoin client which are defined by the developers. No one else can put checkpoints in bitcoin other than the devs.\"He went on to say:\"What we would have to do is find trusted nodes. It would make sense that this belongs to the miners. So all the major pools should be nodes as this is where the miners are. Currently the difficulty is too high to solo mine, the only person solo mining are the attackers. These are future plans but right now there is only one node checkpointing and I am the only person with access to the node.\"In answer to concerns that Bushnell himself could exploit the system, he pointed out that no one can roll back the chain with ACP.He said he was once asked what he would do if someone said they would chop his fingers off if he didn\u0027t roll back or join a chain of their choosing. \"That would be a very unfortunate misunderstanding and I would lose all my fingers!\" He said.","TAGS":"Feathercoin, Blockchain Technology, Technology, Altcoins, News, other-public-protocols, Technology News, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Aug 28, 2013 at 3:00 p.m. UTC"},{"LINK":"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2013/08/25/mastercoin-to-create-new-altcoins-in-bitcoins-block-chain/","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Coindesk","IMAGE":"https://www.coindesk.com/resizer/Pwb_OQwt0qlk8T8ywvAPI7i8q1s\u003d/570x285/filters:quality(80):format(jpg)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/HUVRKRMR6JHLTPGCIJQ4Y6COAI.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"MasterCoin to create new altcoins in Bitcoin\u0027s block chain","INTRO":"The Mastercoin protocol layer gains community support to create a new generation of altcurrencies on the Bitcoin block chain.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Bitcoin expert J. R. Willet is looking to transform not just Bitcoin, but the cryptocurrency world. In his view, Bitcoin is incomplete, and has led to the creation of altcoins which he says has diluted the message of Bitcoin. He wants to change the situation by creating a protocol layer that exists on top of Bitcoin.That protocol layer will allow for a plethora of new digital currencies to be created that will all exist on the Bitcoin block chain. It\u0027s called MasterCoin.The MasterCoin protocol can be described by analogy to the HTTP protocol, which the World Wide Web runs on, being a layer that exists on top of the TCP/IP protocol and that working atop the IPv4 protocol. It will enable new protocols, i.e. new currencies, to exist as part of Bitcoin, and not something different from it. In other words, currencies created on top of MasterCoin will use the Bitcoin block chain.In the specification that Willet published online, he describes altcurrencies as: \"Alternate block chains compete with bitcoins financially, confuse our message to the world, and dilute our efforts. These barriers interfere with the adoption momentum of bitcoin and the adoption momentum of alternate currencies as well, regardless of how well-conceived their rules may be.\"What Willet wants to do is similar to the idea of Colored Coins. MasterCoin will facilitate the creation of new currencies that can be assigned data streams from stock or commodity markets, thus making them represent the value of the selected item. For example, Willet intends to create USD Coin and GoldCoin, which will track the values of their corresponding commodities.Enforcement of the market value for whatever stock or commodity a \"higher protocol\" currency relates to will be achieved by the use of an escrow fund built into the currency\u0027s protocol. When the value of the \"commodity coin\" goes too high, the currency\u0027s escrow fund will start creating new commodity coins in exchange for MasterCoins. When the value is too low, it will trade MasterCoins in exchange for commodity coins, then destroy those coins. Through this control of supply and demand, a MasterCoin derived currency can sustain a balanced value. The efficacy of this will depend how intensively the currency\u0027s author sets the protocol to check and interact with the market.That\u0027s not all that MasterCoin will do, there is also support for \"savings addresses\". This is a MasterCoin feature that adds an extra layer of protection to those storing their wealth in digital currency. With savings addresses, MasterCoin has the ability to reverse transactions – whereas ordinary transactions from \"spending wallets\" are irreversible just as with the basic Bitcoin protocol. To complement the savings wallet, there is a \"Guardian\" wallet which is used for receiving reversed transactions – this is to be used when someone believes their savings wallet has been compromised.That\u0027s the theory. The practice is shaping up too – you can follow Willet\u0027s progress on the Bitcoin forum.Willet has created something called the \"Exodus Address\", which is a bitcoin wallet that will serve the same purpose to the MasterCoin protocol as the genesis block did to the Bitcoin block chain. Not only is the Exodus Address a marker on the Bitcoin block chain, but Willet is also using it as a way to fund his efforts. Those donating to the Exodus Address before the 31st August 2013 will be rewarded with a hundred times more MasterCoins than the bitcoins donated. There is also an early adopter bonus where the (fractional) number of weeks prior to the deadline determines the bonus amount of MasterCoins. At the time of writing the Exodus Address had received over 2,107 BTC (more than $220,000).As for what he\u0027ll be using that money for, he responded: \"I have had a few minor expenses, but most of that money will probably be used for bounties once I have the basic code-base set up. Also, I\u0027m not touching the money at that address until the fundraising is done [on] 1st September.\"Willet is also keen to highlight the risks that would-be investors face. He has published a partial list of risks and his specification paper even goes so far as to say: \"Investing in experimental currencies is really, absurdly risky.\"Willet\u0027s specification also speculates that MasterCoin will be even more attractive to criminals than bitcoin. When asked why, he replied: \"I think criminals (like the rest of us) will prefer to deal with stable currencies rather than unstable ones. Also, betting on data streams will likely be a breeding ground for insider trading. (Note: I\u0027m writing this protocol, but I\u0027ll be very careful not to use it for anything like that myself – I would prefer to stay out of jail!)\"It\u0027s an intriguing idea that raises a lot of possibilities. It\u0027s also fair to say that you need to have an in-depth understanding of the protocol to really appreciate it. Even then, some on the Bitcoin forum have questioned the validity of MasterCoin.Also, the user of higher level protocols requires miniscule transactions to (so-called) \u0027fake addresses\u0027 as a means of passing data through the block chain. This in turn will lead to even more clutter and overhead on the size of bitcoin\u0027s public ledger.Willet admits this is a problem, \"Yes, this will cause some additional headaches for bitcoin scalability. If wildly successful, this sort of protocol layer will make the impact of Satoshi Dice seem pretty tame in comparison. However, this is a problem we need to face sooner or later anyway.\"Furthermore, while Willet argues that altcoins are diluting bitcoin\u0027s message to the world, those currencies are here. For MasterCoin to succeed in bringing focus back to the bitcoin movement, it would have to cause altcoins to fall out of use in favour of MasterCoin derived currencies.How likely do you think this is? Have you invested in MasterCoin? Would you want to trade in commodity driven cryptocurrencies?","TAGS":"Blockchain Technology, Mastercoin, Technology, Altcoins, News, Distributed Ledger Technology, other-public-protocols, Technology News, Cryptocurrency 2.0, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"","CATEGORY":"Markets","CREATION_DATE":"Aug 25, 2013 at 9:45 a.m. UTC"}]
