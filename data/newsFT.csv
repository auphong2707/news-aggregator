The model has hardly changed for decades. Banks fund themselves partly with deposits and then lend at higher rates, trying to capture transaction fees from areas such as payments. But as some central banks trial their own digital currencies, important changes to the industry approach. Initially, sleepy banks allowed fintechs to snatch large chunks of the payments chain from banks. Core banking franchises could suffer the same fate unless banks can get ahead in new areas such as distributed ledger technology, also known as blockchain. For all their bad press, cryptocurrencies have at least demonstrated the efficacy of blockchain technologies to corral large amounts of data cheaply. Industrialisation of banking services such as consumer finance, mortgages and savings is a logical next step. Banks must lead this process or risk further erosion of earnings from core activities. As much as two-thirds of European bank industry’s net interest income could be at stake, thinks Andrea Filtri of Mediobanca. His conclusions follow an analysis of standardised products prone to disruption at 12 of the largest banks by revenues. To adjust to the disruption, bank cost-to-income ratios would need to fall from around half today to below 30 per cent. Using blockchain to cut expenses could help. Though the technology gets much hype, practical applications are few. One is Spunta, which connects Italian banks for accounts reconciliation. Applying its system to a hypothetical single blockchain for all standardised banking services reduces costs by a staggering 99 per cent. That is a simplified example. But the implications are clear. Should central banks adopt digital currencies, the use of blockchain could become widespread. Adapting to this disruptive technology will be profitable for banks that remain. That potential for greater efficiency should be a temptation for banks everywhere. Lex recommends the FT’s Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

The biggest blunder came from the Australian Stock Exchange, which in November abandoned a plan announced seven years ago to upgrade clearing and settlement of shares to a blockchain-based platform. The exchange booked a A$250mn ($168mn) charge and apologised after admitting it needed to start the project again from scratch. Other initiatives in insurance, banking and shipping have also collapsed, suggesting that shared digital ledgers may fall flat in the quest to reform cumbersome operations. Even proponents of the technology warn that adopters should be prepared for multiple failures. “We are forever coming up with new ideas and killing them if they’re not appropriate,” said David Newns, head of Six Digital Exchange, which issued the first digital bond on a distributed ledger in November. “We’re in the invention space, so we have to think of new things with the expectation that a lot of those ideas will fail.” In July B3i, a consortium of 15 insurance and reinsurance companies, ceased activities and filed for insolvency. The project had aimed to reduce inefficiency in premium and claims settlement, and place contracts on blockchains. We.trade, another blockchain consortium of 12 banks focusing on trade finance also entered insolvency in June. The project had included Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Santander, Société Générale and UBS. Most recently, Maersk and IBM announced in late November they were discontinuing TradeLens, a supply-chain blockchain solution for the shipping industry, saying it had not “reached the level of commercial viability necessary to continue work and meet the financial expectations”. The failures have come alongside the crisis that has engulfed many of the crypto companies that tried to build their businesses trading and lending digital tokens such as bitcoin. That culminated in the collapse in November of FTX, the cryptocurrency exchange — a failure that has undermined the case for buying tokens in the hope of making a profit. Still, some banks remain committed to blockchain technology. “There’s lots of negative sentiment about cryptocurrencies, most recently because of FTX,” said Mathew McDermott, global head of digital assets at Goldman Sachs. “That has nothing to do with the underlying technology.” Goldman, rivals such as JPMorgan and other financial institutions are still open to blockchain technology, citing its potential for efficiency gains and cost savings. JPMorgan has promoted its Onyx digital asset platform, which links other banks and financial institutions such as Visa, and handles payments linked to about $1bn of assets a day in currencies and bonds. But even some of those groups that have gone furthest with blockchain are cautious about its ultimate potential. In November, the European Investment Bank issued its second digital bond using the technology — a €100mn two-year deal arranged by Goldman Sachs, Santander and Société Générale. Using the technology can potentially help streamline issues around documentation and payments but Xavier Leroy, senior funding officer at the EIB’s non-core currencies and special transactions division said the advantages were so far limited. “Given that we are in the initial stages, at the moment there aren’t many [benefits] — it’s mostly about potential for the future,” he said. Some blockchain-related projects are also highly reliant on existing systems rather than replacing them, particularly so-called distributed ledgers that allow a select group of actors such as banks to share information on an immutable record. This activity is related to blockchains and crypto assets but does not involve creating and verifying transactions in return for token rewards — a crucial difference from the blockchain on which bitcoin and other tokens are based. HSBC, for instance, describes the FX Everywhere system that it uses to settle currency with Wells Fargo — which has handled more than $200bn of five currencies — as “blockchain-based”. Even so, its distributed ledger technology (DLT) relies on Traiana, a well-established market infrastructure, to act as the first step in the system. “There is a definition element. Even though we say DLT, people hear blockchain, blockchain, blockchain,” said Mark Williamson, global head of FX partnerships and propositions at HSBC. FX Everywhere uses consensus algorithms, cryptographic signing and other crypto-related processes. But it “doesn’t require a blockchain”, Williamson said. It also represents a tiny proportion of the overall business that HSBC and Wells Fargo handle in their currency trading operations. A group of technology experts in June told US lawmakers that such “append-only” digital databases were not new. “They have been known and used since 1980 for rather limited functions,” they said. Recommended Responsibilities to shareholders and regulation can also inhibit banks from using the types of blockchains that underpin tokens such as bitcoin. These blockchains generally require maintenance by networks of computers that use vast amounts of power, in a controversial process called “proof of work”, but shareholders and regulators are pushing companies to invest in projects that are more environmentally friendly. Banks are equally conscious they would have to navigate the different ways jurisdictions recognise tokenised investment products. In December, another Swiss stock exchange, BX Swiss, said it had completed a test trade of tokenised assets on a distributed public blockchain. However, it admitted it would require a separate market licence from the Swiss regulator to proceed. “The challenge is when a set of institutions come together and individual shareholders need to be committed to the journey,” said Keith Bear, a fellow at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. “If priorities change and they don’t hit targets, projects fail.” Letter in response to this article: Here’s another diagnosis of recent blockchain mishaps / From Alisa DiCaprio, Chief Economist, R3; Former Chair, Fintech Committee at the US Department of Commerce, New York, NY, US,,Martha Muir,2022-12-30T05:00:07.019Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/76234c49-cb11-4c2a-9a80-49da4f0ad7dd,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,The great crypto crisis is upon us,Any regulation needs to look at what tangible economic benefits the industry actually offers,The writer is economic adviser and head of research at the Bank for International Settlements There is a bitter irony in the turmoil currently gripping the crypto universe. Crypto was born in the depths of the great financial crisis of 2008 as a backlash against the failings of the conventional financial system, with its overleveraged shadow banks and daisy chain of leverage and maturity mismatch. The original Bitcoin white paper published that same year sold a vision in which money was refashioned as a self-sustaining system of peer-to-peer transfer without the need for intermediaries. However, today’s upheaval bears all the hallmarks of precisely the failings that the industry’s early proponents railed against. As firms collapse and coin prices crash, the unravelling of this new daisy chain of over-leveraged shadow crypto banks is now in full flow. While we survey the wreckage and plot a course for the policy response to rein in the sector, we need to keep in mind some key facts. Crypto operates under the banner of decentralisation, but it is highly centralised in two crucial respects. First, many supposedly decentralised protocols turn out to be highly concentrated in terms of who actually governs and controls things. Often, it is the founder and a small number of venture capital backers that are in charge — as evidenced by the implosion of the Terra stablecoin in May. In most instances, crypto is decentralised in name only. Second, centralised intermediaries, such as Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX, play a pivotal role as the gateway into the crypto world from the conventional financial system. They channel the flow of new investors, which is the oxygen that keeps these speculative dynamics alive. BIS research in this area has highlighted how crypto only really works when this is happening. To the extent that recruiting new investors is key to the survival of crypto, centralised intermediaries are crucial to propping up the edifice. The current collapse of FTX, and other falling dominoes in the sector, has led to much soul-searching among crypto promoters. Predictably, we are hearing calls for the industry “to go back to its roots” and be reborn in a purer form. The vision is to turn back the clock to the days when crypto was the preserve of a small group of enthusiasts rather than something marketed as a mainstream financial product. In this vision, it would be more like a niche hobby among a small minority of followers, rather than entering our living rooms through television advertising in an effort to draw in retail investors. This pure form of crypto, which imagines getting rid of centralised intermediaries, would have only a very small footprint. But crypto would not have grown to its current size without these entities channelling funds into the sector. Rather than standing in opposition, centralised intermediaries and crypto feed off each other. For this reason, any policy intervention now taken to mitigate crypto’s impact will need to take account of this mutual dependence, as well as the role that stablecoins play as the gateway from the conventional financial system. Some say “just let crypto burn”, but the idea that it will disappear of its own accord may be wishful thinking. When financial conditions change, even a much diminished sector that is the preserve of purists could still provide the embers for the renewed entry of centralised intermediaries. Any intervention would need to overcome one key challenge: if policy allows crypto to intertwine itself with the mainstream financial system, it will usher in something that has been avoided so far. In particular, if stablecoins are brought into the regulatory perimeter, their role as the entry point to the rest of the crypto ecosystem will need to be addressed. Policy should guard against letting them become the “cuckoo in the nest”. The new standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision on banking sector activities in crypto are a significant step in the right direction. More generally, the approach to regulation will need to distinguish the underlying economic function of crypto from what it looks like on the surface. Even during the worst excesses of the subprime mortgage boom, the daisy chain of leverage ultimately led to real world activity — most obviously buying a house with money. Crypto, on the other hand, is largely self-referential; its activities deal with trading other types of crypto and have little reference to tangible economic activity. Ultimately, any public policy response needs to start with a realistic assessment of the economic value that flows from blockchain technology. Blockchain’s returns have been remarkably meagre considering the early hype. One after the other, projects that have explored its potential benefits have come up empty-handed. A more promising approach is through central bank digital currencies that operate within the broader digital monetary system. This is an approach that builds on the trust embedded in central bank money, and could serve public interest in a future monetary system. The technology benefits flow to real world economic activities rather than just other types of crypto. The economic benefits of decentralisation should also be scrutinised more effectively. We are now seeing what happens when an industry rests simply on an article of faith.

What the distributed ledger technology needed, Singapore decided, was the rhetorical skills of former UK prime minister Boris Johnson to burnish its battered image, and here he was at a glittering gathering of the blockchain industry in a five-star hotel last week. Blockchain in particular and innovation in general, Johnson explained, is always scary at first. “Humanity has been paranoid about this since the Titan Prometheus gave us the first flame,” he said, mixing classical reference and technological detail. Johnson was giving the keynote speech for the International Symposium on Blockchain Advancements to 80 or so crypto enthusiasts who had braved Singapore’s tropical thundery showers to hear his insights. It felt a fitting location for the event in the same week that Singapore’s state-owned fund Temasek was facing scrutiny for ploughing $275mn into the collapsed crypto exchange FTX after eight-months of due diligence failed to flag up any big concerns. It is clear there was never enough paranoia or fear, one nonplussed conference-goer said after an hour of Johnson’s musings on Brexit, Australian submarines and his time at the Telegraph. Beyond the free canapés and macarons, the event was hard to read as anything other than a plea from the blockchain industry to be taken seriously. Every sector is entitled to seek the endorsement of disgraced former leaders at times, but Johnson’s paeans of praise for Singapore Slings and his room at the famously expensive Raffles Hotel, delivered alongside his lauding of the potential of blockchain to a half-filled ballroom of men in suits, unsurprisingly was not the panacea for its woes. One delegate, who gave his name as Kai and said he worked at a local crypto custodian start-up, was excited that someone “so famous” was speaking. What about Johnson’s position on digital currencies and the potential of blockchain? “Oh I don’t know about that,” Kai said with a nervous laugh. A rare female attendee admitted that she was actually a journalist mainly trying to find out how much Johnson was being paid to headline the conference. Against this backdrop, Britain’s former prime minister jovially assured the room of “blockchain pioneers” that they were in the right place, going on to remind his audience that technology is “morally neutral”. He dwelt at length on how doctors erroneously claimed in the early days of the railways that the rattling and jolting of trains was likely to cause sexual excitement, why the City of London is “the most productive place on Earth”, and something unclear about nuclear-powered vacuum cleaners. But it was not obvious how these digressions would bolster his case for blockchain. He did eventually circle back to the technology and cryptocurrencies. He said he has “seen some pretty shocking headlines about this whole venture and we need some way of holding people to account”. But no sooner had he raised the subject of recent events in the cryptosphere than he moved swiftly on to topics closer to his heart: Brexit, the Ukraine war and green technology. Then came his finale. “I will make a strong argument that the UK will become even more attractive as a place to invest once we deliver on all that Brexit stuff.” On blockchain, he added, he could not comment further without more details. The blockchain enthusiasts seemed less than enthused. Someone showed enough interest to snap a photo only to be admonished by a man who rushed over hissing there was to be no photography. The interviewer tried valiantly to bring Johnson back to blockchain. What was his overall message for innovators in the industry? “Apart from Singapore, which is a fantastic place for innovation, come to London. Come to the UK . . . It’s a fantastic country . . . it rains more in Rome by the way,” he replied. “I look forward to watching the progress of the blockchain industry with fascination,” he added to bemused applause. mercedes.ruehl@ft.com,,Mercedes Ruehl,2022-12-06T12:00:31.807Z,

Blockchain technology and its resulting cryptoassets were built upon the promise of a revolution in finance but, amid the latest market disruption, it’s time for a reset and review of the opportunity. Cryptocurrencies have dominated the headlines, but they are a small part of the world of digital assets. To fully realise the untapped potential of the emerging digital asset ecosystem, it is incumbent on leaders of the public and private sectors to work together to accelerate a smart regulatory framework that unites the traditional and digital asset systems, rooted in two fundamental principles. The first is a recognition that regulation should enable the financial industry to prudently embrace innovation. Over the past two centuries, the world has seen many generations of financial technologies. Digital ledger representations of traditional assets such as cash, bonds and equities could be an important progression, as the original computer ledgers and real-time payments were from paper before them. This can lead to improvements in accuracy of record-keeping, easier handling of certain asset types such as real estate and loans and speedier, more efficient settlement. The distributed ledger technology underlying cryptoassets can be used to underpin new market infrastructure that offers benefit to the financial system. The central bank digital currencies and tokenised bonds being explored by major jurisdictions are just a few examples of the efforts to harness the benefits of this new technology. Just last month, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Monetary Authority of Singapore announced a joint effort to investigate how wholesale central bank digital currencies can improve the efficiency of cross-border wholesale payments involving multiple currencies. Exploration and innovation around digital ledger technology should thus be encouraged, not punished, in future regulatory frameworks. The second principle is to maintain the basic tenets of client protection, orderly markets and clear regulatory guidelines — regardless of the new technology, asset class or type of entity servicing it. Our established frameworks for market health and safety in the US were borne out of a series of depressions. While the progression of banking and securities regulation has not always been linear, it has remained rooted in these tenets. Digital assets operating outside those principles risk undermining the broader financial system. The fallout from co-mingled client assets, poor disclosure and missing internal controls should remind us that while the cast of characters and products may change, the script of financial market disorder remains painfully familiar. Although technology has evolved, certain established concepts should apply to all market participants and assets regardless of their technological wrapper. These include good governance, client asset segregation, clear record-keeping, security and technology standards, capital and liquidity requirements, limits on extreme leverage, anti-money laundering protections, strong risk management and regulatory guardrails. Today, banking institutions already operate within a perimeter of regulation. While conferring both privileges and obligations, this perimeter breathes what is arguably the most important currency into the global financial system: trust. Investor and public-sector confidence derive from the knowledge that the game has rules. Without trust in our financial system, we will have nothing useful. Worse still, without the resulting confidence in the system, we may suppress the opportunity to embrace an exciting technology that could help move the industry forward. With a majority of institutional investors interested in tokenisation, distributed ledger technology may represent the next financial frontier. Certain elements of the digital asset space have conflated disruptive innovation with generally disruptive behaviour, but they should not be allowed to spoil the opportunity for everyone else. A comprehensive regulatory framework is needed, but much of the underpinning already exists and can be extended from the regulation of traditional assets. There is a path to be found. We should embrace digital asset innovation, and align it to established rules and measured regulatory principles in order to protect customers and promote resiliency. In so doing, we also protect the most precious asset of all — confidence in our financial system.,,Robin Vince,2022-12-02T05:00:54.036Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/6d049669-1fac-40d8-bd24-955de5d29730,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Blockchain may have a green future regardless of crypto,Scandals like FTX should not detract from the experiments going on with the technology elsewhere,This month might not seem the perfect moment for an institution such as Goldman Sachs to be championing the benefits of “blockchain” or “tokenisation”. After all, these buzz words first shot to fame in the cryptocurrency sector, which has lost two-thirds of its value during the past year. And the recent implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire is likely to leave many traditional financiers shying away from digital assets — if not deriding them as a fraud. Yet when green activists, politicians and scientists assembled at COP27 this month, Rosie Hampson, an executive director at Goldman Sachs, was happily talking of both. In recent months the Wall Street bank has joined forces with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Bank for International Settlements and other financial institutions, to launch a capital markets initiative known as “Genesis” (a name it unfortunately shares with the struggling crypto broker). This Genesis aims to use blockchain and digital tokenisation to help investors who purchase climate-related bonds track the associated carbon credits in real time. “[With] Genesis we are thinking about how you can use blockchain, smart contract technology and IoT devices to support green bond contracts,” Hampson told a COP side event. She noted that this could change the process from “book building all the way through to primary issuance, asset servicing and . . . the secondary market component.” Or as Bénédicte Nolens, of the BIS, echoed in a recent podcast: “It is actually hard to sell a green bond [today]. But if you can attach the future carbon offset [with tokenisation] then it becomes a lot more attractive to the end investor.” This did not cause a splash at COP. No surprise, perhaps. Many green activists hate the whole concept of blockchain technologies, since early iterations of this guzzled energy. And the type of young(ish) anti-establishment evangelists who have rushed into cryptocurrencies in recent years generally dislike the idea of central bank involvement. But investors should take note. For while Genesis is still just a pilot, it is symbolic of a far bigger point: although the crypto collapse has left investors reeling, it has not stopped experiments with blockchain and tokenisation. Moreover, these are now reaching into some unexpected places, with growing government support. The World Bank is currently developing a utility for carbon credit registries that uses a blockchain system called Chia. And in mainstream central banking, tests are under way for wholesale (ie bank-to-bank) central bank digital currencies. The HKMA, for example, is currently working with the People’s Bank of China and other central banks on a so-called mBridge project to enable them to swap assets instantaneously. In Europe, the Banque de France and the Swiss National Bank have unveiled Project Jura, a foreign exchange CBDC pilot. And while these initiatives are still just pilots, they represent “a completely new architecture”, as Ousmène Mandeng, an Accenture consultant, recently told a meeting of the Euro 50 group in Washington. Or as Adrian Tobias of the IMF echoed: “The key things we have got from crypto are the ideas of tokenisation, cryptography and distributed ledgers. They are very important technologies and there is a lot of experimentation going on.” Unsurprisingly, the players driving these experiments are keen to distance themselves from scandals like the FTX implosion, by stressing that they are operating with extensive establishment oversight. They also emphasise that they are trying to deploy these technologies to solve real-world problems — rather than simply using them for their own sake. The Genesis initiative, for example, is trying to solve the problem that the carbon credits market today is so fragmented and opaque it is hard for investors to track potential greenwashing. Thus while Chinese issuers have sold $300bn of green bonds, transparency around this is very low. However, by using a co-ordinated distributed computerised ledger (ie blockchain), the BIS and Goldman Sachs say it would be possible to eliminate double counting and verify the carbon credits at source. Similarly digital tokenisation should make it possible to simplify bond distribution and pull retail investors into the market for the first time, by breaking bonds into tiny fractions. Or so the argument goes. Could this be done without digital assets technologies? Perhaps. Banks could theoretically sell fractions of green bonds using existing processes. They might also be able to create a single computerised global ledger for carbon credits if they collaborated with each other and the public sector. But the hard truth is that these sensible initiatives are not in place right now, while the mere advent of cryptocurrency is sparking a rethink of existing practices among legacy players as well as digital evangelists. And this may end up producing benefits, even if blockchain itself is never adopted at scale. This will not make mainstream investors any less suspicious of crypto. But it does illustrate a bigger theme: when disruptive technologies have emerged in the past, be they the railway or the internet, it is not always the first-order consequences that matter. It is still to early to judge whether or not digital assets can change the world — or make it green. gillian.tett@ft.com,,Gillian Tett,2022-11-24T17:26:12.864Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/bea83002-3c38-4012-9311-e8644e4ff863,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,FTX: The Wallet Inspection,(Picture unrelated),The FTX collapse is funny for all kinds of reasons. Here’s one from a Delaware court filing on Tuesday where the administrators ask for judicial forgiveness for “certain authorised actions”. (Our emphasis, H/T Kadhim): 3. In light of the risk of cyber-attacks and other malicious activity, the Indemnification and Exculpation Motion seeks authorization on an emergency basis to provide indemnification and exculpation of certain individuals for certain authorized actions described in the Indemnification and Exculpation Motion. 4. The Indemnification and Exculpation Motion details certain actions that the Debtors and certain individuals have taken and continue to take in connection with valuable assets that represent a significant share of the Debtors’ estates as well as descriptions of the locations of these assets. 5. The Debtors seek to file the Indemnification and Exculpation Motion under seal to protect confidential commercial information, the public disclosure of which may put certain of the Debtors’ assets at further risk of cyber-attacks or other malicious activity. Reading between the extremely wide-spaced, crayon-drawn lines here, it sounds like the company in the chaos of FTX’s collapse authorised some stuff that we assume was important but not entirely best practice, and it doesn’t want to say what it did or who did it? Listen, we’ve all been there — the Caribbean crypto empire is collapsing, your boss’s pro-gaming career isn’t taking off, you’re all being cyber-bullied by this guy. And to top it all off, you’re being abnormally transacted with. What’s an FTX-er to do? Well, probably whatever you can to get things to calm down. In the case of that grab bag of magic beans shitcoins crypto “assets” (for want of a better term) you’ve assembled, that might involve moving them away from somewhere vulnerable to hacking. In doing so, you might make some unconventional decisions! Occasional Alphaville contributor Dan Davies has a theory on where this might leave you: Or actually they've shifted it to a cold wallet, and there's someone in the Bahamas who is nervous about the fact they have no insurance for the $5bn flash drive in their hotel safe We’re sure this will produce hilarity when details eventually emerge (things are unfolding, etc), and we want to stress that a lot is unknown at the moment. But this did provide us with a neat excuse to do some wallet inspecting. (Buried lede begins.) Earlier this month, we revealed FTX’s shoddy balance sheet. This showed that it was roughly $8bn short of its liabilities and its assets were mostly chaff. We also shared their extremely confident “term sheet”. (Side note: FTX management tracks down $1.24bn in cash holdings) But there’s more! Moderately less excitingly, other documents extracted from FTX’s data room included a list of all the hot (ie internet-connected) wallets held by FTX US. The data were held in an Excel file, which according to its metadata was initially created by Gary Wang, FTX’s chief technical officer and co-founder. The file version we have was last modified on November 10th at 13:39:36. Here is the first sheet (as obtained, with the exception that FTAV has sorted the values by size, and added asset/liability totals at the bottom): These aren’t overly exciting on a surface level. As you might expect, FTX US’s hot wallet tokens assets matched its customer liabilities. Meanwhile, it was about $13mn short of its liabilities across a range of currencies (which feels small, relatively speaking). (It’s worth a quick reminder about what FTX offered, which was at least partially a wrapper service to allow normies to do crypto trading through derivatives without really getting their hands dirty.) More interestingly, the document also includes a list of all of FTX US’s hot wallet addresses at the time it was created. These addresses are perhaps best thought of as being like individual current accounts, with each one sending or receiving crypto within the bounds of its blockchain protocol. Here are the top few rows: All in all, there are 76 unique (in terms of either wallet name or coin held) entries in this sheet, and a further 47 across further sheets (there are some entries that appear to be duplicates). Here, for example, are FTX US’s various hot wallets containing bitcoin: Working through desperate, blind groping systemically, FTAV naturally went straight to the top, following the money from FTX US’s biggest BTC address — row 12 above. This address is catchily hashed as 36mSujwwRR4LM5m2MtsjimuKzJRb1FehW4. At the time it was added to the sheet, it contained 977.8218867 bitcoin, worth about $15.9mn at the time. We’re gonna call it a completely random name as it is basically unimportant. 🥁 Hello, Suman! Let’s learn about you. Suman’s address hash is all we need. Thanks to the magic of the blockchain, transparency is easy! Per Blockchain.com, Suman has handled two transactions in its life: — At 11:48 on November 10th, it received 978.02192791 BTC from address 3Fb79abn2MKhyYdSHXhFmDFdwDDti6fhP9, which we’ll call Naseem. — At 12:16 the same day, it sent 977.82188672 BTC to 12 addresses, incurring a small fee. — The biggest share by far (976.99792909 BTC) went to bc1qj2lwyjey8vl85stky7fhfvs572nv8akclkudxn, which we’ll call Zheng. So, big chunk of money goes from Naseem to Suman, sits with Suman for less than half an hour, then mainly goes off to Zheng. All we’ve learned at this point is that the address listed in Wang’s wallet document was incorrect — Suman had in fact been emptied about an hour before the version we obtained was made. FTAV initially tried to work Naseemwards, aka backwards through time. Going back through dozens of addresses, it was a similar story: a large block of BTC landed, remained in the address for a very short period, and then moved on. Naseem held the BTC for about an hour . .. . . . the account before him had it for about the same . .. . . . and so on. Sometimes, the movement included several small payments, but often it was only split two ways: the big chunk, and what appears to have been a small fee. Frequently, this fee was of 0.2 BTC, and went to address 1BejpJzSYnydbvbpar1qwrjjMLuQY1c5DF. We’ll call this address Jo. Jo frequently participates in big block transactions to bc1qm34lsc65zpw79lxes69zkqmk6ee3ewf0j77s3h, which is a big (like, $1.5bn of BTC) hot wallet that may be controlled by Binance. So, it looks like FTX US was moving its money frequently, though not with any immediately discernible pattern and sometimes seemingly with little clear purpose, and in the process possibly leaking money to Binance through handling fees. It’s not clear how far we’d have to go back to find the end of this pattern (if you know a good way to do so, please let us know!) Still, this is weird, right? Giving up, and cursing ourselves for having never learned to code, we headed Zhengwards (ie forward in time). Again, similar quick movements, with dozens in a row. In a couple of instances, bigger blocks came off and went to 17QyR2ixNj1AgpD5ZuXubvSJ3gPPQVcsvp, aka Ayolede. Ayolede appears to be some kind of intermediary address — more than $3bn of BTC has flown through her, though she was empty at time of pixel. She has previously been featured by Whale Alert, a site which tracks big crypto transfers. But the biggest part of the Suman block kept going, moving through dozens and dozens of transactions. Until, suddenly, it stopped. At 22:03 on November 11, address 38ijhiFYiBWKo2p48K78Gmpx5nspUQnqAw (Merlyn) transferred 736.20098821 BTC of the 736.21102453 BTC it had received ten minutes earlier to bc1q8umytnw6dh6f909c9r53ae4n08uqmtyw88v0ge (Jessy). Jessy then chilled for about six hours, before sending all they had to 325gSHHe7UGvzEc9kGx43VqPboXUVwa26i, which behindthename.com has called Wisdom, at 4:38am on November 12 — about fourteen hours after FTX Group (including FTX US) declared bankruptcy. Let’s end with some Wisdom. Wisdom contains, at time of pixel, 3871.694 BTC, which was worth, at time of pixel, about $62.6mn. We can assume that FTX wants Wisdom to have this money. After all, FTX claimed to control Suman, a link in the link in the chain that led to Wisdom. Wisdom has already gathered a bit of attention online (this roughly feels like in Monty Python and the Holy Grail when they finally discover the grail castle only to find the French are already there). ZachXBT (an “on-chain sleuth” who is likely much better at this than us) reckons this address is controlled by “white hat” (aka non-evil) hackers. Whitehat 0xd8019a114e86ad41d71a3eeb6620b19dd166a969 0x97f991971a37D4Ca58064e6a98FC563F03A71E5c 6b4aypBhH337qSzzkbeoHWzTLt4DjG2aG8GkrrTQJfQA TYoZM8LALfUqm4EXzB7oKmwqusWtXTBhY6 325gSHHe7UGvzEc9kGx43VqPboXUVwa26i >funds withdrawn later on >funded via CEX >funds sent to multisig Much to consider. So what did we learn? — blockchains are hard — the money is resting We can hypothesise that, with unlimited time and resources OR simply learning to code, following other Sumans might lead us to further Wisdoms. But exactly what Wisdom is, and how many other addresses like that exist, could be one of the many revelations of the coming weeks. Could Wisdom be, as floated thousands of words ago, on a cold-storage USB drive being held by some mid-ranking FTX staffer who has been locked in their Bahamas flat eating nothing but takeaway for two weeks? Only time, and lawyers, may tell. For those people who deposited with FTX US, they’ll be hoping Wisdom is on their side.,,Louis Ashworth,2022-11-24T11:02:53.052Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/3db177f2-d187-4632-b94d-268f9d2598eb,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,How technology can help redraw the supply chain map,Certain innovations show promise in dealing with current supply chain challenges, but companies must know which problems they want to solve first,Supply chains face a rethink. Geopolitical fissures have disabled the just-in-time model, unwinding decades of globalisation. The danger of overreliance on one large manufacturing base, China, has been exposed by the pandemic. Early on in the Covid outbreak, Fortune observed that 94 per cent of Fortune 1000 companies had experienced supply chain disruption. Added to this, many companies in the UK have been hamstrung by Brexit. Multinationals had the resources to prepare for Britain’s departure from the EU and, in critical sectors such as pharmaceuticals, many received government help to increase inventories and set up alternative sourcing. Small and medium businesses without financial clout, however, have been severely affected. Other countries did not have the UK’s additional impediment but they still experienced shipment delays. The August 2022 Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, collated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, showed that while delivery times had reduced in the previous four months, pressure was still high. This left the chain vulnerable to disruption or even to fluctuations in seasonal demand. Against these stresses, consumers continue to expect greater choice delivered quickly, cheaply and, increasingly, more sustainably. Even as disruptions continued, global trade for 2021 reached a record high in value, according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development. Suppliers should aim to meet the challenges that accompany this demand. To do so effectively, factors such as resilience, reliability and flexibility of the supply chain should be treated as more important than cost and efficiency. Visibility can help to solve problems. An accurate overview of the chain will mean that disruptions can be identified and dealt with. This will give a degree of resilience, says ManMohan Sodhi, professor of operations and supply chain management at Bayes Business School London. At the consumer end of the chain, traceability can fulfil shoppers’ demands for sustainability. Most companies recognise the need for better visibility but only a few can achieve it. In 2020, SupplyChainBrain, the supply chain management information resource, said most enterprises could view just 20 per cent of their chains — it recommends 70 to 90 per cent visibility. SupplyChainBrain says digitisation is “no longer optional” if we are to avoid severe business consequences. You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser. For the best results, supply chains should be digitally integrated from the most upstream commodity and component supplier to the final customer. Manual inputs would be turned into digital data that is consolidated, legible and visible throughout the system. The costs of not embracing digitisation are considerable, according to a study in 2021. It said the average annual cost to an organisation of manually entering data averaged $1mn in the organisations it polled, while more than $600,000 was spent in manual entry of supplier invoices. The importance of a digital supply chain strategy is well understood but, due to the complexity, most companies struggle with implementation. Transmetrics, an AI logistics software provider, says the logistics sector is notorious for its heavy use of manual processes and large volume of disparate data that can be costly to centralise. The result is that holistic digital integration is extremely challenging. Supply chains are also disrupted by technology silos between and within companies, as well as the lack of standardisation in data — a barrier that organisations including GS1, the champion of the barcode, are working to dismantle. Many companies are eager to deploy technology-enabled solutions. A survey conducted in 2022 by SAP, the software solution provider, found that within the next year or two, 70 per cent of UK businesses plan to adopt the latest technology to try to overcome supply chain challenges. 💾 View and download the entire report Older technology is already adding value. Some solutions that have evolved over decades, such as robotics and supply chain optimisation, have lowered costs and improved efficiency. Systems based on legacy software have emerged to improve supply chain visibility. Wincanton, the supply chain solution provider, has developed an application that applies new modules to existing technology. Its system can track goods from order placement to arrival at a consolidation centre. This “control tower” capability is still being developed and some manual elements remain. How a company approaches digital transformation is critical to success. Change should be viewed as an opportunity rather than a threat — and businesses must be prepared to fail as they learn. Michael Feindt, an adviser at Blue Yonder, the specialist in intelligent supply chains, says that while a move towards greater use of technology can be hampered by fear, this is less prevalent in South America and Africa — perhaps because there is more to gain in less developed markets. A supply chain upgrade should be a stepped process rather than a simultaneous, wholescale overhaul. Adoption of new technologies, such as blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT), should be incremental, not least because these are still poorly understood and sometimes seen as a panacea, which they are not. Early adopters will undoubtedly experience disappointment. Most importantly, as Sodhi’s research emphasises, companies must first identify the problems they face and then, second, clarify their strategic goals. Technology will certainly help companies to become more adaptable and flexible, reduce costs and errors, optimise asset usage and speed up processes and communication. It will free workers from repetitive tasks to roles that require judgment and experience. Yet only when the right solutions are applied to defined problems can supply-chain technologies achieve any of the many aims. “Whatever the prioritised list of needs or expected benefits you seek and whatever your organisational constraints . . . you bring that to the vendor and ask them which they can or cannot do”, Sodhi says. He emphasises that the onus is on suppliers to identify solutions and, if necessary, to undertake their own pilot schemes to test nascent technology. Having the right organisational structure can improve outcomes and prevent a failure of experimental technology from going on to affect the entire business. Paul Durkin, chief customer and innovation officer at Wincanton, says his company has improved by splitting its technology function in two. One part addresses the challenges that face the existing business while the second identifies opportunities and products based on emerging technologies. He says “this creates bandwidth” for product development without neglecting current projects, thus creating more solutions for customers’ problems. The two parts come under one division and they unite to implement viable solutions. “There is no technology we have taken that hasn’t met expectations, but there are technologies that we have to be ready to consume as an organisation,” Durkin says. He adds that people are key. “In some cases [we may be] ready from a technology point of view; in [other] cases that might be from a people point of view. It’s the combination of people and technology that make it work.” Even once a technology solution has been identified as the right one, it is important to understand its capabilities. Feindt says: “Data-driven AI can help [in the] short term but for long term planning it gets more difficult. That is because the [likelihood of] unprecedented events becomes larger with longer timeframes.” In other words, AI cannot overcome the fundamentals of statistics nor predict the unpredictable. “Once an event has happened, software can help [you] adapt fast,” Feindt says. “For instance it can predict how consumer behaviour will develop and the necessary execution.” It can also rapidly assemble data about current circumstances, such as blockages at ports, helping companies to act quickly to find alternative products or suppliers. In the early days of the pandemic, machine learning (ML) could outperform humans. As the latest data came in, ML made use of them to come up with the best response. ML quickly learnt that this was not at all like a holiday period. Some customers initially feared that their software would be unable to cope with the unprecedented situations caused by the pandemic. Machine, however, turned out to be far faster than man in understanding and reacting to the flood of data. AI and ML also measured predictions against actual outcomes, learning as it went. While unpredictable events are inevitable, technology can devise scenario planning to help supply chains withstand shocks. It will optimise inventory management by incorporating levels of uncertainty and can help organisations reach strategic goals, for example, minimising wastage. Ultimately, networks will be able to be envisioned, designed and tested for resilience through scenarios where parts of the chain are “attacked” and contingencies brought into play. This could also help with the relocation of supply chains, such as from China to other parts of Asia, with systems optimised for site location, capacity, inventory management and customer response. To outline some of the technologies that can make a difference, this report looks at the strands of a typical supply chain to show which solutions add value and where, and which hold promise for the future. Companies should focus on what technologies do, not what they are, advises Cambridge university’s Centre for International Manufacturing. Echoing Sodhi, it says that a business’s strategic objectives — better delivery, better products, increased efficiency — should drive decisions on which part of the supply chain needs investment and the technology to be deployed. IBA Group, the outsourcing and software services company, says it can be better and less stressful for management, and therefore more successful, to upgrade facilities than to switch to an entirely new infrastructure. Procurement and fulfilment are entwined even though they are at opposite ends of the chain. Based on actual orders or predictions about orders, the former sources materials and goods to ensure that demand is satisfied through fulfilment. The more digitised a company’s procurement data, the better it can integrate with suppliers. If other suppliers are similarly enabled, the improved connectivity will boost visibility and responsiveness along the chain. The amount of data available for consumer behaviour is growing fast. According to an Ericsson report this year, total global mobile data traffic reached 67 exabytes a month at the end of 2021. This is expected to more than quadruple to 282EB a month in 2027. With the integration of information from suppliers and customers, AI and ML can provide demand forecasts and statistical analysis faster and more accurately than humans. Higher demand for a new type of product in a region can be identified early, which provides insights that can then be applied predictively to neighbouring markets. Data analysis can help to manage price movements and find cheaper sources. Supply chain planning is not new but a digitised system will allow more extensive scenario modelling. This will help companies work out how best to continue should part of a chain break, or to identify when alternative suppliers may be needed. As with visibility, such planning improves resilience. Companies that hold good quality data will have a significant advantage. The resilience of sourcing will be further enhanced when impending supply failures can be identified through automated monitoring that uses natural language processing. This could involve, for instance, the use of information gleaned from the web about extreme weather or political events. To some extent, this is already provided by “control towers”. These are less automated cloud-based data repositories that rely on both manual and automated sources to give companies an improved view of their chains. Control towers can, for example, give early warning of when an external shock is about to trouble a supplier. While control towers are already in use, continued manual inputs, data quality and the security of transfer between companies stand in the way of full automation. They are expected to be a strong growth area: the control tower market was worth $6.5bn in 2021, according to Grand View Research, and this valuation is predicted to grow at a compounded rate of 20 per cent a year between 2022 and 2030. Automated analysis that uses natural language processing and ML can also optimise supplier contracts, provide items to review or action and ensure that procurement terms are in alignment and standardised. Similarly, automation of repetitive tasks such as invoicing can reduce human error and speed up processing times. ML can also analyse invoices to prevent fraud. The efficient production of goods relies on a glitch-free manufacturing process. Equipment failure, poor management of input materials and bad scheduling all cost time and money. Solutions in this area are intended to ensure that downtime is minimised and the use of time and materials is optimised. Sensors can monitor anything from equipment function to product flow and help companies select more efficient production schedules. Combined with ML, sensors can predict the need for equipment maintenance and say when a particular piece is likely to fail. Smart sensors can spot quality issues based on data inconsistencies and decide when to call for human oversight. Want the best factory layout? Digital twinning can help. This is used to create a virtual replica of existing plants and work sites. It can provide insight into the best design, for example when new machines are being installed. One of the more mature technologies available for use in supply chains is robotics. Functionality has become increasingly sophisticated and the use of robots has spread far beyond its traditional heartland in the automotive sector. Data from the Association for Advancing Automation show that in 2021, sales of robots rose 28 per cent year on year to $2bn. This was triggered by a shortage of workers during the pandemic and was 14 per cent above the 2017 sales record. Non-automotive sectors represented 58 per cent of the total. 3D printing is useful for companies that produce work in small-scale batches near to their end markets. This is becoming more common in high-precision, low-volume industries such as customised medical devices, aerospace and aviation as well as those producing prototypes and spare parts. While the IoT grows bigger and stronger by the day, systems built on the more mature RFID technology (radio frequency identification) can offer near real-time monitoring of goods in transit. This allows accurate scheduling of handling and delivery and the most efficient use of fleets of lorries or vans. For refrigerated items, tracking enhances quality control by giving near-continuous temperature readings. In April 2022 Hapag-Lloyd said that all of its standard containers would have trackers within months, offering greater visibility of this part of the chain. Various software providers now offer control towers, which combine third party data and algorithms to solve transport problems. These can be especially helpful when delays occur: storms can be tracked and routes altered almost straight away. When dealing with mundane events such as traffic jams, technology can identify alternative routes far faster than people can. One drawback, however, is where a system still relies on data that is manually input. Currently when disasters affect trade arteries — the blocking of the Suez Canal by a container ship in 2021 is one example — it can take longer for companies to reconfigure schedules if their processes are not fully automated. The more data a system has, the faster it can optimise alternative plans. At some stage, natural language processing and standardised announcements — of changes to Covid regulations, for instance — should facilitate more automated data collection. AI can speed up mundane tasks such as choosing a carrier. It can assist logistics planners by narrowing down possible routes. The process is similar to that of an individual consumer who uses Google Flights to select a plane ticket. Predictive algorithms can also make sure that assets, for example containers, are in the right place at the right time. AI improves data analytics, capacity estimation and network analysis. Digital twinning uses AI and the IoT to make transportation more efficient. In the Port of Rotterdam, for instance, sensors in a digital twin help to plan mooring and unloading schedules, taking into account the state of the tide and weight of cargoes. In the long run, DHL envisages that digital twins of entire routes will be possible, all using real time information. This will make autonomous deliveries more feasible. Blockchain is said to have the potential to revolutionise much of the supply chain by providing transaction verification. Its promise to solve border logjams caused by Brexit have yet to materialise, however, and with limited evidence of its value or applications, any wide scale adoption should be treated as speculative. Warehouses operated by Ocado, the grocery technology company, show how end to end integration can add value. Systems based on its Smart Platform — which was developed in-house to meet its own business needs — are sold to grocery companies worldwide. Robots have added value to this part of the chain for decades and they have become increasingly sophisticated. Robots enabled with sensors, ML and AI can load trucks and pallets and move boxes. Ocado’s state of the art warehouses reduce downtime, as their robots monitor their own “health”. At Amazon, robots do everything from lifting heavy loads to fast and accurate picking and packing. Stock levels are based on actual orders and predicted demand — and this is where AI can bring savings. Historical data and pattern analysis have helped Ocado to reduce food wastage. It is down from the industry average of 2 to 3 per cent to 0.6 per cent. Last mile delivery can make or break customer satisfaction levels for a consumer-facing company. Besides the technologies already outlined, which help to predict demand and ensure that goods are available for delivery, software can optimise route planning as customer orders are received. For the past few years street robots have delivered fast food in London and other European cities. We can expect to see more autonomous vehicles and drones being used within a few years. Fully digitised supply chains not only enable efficiencies in existing businesses, they can also enhance revenues by focusing on what customers may need or wish to buy. Within procurement, ML and algorithms can make use of customer buying patterns and help to sell more products. Digital sales channels are no longer simply nice to have, they are essential for companies to reach digitally savvy consumers and tailor products for them. As demand increases for products whose sustainability is verified, traceability will give an edge to the consumer-facing companies that are among the first adopters. ◉ Cyber threats Greater digitisation in the supply chain is not free of risk. Data loss, information security and hacking are all threats. A report on the 2021 state of the supply chain for the software industry by Sonatype, which sells supply chain software, reported that the number of cyber attacks in the sector rose from 216 in 2015 to 12,000 in 2019, a 650 per cent increase. ◉ Expectations shortfall Disappointment can be a danger, a trend with technology that is shown by the Gartner hype cycle. With any early stage technology there is limited understanding. Failing to match the organisation’s need to the right technology will inevitably cause disappointment. The benefits provided by IoT, AI and blockchain are all still indistinguishable to most companies, as their utility is misunderstood. Sodhi of Bayes Business School London says that, to increase the odds of success, users must recognise that not all problems can be solved by every technology. “Each of these technologies are useful for something but they are not useful for everything . . . People think whether they get blockchain or AI or IoT that all their needs in the supply chain will be met. What they are actually thinking is what they need, they are not thinking what the technology will provide or not provide”. He likens making a choice from what is on offer to a homeowner being presented with a fridge, microwave and vacuum cleaner and choosing just one to fulfil all their needs. “If I buy a microwave to clean the floors and I open it and close it to pick up the dust from the floor, it might kind of work but that’s not what it was designed for”. The problem is exacerbated by limited knowledge-sharing among users. For technology applications to be refined and developed, more companies should share their experiences about what works and what does not. ◉ Talent mismatch Companies that are fearful of change risk poor implementation if they fail to achieve buy-in throughout an organisation. A lack of training will hamper progress. In some instances, a generational shift may be required for successful adoption. Experts stress the importance of the right personnel being involved in commissioning new software. Too often CEOs are sold so-called all-in-one solutions whose functionality they do not understand. Technology can help with the challenges that face supply chains. For greater adoption to be a success, however, companies must know which problems they want to solve. They must recognise that any solution is simply a tool that must be applied and used correctly by skilled people trained in its use. If there are problems in a supply chain, these need to be identified and addressed as early as possible. Even with the best technology, there is no substitute for communication and transparency. Early intervention can save companies’ relationships with their customers. Internet of things (IoT) The IoT consists of sensors that make goods “smart”. These can both send information and communicate with each other. The IoT is used in the supply chain for tracking and monitoring. Blockchain Blockchain is also known as distributed ledger technology. It allows for the digital recording of transactions and tracking assets in a business network. It introduces trust where this is scarce. The verifiability of transactions can help to reduce fraud). Artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics These involve statistics at a huge scale processed at a blistering speed. They can help with warehousing and inventory, improving sourcing relationships and predicting demand AI and machine learning ML is a facet of AI that applies an algorithm to data. It then taps into previous experience and then accomplishes tasks without human involvement. The algorithms can, for instance, make predictions, form personalised recommendations and recognise images in photos. Examples of ML with which you may be familiar include TikTok recommendations, photo portrait recognition and sentence completion. Robots and automation This covers the physical side of distribution centres and includes optimising storage, moving stock and picking and packing. It is increasingly sophisticated. 3D printing This involves the creation of three-dimensional objects by a machine that uses a computer model. It applies layers of substrate (plastics, liquids or powders) to create physical goods. It allows for the making and replication of extremely complex shapes that cannot be constructed by hand.  ,,Lucy Colback,2022-11-22T12:00:06.121Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/029dd01f-eaf5-493c-b195-299408b62469,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Australian stock exchange apologises for dropping botched blockchain upgrade,Pioneering project’s failure threatens to leave country behind UK and EU, critics say,Australia’s stock exchange has apologised for abandoning a years-long plan to upgrade its clearing and settlement system to a modern blockchain-based platform after a series of delays. The Australian Securities Exchange’s move to drop the upgrade of its clearing housing system calls time on a project that critics say has cost the country its head-start in developing a more efficient trading system. Damian Roche, chair of ASX, apologised for the disruption caused by the botched upgrade. “We have concluded that the path we were on will not meet ASX’s and the market’s high standards. There are significant technology, governance and delivery challenges that must be addressed,” he said. Australian regulators had granted ASX control of the project to foster more efficient trading. In contrast, the European Union has launched a technology pilot to trial distributed ledger technology for share trading and the UK Treasury is set to do the same. The project, launched seven years ago, has been beset by repeated delays of the system’s implementation. ASX will book a A$250mn ($168mn) charge after admitting it needed to start again. Philip Lowe, the governor of Australia’s central bank, said that the banking industry had incurred significant costs and that any writedowns would need to be fully borne by ASX. “The announcement by ASX after many years of investment by both ASX and industry is very disappointing. ASX needs to prioritise developing a new plan to deliver safe and reliable clearing and settlement infrastructure,” Lowe said. Banks and financial services companies are estimated to have spent up to A$150mn preparing for the upgrade. The decision to abandon the blockchain upgrade followed a review by Accenture that showed major deficiencies in the design of the software, developed by a company in which ASX has a stake, and questioned its ability to ever launch. David Ferrall, head of trading platform FinClear, laid the blame on ASX and regulators who “blindly” accepted that the upgrade would deliver on its original promise. “It is not the technology that’s the problem. It is the implementation,” he said, noting that his company has developed trading platforms using the same system that ASX has aborted. Ferrall said that the replacement for ASX’s upgrade could be obsolete by the time it arrives in two to three years. Recommended “We’re now falling behind the rest of the world,” he said, arguing that other markets such as the UK and EU have created “sandboxes” to promote innovation outside the traditional clearing houses, something Australia failed to do. He said there was a risk that regulators could force a break-up of ASX by separating its exchange from its clearing operations. “That would be to the long-term benefit of the market and to the detriment of the ASX,” he said. ASX shares closed flat on Thursday but have fallen by almost a quarter this year to a market cap of A$13.6bn.,,Nic Fildes,2022-11-17T06:41:07.061Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/3746542f-3f13-46c7-a236-586dffed3b61,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Wait, wasn’t bitcoin supposed to solve this?,Back2basics,Jill Gunter is a co-founder of blockchain company Espresso Systems. Previously, she was a venture capitalist focused on crypto. She started her career as a trader at Goldman Sachs. A popular refrain among crypto advocates over the years has been “bitcoin solves this”. But the same phrase has also become a popular meme among critics of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. Sceptics offer the phrase in reply to overzealous crypto acolytes who try to apply blockchain technology to everything from salad provenance to social media. “Bitcoin solves this,” they eye-roll, gesturing to the fact that no amount of blockchain will be a panacea to the problem at hand. Over the last week, as crypto exchange FTX crumbled into bankruptcy amid revelations of misappropriation of customer funds, imaginary marks and risky bets, crypto’s proponents and detractors alike have turned that phrase into a question. “Wait, wasn’t bitcoin supposed to solve this?” After all, cryptocurrency was invented explicitly to counter Wall Street’s opaque and overleveraged practices. The original Bitcoin whitepaper proposed a system that would end the reliance on trusted financial institutions, reduce fraud and protect consumers. At the moment, this couldn’t feel more ironic. But not having to trust anyone is a seductive promise! According to Gallup, trust in government, media, banks and beyond has been in a steady decline for decades, but really, all you need to do is log on to Twitter this week and check out the chaos to see that society has a trust problem. It is little wonder that blockchains with their vows to obviate the need for trust have captured the imagination of many. And to their credit, I think blockchains and their “decentralised finance” (DeFi) applications have actually delivered on this promise. Individuals can custody their own crypto assets, audit the ledger of transactions by themselves, and even participate as keepers and overseers of the whole system. Millions of people now only need to rely on code. These cryptocurrency users might have lost sleep this week as they watched the value of their assets plummet, but at least they weren’t worried about whether they’d ever get access to their funds again, as they have with centralised crypto exchanges like FTX. While FTX’s customers scrambled and failed to withdraw their funds, users of major decentralised finance products like Uniswap, Compound, and Aave had continuous access to their assets and benefited from orderly and transparent processing of their trades, transactions, and, yes, liquidations. For the users who hold their own coins and only trade on decentralised finance platforms, crypto came through. It turns out that blockchains can mitigate the risks posed by intermediaries! Unfortunately, not all crypto holders have taken advantage of these properties. That’s because there are major trade-offs. In order for crypto users to gain the benefits of blockchains, they must use new and clunky products that carry their own risks. The stakes are high if they make any mistakes, and they will only have themselves to blame. The man who famously threw away hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin in a garbage dump was “acting as his own bank”. As he demonstrates for us, there’s a major drawback to being your own bank. You have no recourse, no customer support, and no one to sue if you lose from your own negligence. DeFi users also take on the risks inherent to an anarcho-utopia (or dystopia?) where code is law. If a user makes a typo in the address to which they are sending their assets, there is no way to undo that. Similarly, if a hacker finds a bug in the code of a DeFi product and extracts user funds, the victims will have little protection. It is like the ultimate “finders keepers.” The technology is still in a state where these types of hacks happen all the time. For many users, it is not worth the inconvenience and the risk to gain the benefits of “trustless” systems like those of DeFi. Users who do not want or need to hold their own crypto can do it the old fashioned Wall Street way: they can trust a custodian. Custodial exchanges not only enable crypto users to cash in and out of coins and tokens, they also hold on to users’ assets as deposits. Of course users who hold and trade on exchanges are not really using crypto. They aren’t deriving any of the features crypto was designed to offer, like self-custody and censorship-resistance and transparency. They are just holding or speculating on whether “number go up” or “number go down”. Still, it’s fair to say that millions of users benefit from the convenience of holding their assets on these exchanges. Today it turned out that at least a million of those users — namely the ones who used FTX — would have been better off if they had taken advantage of crypto’s value proposition and held on to their funds themselves. And the grim reality is that despite bitcoin and other blockchain products offering alternatives, as of today, the cryptocurrency market has created more intermediaries than it has eliminated. For the last several years, no one has really cared about the genuine utility that may be found in crypto. With global floods of easy money pouring into asset classes of all kinds, and pushing people further out the risk spectrum, entrepreneurs, developers, and investors found themselves incentivised to play into the building of a large speculative bubble as opposed to delivering durable value. Too much of the time, energy, money, and attention that has gone into crypto over the past few years has gone toward building gambling markets around magic beans — instead of creating products taking advantage of the openness, transparency, and autonomy that the tech offers. FTX and its violation of user trust serve as the starkest reminder the industry could ask for in returning it to its original vision. The demise of FTX feels like the end of crypto at the moment, but it may become the catalyst to drive the industry to the areas where cryptocurrencies and blockchains can solve real problems. Already, many more custodial exchanges have announced that they will take advantage of the transparent nature of blockchains to provide the public with a cryptographic “proof of reserves”. This is a great example of leveraging the technology for its true utility: improving accountability.

He was ready to negotiate a $600mn truce in a public feud that had rocked the crypto industry. But Zhao swiftly decided to throw a lifeline to FTX, Bankman-Fried’s company and the chief challenger to his own, Binance, in the fierce competition to dominate the offshore market in risky and complex digital asset trading. FTX had been swamped by customers demanding their money back, and urgently needed billions of dollars to stay afloat. Zhao agreed to rescue FTX and acquire his rival. But, only a day later, he abandoned the deal. On Friday Bankman-Fried’s $32bn empire filed for bankruptcy in the US. The collapse of FTX instantly tipped the balance of power in the $1tn crypto market. “[Zhao] coming out and attacking the token I think will go down as one of the greatest corporate attacks that has ever happened,” said Jon de Wet, chief investment officer at digital wealth manager Zerocap. “It’s private equity corporate raider stuff.” Zhao denies having a “master plan” to take over FTX. In just five years, Binance has boomed into an industry titan with a constellation of global affiliates — many in Zhao’s name. Last month alone, it processed $2.8tn in crypto coin and derivatives transactions, according to CryptoCompare data. The 45-year-old, universally known as “CZ”, was estimated to be one of the world’s richest people before the crash in crypto prices cut his fortune to $17bn, according to Forbes. Interviews with former employees, business partners and industry peers paint a portrait of a divisive entrepreneur on a relentless drive to grow at all costs. Several of those who worked with him said security and regulatory compliance were sacrificed in the race to dominate. Binance said: “In this fast-growing industry, we continually strive to evolve and ensure regulatory compliance and account holder protection.” Zhao, who declined to be interviewed, is venerated by an army of have-a-go investors who rush to take selfies with him. But while his “Binance Angels” spread the company gospel, equally vocal opponents criticise the exchange for money they say was lost during a series of technological outages at the height of 2021’s crypto market mayhem. Several former employees described a driven leader who pushed them to the edges of their comfort zone. Zhao’s tough character was on display this week when he said he would sell around $600mn in FTT, a token issued by FTX, which Binance had held since exiting an early equity investment in the company. This move knocked the token’s price, with FTX enduring a record $5bn of customer withdrawals on Sunday. Bankman-Fried alluded to the tussle on Twitter. “At some point I might have more to say about a particular sparring partner, so to speak. But you know, glass houses. So for now, all I’ll say is: well played; you won.” Zhao says the sales were a prudent move to avoid losses and the abortive takeover a good-faith effort to prevent market panic. “Did CZ seize an opportunity? Yes. Did CZ orchestrate everything? No. FTX put themselves in this position, ultimately,” said a senior executive at a trading firm. Born in China, Zhao is a Canadian citizen who spent his teenage years in Vancouver where he worked at McDonald’s. After studying computer science, he worked on trading software, including for the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In 2013, he moved into crypto, launching Binance four years later. Early on, Zhao repeatedly insisted that the company had no fixed headquarters, in line with crypto’s decentralised ethos. In fact, staff worked out of Shanghai and Tokyo but were warned not to wear Binance-branded clothing to the office, or reveal where they worked on LinkedIn. After a 2019 security breach, staff complained in chat messages seen by the Financial Times that users were “pointing out our clear negligence” and “extremely lax Know Your Customer security and procedures”. A former business partner said Binance “talked a big game” on anti-money laundering and KYC controls but was “resistant to throwing human resources at compliance issues”. Regulators have since censured Binance in a string of financial capitals, including the UK, which warned last year that the crypto behemoth’s “complex and high-risk financial products” posed “a significant risk to consumers”. Some viewed Zhao as an ambitious successor to Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. “Apple was selling computers, we were trying to reinvent the financial system,” said a former employee. But a former business partner said internal rivalry made Binance unpredictable and, at times, chaotic. “There was a conscious decision to let people battle for supremacy. It’s a very Machiavellian vision of leadership that I think CZ has embraced,” the person said. In a blog post about his leadership style, CZ said: “Controlled chaos is a type of structure.” After clashes with regulators, Zhao pledged to scrap “decentralised” organisation and establish a normal home base. “I am a technology entrepreneur and we are doing this pivot into a fully-regulated financial business,” he said last year. But his conversion to financial orthodoxy has yet to be completed. Binance said it has invested heavily and added 500 staff in compliance and law enforcement, but has not unveiled a regular corporate structure or headquarters. The company has, however, secured oversight in several jurisdictions including a registration in France and a licence in Dubai, where Zhao lives. Zhao said this week that the demise of his chief rival was not “a win” for Binance, as it will sharpen regulatory attention on crypto operators. The question now is whether his company can put down roots and escape the traps that have ensnared its rivals. joshua.oliver@ft.com, adam.samson@ft.com,,Joshua Oliver Adam Samson,2022-11-11T22:00:29.994Z,

Things have come full circle, and https://t.co/DWPOotRHcX’s first, and last, investors are the same: we have come to an agreement on a strategic transaction with Binance for https://t.co/DWPOotRHcX (pending DD etc.). The cold war gripping cryptoland has suddenly turned very hot. Binance has stepped in to non-bindingly rescue rival cryptocurrency superpower FTX from a liquidity crunch it was widely considered to have helped create. This afternoon, FTX asked for our help. There is a significant liquidity crunch. To protect users, we signed a non-binding LOI, intending to fully acquire https://t.co/BGtFlCmLXB and help cover the liquidity crunch. We will be conducting a full DD in the coming days. It’s a reverse ferret from SBF, who was talking on Monday about how “a competitor is trying to go after us with false rumors”. All friends now though. Apparently. 5) I know that there have been rumors in media of conflict between our two exchanges, however Binance has shown time and again that they are committed to a more decentralized global economy while working to improve industry relations with regulators. We are in the best of hands. The trigger to surrender was FTX’s native token FTT slumping to new lows. TheBlock reported around 9am EST that FTX hadn’t done any on-chain withdrawals on Ethereum, Solana or Tron blockchains since 6:37am EST: Crypto exchange FTX, which is currently fighting a battle with rival Binance, seems to have stopped processing clients’ requests for withdrawals, according to on-chain data. The last outgoing transaction from FTX on the Ethereum blockchain took place at 6:37 a.m. ET, more than two hours ago, data from Etherscan show. It’s a similar story on the Tron and Solana blockchains as well, on-chain data show. Skirmishes had begun over the weekend, when Binance said it would dump its FTT tokens in response to “recent revelations”. This appeared to refer to claims about the fragility of Alameda Research, the FTX-linked trading firm, due to its reliance to FTT and other third-tier tokens. Caroline Ellison, chief executive of Alameda, had suggested on Twitter that it could buy Binance’s FTT holdings at $22 per coin. Binance’s Changpeng “CZ” Zhao publicly rejected the proposal by making passing reference to Luna, the algo-stablecoin that collapsed spectacularly in June. I didn't say that. It was a question, not a commitment. I think we will stay in the free market. We still hold LUNA (now LUNC) today. 😂 FTX's only option left was direct intervention to support its sort-of currency and discourage shouts of fire within its very crowded theatre. Support never arrived, however, and FTT slumped below $15. The full story’s over on the FT mainsite. SBF and FTX’s official Twitter accounts were uncharacteristically quiet through the drama. But CZ did find time to like this tweet. Only $BNB is surviving the sea of red today. CZ is showing everyone who’s boss. pic.twitter.com/P84LGWV28u Note: this post has been substantially revised post publication in an attempt to keep pace with breaking news,,,2022-11-08T16:06:36.207Z,

The funds were launched in the heady days of 2021 — just in time for them for them to face the full force of 2022’s market fury, Morningstar Direct data show. The findings, from data provided exclusively for the Financial Times, exclude the performance of leveraged and inverse funds, which are not designed to be held over the long term. All five focused on the once high-flying cryptocurrency sector or the related field of blockchain, in a new illustration of academic claims that thematic funds have a tendency to launch near the peak of their theme, just before returns head south. “Specialised ETFs are launched just after the very peak of excitement around popular investment themes. Over the years following the launch, the underlying assets shed some of their initial overvaluation, and so do the prices of specialised ETFs,” wrote Rabih Moussawi and colleagues in an academic paper initially released last year. “Specialised ETFs appear to cater to over-optimistic investors,” said Moussawi, associate professor of finance at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. The heavily hyped ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which lost a record $1.2bn of investors’ money in the 12 months after its eagerly awaited arrival in October 2021, has garnered many of the headlines. Its travails have been far from unique, though, with a number of smaller ETFs sporting still larger losses in percentage terms than BITO’s 70.4 per cent maiden-year plunge, even if their losses in dollar terms were smaller by dint of their diminutive size. The worst performer was the France-domiciled Melanion BTC Equities Universe Ucits ETF (FR0014002IH8), which invests in crypto-adjacent companies such as Marathon Digital Holdings, Riot Blockchain and MicroStrategy. It launched in October 2021, the same month as BITO and just weeks before global markets peaked, only to tumble 76.9 per cent in the subsequent 12 months. Likewise, the US-listed Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH), which entered the fray in July last year, plummeted 76.7 per cent in its first year of operation. Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO), another October 2021 hatchling, was not far behind, sinking 73.7 per cent, while the First Trust SkyBridge Crypto Industry and Digital Economy ETF (CRPT) shipped 69.4 per cent in the 12 months to this September. “Blockchain investments are closely aligned with bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general but they come with added risk of equity exposure,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at consultancy VettaFi. “Companies that are connected to the broad ecosystem have faced challenges as the price of bitcoin has fallen sharply and the demand for the technology has not grown as fast as expected by investors. They are being punished just as much or even more so than bitcoin futures-based products themselves,” he added. The only other non-leveraged or inverse ETFs to have had a worse maiden year than BITO are the Xtrackers MSCI Russia Capped Swap ETF (XMRD), which lost 75.1 per cent in the year to December 2008 as the commodity supercycle crumbled, and Canada’s Horizons US Marijuana ETF (HMUS), which saw 75.3 per cent of its assets go up in smoke in 2019-20. In a demonstration, however, of the risks of holding leveraged and inverse vehicles over a long period, the worst ever debut year for any ETF, according to Morningstar, was chalked up by the Dublin-domiciled Leverage Shares 3x Roku exchange traded commodity (ROK3). Anyone who held the fund for 12 months from ROK3’s launch in June 2021 would have seen 99.92 per cent of their money evaporate, magnifying the 76 per cent slide in the US streaming platform’s share price during the period. A similar story of the risk of holding products designed for the short term can be found in the fortunes of the Switzerland-domiciled 21Shares Short Bitcoin ETP (SBTC), which took the opposite side of BITO’s bet, but over a different time period. SBTC would have lost investors 86.2 per cent in its first year, because its birth in January 2020 was just as bitcoin began its vertiginous climb, rising by 285 per cent. The Morningstar data also suggest a terrible first year does not necessarily sound the death knell for a fund, however. The SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF (SPYG) fell 53.8 per cent in its first year of trading in 2000-2001 but has since bounced back to become a $12.2bn fund. Likewise, the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) tumbled 56 per cent in 2008-2009 but now has $4.5bn of assets and the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) slumped 68.2 per cent in the same year but now holds $2.2bn. Even ProShares has experience of this; its UltraPro Short QQQ (SQQQ) now has $4.8bn of assets, despite losing 68.1 per cent in 2010-2011. Kenneth Lamont, senior fund analyst for passive strategies at Morningstar, believed the crypto sector could be another to bounce back. “The people that I speak to who invest in bitcoin are still reliably bullish because the potential use cases haven’t changed,” Lamont said. “A lot of those involved in the industry have just regathered themselves for the next bull run. Whether that will arrive or not who knows, but if there is an investment case for bitcoin there will perhaps be an equilibrium found.” Click here to visit the ETF Hub,,Steve Johnson,2022-10-28T04:00:04.070Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/3c64101b-c4a1-49b3-a187-30229b1e5b9d,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,The ‘Merge’ did not fix Ethereum,Switch in the way the blockchain works is leading to increasing centralisation of the network,The writer is professor of law at the American University Washington College of Law The Ethereum blockchain that facilitates much of the crypto world last month finally accomplished the long-promised and oft-delayed “Merge”, a technical switch in the way it works. The Ethereum blockchain is one of the world’s most widely used digital ledgers, and is the main platform for Web3, non-fungible tokens, and decentralised finance. While the Merge is unequivocally good news for the environment, it brings the Ethereum blockchain’s other problems into even starker relief. Rather than relying on centralised intermediaries such as a bank to approve transactions, blockchains rely on what is known as a “consensus mechanism”. Before the Merge, Ethereum used the “proof-of-work” consensus mechanism. This involves so-called “miners” using enormous amounts of electricity to power computers to make repeated guesses of the number that will allow them to add a block of transactions to the blockchain. The winning miners are then compensated with cryptocurrency for their work. The bitcoin blockchain still does it this way. Verification of bitcoin transactions uses more energy than entire countries like Norway; in areas where lots of bitcoin mining occurs, local populations have suffered from rising energy costs and noise pollution. Ethereum’s shift to a “proof-of-stake” system avoids these environmental costs. Ethereum now uses an algorithm that randomly selects someone to create a new block to add to the blockchain. The party is chosen from those who have staked their ether (the Ethereum blockchain’s native coin) for the chance to do the work and be compensated for it. The more ether someone stakes, the more likely they are to be chosen to create the new block. This creates incentives to acquire even more ether, and it seems reasonable to predict that any blockchain that relies on proof-of-stake will start to concentrate the ability to process transactions in just a few hands. Staking is already a highly centralised business involving some of the industry’s largest companies, such as Coinbase, according to data provider Nansen. More centralisation seems inevitable. Remember that the whole point of having a blockchain with a consensus mechanism is to avoid having to rely on centralised intermediaries to verify transactions. Without meaningful decentralisation, one has to wonder if all the other problems associated with Ethereum are worth it. For example, the Ethereum blockchain is notorious for congestion at peak times, which manifests in slower transaction processing times and fluctuating transaction fees (which are known as “gas fees”). At peak times, gas fees can be prohibitive for users trying to complete smaller transactions (in May 2022, average daily gas fees reached nearly $200), but the Merge has not changed the way gas fees are calculated or charged. Such congestion adds to another problem. Users can pay validators higher fees to have their order executed first within a block of transactions. This is a cost on users which benefits the bigger validators which will be chosen to create more blocks of transactions, and will therefore have more opportunities to pocket higher fees. A validator may even insert their own transaction ahead of others in order to profit from market movements, a practice known as MEV or “maximal extractable value”. The Merge will also not make the blockchain more secure. Ethereum’s claims that it will do this assume that the Merge will increase decentralisation. But if the reverse is true, there are risks. A report commissioned by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency found proof-of-stake blockchains can be successfully manipulated if the number of validators is too small. The shift to proof-of-stake also increases the legal uncertainty around the status of ether. Prior to the Merge, US Senator Debbie Stabenow proposed a bill that lists ether as an example of a “digital commodity” falling outside of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s jurisdiction (in the US, securities are regulated by the SEC, whereas the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has oversight over the commodities markets). However, now that stakers pool their ether together in the hope of being compensated from the Ethereum blockchain’s gas fees, a stronger case can be made that ether are securities and not commodities. The SEC might have something to say about Ethereum’s claims about its decentralisation and its benefits.,,Hilary Allen,2022-10-19T04:00:44.335Z,

A (very) quick check of the relevant data suggests the figure is a tad overblown. Per Moody’s: Many companies are testing and adopting blockchain technology solutions for their business. For example, financial institutions are developing blockchain infrastructures to transfer funds among subsidiaries at lower costs, higher speed and lower overhead to keep track of money inflow by means of an electronic distributed ledger. Manufacturing firms are employing blockchain to improve the traceability of goods and commodities across the whole supply chain. As of September 2021, 81 of the top 100 publicly traded companies had adopted blockchain within their business model . . .  It’s unclear whether Moody’s analysts read the press release from which the figure was taken all the way to the bottom: the claim becomes more and more diluted the further one scrolls. The data came from wide-eyed blockchain analysis company Blockdata (tagline: “Accelerating. Blockchain. Adoption”). First, its list of 81 companies “includes those who are in a research phase, meaning they are exploring opportunities and deciding on which technologies they could use for their blockchain initiatives”. “If we remove the research phase,” the post continues, “we find that there are still an impressive 65 companies who are actively developing blockchain solutions.” The claim is watered down even more in a separate post. It turns out only 44 of the top 100 companies have “actively pursued blockchain strategies” in the past year. Just five of those 44 companies are “financials”. Tortured English aside, Moody’s assertion that “we are witnessing the rapid adoption of financial institutions developing blockchain infrastructure to increase the speed and efficiency of fund transfers” simply does not stand up.,,George Steer,2022-10-10T15:54:54.396Z,

Binance initially estimated on Friday that tokens worth about $100mn to $110mn had been taken, pausing the operation of the affected blockchain for approximately eight hours. However, the exchange later disclosed that the hacker had taken around two million of the cryptocurrency BNB, Binance’s own digital token, with a value of around $284 each. The hack targeted BSC Token Hub, a bridge between two Binance systems. It comes at a time when digital assets are trying to recover from a credit crisis that wiped nearly two-thirds off the value of its most high-profile tokens such as bitcoin. Industry data have also indicated that theft from projects is soaring this year. Cyber criminals had taken nearly $2bn this year to the end of July, nearly double the total in the first seven months of last year, according to data from Chainalysis. High-profile thefts included $600mn from the blockchain behind popular crypto-gaming platform Axie Infinity. Many hacks have been traced to state-sponsored actors in North Korea. Binance’s position as the world’s largest crypto exchange means Friday’s exploit represents a significant blow to the digital assets industry. In a series of social media posts Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s founder and chief executive, told users: “The issue is contained now. Your funds are safe. We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide further updates accordingly.” Binance asked the affected network’s validators, who secure the system, to pause their work. The funds were taken from BSC Token Hub, a bridge that allows customers to transfer tokens tied to one chain to another. The hack exploited a weakness that created extra BNB tokens on the network, according to Zhao. Many of the world’s most widely used blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum, run on separate technologies or use different tokens. That means investors and developers cannot easily move their tokens to a different blockchain to use or trade them elsewhere. Binance’s security team and other crypto network operators have steadily been freezing the stolen assets. By Friday afternoon a Binance spokesperson said there was around $100mn of unrecovered funds. Binance Smart Chain allows the world’s largest crypto exchange to open its doors to let developers build applications that use smart contracts, based on Binance’s own token. Binance launched the new chain in September 2020, at a time when the crypto industry was seeing widespread interest in decentralised finance projects.

https://www.ft.com/content/28455312-badf-4851-bb6e-e92dba972b93,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,FT Cryptofinance: Solana loses its lustre,Plus, Kim Kardashian keeps up with US securities law,Welcome to this week’s edition of the FT’s Cryptofinance newsletter. Today, we’re taking stock of Solana, a blockchain touted as the next Big Thing. What a difference a year makes. Last October the token that represented the Solana blockchain was well on its way to an all-time high of nearly $250. I was about to interview Anatoly Yakovenko, one of its co-founders, at a Solana conference in Lisbon intended to showcase all of its wonderful advances and potential. I bumped into an old friend attending the conference who said Solana had “made a pretty meaningful difference to [his] year, financially”. The hype was infectious. A few months later, the sober Bank of America said Solana “could become the Visa of the digital asset ecosystem”. Now, Solana’s native token trades at just $33. The applause from the indulgent audience at the conference is just a memory. This week brought a reminder of why, when the blockchain suffered an outage lasting several hours. The root cause was a malfunctioning node — the pillars that hold up the blockchain — that caused duplications on the network. It was resolved by effectively . . . *checks notes* . . . turning off the blockchain and turning it on again. Anyone who was running projects on Solana could not process any of their transactions while the network was down. Obviously, this is pretty embarrassing for a network that has touted itself as the answer to a problem that would allow blockchain technologies to rival the scale and reliability that traditional financial institutions demonstrate every day. Bitcoin is designed to process blocks every 10 minutes or so. Costs tend to rise sharply when lots of people want to use them. That makes blockchains useless for mass take-up by consumers. Solana promised it could handle 50,000 trades per second, a scale that could rival credit card operator Visa or the Nasdaq stock exchange while still keeping the costs at a fraction of a cent. But reliability issues on Solana are becoming something of a habit. Thousands of crypto accounts linked to it were drained in August in an apparent hack. According to data from CryptoCompare, Solana has been down for 6,422 minutes this year, equivalent to more than four days. Admittedly, the bulk of that time is down to an outage in January but it has been out for six hours this month already. By contrast, Nasdaq has been up for more than 99.9 per cent of the time this year. After last week’s outage, Solana users vented on social media with a mix of anger and resignation. “As usual”, “shut down the chain completely” and “no need to post anything. We are aware that Solana goes offline every few weeks.” Solana’s supposed scalability has attracted traditional finance. One of Wall Street’s more eye-catching forays into crypto is Pyth, which collects and distributes data on stock, conventional currency, crypto and commodity deals for decentralised trading. The data have been supplied by high-frequency traders such as Jump Trading and DRW Cumberland and exchanges including IEX and LMAX. Pyth is built on Solana. Just this week Chicago derivatives exchange Cboe Global Markets agreed to supply data to Pyth. Helpful as this may be, it only goes to show how far Solana is from being “the Visa of crypto”. Big financial institutions are happy to use it as a live testing ground for their own crypto ambitions; it’s low-risk but not an immediate contributor or threat to revenues. But if a new-ish technology such as blockchain is going to supplant existing financial systems, it has to offer something better than what has gone before. What’s your take on Solana? Will it ever take off, or is the game over? Email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com. The Securities and Exchange Commission continues its march against crypto, settling charges with celebrity Kim Kardashian for promoting an “ethereum max” token. The social media influencer and celebrity A-lister agreed to pay $1.3mn in penalty fees but didn’t admit or deny the SEC’s findings. Crypto’s great resignation continues. Celsius Network’s co-founder Daniel Leon has stepped down. This week my colleague Kadhim Shubber revealed that former Celsius head Alex Mashinsky took $10mn out of the bankrupt lender before it froze customer accounts. Binance became the latest in a very, very long line of crypto hack victims this week. Early reports indicate the exploit caused between $100mn and $110mn worth of losses. Read our story here. Europe has tightened existing crypto prohibitions against Russia in the wake of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Now all crypto asset wallets, accounts and custody services irrespective of the amount held will be banned. The FBI has issued a warning against “pig butchering”. It’s not a form of animal cruelty but usually involves scammers making contact on social media or dating applications, gaining their trust before persuading victims to make deposits into fraudulent crypto schemes. In recent weeks Terraform Labs chief Do Kwon has been cheerfully asserting on social media that he isn’t hiding (but without revealing his whereabouts) and even suggests he goes for walks, seemingly without a worry. This week his tone changed when asked about a report that South Korea had frozen almost $40mn of his crypto assets. He claimed the story was a “falsehood” and an example of why crypto was popular in countries that weaponised state institutions against their own people. “Reap what you sow — revolutions start from within.” The USDC stablecoin, run by Circle, has been losing market capitalisation in the past two months, according to data from CryptoCompare. It is now at $46bn compared with $55bn in July. The market cap of Tether’s USDT and Binance’s BUSD, the industry’s other two big stablecoin players, have both risen in the same period. An important macro point: dollar interest rates today are higher than they have ever been in the era of crypto. US Treasuries are offering about 4 to 5 per cent and stablecoins nothing.

A number of cryptocurrency and blockchain-focused funds that invest in the broader universe without directly investing in cryptocurrency have been rolled out this past year in Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea, while Australia has seen the region’s first exchange traded funds with direct exposure to bitcoin and ether. “For investors, the growing number of mutual funds and ETFs coming to market help to widen product choices or even legitimise crypto investing by providing arguably safer routes to accessing this asset class, compared to direct crypto investing,” said Ken Yap, Singapore-based managing director for Asia at Cerulli. “Crypto funds offer an important asset-gathering opportunity for managers,” Yap added. This article was previously published by Ignites Asia, a title owned by the FT Group. Regional regulators have been cracking down on the asset class, however, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore curtailing retail access to crypto in August and Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission overhauling advertising rules for digital asset companies. South Korea also does not currently permit local players to tap services from cryptocurrency exchanges. This environment of increasing regulatory scrutiny and market volatility, however, would be “key selling points” for asset managers in providing crypto-related funds, rather than products that have direct exposure to the asset class, said Yap. The growing regulation has not stopped Asian managers from seeking opportunities in this space, with a number of Korean firms taking steps to grow their digital asset capabilities. In January, Korea’s Mirae Asset Financial Group announced plans to roll out a digital assets business that would initially target custody services for cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens and eventually create loans and funds tied to digital assets, the Korea Economic Daily reported, citing industry sources. That push came amid rising demand for such services. KB Asset Management, South Korea’s largest bank, announced in February that it had created a digital asset management preparatory committee to explore the development of digital assets and artificial intelligence funds. KB AM rolled out the KB Global Digital Chain Economy fund, the first strategy in the country that focuses on investments in blockchain technology companies, in September last year. Generation Z and millennials were fuelling the interest in crypto in South Korea, said Cerulli. Singapore is also seeing strong interest among young investors, with Cerulli citing a survey from last year that found 51 per cent of those aged 25 to 44 were more willing to invest in crypto, while only 36 per cent of those aged 45 and over showed the same interest. At the start of the year, BNY Mellon Investment Management was preparing to launch Singapore’s first retail-oriented fund that invests in the blockchain universe, amid growing interest in crypto assets and related technology among local investors. Thailand and Vietnam have also emerged as hotbeds for retail cryptocurrency investments in south-east Asia, even in the face of a global market rout and tightened regulations imposed on the highly volatile sector. Thailand recorded $135.9bn in crypto value transacted in the 12 months to June 2022, while Vietnam had $112.6bn, according to a report published by blockchain data platform Chainalysis on September 21. Crypto has also drawn interest from high-net-worth individuals, with Cerulli reporting that some private banks and family offices in both Singapore and Hong Kong are “seeing interest in direct crypto investing or crypto ETFs”. There is demand from distributors as well, with Cerulli’s survey indicating that they want asset managers to “develop niche product ideas that offer long-term opportunities, including technology themes such as blockchain and crypto”. ETFs are seen as another way to give even more retail investors access to crypto. Australia has emerged as a regional leader in the crypto ETF space. Australia’s first three cryptocurrency ETFs started trading in May. The Cosmos Purpose Bitcoin Access, 21Shares Bitcoin ETP and 21Shares Ethereum ETP ETFs went live on Australia’s alternative exchange, formerly known as Chi-X Australia, that month. In June, the Hong Kong arm of South Korea’s Samsung Asset Management rolled out what it called the first-ever global blockchain-related ETF in Asia. The Samsung Blockchain Technologies ETF is actively managed and can invest in blockchain-related ETFs, such as cryptocurrency futures ETFs listed in the US. *Ignites Asia is a news service published by FT Specialist for professionals working in the asset management industry.

The blockchain platform has successfully switched from approving transactions via maths problems to crypto holdings, a change known as the Merge. The new “proof of stake” model should reduce energy use by more than 99 per cent. Hailed as a make or break moment for crypto, the Merge has helped to lift ether tokens nearly 50 per cent from their June low point. But prices remain well below last year’s high point. The crypto winter has not broken. Ethereum’s Ether is the second best known digital token after bitcoin. Merging the main network with an ethereum network that already uses proof-of-stake transactions could help to overhaul crypto’s reputation as an environmental disaster. But while the Merge was technically difficult it has not changed much for most ether holders. Energy requirements for the blockchain have been cut but fees have not fallen. Transaction times have not improved. It is possible that the switch to proof of stake will encourage more decentralised-finance applications to run on the ethereum blockchain. Then again, they may wait for future updates designed to expand capacity. Investors remain more fixated on inflation and removing risk from their portfolios. The change could also give more power to validators with a large pool of ether they can put to work, earning a return for “staking” their tokens. Just as proof of work mining benefited groups with access to major computer power, proof of stake will benefit those with an existing haul of tokens. The minimum required stake is 32 ether — equal to just under $48,000. There are risks. Tokens may be confiscated if transactions are invalid and stakes cannot be withdrawn until the next software change, which could be a year away. The really transformative news this week came from Fidelity, Citadel Securities, Schwab and others, who are creating a crypto exchange called EDX Markets.

The launch of the first web browser in 1994 was a turning point for the internet. Now, if crypto enthusiasts are to be believed, the switch by the Ethereum blockchain to a new system for validating transactions — a move known as “the merge” — is an equally historic moment for what has become known as Web3. Moving away from its previous, energy-intensive validation mechanism puts Ethereum on a more sustainable long-term path. For the network that has become the main platform for blockchain-based applications like non-fungible tokens and decentralised finance, that is certainly significant. But nine years after Ethereum was launched, there is still a long way to go. Here are five issues that will help to determine whether or not the merge will one day be seen as a significant moment in the history of the internet. First, the new validation mechanism, known as proof of stake, doesn’t on its own do anything to solve one of Ethereum’s biggest problems: that it can handle only 15 transactions per second (tps), a bottleneck that has led to very high transaction fees. The merge at least clears the way for the network’s next big step, scheduled for the second half of next year. Called “sharding”, this would involve splitting the Ethereum database into 64 fragments. Since every computer on the network would no longer need to keep a record of every transaction, it would greatly increase overall capacity and speed. There are still big, unresolved technical questions about how this will work. Also, sharding will not be a complete solution. A 64-fold increase would lift the network’s capacity to nearly 1,000 tps — still some way off the 7,400 tps capacity of the Visa network. The promise of Web3 is to use blockchain technology to mediate every online interaction, meaning far greater capacity will be needed. Second, the merge brings with it a whole set of unknown risks. Essentially, a market currently worth $200bn is being shifted on to entirely new foundations, with new mechanisms and new roles for market intermediaries that haven’t been tested in real-world conditions. Rather than the risks, many market participants are likely to be more focused on the potential for higher returns. Under the new proof of stake system, holders lodge their ether as collateral to validate transactions in return for “staking rewards”. That has turned a previously unproductive asset into one that now offers a yield — something that many investors are likely to find attractive. But at this stage, it’s anyone’s guess whether the yield will compensate for the new risks — not to mention the huge volatility in the cryptocurrency itself. Third, the build-out of a broader layer of market infrastructure on top of Ethereum is still in its infancy. So-called layer-two networks, like Polygon and Optimism, act as “roll ups”, batching up many individual transactions themselves and lodging only a single entry back on the Ethereum blockchain. Along with sharding, Ethereum’s backers claim this might lift overall capacity to 100,000 tps. The companies that operate on top of Ethereum in this way could themselves become powerful new intermediaries in the blockchain world — something that runs counter to the ideal of decentralisation on which crypto is founded. This leads to the fourth point: as the broader Ethereum system evolves, its backers will have to ditch some of the crypto world’s ideological baggage in favour of a greater pragmatism. The challenge will be to work out which ideals can be compromised in the interests of a more workable system. Recommended The emergence of influential new intermediaries could also give governments a new point of leverage over the system. For instance, if large numbers of holders turn to crypto exchanges for help with staking, then those exchanges would play an important role in validating transactions. That could expose them to political pressure to block certain transactions in pursuit of financial sanctions. Fifth, and finally, improving the underlying blockchain infrastructure will do nothing to solve Web3’s biggest challenge: demonstrating why this technology is needed in the first place. The optimists claim that, with the merge completed and work well under way on solving Ethereum’s scaling challenges, effort will shift increasingly to building the consumer-friendly experiences needed to draw large numbers of users. That means devising things like crypto wallets and marketplaces for digital assets that are easier for ordinary mortals to use. It also means coming up with entirely new applications that could not have worked as well on the existing web. The Ethereum merge doesn’t provide any clues about what those uses might be. But, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, it at least shows that Web3 has got to the end of the beginning. richard.waters@ft.com The capacity of the Visa network has been updated to reflect the most recent figure available.,,Richard Waters,2022-09-15T13:52:01.659Z,

The upgrade, known in the industry as the “Merge”, which changes how new transactions are verified on the Ethereum blockchain, completed on early Thursday, said co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Ethereum powers large swaths of the Web3 world, which includes applications such as digital collectibles and decentralised finance systems. The milestone, which has been promised by developers for many years, was hailed as one of the most significant moments in crypto’s short history by fans, who planned “Merge parties” in cities around the world and followed live-streamed watch parties on social media. “This is the first step in Ethereum’s big journey towards being a very mature system. There are still steps left to go,” Buterin told developers. The Merge marked a high-stakes test for the crypto sector after the crash in token prices this spring wiped $2tn off the value of digital assets and shook faith in the market. Changing the architecture that underpins the $200bn ether cryptocurrency, the flagship token on the Ethereum blockchain, and tens of billions more of related assets and applications is fraught with risks from technical hiccups to squabbles among participants in the decentralised network, even after the Merge was completed. Its backers expect a successful Merge will boost confidence in Ethereum, launched in 2015 by Russian-Canadian programmer Buterin, and the multitude of tokens and projects that run on its blockchain, as well as blunt criticism over its energy consumption. However, Ethereum developers said they would need to monitor the network over the coming hours and days to ensure the upgrade is working smoothly. “It is a complicated task,” said Edouard Hindi, chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund Tyr Capital. “One forgotten fine tune . . . could lead to a lot of volatility, and the market is in a panicky mood.” The Merge represents just one step in a plan sketched out by Ethereum developers to overcome limits on the network’s capacity, which are seen as a major hurdle to achieving mainstream adoption of decentralised finance. “[The Merge] solves one issue but it does not solve a heck of a lot of other issues,” said Lars Seier Christensen, co-founder of Saxo Bank who now runs a blockchain project called Concordium. Ethereum, like bitcoin, has so far relied on network participants solving complex maths problems to validate new blocks, a process called proof of work. Ethereum’s energy consumption was similar to that of Finland. The Merge refers to the moment when the existing Ethereum blockchain linked with a new network where transactions are validated by a group of individuals and corporations that have staked their own tokens as collateral for the security of the network, a system called proof of stake. Critical intelligence on the digital asset industry. Explore the FT’s coverage here. The Ethereum Foundation estimates that replacing proof of work will cut the blockchain’s energy consumption by about 99.95 per cent. It will also eliminate the need for Ethereum miners, companies that make money from validating new blocks via proof of work. Anticipation of the Merge has helped boost the price of ether, which has risen about 75 per cent from its low point in June. The token also gained ground against bitcoin, which has recovered just 15 per cent over the same period. Ether declined 5.9 per cent to $1,501 after the Merge late on Thursday. However, the years-long effort to complete the upgrade underscored the difficulty of making improvements to the Ethereum blockchain. Transactions on the network are still hampered by slow speed and high costs, which critics have said limits the system’s ability to grow. Hindi said the Merge was “just one step in the right direction. There are three or four more steps. It is a two- or three-year process. It’s a big, big plan that is being rolled out and we will have a lot of surprises on the way, good and bad ones.” Click here to visit Digital Assets dashboard,,Joshua Oliver,2022-09-15T07:40:35.388Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/f56c48ef-b3ea-4bc4-afbb-2773253a3dd4,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Hedge funds race to bet on outcome of Ethereum ‘Merge’,Laying wager on rise in ether price becomes ‘one of most crowded trades in crypto history’,The looming switch of the Ethereum blockchain to a new, greener system has sparked a frenzy of trading by hedge funds racing to place bets ahead of one of the biggest events in the short history of cryptocurrencies. Traders have been scooping up options on ether tokens — the flagship crypto coin trading on Ethereum — betting on price volatility or protecting themselves against sudden sharp moves ahead of the “Merge”. The Merge has been a long-awaited event in the crypto industry and will change how new transactions are verified on the Ethereum blockchain. A clutch of traders are wagering the switch to a new system will slash the network’s energy consumption as much as 99 per cent, opening up ether tokens to mainstream investors who have until now been wary of a network with an energy usage roughly equivalent to that of Finland. “This has been one of the most crowded trades in crypto history,” said James West, chief executive of Globe Exchange, a crypto derivatives exchange. Many of the trades have been placed in the options market, where West said “a lot of smart money [is] buying”, with many expecting that a successful switch will push ether prices higher. The total number of outstanding option contracts on exchange Deribit, which accounts for 97 per cent of ether options open interest on exchanges, has risen from 1.2mn at the start of the year to more than 4.6mn by Wednesday. About 80 per cent of these contracts are call options — a bet on a higher price in which an investor has the ability to buy ether at a fixed price for a set period of time — while the remainder are puts, or bets on lower prices. It’s a sign of “massive bullish sentiment”, according to Deribit chief commercial officer Luuk Strijers. Some even believe the Merge could help ether supplant bitcoin as the world’s biggest cryptocurrency. The total value of bitcoin in circulation is $390bn, compared with less than $200bn for ether, according to the FT Wilshire Digital Assets Dashboard. “The mere anticipation of ether overtaking bitcoin” could become “self-fulfilling and unstoppable”, said Anders Kvamme Jensen, co-fund manager of the AKJ Digital Assets fund, who said funds he invests in are betting on the Merge using options. Some investors have, meanwhile, been constructing options trades to try to profit from potentially huge price volatility from the Merge, regardless of whether that price move is up or down, Strijers said. But such has been the industry hype around the Merge, other traders had set up strategies that bet the price of ether would rise sharply before the event but then sell off if the Merge happened. As a result, some bought shorter-term call options paying out if ether hit $2,500 and funded that by selling longer-dated calls paying out at $3,000, according to Ed Hindi, chief investment officer at hedge fund Tyr Capital, who acts as a market maker in crypto options. However, that trade has not played out as expected. While the price of ether has rallied from less than $1,000 in June to $1,600 this week, that is still some way short of where the shorter-term options would pay out. Fearing they could now be hit if ether rises sharply after the Merge and trigger the options they sold, traders have been racing to cover their positions, according to Hindi. Recommended The market has been “way too bullish” ahead of the Merge, and “way too bearish beyond the Merge”, he said. Many investors already holding ether have tried to protect themselves from a sell-off if the Merge does not pan out, for instance if it is delayed or there are technical problems, by also using futures contracts to bet that its price will decline. This type of trade, known as shorting, effectively protects them from price movements. According to Kaiko Research, the so-called funding rate, a measure of the direction of traders’ collective futures positions, in ether is at its lowest level in more than a year, averaging minus 0.6 per cent. That usually signals that investors are focused on going short. Traders are also hoping that this bet of holding ether while shorting the futures could allow them to pick up some extra tokens, while protecting them from market volatility. Investors who hold ether when the Merge occurs are entitled to tokens that are still based on the older transaction processing system, known as proof of work. While the Merge is set to move Ethereum to the more energy-efficient proof of stake model, some market participants who oppose the change will continue operating on the old system — something known as a “fork” — meaning those coins may hold some of their value. Jay Janer, founding partner of KPTL Arbitrage Management in the Cayman Islands, is running this trade because he believes trading the options has become too expensive. “If the fork occurs, we would get the proof of work token for free,” he said.

https://www.ft.com/content/88518bc5-3af4-41c3-99b5-c0cd0ba69ab9,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,The Merge: a blockchain revolution or just more hype?,Ethereum’s switch to a greener system is seen by crypto enthusiasts as a long-awaited chance to prove critics wrong,At the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto in early August, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin stood before an excitable audience to deliver some big news. “The Merge is coming,” he told the crowd, “this effort that we have been working on for basically the last eight years . . . Ethereum will finally become a proof-of-stake system . . . Yay!” The audience cheered. If there is one thing the crypto community has in good supply, it’s promises. In the relatively short history of digital assets — starting with bitcoin in 2009 — evangelists have trailed a list of innovations that, they say, could solve inflation, revolutionise business, or provide a financial lifeline to people living under authoritarian regimes around the world. In response, critics of the largely unregulated industry have highlighted its links to criminal activity and huge carbon footprint, not to mention the financial ruin it has brought to many vulnerable people — the same ones industry representatives often claim they want to help. The faithful now have an opportunity to prove their critics wrong. On the horizon is arguably crypto’s most ambitious project yet, dubbed “the Merge”. The term describes the moment when the Ethereum blockchain will merge with a system called the Beacon Chain. Ethereum is the most popular platform for parts of the Web3 — or “new internet” —world that have tried to enter the mainstream, such as NFTs and decentralised finance. When the Merge happens, probably sometime this week, the stage will be set for innovations intended to address some of the harshest attacks on the industry. These are high stakes for a project that most people outside the crypto world have never heard of — and that many who have only vaguely understand. If the fusion goes off without a hitch, Ethereum will shift from a “proof-of-work” system to one known as “proof of stake”. Proof-of-work systems such as the bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains are kept secure by powerful computers. These “nodes” race against each other 24/7 to solve complex mathematical calculations in order to validate each new block of transactions added to the chain. The system defends against individual nodes being able to corrupt the blockchain, but it also demands an immense amount of energy to run. That translates to a carbon footprint too big for environmentalists and crypto-sceptics to stomach. By contrast, in a proof-of-stake system such as the one Ethereum is moving to, the blockchain doesn’t need powerful computers for its security. Instead, individuals or companies act as the validators, staking their own ether tokens (the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain) as collateral against bad behaviour. They are incentivised to do so by rewards, including the chance to earn fresh ether. You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser. Some see the Merge as a historic moment that will take crypto mainstream by drastically reducing the industry’s levels of energy consumption — the Ethereum blockchain’s annual level is currently estimated to be as high as that of Finland. “This is a pretty critical step for the infrastructure to actually scale, in order for Ethereum to become what it can become — a 24/7, global permissionless capital market,” says Avichal Garg, partner at early stage venture firm Electric Capital. Noam Hurwitz, a software engineer at Web3 development platform Alchemy, describes it as “the biggest milestone to date of proof [the developers] can execute on their road map”. But to others, the shift represents a betrayal of the blockchain’s fundamental characteristics — to be an open, transparent and decentralised network, self-policing by design and controlled by no group of individuals. The Merge will not revolutionise the whole Web3 world, and it will not directly solve many of the biggest problems facing the Ethereum blockchain, such as high transaction fees and slow transaction speeds. Still, after years of talk, a successful Merge at least sets the scene for future innovation, particularly by allowing the Ethereum blockchain to scale and handle heavier workloads. This is good news for the applications that build their businesses on the blockchain, such as the NFT marketplace OpenSea, or decentralised crypto exchanges like Uniswap. Charles Storry, head of growth at crypto index platform Phuture, who works in the niche worlds of decentralised finance and Web3 tech, is full of optimism. It “is massive for Ethereum and the wider crypto community, because it unlocks new applications which wouldn’t be possible in the existing system, increases scalability and radically improves Ethereum energy efficiency,” he says. “We’re just getting started.” Despite the hype, whether the Merge really heralds the mainstreaming of crypto projects is a matter of serious doubt. This year’s turmoil in crypto markets has tainted the mood: a crash in coin prices wiped about $2tn off the total value of cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based ventures have been caught in its wake. Some of the biggest companies in the sector have declared bankruptcy this summer, including hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and lending platform Celsius. Tumbling valuations in the tech world have also threatened to reach deeper into the crypto and fintech sectors. Ethereum is not the only blockchain in town. Others — such as the bitcoin blockchain — will still use proof-of-work systems after the Merge. According to estimates by Cambridge university, the bitcoin blockchain consumes so much energy that if it were a country, it would rank in the world’s top 35 by energy consumption, surpassing Belgium and Finland. So why does the Merge matter if other blockchains are still guzzling energy and harming the environment? Alex de Vries, founder of the website Digiconomist, claims the Merge could shed approximately 99 per cent of Ethereum’s current energy consumption. Even if bitcoin’s dirty climate record is set to continue, de Vries argues any progress towards greening the industry is better than none: “You can’t say we have cleaned up cryptocurrency when the biggest polluter is still out there . . . but I would say this is a massive step forward at the very least . . . the outside world also needs to see that this is possible.” Many of the “second layer” projects that are built on the Ethereum blockchain (such as NFTs and decentralised finance platforms) will also be affected. “It makes Ethereum greener, which is important because that has actually been a stumbling block to adoption,” says Alkesh Shah, crypto and digital asset strategist at Bank of America. “Many people [who would otherwise] use those digital assets don’t because of the energy use and the negatives for the environment.” “It’s going to dramatically reduce the carbon footprint for the whole industry,” says Ilan Solot, a partner at venture capital firm Tagus Capital. Should the Merge successfully inoculate Ethereum against criticism from environmentalists, pressure will grow on its main rival, bitcoin. If one of the two most prominent blockchains can ditch its dirty reputation, why not the other? Ethereum core developer Preston Van Loon, who co-founded Prysmatic Labs, a team of software engineers dedicated to building the Ethereum blockchain, says the Merge cannot come soon enough. “Proof of stake has been coming soon since 2016 . . . it’s almost a meme at this point,” he says. “I feel like [the energy cost] is really a barrier to global scale, people are not going to use it if they know it has such expensive energy costs.” The carbon footprint problem has been a persistent hurdle to efforts to push blockchain technology to mainstream users, says Ryan Wyatt, former head of gaming at YouTube who now runs blockchain gaming company Polygon Studios. The Merge “really does away with that in its entirety,” he says. “You can then focus on what the other points of friction are for onboarding the next billion users into Web3.” But others in the industry say Ethereum’s problems with slow transactions and high fees will continue to disqualify the blockchain from driving any kind of Web3 revolution. “I don’t understand this insistence of using something [Ethereum] that at its core, doesn’t work very well,” says Lars Seier Christensen, co-founder of Saxo Bank who now runs a proof-of-stake blockchain called Concordium. What is more, there is no guarantee the Merge will even work from a technical perspective. The process has already been set in motion and will happen once a pre-determined target on the blockchain is reached — currently expected to happen as early as Tuesday. The Merge will be gradual, more like the sun coming up than switching on a light. “It’s almost like changing the engines on a plane whilst flying it . . . a significant engineering feat,” says Edward Machin, a senior lawyer in Ropes & Gray’s data, privacy and cyber security practice. Even if the big moment does come off without a hitch, there are plenty of risks that lie in wait. The first is a theoretical one: dubbed the “51 per cent attack”. Post-Merge, the Ethereum blockchain will be secured by a group of individuals by virtue of the ether tokens they have staked. That means, in theory, that any group or individual who gains control of 51 per cent or more of the staked ether on the blockchain would effectively control the system. It is an unlikely scenario — not least because it would probably be prohibitively expensive to own over half the staked ether on the blockchain. But also because an attacker would lose their staked holdings if they tried to meddle with the chain. “I would think smaller blockchains may have a higher risk for that,” says Shah. Recommended Still, the danger is there and crypto sceptics have witnessed enough hacks and collapses not to dismiss it. “It’s a high stakes test . . . The hackers aren’t going to come out until it’s live,” says crypto critic and angel investor Liron Shapira. Another critic, software engineer Stephen Diehl, says it is dangers such as these that make people who are considering investing in crypto markets think twice, because “there is this underlying platform risk where, unlike [with] physical commodities, crypto assets can simply cease to exist due to technical black swan events.” A more immediate problem is the tail risk of a whole series of market mechanisms that have yet to be tested in the wild. “Humans are pretty bad at pricing tail risk. I think most people are probably not thinking about [it], and there are a lot of risks here,” says Garg of Electric Capital. The most urgent concern for many Ethereum backers is the existential question that proof of stake presents to “decentralisation” — a sacred tenet among advocates of blockchains. According to DeFi Llama, a popular analytics website, the Ethereum blockchain holds over 50 per cent of the total value of the decentralised finance industry, which champions direct peer-to-peer transactions and is meant to remove all need for third-party intermediaries such as banks or brokers. Like other blockchains, Ethereum is meant to be censorship-resistant. Its design is supposed to hold out against powerful individuals or entities seeking to exert control over other participants. But in its new guise, safeguarded by a collection of individuals or companies, Ethereum loses that autonomy. “You have what is a shining beacon of decentralisation but in a new model it will be more centralised than people think,” says Machin. This problem has become clearer since the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac) last month imposed sanctions against Tornado Cash, an Ethereum-based platform that the government accused of facilitating billions-worth of laundered crypto. The staunchest of crypto’s libertarian army had said the heavy hand of government would prove ineffective against the kinds of “smart contracts” — computer software designed to automate transactions — that run on decentralised platforms. Yet, sanctions have proved effective after all. In the weeks since Tornado Cash was targeted, transactions on the platform nosedived. That worry is bound to cross the minds of Ethereum’s future guardians, including exchanges Binance and Coinbase, and staking platform Lido Finance. According to Nansen data, these companies are already some of the biggest Ethereum staking players around, and thus will be trusted to secure the network post-Merge. Last month, Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong said his exchange would likely quit the staking business before censoring the network. As guardians of the Ethereum network, these entities will have to decide whether or not to validate and process blocks of transactions that may contain transactions coming from entities under sanctions such as Tornado Cash. That hardly sounds like the censorship-resistant utopia envisioned by the idealists — although critics of bitcoin point out that the concentration of miners (who are overwhelmingly based in certain countries such as the US and Russia) in that blockchain also amounts to a centralised system. If the Merge does usher in a new era of centralisation, those idealists may have to pack their bags and leave. “If people are worried . . . OK, great, go somewhere else,” says Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at asset management firm Arca. There is another reason for optimism: since July, the price of ether — as well as of other popular cryptocurrencies — has partly rebounded, giving investors some respite following a turbulent few months. When BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, launched a bitcoin private trust last month, it signalled that the beleaguered industry might already be repositioning itself for the next bull market cycle. If the price of digital assets — and, more specifically, ether — should revive, then it is likely that the post-Merge Ethereum blockchain will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of another crypto bull run. “I like to call it the lazy man’s ETF,” says Dorman. “By owning ether, you now have exposure to stablecoins, you have exposure to NFTs, you have exposure to decentralised finance.” Even so, Dorman is not convinced that wider interest in decentralised finance will necessarily follow from the Merge. That, he feels, is “a separate conversation”. “Do [people] want to take loans through [DeFi] rather than walking into a bank? Do people want to trade digital collectibles rather than traditional baseball cards or stamps? All those factors, user growth, transaction growth, volume growth, those are independent of the Merge,” he says. Ultimately, answers to these questions will become clear once the Merge happens. Plenty of dry-run merges have taken place on “testnets” — essentially non-live blockchains — the most recent just last month. But there’s nothing quite like the real thing.

https://www.ft.com/content/1f795e5d-c2cf-4e91-89f1-6d5544a8a3db,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Crypto and climate change: can web3 help get us to net zero?,New tech ventures want to use blockchain to clean up a messy carbon market — but critics fear more greenwashing,Last year, a British oil exploration company and a tech start-up joined forces on a project to permanently lock away untapped fossil fuel reserves in Greenland. The idea was simple: the energy company, Greenland Gas and Oil, would not extract oil from an area on the east coast that it had exploration licences for. Instead it would monetise keeping the oil in the ground via a partnership with the tech company, Carbonbase, which works on offsetting carbon emissions. The mechanics were more complex. The partnership aimed to sell NFTs, digital collectibles that come with ownership certificates, linked to the unexplored land. The profits would then be used in part to compensate the energy company and the oil would stay underground. And, since the Greenland government had stopped issuing new exploration licences, the energy company would not be able to simply apply for another and tap a different part of the country. The pitch to buyers was that they could be sure their NFT investment was doing some environmental good. The tokens would also be paired with a new type of “non-production” carbon credit the venture hoped to develop, which owners could use to compensate for their own emissions. But, after months of discussions, the partnership ran into problems. Carbonbase and Greenland Gas and Oil did not agree on how to structure the joint venture. Carbonbase also discovered that the country of Greenland had never successfully produced any oil, a fact that they said undermined the whole idea. Pursuing the project “would have destroyed our public reputation” and looked like “greenwashing”, says Max Song, founder of Carbonbase. Eric Sondergaard, chief operating officer at Greenland Gas and Oil, concedes the scheme was not “perfect” and that it would have been better if an oil producing company was “turning off the flow of oil or gas from a wellhead”. But, he says, it was easier for a group not yet tapping reserves to win investor backing for such a proposal: “once the [oil] development wheels are in motion, it is harder to convince shareholders to opt for a blockchain alternative.” The attempt is just one example in a mass of tech ventures that hope to fuse concerns about global warming with the public’s interest in Web3 technology. A surfeit of start-ups have burst on to the scene this year, variously promising to “green” bitcoin, make NFTs sustainable and solve niggling problems in carbon markets once and for all. These projects range from the relatively mundane to the outlandish and wacky, with interest coming from major corporations as well as fringe groups. One River Digital Asset Management launched “the world’s first carbon-neutral crypto asset fund” last year, while the world’s largest meatpacking group, JBS, has developed a blockchain platform to trace its cattle supply chain in an effort to combat deforestation. Diamond miner De Beers is using blockchain technology to track the provenance of its gems. Many new initiatives focus on the booming market for carbon offsets — each of which is supposed to represent a tonne of carbon permanently removed or avoided from the atmosphere. They have soared in popularity in the past 18 months as companies seek to compensate for their emissions. WeWork founder Adam Neumann’s venture Flowcarbon, which received funding from Andreessen Horowitz earlier this year, is one of a range of efforts to produce carbon tokens, which can either be used to compensate for emissions like traditional carbon credits or traded on certain crypto exchanges. The trend for “tokenising” carbon offsets, or converting them into the sort of fungible, digital tokens familiar to crypto traders has been notable: millions of credits have been digitised since late 2021. Used well, analysts say Web3 technologies could bring greater integrity to the carbon market and help verify the credentials of products labelled as “sustainable”. But critics say complicated new initiatives could just as easily exacerbate existing problems in two unregulated markets (offsets and crypto finance), lure more people into a space with its own big emissions problem, and contribute to more greenwashing. William Pazos, cofounder of AirCarbon Exchange, says some new groups are not displaying “the level of rigour that’s necessary” to come up with credible climate solutions. “They are ticking the boxes: the climate box, the blockchain box — all these buzzwords that potentially could make them very wealthy.” It was only a matter of time before advocates of blockchain — the distributed digital ledgers on which cryptocurrencies run and that have been hailed as solutions to everything from poverty to identity theft — turned to climate change. These supporters say the technology, which keeps an unchangeable record of transactions, can bring greater clarity to the messy market for carbon offsets. “Distributed ledgers are going to help with transparency” and with tracking the purchase and use of credits, says James Cameron, policy adviser at Systemiq, the advisory group. Carbon-crypto initiatives might also be a way for retail buyers, who have traditionally found it difficult to buy offsets, to access the market. But Pete Howson, who researches environmental technologies at the UK’s Northumbria University, says he fears some tech pioneers “don’t understand the way the carbon market works”. The sector is notoriously complicated, with its own well-rehearsed problems: a lack of liquidity, opaque pricing and concerns about the quality of credits. Since the late 1990s the decentralised market has only become more complicated as it has grown. Thousands of projects that generate offsets exist, such as tree planting schemes that can sell credits either directly to end users or via middlemen. Different project types are governed by various complex rules, set by one of a number of third-party carbon offset standard setters such as Verra. Some offsets are of a reliable quality, but others may not deliver the climate benefits they promise. That makes it hard for non-experts to know what to buy, who to buy from and what to pay. The blockchain community is the latest to take up the gauntlet. Tokenising credits has become a popular starting point. The process can involve some mystifying jargon, but the goal tends to be the same: the creation of digital versions of existing offsets that are simpler for people to understand, more liquid and transparently priced. Carbon tokens have been launched by companies including Toucan, JustCarbon and Moss.Earth. Hype about the prospect of the tokens has bubbled up on social media. But the tokens have also drawn the attention of corporate investors: last year Anthony Scaramucci’s alternative investment firm SkyBridge Capital bought nearly 40,000 of Moss.Earth’s tokens to offset the “historic carbon footprint” of its bitcoin holdings. Adrian Rimmer, cofounder of JustCarbon, says the design of carbon tokens is easier for non-expert buyers to understand than the traditional offset market, which he describes as “horrible”. “It requires an unfeasibly large amount of knowledge,” he says. And while traditional offsets can come from thousands of different environmental projects and are difficult to compare, each of the new digital tokens on offer — JustCarbon’s JCRs or Moss.Earth’s MCO2s, for example — are uniform and trade at the same price. Each company decides on a range of offsets, such as any from forestry schemes, that can be converted into its standardised token. Not everyone is convinced. Louis Redshaw, managing director of carbon consultancy Redshaw Advisors, says adding another layer of complexity to the already confusing carbon market is probably “not making it better”. Blockchain may be no more useful for elucidating the process than “a good spreadsheet”, he says. Redshaw insists the complicated nature of many projects is reason enough to be wary: “If you can’t understand what it is you’re getting into you shouldn’t get into it,” he says. Steve Zwick, a senior media relations manager for Verra, the offsets registry, says creating standardised tokens from a broad category of offsets masks key information, such as which project a credit came from. Such details are important, since some offsets are of dubious quality. “That transparency element is critical, especially now with new buyers coming in. You’ve got to make sure the labelling is right,” says Zwick. Critical intelligence on the digital asset industry. Explore the FT’s coverage here. While buyers of Moss.Earth’s tokens know they are underpinned by credits from a list of forest protection schemes published by the company, they do not know which specific project a given token is linked to. The group said its design ensured token fungibility. Last year Vaughan Lindsay, chief executive of offset seller Climate Impact Partners, told the Financial Times that efforts to make credits fungible “remind me of collateralised debt instruments . . . If you keep rolling stuff up, you have no idea what you’re buying.” Another risk is the temptation to use the tokens for financial speculation. Offsets are supposed to be bought to compensate for specific emissions, rather than endlessly traded. But the owners of tokenised credits can easily be swept up in the powerful currents of decentralised finance. Verra banned the tokenisation of certain credits in May. In August it launched a consultation about designing “anti-fraud measures” for crypto-carbon — new rules that could allow tokenisation to resume. Toucan’s tokens soared in popularity at the end of last year, largely because buyers can convert them into a new cryptocurrency, Klima. But experts pointed out that many of the millions of credits underpinning Toucan’s tokens had remained unsold for years due to quality concerns. Toucan said it had tightened up its rules about which credits could be tokenised. “If people are bundling credits and selling them, what’s important is the underlying credit,” says William McDonnell, chief operating officer of the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market, an industry group that is drawing up rules for what constitutes a “good” credit. “Whether it’s tokenised or not, what’s important is the quality of the credits.” Fiorenzo Manganiello, a professor of blockchain technologies at Geneva Business School, warned of scams targeting those looking for “green” crypto. “I’ve been approached three or four times by people saying they’re selling ‘green’” tokens they claimed were backed by carbon credits, he says. “In reality, they [looked like] a pump-and-dump scheme.” Then there is the broader threat posed by a turbulent crypto market, which crashed this year. The value of Toucan’s “BCT” tokens fell from a high of nearly $9 last year to around $1.50 in August. Moss.Earth’s MCO2s dropped from more than $17 in January to under $4 this month, while JustCarbon’s JCR moved from nearly $40 in May to around $24 in August. The crypto-climate crossover goes beyond carbon tokens. Shoppers can now participate in metaverses where they are encouraged to purchase virtual versions of fashion items such as clothing, instead of buying in the real world. Conservation-linked cryptocurrencies are also appearing, such as one developed by Estonia-based Single.Earth. The group generates “Merit” tokens, which landowners earn each time they store 100kg of carbon in their forests. Their woodland must be at least 20 years old to be eligible, and Single.Earth monitors the process using satellites and machine learning. However, since there is no penalty for landowners who later cut down the trees, except that they do not earn more tokens, the stored carbon could be released back into the atmosphere. Merit Valdsalu, Single.Earth co-founder, concedes this is a concern, but says she hopes the prospect of earning more tokens will incentivise landowners to keep trees standing. The elephant in the room is the energy consumption involved in many crypto and blockchain transactions. Minting bitcoin, for example, requires huge computing power, which often runs on coal-generated electricity. That issue is drawing more attention. This year, the US Office of Science and Technology Policy called for evidence on the energy and climate implications of digital assets. Enthusiasts have pushed back against this characterisation of crypto, arguing that many coins and blockchains are much less energy intensive than bitcoin. But the perception of digital assets as a gas-guzzling, carbon generating problem is so prevalent that an NFT auction by the UK arm of conservation charity WWF was abruptly cancelled in February following a backlash. Despite such criticisms, many analysts do see a role for digital technologies in the fight against climate change and are encouraged by the interest in sustainability from some in the crypto community. The “recognition of the energy conundrum by major players . . . could signal a turning point for the crypto market in adapting greener algorithms,” wrote HSBC analyst Camila Sarmiento. Banks and exchanges are exploring a middle ground between the traditional carbon market and the crypto-carbon crossover. AirCarbon Exchange has designed smart contracts that could allow credits to be sold in smaller quantities than one tonne of carbon. That could be useful for people making small, regular purchases, such as offsetting a taxi trip, says Pazos. “Just like we see calorie counts on food [packaging], we’re going to see carbon counts on all types of different activities.” Lenders including NatWest, Standard Chartered and BNP Paribas have developed a blockchain-based settlement platform, Carbonplace, which aims to make buying offsets simpler and enhance the traceability of transactions. Buyers receive tokens representing credit ownership, which include the details of the offsets — not digital versions of the credits. Even the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has taken an interest: it supported the creation of the Climate Chain Coalition initiative in 2017, which works to “advance blockchain . . . and related digital solutions” to mobilise climate finance and action on climate. But for now, the proliferation of new companies and the “low barriers to launching new projects” make it “hard to understand who you want to work with,” says Claudia Herbert, from the advisory group Carbon Direct. “We’re seeing the lessons of the [real-world offsets market] being relearnt.” Where climate change meets business, markets and politics.

https://www.ft.com/content/8292ae50-690f-41e5-9d67-5721fc2587e8,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Silicon Valley should spare us the guff about doing good,It ought to be OK to say that the purpose of business is to make money,If you believe the spin, the reason that Andreessen Horowitz — or a16z — is betting billions of dollars on the chimerical, crypto-powered idea of “Web3” is because the current version of the internet, “Web2”, gives too much money and power to Big Tech, and not enough to users. You might wonder whether one of Silicon Valley’s biggest venture capital funds might themselves be trying to grab as much money and power as they can but no, really, it’s you they care about. “My hope is through Web3, we can return to . . . a much more decentralised distribution of power and control,” Chris Dixon, head of the firm’s $7.6bn crypto fund, told the FT’s Tech Tonic podcast. “Facebook, Instagram . . . They figured out a way to have other people create their content and take basically all of the money,” he said. This is bemusing. Isn’t a16z at the very heart of Big Tech, having massively profited from Web2? Is co-founder Marc Andreessen not still on the board of Meta — the company that owns both Facebook and Instagram — and doesn’t he still own millions of dollars’ worth of shares in it? And anyway, isn’t the whole point of venture capital to generate returns? Why does this company — and the tech sector more broadly — feel the need to insist that their raison d’être is saving the world, when in reality they are simply out to make as much money as they can? Shouldn’t it be OK to say that? Dixon in fact went still further. Web3, he said, wouldn’t just follow the old Google mantra of “Don’t be evil” — which was quietly abandoned a few years ago — because this relies on fallible human beings sticking to it. Making the internet run on blockchains instead, and introducing new financial incentives in the form of crypto tokens, would actually somehow mean this idea was built into the system: “That’s a very, very important concept in Web3: ‘can’t be evil’ instead of ‘don’t be evil’.” Now this, of course, is a farcical idea, as a quick glance at some of the projects that a16z’s crypto fund has invested in can demonstrate. While Dixon insists that in this new vision of the internet, “data is controlled by users”, one of his investments, Worldcoin, has been collecting biometric data from people in developing countries in return for crypto tokens and has been accused of deceptive marketing. Worldcoin’s chief executive told BuzzFeed News that the company “will improve” communication and marketing. The extractive practices of a more mainstream investment, Coinbase, helped the crypto exchange rake in $3.6bn of profits in 2021. The truth is that the lofty claims made by a16z are part of a have-your-cake-and-eat-it culture that we have all helped create. We so demonised the “vampire squid” banks in the aftermath of the financial crisis that the business of making money became seen as ugly and immoral. Cue young business school graduates — the young are the most likely to demand a job with “purpose” — shunning investment banking for Silicon Valley, which offered them not only free beers and ping pong tables, but the chance to feel they were making a difference. “Big Tech was saying ‘we’re better than finance’,” says Martin Walker, director of banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management. “They were more socially conscious and you could get all kinds of stuff for free . . . but what we have learnt is that Big Tech does not give away things for nothing. They’re either trying to build monopolies or they’re trying to extract value from people in some other way.” Since the explosion of ESG, too, investors want to be told they are putting their money into projects that are doing good — whether or not that is true is somewhat beside the point. Recommended What this all means is that companies are spending more of their resources on optics, leaving them with less time and money to focus on doing something that might actually be of value. We live in a society so obsessed with how things appear that in the US today there are more than six “flacks” — as my profession affectionately calls PRs — for every journalist. Further, by creating the expectation that companies must tell us they exist to do good in the world rather than to turn a profit, we are making them better at telling us lies. That makes it harder to tell fact from fiction, and thus to hold these firms to account. From the giants of Silicon Valley to the grifters of the crypto casino, the world of tech should try being a little more honest with itself and with the rest of us. We should allow them to tell it to us straight — if we don’t, we are complicit in building a culture that does not value the truth, and in which the critical line between reality and fakery become increasingly blurred. jemima.kelly@ft.com,,Jemima Kelly,2022-08-24T16:42:34.368Z,

Not by investing directly in volatile cryptocurrencies, mind. Abrdn, the UK investment group, recently bought a stake in digital assets exchange Archax. BlackRock is opening direct access for clients to crypto exchange Coinbase. Schwab has launched a crypto-linked exchange traded fund. Sceptics will say asset managers are scrambling to exploit an immature, speculative market, when unwary customers betting on cryptocurrencies are still vulnerable to hype or even fraud. Underlining the risks, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, a big Canadian pension fund manager, has written off what it conceded was a premature investment in bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius Network. BlackRock’s chief executive Larry Fink was an early bitcoin critic, opening him to charges of, at best, inconsistency. But when he was sniping at bitcoin in 2017, crypto’s foundations were more fragile than now. It is hardly surprising that companies such as BlackRock, which is also developing a spot bitcoin trust for institutional clients, should look to cater to new groups of investors. Asset managers need to be open to multiple futures of finance. Cryptocurrency could become a legitimate way of hedging sophisticated investors’ portfolios, like other alternative assets such as wine or gold. It could still pay to have some exposure. But whether or not cryptocurrencies recover their earlier levels, the history of markets suggests that something useful usually remains after bubbles burst. By investing in the market’s superstructure now, asset managers can also prepare for the possible advent of central bank digital currencies, which offer some of the promised upside of crypto with the security of backing from central banks. They are improving their understanding of the underlying technology, such as blockchain. And they may put themselves in a position to hire innovative and fintech-adept young staff made redundant by shrinking crypto companies. In other words, it is perfectly possible to embrace the technology, entrepreneurial spirit and innovation of crypto while remaining at arm’s length from the asset class itself. As for ordinary investors, the growing ties between high finance and crypto seem a step away from digital currencies’ origins as a tool for tearing down the establishment. But at least by filtering their investment through orthodox institutions, they limit their exposure to theft and fraud. Even so, cryptocurrencies are still broadly unsupervised, hold the potential to contribute to wider market instability and are a risky home for the savings of retail investors used to more solid regulatory protection. Recommended The obvious solution is to put in place firm guardrails, as this newspaper has repeatedly suggested. Unfortunately, different agencies and countries have divergent attitudes. Financial entrepreneurs and innovators will naturally seek to exploit such differences. For example, crypto companies are lobbying to ensure cryptocurrencies are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates derivatives, rather than the more hawkish Securities and Exchange Commission. In what remains a buyer-beware market, asset managers’ involvement provides a thin layer of additional security. Their interest could bolster surviving crypto companies that wish to win access to institutional clients. But with asset managers’ power comes a responsibility to help the crypto market grow up, and to help protect more vulnerable investors while it does.,,The editorial board,2022-08-21T10:00:35.019Z,

Critics say blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are too energy-intensive to play a role in finance. The riposte of ethereum developers is The Merge. They aim to combine the main ethereum blockchain network with another system to slash power consumption. The Merge promises to edge digital assets, whose prices have taken a battering, closer to the financial mainstream. A successful dress rehearsal in August means the change could take place in coming weeks. Like bitcoin, ethereum uses a proof-of-work model in which complicated equations must be solved in order to unlock new digital tokens or validate transactions. This drains a great deal of computer power. Estimates of energy consumption vary. But bitcoin is reckoned to use as much as 150 terawatt hours yearly, 0.65 per cent of the global energy supply. Ethereum would burn up about 75 Twh annually. The Merge means ethereum will shift to proof-of-stake in which users verify transactions using their existing assets. This requires less power — 99.95 per cent less according to community-created information site ethereum.org. Token owners can invest their capital via staking, loaning out digital assets to validate transactions. The annual return for staking is about 3.85 per cent on proof-of-stake blockchain network Solana, according to estimates from Coinbase, a crypto platform. Ethereum, a larger network with more transactions, could provide higher returns. Ethereum.org predicts 7 per cent. Ethereum’s digital token ether is the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin. However, the gap is substantial. Ether’s market value is about half of bitcoin’s, according to data from CoinGecko. Like all cryptocurrencies, the price has retreated from a record high last year as interest rate rises reduce demand for risky assets. It is down 60 per cent from its high point, just below bitcoin’s 65 per cent drop. The Merge could reduce the gap by propelling ether’s price. It jumped more than a tenth after a test network completed a simulation of the switch planned for the main network. The update has been delayed before. Even if it occurs, not everyone plans to adopt it. Some miners who stand to lose out are making plans to run the old version of ethereum — something known as a fork. But such a move will not be widely supported. Reducing crypto’s energy use is a widely shared goal. What does the future hold for digital currencies?

https://www.ft.com/content/0948f1a9-ad0b-4126-9ae8-5ce4e212c07e,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,BlackRock pushes into crypto market with bitcoin private trust,Asset manager to offer investment vehicle only to institutional clients in the US,BlackRock has announced the launch of a spot bitcoin private trust, deepening a push into digital assets as the crypto industry is recovering from the fallout of a credit crisis. The world’s largest asset manager said in a blog post on Thursday that the private trust would be available only to institutional clients in the US, but gave few other details. US regulators have repeatedly rejected proposals to offer spot bitcoin exchange traded funds that would be open to retail investors, citing the need for investor protections. The move by BlackRock potentially puts the investment house, whose chief executive Larry Fink has publicly criticised bitcoin, into competition with Grayscale, the world’s biggest investment vehicle for cryptocurrencies. It comes as the crypto industry deals with the fallout of an acute drop in the price of assets such as bitcoin, which has lost two-thirds of its value since its all-time high last November. The total market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies dropped from around $3.2tn to less than $1tn in that time. “Despite the steep downturn in the digital asset market, we are still seeing substantial interest from some institutional clients in how to efficiently and cost-effectively access these assets using our technology and product capabilities,” BlackRock said in a statement. “The launch of BlackRock’s bitcoin fund is a sign of how far crypto has matured as an asset class,” said Sui Chung, chief executive of crypto index provider CF Benchmarks. Earlier this week BlackRock agreed to join its Aladdin investment technology platform to Coinbase, the crypto exchange. The network is widely used in the fund management industry to link asset managers, insurers and banks to markets. Other fund managers are also dipping their toes into the crypto market. In recent months Schroders picked up a stake in the crypto-focused fund manager Forteus while Fidelity announced it would allow investors to add cryptocurrencies to their portfolios in 401(k) retirement schemes. Recommended However, BlackRock’s pivot to digital assets marks a significant evolution from previous comments made by Fink. In 2017, the chief executive said “bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world”, adding “that’s all it is”. BlackRock’s bitcoin embrace also follows the firm’s previous calls for global environmental, social and governance standards in a bid to bolster sustainability efforts. Bitcoin — which runs on an energy-intensive blockchain system — has been criticised for its carbon footprint and broader impact on the environment. What does the future hold for digital currencies?

Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Friday In crypto land, breathless pitches about technologies that will transform the industry are 10-a-penny. For once, one that might partially justify the hype is around the corner. In the past few years conversations about the future of crypto usually alight on a semi-mythical event at an undetermined date known as the “Merge”, and involves Ethereum, one of the industry’s premier blockchain networks. It matters because it confronts one of the sharpest criticisms of crypto: that the industry guzzles vast amounts of energy when the planet desperately needs to reduce its consumption. After years of talk, the Merge is tentatively pegged for mid-September. There’s a bit to unpack, so first, the basics. The Ethereum blockchain is one of crypto’s great hopes because it aims to make digital ledgers more than a simple database for transactions. But like the bitcoin blockchain, it sucks up a lot of energy. The developers behind Ethereum have long talked about their solution, which is to change the way the transactions on the blockchain are verified. To use the industry jargon, it would move from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain. Ethereum would no longer be secured by energy-intensive mining, but by individuals (called “validators”) dedicating their own capital on the network itself. But will the shift work as intended? Alex de Vries — better known by his “Digiconomist” moniker — has high hopes, telling me “it’s hard to say how things will look . . . but a 99 per cent reduction in energy use seems realistic”. De Vries estimates that the Ethereum network’s carbon footprint is currently comparable to Finland’s. These hefty climate costs have prompted regulators to slam the proof-of-work system that underpins both Ethereum and bitcoin. Last year, EU lawmakers almost banned cryptocurrency mining outright, and should the Merge come off without a hitch, regulators in Sweden are already waiting in the wings to retrain their sights on the controversial industry. “Regulators are literally waiting for Ethereum to be successful in moving to proof of stake before cracking down on proof of work”, de Vries said. A meeting between Sweden’s financial services watchdog and environmental agency last year hints at some of the thinking. “If Ethereum is able to shift, we could legitimately request the same from bitcoin. We need to protect other crypto coins that are sustainable,” the minutes read, according to freedom of information requests* by news site netzpolitik.org. But it might be easier said than done. Bitcoin — which still uses a proof-of-work system — is by far the world’s most actively traded crypto token and, despite the recent crash, there are plenty of bitcoin defenders. Then, of course, bitcoin’s apparent success as a secure network has to be considered. In a crowded field of security failures, bitcoin has never been hacked, unlike a series of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies that allegedly represent the greener future of the industry. So it is not impossible that the Merge is a success but the criticism of crypto’s environmental impact doesn’t go away. It may even sharpen scrutiny laid down by regulators. I’d like to hear from you. Will the Merge change your view on Ethereum? And what does it mean for bitcoin’s future? Email me at scott.chipolina@ft.com. It’s been a difficult week for those who preach the immutable resistance of blockchains. After one digital token protocol called Nomad was compromised to the tune of $190mn, thousands of crypto wallets linked to the Solana network were “drained”. Crypto exchange Coinbase forged a deal with BlackRock, giving the asset management giant’s clients greater access to crypto. The partnership is the latest sign of traditional investors pivoting to digital assets, even after a dramatic sell-off across the crypto market. At a time when the likes of Robinhood and Coinbase are cutting back staff, Ripple is going full speed ahead on recruitment. After starting the year with roughly 500 employees, the company aims to increase its headcount to 850 by year-end. “The last 18 months or so have been our most successful and fastest growth period to date,” Ripple’s Europe managing director Sendi Young told me this week. Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor is stepping down from his role as chief executive of MicroStrategy after the software company reported a near $1bn impairment charge on account of its relentless bitcoin purchases over the past couple of years. Saylor believes his new role as executive chair will help him “focus more on our bitcoin acquisition strategy”. Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of prominent crypto platform Polygon, had some choice words that likely offered little comfort to those who lost funds in this week’s hack of wallets linked to Solana. “My heart goes out to Solana community members who lost their life savings in the ongoing attack. Stay strong, these are the growing pains the entire blockchain industry has to go through. These moments, if handled correctly, lead to a lot of strength for any ecosystem.” The Ethereum Merge looks set for next month, and crypto prices have risen in recent weeks. In the past month, bitcoin and ether, the native token on the Ethereum blockchain, have rallied by about 15 per cent and 45 per cent respectively. These points make this a good week to take stock of how much of the broader crypto market bitcoin and ether represent. According to data compiled by Crypto Compare, the industry’s two flagship cryptocurrencies make up 62 per cent of the broader crypto market. Interestingly, the crypto crash has done little to change things. Bitcoin remains firmly in the top spot with 43 per cent of market share, just as it was at the start of the year. Ethereum is at 19 per cent, down 2 percentage points year to date. *This newsletter has been amended to clarify that the meeting minutes became public as a result of freedom of information requests by netzpolitik.org.,,Scott Chipolina,2022-08-05T12:00:42.120Z,

Solana and several other platforms linked to the blockchain were on Wednesday investigating an apparent hack that affected at least 7,767 digital wallets, the computer programs that store traders’ crypto tokens. The Solana Foundation, a non-profit focused on the growth and security of the Solana network, told the Financial Times that it “does not appear” that the exploitation had affected its core infrastructure, but rather was caused by a bug “in software used by several wallets popular among Solana users”. The apparent hack marks a fresh setback for Solana, which has been touted as one of the potential long-term winners of the crypto industry because it was built to handle thousands of trades a second but has faced a series of outages in recent months. The Solana Foundation said on Wednesday that “engineers from multiple ecosystems, with the help of several security firms, are investigating drained wallets on Solana”. In many recent crypto hacking episodes, users did not receive their funds back since transactions typically cannot be reversed on blockchains. Critical intelligence on the digital asset industry. Explore the FT’s coverage here. Phantom, a wallet app built on Solana, and Solana non-fungible token marketplace Magic Eden were among the providers that said they were affected in the apparent hacking incident. The Solana Foundation said wallets that allow traders to hold their coins offline rather than using online applications did not appear to have been affected. Solana Labs, a developer of the Solana blockchain, is backed by big groups in traditional and cryptocurrency markets including venture capital company Andreessen Horowitz, high-speed trading shop Jump Trading, and Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research. Solana is designed to process up to 50,000 trades a second, a scale far in excess of rivals including bitcoin and ethereum, and on a par with established traditional financial services such as the Nasdaq stock exchange. In January, Bank of America analysts said Solana “could become the Visa of the digital asset ecosystem”. However, Solana has suffered processing glitches that have tarnished its reputation. The entirety of the Solana network went dark for four hours in June, an outage that was documented on the network’s official status website. The blockchain’s eponymous native coin has tumbled almost 80 per cent this year, bigger than the drops sustained by its larger rivals bitcoin and ether.

https://www.ft.com/content/c6585dea-e1f8-491e-bd2f-7373c5476794,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,The future of stablecoins is commercial bank money,The business models of issuers will not survive unless they can pay or charge interest,The writer is a partner at the Dutch law firm Resor As the world of decentralised finance continues to grow, there is much demand for a digital currency fit for use in blockchain-based applications with near-real-time, peer-to-peer global settlement that can be used as a medium of exchange. However, most cryptocurrencies are too volatile for this and there are also issues with central bank digital currencies. CBDCs may not be based on the distributed ledger technology of blockchain or be available for retail use. They might also be slow to materialise. As a result, stablecoins or e-money tokens have taken off to meet the market’s demands. Stablecoins come in many varieties. We believe the only ones likely to function as a medium of exchange in the foreseeable future are the most widely used type — those pegged to a fiat currency with the issuer holding reserves. Issuers offer to redeem their tokens on demand, claiming they are fully backed by reserves to meet this pledge. The tokens, which do not pay interest, are usable as money in blockchain applications and trades in them can be settled on a near-real-time, peer-to-peer basis. In addition to being a medium of exchange, they serve as collateral in DeFi. Issuers of these stablecoins have thrived while nominal interest rates have been near zero. With high positive interest rates, the opportunity cost of holding zero-interest stablecoins increases and the issuers lose business. With significantly negative rates, the value of safe reserves declines but the tokens are still redeemable at par. Issuers face insolvency and must invest in riskier reserves for a chance to survive. If stablecoins are no longer fully backed by safe and liquid assets and are widely used, this creates financial stability risks. Suppose the issuers could pass on their interest earnings (or costs if rates are negative) on reserves to the token holders on a one-on-one basis. If interest rates are high, stablecoins are a competitive liquid store of value. If they are significantly negative, the issuers’ liabilities shrink along with their reserve; the issuer remains solvent. Stablecoins could be sustainable in all interest rate environments. There is a problem though, at least for the EU with the Regulation on Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) that is expected to come into force in 2024. This proscribes the paying of interest on money tokens. That would force issuers to adopt a business model that is only sustainable with near-zero interest rates. We see no sensible reason for the ban but such regulation will force stablecoins to evolve. Shares in a regulated retail money market fund, issued as security tokens on a public blockchain under the applicable securities legislation, might be an alternative. Like stablecoins, they would be pegged to a unit of fiat currency but would pay interest. Like MMFs that seek to maintain a constant net asset value, they would be at risk of self-fulfilling runs if investors rush to sell tokens, triggering further sales. As a result, they should have access to central bank lender-of-resort facilities such as MMFs. This sort of fund sits outside Mica and is allowed. It is telling, however, that one needs to circumvent Mica to design a stable stablecoin. Tokenised deposits offered by commercial banks are another possibility. Banks would administer deposits on a distributed database rather than their own. In legal and economic terms, these are identical to conventional deposits; they do not fall under Mica and can pay interest. Tokenising deposits would enable peer-to-peer settlement and make commercial bank money usable in blockchain applications without impacting the broader financial system. Tokenising commercial bank deposits has advantages over alternative stablecoins. They can fall under existing deposit insurance schemes and may qualify as legal tender in some jurisdictions. Finally, banks have access to the central bank as lender of last resort; widening the scope of assets that the token holders’ funds can be invested in while maintaining sufficient liquidity. If interest rates deviate significantly from zero, stablecoin issuers are likely to apply for banking licences to benefit from the regulatory advantages. Existing banks will probably introduce tokenised deposits in order to compete. Stablecoin issuers, as intermediaries, will probably be only a temporary phenomenon. What will remain is commercial bank money with enhanced technical functionality. Willem Buiter and Anne Sibert co-authored this article What does the future hold for digital currencies?

https://www.ft.com/content/175f03f1-29af-4b55-b571-f1a65f561935,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Automated margin calls are another thing blockchain doesn’t have to fix,Solutions in search of problems, trade-tech edition,“How FTX plans to reshape the US futures market with crypto tech” is the story running elsewhere on Financial Times webspace. It explains how Sam Bankman-Fried’s Central Bank of IP wants to “strip out the brokers that for the past 40 years have acted as intermediaries between customers and the exchanges where deals are done.” SBF formally pitched his idea of automated risk management to US regulators in March. His proposal involves using the 24-hour trading of leveraged crypto futures as a proof of concept to gain the confidence of the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Anyone familiar with CFDs and spread betting will by now be wondering what all the fuss is about. Accounts with upfront margin and algorithmic liquidation have been part of the scenery in European markets, and globally for forex, for almost as long as the means have existed. The problem here is America. The CTFC still needs to get comfortable with the concept of leveraged borrowers managing their own risk, which isn’t incontestably compatible with the Commodity Exchange Act. FTX has been lobbying the CTFC for a rule change after last year buying LedgerX, a US futures and options exchange that under current rules has to ask for customer collateral in full (or close to full). FTX wants to offer them leverage, but it doesn’t want to be reliant on futures commission merchants (FCMs), which are the market’s repo men. FCMs have remained because they’re quite useful. Placing a gatekeeper between the exchange and the customer helps pool collateral, and is meant to ensure that clearing houses will have enough to cover any default. Gatekeeping also provides a degree of human discretion to the big decisions, such as when Citigroup was given free pass in March 2020 after missing a margin call. FTX wants to bypass all that. “Dramatic improvements in technological infrastructure over the past twenty years” mean customers should be given direct access to exchange and clearing services, then be taken out of losing positions by a disinterested algorithm. Real time margin monitoring would shut down accounts in 10 per cent increments, with FTX laying off its risky positions where possible to “liquidity providers” and backstopping against catastrophe with its own $250mn cash fund. SBF cites FTX’s own trading history (August 2020 to date) as evidence that such a risk management system works, and that it’s better to boil the frog with regular small liquidations than occasional big ones. Regulators who were calling for god-view futures market monitoring in the wake of the GFC are invited to see on FTX’s dashboards a microcosm version of how it might have looked. Blockchain gets mentioned in passing because its fans believe distributed ledgers are good at instant, frictionless capital transfers. SBF has talked about how smart contracts etc are a “really beautiful experience” when applied to risk management but really, any talk of protocol improvement is incidental at best. Hurdles are all regulatory, not technical. Under the hood, FTX is just as centralised as the average tradfi trading shop; its application letter to the CFTC doesn’t mention blockchain at all. All that’s left then is the argument over whether risk management by algorithm is positive or negative for market stability. But is FTX really the right company to be leading it? After all, SBF didn’t get rich by making crypto less volatile, he got rich by making fiat easier to lose. Crypto lobbyists have seized on the London Metal Exchange’s nickel omnishambles in March as an example of the problems caused by human intervention — while critics have argued that LME’s autocratic style might be a symptom of Hong Kong-Chinese ownership rather than structural failings. It’s not difficult meanwhile to find examples of when algos failed spectacularly to offset risk, such as in 2015 when Switzerland scrapped its currency ceiling and crashed much of the retail CFD industry. Regulators and tradfi firms have so far been wary of the crypto lobby’s charm offensive. As Alphaville noted at the time, a CFTC’s round table in May included a rather exasperated contribution from Chris Edmonds, ICE’s chief development officer, after Coinfund managing partner Chris Perkins used the infallibility of the big shops as an argument in support of FTX’s proposal. (Perkins was in charge of Citi’s clearing unit in March 2020 when its margin call was waived.) A cynical take is that US tradfi has been resisting innovation to protect its profit centres. The more rational take is that futures pricing has real-world consequences for global industry and agriculture, so doesn’t deserve the same risk tolerances as applied to dogecoin. And crypto liquidations appear to be a profit centre in their own right. Moreover, FTX is lobbying to influence its preferred pick for industry regulator, should the US government ever follow through on proposals to put crypto trading within a legislative structure. Blockchain is, and always will be, mostly irrelevant to the wider argument. FTX wants the legitimacy of regulated markets while using the same centralised systems it has developed in crypto to boil the frog and harvest the dead. What FTX has to do is to now convince participants that its preferred mechanisms of modernisation won’t just encourage retail-driven gambling, manipulative volatility and arbitrary financialisation. What’s needed most is a clear presentation of the potential upsides, because right now the evidence from its core market isn’t great.,,Bryce Elder,2022-07-20T15:05:03.363Z,

The FTSE 100-listed asset manager, which oversees £731.6bn on behalf of customers, said on Tuesday that it had invested in the Zurich-based company, which specialises in blockchain technology and digital investments. The deal is part of a push by Schroders to develop research in the sector and to form a strategy for tokenisation, the process of issuing digital tokens to investors instead of traditional shares or fund units. “We’ve seen peak mutual fund,” said Schroders chief executive Peter Harrison in an interview. He noted that money was shifting from mutual funds to personalised portfolios, adding that this would increase with the growing adoption of ledger technology. The investment comes as crypto markets have been nosediving, with analysts likening it to the 2008 financial crisis for the digital asset sector. Tightening central bank policy has led investors to flee high-risk assets, prompting a brutal sell-off in risky tokens since the beginning of the year. The total value of crypto markets has fallen from a peak of more than $3tn in November to less than $1tn, while bitcoin — the largest cryptocurrency — has shed about 70 per cent of its value. The market crash has returned crypto prices to levels not seen since 2017 and has stricken several large companies and projects, including crypto lender Celsius, which filed for bankruptcy in the US last week. Harrison said he was not concerned about the sell-off. “This deal is not about cryptocurrencies. It’s about how do we get tokenisation mainstream.” He said that the focus was on blockchain “as a means of ownership” rather than cryptocurrencies “as a means of payment”. Forteus is the fund management arm of Numeus Group, a digital asset investment firm based in Switzerland run by Nobel Gulati, former chief executive of Two Sigma Advisers. The deal comes as Britain’s asset management industry is pushing the government to establish a new class of fund employing blockchain technology. The Investment Association, the UK’s asset management trade body that oversees almost £10tn, is calling for the government and City regulator to work “at pace” to approve blockchain-traded funds. These would issue digital tokens to investors instead of traditional shares or fund units. Blockchain technology can open access to assets such as alternatives, usually the preserve of wealthy investors, because once they are tokenised the investment minimums can be lowered.

https://www.ft.com/content/bb53f8d8-a4bc-4ab0-8a81-e8befe7e31d1,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Web3 is just a fresh serving of the same old crypto nonsense,Instead of guarding the internet from exploitation, the technology adds an extra layer of financialisation,You have probably, unless you’ve been unusually fortunate, been schooled in the wonders of Web3. For the remaining lucky few, allow me to explain. Web3 is the inexorable destiny of the internet — the magical fabric from which blockchain-based decentralised dreams are made and dystopian big-tech nightmares destroyed. The future is bright; the future is “append-only” databases. The central thesis of Web3 is that because the internet has become so centralised — with power concentrated in the hands of a few, and users powerless over their own data — we need a more distributed, egalitarian, open system. So far, so reasonable. But the minute you look beneath the surface, gaping holes appear in the Web3 vision. Its techno-utopian advocates say they want to harness the alleged power of blockchains — the immutable databases that underpin bitcoin and other tokens — to create a democratised internet where you control your own data and are no longer reliant on the big tech giants. Web3, the argument goes, will allow you to “own a piece of the internet”. Naturally, the “decentralised” apps and organisations that operate in this brave new world are powered by crypto tokens: all you need to do is buy them. In truth, Web3 has become just the latest marketing term used to try to prop up and repackage the overlapping ideas of crypto, non-fungible tokens, and “decentralised finance”, which all seemed brilliant innovations until the whole market started to tank. No matter that blockchain — once touted as the solution to everything from corrupt elections to supply-chain fraud — has totally failed to live up to the hype and only proved its usefulness as the enabler of the crypto casino. This time will be different. It is hard to even discuss Web3 because it is, like many similar overhyped concepts, a very nebulous term. I had a somewhat heated exchange last weekend with someone who claimed that Web3 was about banks processing data to predict your divorce and downgrade your credit rating before you realise your spouse is having an affair. That, I argued, was about Big Data and artificial intelligence, which has nothing to do with blockchains or distributed ledgers. But just like the metaverse and the “Fourth Industrial Revolution” before that, Web3 often seems to be used to mean something along the lines of “techy stuff that could do stuff in the future”. The term itself comes from the idea that we have had two iterations of the web: the first, launched in the early 90s, lasted for just over a decade and consisted mainly of static web pages that were not interactive. The second, arriving in the early 2000s and continuing to this day, allowed users to upload their own content to the web, but in so doing, the user unwittingly became the product. Perhaps the most disingenuous and pernicious aspect of Web3 is the lie that it is truly about decentralisation. Its biggest backers are Andreessen Horowitz — or a16z — a venture capital firm with billionaire co-founders and assets under management of more than $28bn, which launched a $4.5bn Web3 fund earlier this year. Leaving aside the fact that launching a multi-billion-dollar fund seems like quite some concentration of wealth, this firm also happens to be a major Web2 investor: it has, for instance, a stake in Meta, formerly known as Facebook, on whose board a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen still sits. “Power . . . is just becoming re-centralised in the hands of a small few other investors, in some cases the same exact people who hold so much power in the current web,” according to Molly White, a software engineer and author of the “Web3 Is Going Just Great” blog, who is one of Web3’s leading critics. “I do think there are ways to achieve decentralisation on the internet,” she tells me. “But I see those solutions necessarily as being based in societal and policy change rather than in pure technological change.” Meanwhile, firms like a16z-backed crypto exchange Coinbase — which, until recently, was raking in hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of profits every quarter — are positioning themselves to be “the default gateway to the Web3 ecosystem”. Rather strange that an internet that is all about openness and decentralisation would need a corporate behemoth to provide entry. Web3 is not about making the internet fairer or less liable to exploitation by greedy fat cats, it’s actually the very opposite: it’s about introducing yet another layer of financialisation to the web. The reality, therefore, is actually far more simple than the jargon you will have to sit through when someone is explaining it to you. Web3 is just the newest way of serving up the same old crypto bullshit, and it stinks just as badly as ever. jemima.kelly@ft.com,,Jemima Kelly,2022-07-14T04:00:29.246Z,

The Investment Association, the trade body representing the UK’s asset management industry that oversees close to £10tn for clients worldwide, will call on Thursday for the government and City regulator to work “at pace” to approve blockchain-traded funds that will issue digital tokens to investors instead of traditional shares or fund units. Significant cost savings for end investors could be achieved by using the digital ledgers known as blockchain, to drive multiple efficiency improvements in the existing laborious processes involved in buying and selling mutual funds, according to the Investment Association. The group will also propose the creation of a new task force to examine how distributed ledger technology could accelerate the creation of new products and services as well as allowing more investors to customise their portfolios with holdings in private companies and cryptocurrencies. Chris Cummings, Investment Association chief executive, said it was vital that policymakers, regulators and investment industry participants should work together to “drive forward innovation without delay”. “Greater innovation will boost the overall competitiveness of the UK funds industry and improve the cost, efficiency and quality of the investment experience,” said Cummings. Recommended Blockchain-traded funds, also known as tokenised or on-chain funds, could be rolled out as early as the end of the second quarter of 2023 if regulatory approval was expedited by Financial Conduct Authority. California-based Franklin Templeton launched the first US mutual fund to use blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership in April 2021. FundAdminChain, a financial technology group, is working with the London Stock Exchange and four global asset managers to develop live tokenised funds for the UK market. “Asset managers have realised that there is potential to generate alpha [market-beating returns] via tokenisation. Tokenised funds can deliver more transparency, instant settlement, improvements in data and analytics which will contribute to a more efficient system for investors but we need regulatory support to ensure that the UK remains competitive with other jurisdictions,” said FundAdminChain chief executive Brian McNulty. The Investment Association is also calling for the FCA to assess whether traditional mutual funds should be allowed to own cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, as well as other digital assets. However, any new assessment of the suitability of cryptoassets for inclusion in funds sold to retail investors would require the FCA to carry out a full consultation, a lengthy process that would delay regulatory approval. The total value of the cryptocurrency market has tumbled by more than $2tn from the record high of November 2021 as global investors have deserted speculative financial assets. The collapse has alarmed regulators and prompted multiple calls for stricter rules to protect investors. “The recent volatility highlights the importance of defining the ‘rules of the road’ for cryptoassets, which will help to mitigate the risk of harm to consumers,” said Cummings. In a speech in April, John Glen, then City minister and economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government wanted to “remove disincentives” that prevented UK fund managers from holding cryptoassets in their portfolios. “By making [the UK] a hospitable place for crypto, we can attract investment, generate swaths of new jobs and create a wave of groundbreaking new products and services,” said Glen.

https://www.ft.com/content/454257b4-a64b-4d83-a419-fb0ea744df1a,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Will the crypto crash derail the next web revolution?,Advocates argue that the blockchain technology that underpins digital assets will withstand the recent fall in values,Ethan Buchman, co-founder of blockchain network Cosmos, is doing his best to sound stoic. Since January, the collapse in cryptocurrency prices has wiped 80 per cent off the value of the atom tokens that underpin Cosmos, slicing $10bn from their total worth. “Some people get shaken out, some people get scared,” Buchman says of the price collapse in the tokens, which are used to secure the network. “But others see it as an opportunity to double down on what they believe in.” “It is always a scary moment for everybody [when markets crash],” adds Joseph Lau, co-founder of another blockchain company, Alchemy. He insists that the falling crypto prices don’t mean that all the projects involved are doomed, or that developers working on them will lose interest. The fall in prices doesn’t mean crypto projects will not get “traction in the long term”, says Lau. The people working on them “are building no matter what the prices are”. But if Lau and Buchman are wrong, the crypto revolution could be stopped in its tracks. This year’s market collapse — part of a broader retreat from risky financial assets in the face of rising interest rates — could seriously weaken the incentives that have made crypto one of the hottest corners of the tech world. No two tech manias are exactly alike. But the market collapse and the claims that it will not derail the crypto revolution recall another seminal moment in recent tech history: the dotcom boom and bust at the turn of the century. Both bubbles were sparked by a supposedly revolutionary technology that would weaken control over online activity by the political and business establishment, ushering in a decentralised online world in which power would flow to the people. In crypto’s case, something that began as a vision of digital money around bitcoin has broadened into a movement known as Web3. It holds that the same underlying blockchain technology, which records and tracks crypto assets, will support a new generation of user-controlled online services that will dethrone today’s internet giants. Decentralised finance is an umbrella term for a collection of crypto asset projects that aim to do away with a centralised intermediary — like a bank or an exchange — to provide financial services. They use a new form of distributed application, known as a DApp, to execute common services such as lending, savings accounts and trading coins. There are also close parallels in the financial busts. The total value of all cryptocurrencies peaked in November last year before falling around 70 per cent, cutting $2tn from their value. Bitcoin, which accounts for some 42 per cent of the $900bn that remains, may dominate the headlines, but many other digital assets make up the crypto world. In the eight months after dotcom stocks peaked in early 2000, publicly traded internet companies are estimated to have lost $1.7tn, or 60 per cent of their value. Stephane Kasriel, the head of commerce and financial technologies who oversees blockchain efforts at social media group Meta, is among those who argue that when the dust settles, crypto mania, like the dotcom bubble, will turn out to have been the manic precursor to a more stable and lasting tech revolution. “A lot of these technologies go through the same hype cycle,” he says, with early euphoria and speculation followed by a bust. But, he adds, like the web at the start of the century, the underlying blockchain technology is something that “solves a real problem for people” and will be “useful for the world in general for a very long time”. That is not a universally held belief. Exactly what that “something” is — or what uses it could be put to that are not already possible with today’s technology — is not absolutely clear. So far, crypto tech has been used mainly for financial speculation, criminal activity, decentralised finance or DeFi (which exists outside regulation) and the creation and trading of unique digital tokens called NFTs, which have been through their own boom and bust. “A lot of the language [about decentralisation] is an almost exact replica of what we talked about in the 1990s,” says Martha Bennett, who at the time was head of advanced technology at UK insurance group Prudential. But she points to a fundamental difference between the early days of the world wide web and Web3 now: “We already had lots of utility by 1995 — we had email, we had lots of information online. With Web3, we have none of that.” Bennett, who now analyses new technologies at Forrester Research, says it is probably still too early to judge whether anything lasting or useful will survive. But a growing chorus of critics in the tech world argue that — unlike with the dotcoms — the tech underlying crypto has no redeeming features at all. A group of 26 computer scientists and academics wrote to members of the US Congress in May to warn that the technology was “risky, flawed and unproven”. Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert and one of the authors, says that any application built to run on a blockchain would be more practical, cost-effective and secure if it was based on other technologies: “Whatever it is you’re doing, it’s better without blockchain,” he says. The crypto boom drew its power from new technology, anti-establishment social forces and powerful financial incentives that combined in an era of loose money to produce an explosive mix. With that era apparently over, it is now entering a challenging new phase. Summing up the case against crypto and Web3, Phil Libin, a computer scientist and former chief executive of Evernote, the note taking app, describes the forces that inflated the bubble as: “80 per cent greed, 20 per cent ideology and zero per cent technology”. A blockchain co-founded by Vitalik Buterin, a Canadian-Russian computer scientist, Ethereum is at the centre of Web3 efforts to turn blockchains into more than just a database of transitions. Its technology can hold assets, enables programmers to code functions for buying and selling into smart contracts, and also provides the building blocks for most DApps for finance. Ether, the token associated with Ethereum is the world’s second-most actively traded cryptocurrency. The enthusiasm for crypto in the tech world rests on a belief that blockchains — open, distributed databases that can in theory be updated by anyone — represent a new foundation for online activity. Public blockchains use specially designed “consensus mechanisms” so that participants can agree updates are accurate. Fans claim these blockchains — and the cryptocurrencies used to validate the updates — will be the foundation for a new set of online services in which users, rather than corporations or governments, are in control. Yet even Web3 advocates admit that existing blockchain technology is woefully inadequate when it comes to supporting mass online services. The Ethereum network, which is at the centre of much Web3 activity, can handle a maximum of only 30 transactions a second, while newer, faster networks such as Solana have yet to prove themselves. The technology is difficult to use for non-experts and is beset by unresolved privacy, security and legal questions. Supporters say this is the result of technological immaturity rather than any fundamental flaw. Juan Benet, chief executive of Protocol Labs, whose Filecoin network acts as a decentralised marketplace for computer storage, compares today’s blockchains to the early days of cloud computing. The cloud was already the subject of widespread interest in the tech industry in the 1990s, he says, but it “took 20 years to build” before it was seen as a serious alternative. A similar technological “maturation” lies ahead for crypto, he predicts. In the process, however, the ideal of decentralisation imagined by crypto enthusiasts risks being diluted to the point where there is little to distinguish it from the technology it is seeking to replace. One widely touted switch could see “proof of work” mechanisms (which involve “miners” competing to solve cryptographic puzzles to verify new entries on the blockchain and consume vast amounts of power) replaced by “proof of stake” systems (where people who already own a cryptocurrency control how the network is governed). By definition, proof of stake systems hand most of the power to the wealthiest, undermining the ideal of distributed power that crypto systems are meant to enshrine, says Libin. The new tech infrastructure being built on top of blockchains is designed to make them easier to use and able to handle many more transactions. But it also threatens to weaken their decentralised nature. It could give rise to a new set of dominant companies that act as the “gatekeepers” controlling access to the technology in the same way that the Big Tech companies rule today’s online world, says Bennett at Forrester. Any creeping centralisation of Web3’s supposedly distributed computing platform would echo the trajectory of the web that preceded it. The open communication protocols on which the internet is based prevent any government or organisation from exerting control. Yet the system has left plenty of opportunity for private companies to build empires on top of tech foundations that promised, but failed to deliver, a more democratic online world. This helps to explain why, despite the rhetoric that casts Web3 as an existential threat to the existing internet giants, companies such as Meta are dipping their toes into the blockchain pond. “It’s always been a combination of things that are centralised and things that are decentralised,” Kasriel says of the technology on which the social networking company, previously known as Facebook, is built. Its plans now include creating a blockchain that enables software developers to keep control of the digital content they want to post to Meta’s networks. In proof of work systems, groups known as miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles in order to validate transactions, with the winner earning rewards in the form of cryptocurrency. These systems, which include bitcoin, are widely criticised because of the huge amount of energy used in trying to compute the result. Proof of stake systems randomly select someone to validate transactions from among a group of people who already hold the cryptocurrency and have “staked” their holdings, or posted them as collateral, with the networks. This uses much less power than proof of work, but it concentrates control in the hands of the wealthiest crypto owners. Ethereum is in the middle of a long-delayed switch from proof of work to proof of stake. The company does not really need to use a blockchain for this idea, says Kasriel. At a technical level it could achieve the same result in other ways. But giving up control through a blockchain would help to assuage those who don’t trust Meta to look after their interests, he adds. Even so, critics such as Schneier argue that the shortcomings of the technology are so great that it has little practical use. And if the promise of a decentralised online world turns out to be largely illusory, then there is nothing left to recommend the technology. If serious doubts remain about the long-term usefulness of the technology behind Web3, there is less uncertainty about the forces the crypto boom has already unleashed. The combination of idealism and greed has been every bit as potent as the euphoria that ruled during the dotcom bubble. According to supporters, the large number of people already committed to the sector will make it impossible to ignore. “A rule of thumb on the internet,” says Avichal Garg at Electric Capital, an investment firm specialising in Web3 start-ups, “is that if 100mn people are doing something, then it is worth paying attention to.” At the heart of the mania are the cryptocurrencies and digital tokens that are embedded in blockchain networks. The willingness of people to ascribe value to these — either because, like bitcoin, they are believed to have some of the characteristics of money, or because they are central to online networks that may one day support new, decentralised digital economies — has propelled the boom in the cryptocurrency market. The soaring value of these digital assets provided a way to finance blockchain projects such as Cosmos and to attract talent to the industry. It has also drawn internet users to the first consumer services that are being built on blockchains. These include so-called “play to earn” games where participants have the chance to earn tokens that they can later sell on. These new financial incentives could solve a perennial problem faced by online consumer start-ups, says Vinod Khosla, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist: how to attract enough people to get a new service off the ground, triggering the network effects that make online services more valuable as more people start to use them. Recommended Critics argue that using tokens to spark online interaction gives users a financial motivation to take actions that were previously freed of commercial incentives. This could lead to a “financialisation” of online services that turns every interaction into a chance to profit. Ryan Wyatt, a former head of gaming at YouTube who now runs blockchain gaming company Polygon Studios, says this criticism fails to reflect the highly diverse nature of online services. Out of the huge number of people who play games online, only a relatively small number need to participate in blockchain-based games for them to be a success, he says. Yet while the rising prices of digital assets acted as a powerful draw on the way up, now that prices are falling there is a fear they could act as a big drag on the way down. The price collapse will also hit the finances of blockchain projects that have benefited from the rising value of their tokens. Many sell tokens to generate cash and hold their reserves in the form of cryptocurrencies, leaving them seriously exposed to a collapse in crypto prices. Backers still claim that a profound change in what users demand has occurred and that it is a phenomenon that will outlive the bubble. The expectations of a generation of internet users have already been changed by crypto, says Wyatt, who believes people will not accept online services that leave them without any control or a share in the profits. Organisations including Cosmos and Alchemy claim that collapsing crypto prices have not weakened the resolve of the developers building their networks. According to the believers, the fact that it is hard to anticipate the ultimate uses of the technology behind crypto and Web3 should not be a concern. After all, many of the things that underpin today’s online world — from Facebook’s social network to the mobile internet triggered by the iPhone and Amazon Web Services’ cloud computing platform — didn’t see the light of day until well after the dotcom bust. “If it takes 10 years to see the Amazon of Web3, that’s fine,” says Wyatt at Polygon Studios. “That’s a multitrillion dollar company that would be on-chain. I think we would be pretty happy with that.” ,,Richard Waters Hannah Murphy Scott Chipolina,2022-07-06T04:05:45.902Z,

The dominance of non-fungible tokens in these markets has also drawn most of the attention. Many believe that the next big breakthrough will be to designate ownership for virtual goods in the metaverse. But what if NFTs could also provide solutions in cumbersome, archaic systems for securing property rights, thus unlocking value from tangible assets? Such possibly transformative uses of NFTs are only vaguely starting to take shape on the economic and legal horizons. Technically, they are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated. Unlike cryptocurrencies, they cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency. By “twinning” an NFT with a particular version of a digital work, it becomes possible to differentiate it from its myriad other versions and thus ascribe a distinctive value to it, conferring proof of ownership on a single identifiable holder. NFTs already represent and “tokenise” physical objects, items such as artworks and luxury goods, expanding the attributes of their ownership into the digital world and permitting more efficient and secure transactions. Experiments in real estate are now being undertaken as a new way of providing needed liquidity in a system that has historically been hostage to transaction costs. The fact that NFTs can act as immutable proof of ownership and provenance could help solve a persistent problem when it comes to property in developing countries. Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto argued early on about blockchain’s potential to establish a cost-effective mechanism for formalising property rights for the poor. This would, he estimates, unlock $10tn of formerly “dead capital” around the world. It also seems increasingly possible that the joint ownership and crowdsourcing investment of NFTs could be used to support the preservation of world heritage sites, national artistic masterpieces or threatened biodiversity zones. Practitioners are still trying to understand how exactly NFTs fit into or disrupt existing legal notions and, consequently, what the applicable legal and tax treatment should be. Fractional ownership and instruments for the syndication of property rights are not a new concept: NFTs are merely their latest avatar. The novelty, however, is that these blockchain-based tools provide the prospect of disintermediated (financially and administratively) new markets for creators and holders of otherwise non-marketable physical assets. This prospect raises important issues of governance. Even if each NFT representing a particular value stake in the associated asset can be easily and individually traded, what is the basic framework needed to guarantee the preservation and integrity of the underlying asset as a whole? When do they become security instruments? What are the rights of holders as regards the asset and what obligations do they have with respect to any other holders? Well-documented challenges remain elsewhere, including the reliability and security of blockchain, the interoperability of different blockchains and, extremely importantly, the big environmental footprint of NFT minting. Fraud and market manipulation are also on the rise. Regulators are hesitating as to the right approach, mindful of the need not to stifle innovation while attempting to exercise oversight. Neither the EU’s markets in crypto assets regulation nor the proposed US crypto bill make any explicit reference to NFTs. These technical, legal and regulatory considerations should be grabbing much more of the debate. It is not impossible that NFTs could become important new instruments of fractional asset ownership, well beyond digital art, and into the realm of more tangible repositories for creating and distributing wealth. For now, however, they remain in a state of flux.,,Marina Niforos,2022-06-20T16:40:06.919Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/85361539-2421-42e1-8194-7846f71b163a,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,No, Russia won’t replace Swift with the blockchain,Because don’t be daft, honestly.,Have you heard that Russia’s developing a blockchain platform for international payments to replace the current Swift system? There’s a good chance you have, but if you haven’t you soon will, because the story has been stuck in a holding pattern above the news agenda for weeks. It loomed back into view this morning via coinbro churnalism and tweets such as this one, from Watcher.Guru to its 1.1mn followers: JUST IN: Russian government organization has created a blockchain platform for international payments to replace the current Swift system. It all stems from an appearance by Rostec, Russia’s state-owned military technology developer, at a digitisation conference in Nizhny Novgorod that ran on the first three days of June. Rostec’s software battalion, Novosibirsk Institute of Software Systems (NIPS), used the event to announce “the CELLS industrial blockchain platform”. Here’s the press release fed through Google translate: One of the central elements of the [CELLS] platform has become a digital system for making payments in national currencies, which can provide a real alternative to SWIFT in international settlements. The multifunctional system provides international payments, multicurrency transactions, user identification and storage of digital currency. Blockchain technology in combination with certified cryptographic information protection tools provide a high level of IT solution reliability. “The digital payment system on the blockchain platform can be used as a full-fledged replacement for SWIFT, providing high speed, security and irrevocable transactions. The system will make it possible to switch to settlements in national currencies, eliminate the risk of sanctions and ensure the independence of the national financial policy for clearing participants ,” said Oleg Yevtushenko, Executive Director of Rostec Group. NIPS has some form with bold predictions. In 2019 it presented to the same conference a “roadmap for the development of blockchain technology in Russia” that involved chaining the entire machinery of state at a cost of up to 85bn rubles ($1.5bn). Council budgets, transport infrastructure, the industrial complex and municipal elections would all be put on distributed ledgers to somehow deliver an estimated economic benefit of up to 1.64tn rubles within five years. Deploying a platform such as Ethereum in the Kremlin “is not a sign of dependence on foreign solutions”, since access to the source code cannot be limited for political reasons, Kommersant quoted NIPS as saying in May 2019. Between that date and now, for perhaps obvious reasons, the focus has switched to a proprietary system. Not much information is in the public domain about the CELLS blockchain other than what’s on a product website. From that we learn it uses uses proof of authority mining, which does away with the whole competitive mining thing and relies on a small fleet of validators. There are benefits to this approach, including that transactions are nearly as quick, secure and power efficient as in a conventional database. The downside is a degree of centralisation that’s the opposite of blockchain’s theoretical USP, in return for a system that’s slightly worse than the one it replaces. The Swift cross-border money transfer network routes 42mn financial messages a day to connect more than 11,000 institutions and 4bn account holders in at least 200 countries. NIPS’s proposed replacement is arguably over-specified, reportedly handling up to 100,000 transactions per second, though capacity is really not the problem here. None of the hurdles is technical. It’s all about the Benjamins, as Claire Jones explains: About half of all global payments are made in dollars. Along with about 90 per cent of trade finance. When instructions are sent via networks such as Swift, many of those dollar payments need to be made between institutions that do not have accounts with one another. What that means is that a correspondent bank — probably with operations in the US, policed by the American authorities — will act as an intermediary.... Even for transactions that are legal, parties are unwilling to take the risk of alienating the US authorities by processing payments for businesses based in countries that have fallen foul of Washington. Which is the bottom line. And what are the chances that any non-Russian counterparty would adopt a mystery meat ledger that’s centrally controlled by a company that parades its tanks through Red Square every May 9? Ноль.

Most are foreseen accidents, though some may be engineered in their image. To safeguard the overall blockchain industry and crypto market, TRON DAO Reserve will withdraw 2.5 billion #TRX out of binance. That’s Tron, which is a blockchain network in the Ethereum model. It includes a $700mn-ish valued token, usdd, that has been among crypto’s most obvious targets for attack in recent weeks. Usdd (launched on May 5) is a decentralised algorithmic stablecoin that applies a near-identical arbitrage mechanism to Do Kwon’s Luna/Terra coin (which collapsed on May 10). Tron’s white paper for the coin was deleted and rewritten this month to add a promise of “guaranteed over-collateralisation using various mainstream cryptocurrencies”. (The old version is on Web. Archive.) Usdd finally broke the buck late last week: Justin Sun, Tron’s permanently online founder, has pinned the blame on the network’s native trx coin becoming a crowded short: Funding rate of shorting #TRX on @binance is negative 500% APR. @trondaoreserve will deploy 2 billion USD to fight them. I don't think they can last for even 24 hours. Short squeeze is coming. pic.twitter.com/VRExM6UK70 Sun is crypto’s most tenacious publicity hound. A vanity website leans heavily on his role as “Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the WTO in Grenada”, which last week allowed him to talk blockchain at the WTO’s Ministerial Conference. (Tourism, which pre-pandemic provided more than half of Grenada’s GDP, wasn’t mentioned.) In 2019 Sun paid $4.6mn to have dinner with Warren Buffett, then cancelled, then on rearranging gave Buffett a phone loaded with bitcoin. A year later he was sucking the exhaust fumes of the NFT high-art bandwagon while self-identifying as a meme-stock bagholder. Any entrepreneur so reliant on self publicity will be vulnerable to the law of diminishing returns. That’s how it was with Sun’s earlier attempts to shore up confidence, with reserve injections providing no more than short-term relief. The market response to a withdrawal of deposits for the sanctity of crypto has been much more positive: That’s because stated reserves aren’t Tron’s problem. The plummeting value of its native token is basically irrelevant to everyone but hodlers, because the usdd stablecoin is (on paper) more than fully collateralised by Tron’s $1bn of USD Coin and $140mn of Tether reserves. Tron’s problem is that it’s a lobster pot. There’s no redemption mechanism for usdd. Once you’re in, there’s no way out other than through secondary market trading. The only arbitrage opportunity on offer for usdd hodlers is to swap the tokens for a dollar’s worth of newly minted trx. Sun and the Tron grand council are the only ones with direct access to the reserves, so can choose whether to restore the peg or flip in and out of whatever asset will generate the most noise. Pulling Tron’s trx deposits out of Binance therefore looks like an attempt to choke off liquidity in what is the crypto equivalent of a very heavily shorted small cap. It’s not a Terra/Luna arbitrage breakdown or a rug pull, though their similarity of appearance is probably not coincidental. It has a lot more in common with the simple meme stock-style manipulation of supply and demand. Sun, however, has been very keen to make the shorters think otherwise: Deploying more capital - steady lads Deploying more capital - steady lads Further reading: The many escapes of Justin Sun — The Verge,,Bryce Elder,2022-06-15T15:31:07.591Z,

The marketplace company is allowing customers to buy these digital certificates of authenticity, often related to artworks or sporting triumphs, using multiple assets. The payment bundles may even include NFTs themselves. Using one NFT to buy another is of debatable value. It does little to improve liquidity. It could also create risky feedback loops, as in many other asset classes. Notional dollar values for NFTs could push each other upward in growing isolation from anchoring transactions in real greenbacks. NFTs are receipts for digital assets recorded with blockchains. Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, which are meant to confer ownership for online monkey cartoons, are among the best known. Bored Ape buyers have access to members-only social media. Last year, one simian NFT reportedly sold for $3.4mn. Funding for start-ups connected to NFTs reached $7.4bn in the first quarter of the year, according to PitchBook data. Investors hope NFTs have utility beyond Twitter profile pictures and a speculative price boom. The popularity of NFTs has transformed OpenSea. In January the marketplace raised $300mn at a $13.3bn valuation, up from $1.5bn six months earlier. Coinbase launched an NFT marketplace in April but has a fraction of OpenSea’s trades, according to Dune Analytics. OpenSea’s NFT trades are hailed as a tangible example of web3, touted as a decentralised financial wonderland. Of course, OpenSea is itself an intermediary. It charges a 2.5 per cent fee on transactions. But with cryptocurrencies crashing, NFT sales volumes have been falling too. Dune Analytics says OpenSea’s monthly trading volume almost halved between January and May, to $2.6bn. The sector has also been hit by an insider trading scandal, reports of NFT theft, and copyright problems. Artists say their work is sometimes plagiarised. OpenSea needs to focus on cleaning up scams. It may be uncomfortable with tightening its rules. These are, after all, not very decentralised. But OpenSea is charging for a service. Its first priority should be to provide a secure marketplace.

Ether, the world’s second-biggest crypto token and a proxy for sentiment on the $100bn DeFi market, has shed more than a third of its value over the past month. Its fall is significantly more severe than the 23 per cent decline for bitcoin, the oldest and most valuable digital token by market value. Many crypto advocates consider DeFi to be one the most promising innovations in the digital asset industry, with projects aiming to operate without centralised intermediaries such as banks through the use of automated systems that dole out control to the biggest stakeholders. However, the failure last month of luna, and its linked stablecoin terraUSD, highlighted the risks of investing in DeFi projects and the potential for catastrophic flaws in the design of programmes that underpins their operations. “Confidence in the crypto ecosystem and decentralised finance remains at historically low levels” after the breakdown of terra and luna, said Sipho Arntzen, an analyst at Swiss private bank Julius Baer, adding that, “we expect no swift recovery for now”. Stablecoins act as lubricants of transactions in DeFi markets, and the wipeout of terra was seen as a particularly strong blow to confidence in the sector. Terra was designed to match the value of the US dollar through a financial relationship with sister token luna, in contrast to other major stablecoins that claim to be backed by portfolios of reserves. Ether’s fall is a sign of how the crash in terra and luna has sent a chill through the wider DeFi sector, analysts said. The token price is tied to investors’ expectations for the future of DeFi since many of the computerised financial apps in the decentralised market are built on the Ethereum blockchain where ether resides. Investors drained $56mn from Ethereum investment products in May, taking this year’s total net outflows to $250mn, according to data from digital asset manager Coinshares. Bitcoin products, in contrast, have drawn $369mn of net inflows in 2022. “As [Ethereum] primarily aims to provide the infrastructure for the emerging world of decentralised apps, we believe that these drawdowns are symptomatic of a loss in confidence in the broader DeFi ecosystem,” Arntzen said. Recommended Some investors argue the hit to ether also reflects a reassessment of the future demand for multiple facets of the crypto industry, such as digital collectibles known as non-fungible tokens and borrowing and lending protocols, which also often use the Ethereum network. “Ethereum, like Netflix or any stock, reflects expectation of future demand,” said Ilan Solot, partner at Tagus Capital. He said investors were doubting the level of future demand on the Ethereum network as the economic outlook darkens. “If the Federal Reserve is tightening [monetary policy], the world is in recession, and people need to pay $4.5 per gallon of gas, they’ll have less to invest in DeFi or spend on blockchain games,” he added. Investors have also soured on risky assets more broadly, said Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush. He said DeFi was “caught in a general risk-off tornado”. Derivatives markets suggest that investors remain nervous about the near-term prospects of ether, despite optimism about bitcoin’s path. While options markets signal a positive tone for bitcoin over the next month, investors see difficult trading conditions for ether on the same time horizon, said Adam Farthing, chief risk officer for Japan at market maker B2C2. “The market has become much more cautious of ether due to its recent performance and in a way it hasn’t for bitcoin,” he said. Bitcoin still enjoys a reputation among some investors as a hedge against inflation, despite losing more than half its value from its November high. Another challenge facing Ethereum is the network’s long-awaited shift to a different kind of blockchain system called proof of stake. This shift is expected to relieve frustrations surrounding Ethereum’s longstanding transaction fees and clunky processing speeds. Ingo Fiedler, co-founder of Blockchain Research Lab, said Ethereum’s blockchain shift “could go wrong as any code change is risky for any software”. He added that there may be unknown risks that will come to light only once Ethereum’s new system is tested in the real world. “We saw this flight to safety from terra to [rival stablecoin USD Coin] and into assets people perceive to be more established, and so I think that anything that’s new, or overly technical, will probably have people a little standoffish,” said Teana Baker-Taylor, vice-president of policy and regulatory strategy at crypto firm Circle.

So when financiers and policymakers recently gathered in Davos for the World Economic Forum meeting, crypto schadenfreude was in the mountain air. Earlier this year, when crypto was booming, numerous digital assets companies booked space on the Davos promenade to advertise their power and brands. But just beforehand, the terra and luna stablecoins collapsed, and the price of tokens such as bitcoin tumbled. Cue establishment chatter about a “crypto winter” — and general sneering about digital Ponzi schemes. But amid the sniping, investors should have taken note of another important — if less discussed — theme in the digital asset debate: namely that the world’s big central banks are becoming more interested in using distributed ledger technology, or blockchains, themselves. This is not because they like the retail central bank digital currencies that normally grab headlines. Yes, the mighty People’s Bank of China is testing this, along with some smaller emerging market countries, including Jamaica. The European Central Bank is pondering it too, as François Villeroy de Galhau, the French central bank governor told Davos. However, most western central bankers are wary of creating retail CBDC — ie letting citizens hold digital central bank cash — because they fear the implications of being responsible for their data and/or dislike the idea of disintermediating commercial banks. The crash of terra has also reduced any sense of urgency. So, too, the fact that mobile payments are making it increasingly easy, fast and efficient for citizens to use fuddy-duddy fiat currency. But what is sparking establishment interest is using CBDC for wholesale cross-border payments, to move funds between financial institutions and central banks. “We believe in wholesale [CBDC] and we have run nine experiments [with these],” de Galhau told the WEF, noting that although “retail CBDC is where the public interest is”, this misses the point. Or as Ravi Menon of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which has been experimenting with CBDC for seven years, recently told an important central bank meeting in Zurich: “We are barking up the wrong tree with retail CBDCs. The tree we should be barking up is wholesale cross-border CBDCs.” This might not be what most politicians or ordinary citizens want to hear, given the arcane inner workings of wholesale markets. But it matters, since the shift in emphasis is driven by two key factors. One is a recognition that current cross-border payment systems are achingly slow; so much so that Roberto Campos Neto, the Brazilian central bank governor, recently told an IMF meeting — only partly in jest — that it has been faster to move money from São Paulo to London by boarding a plane with bags of cash than using official bank channels. However, if central banks “scale up [wholesale CBDC] and achieve atomic settlement you can make cross payments at close to zero cost and the benefits are huge”, as Menon said in Zurich. Or as Kristalina Georgieva, head of the IMF, told Davos: “CBDC are not yet internationalised, but this is where the opportunity is.” There is, in other words, a genuine use case. The second attraction is cultural: a wholesale CBDC can be organised by a club of central bank technocrats without needing much debate with politicians, or voters. This does not make it easy to create wholesale CBDCs on a large scale. Far from it. The technology hurdles remain daunting. Wholesale CBDCs may also require central banks to cede a little sovereignty since using distributed digital ledgers means they no longer control fiat currencies in the traditional manner. That requires mutual trust. However, the central banking tribe that convenes around the Bank for International Settlements in Basel does generally trust each other — and more than their own domestic politicians. More than a dozen cross-border wholesale CBDC experiments have occurred, not just with the French and Singaporean central banks, but countries such as Switzerland, South Africa, Thailand, China and the United Arab Emirates. It is not clear (yet) whether these can scale up. One key block, as Georgieva stressed in the Zurich and Davos meetings, is that there is still no “interoperability” between these separate pilots. But if this does emerge — ie scaleable systems are created — there would be further interesting implications. One is that future historians might conclude that the most significant long-term consequence of distributed ledger technologies for finance was not bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Instead, it lay in deeply dull corners of banking, like wholesale payments. They might also decide that while distributed ledgers were presented as a tool that could rip power away from establishment institutions, this innovation actually reconsolidated them in some ways. The Davos elite is usurping the dream. Of course, bitcoin maximalists would retort that this is precisely why CBDCs are a bad (if not unworkable) idea; their assumption is that central banks cannot continue to hoard monetary power. Maybe so. But the real moral of all these discussions is that “blockchain” can mean a multitude of different — and sometimes contradictory — things. gillian.tett@ft.com Sign up for Gillian Tett’s Moral Money newsletter, ft.com/newsletters ,,Gillian Tett,2022-06-02T15:15:07.313Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/610e111e-71a2-4182-ad30-da49530a12f6,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,The crypto plan to save our souls,Imagine a Web3 blocktopia where ‘souls and communities convene bottom-up’,Packed with references to DAO-on-DAO “vampire attacks” and sentences like “we also do not assume non-transferability of Souls across humans”, a whimsical paper on the future of Web3 from Eric Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin makes for quite the ride. As far as these technologists are concerned, the world lacks any hopeful vision of the future. “We’re heading either for a Peter Thiel-inspired anarcho-capitalist dystopia or a Chinese government-style top-down surveillance system,” Weyl told FT Alphaville. Web3’s “radically democratic” horizontality constitutes a potential third way. Yet the internet’s ill-defined next iteration needs plenty of work if it’s going to supplant what we already have, the trio write. At its core, Web3 today still “centres around expressing transferable, financialised assets”. What it lacks is any way of “encoding social relationships of trust”. Pseudonyms are great, in other words, but they don’t inspire confidence. “Persistent identities” are a must. Enter “soulbound tokens”, or SBTs for short. (Ohlhaver acknowledges that a rebrand may be required. ) As in World of Warcraft, where “soulbound” items are those that can’t be traded with other players, SBTs represent similarly non-transferable (and revocable) credentials. In theory, these would be issued by institutions like universities, companies and foundations then deposited in users’ wallets (aka “Souls”) as proof of past achievements. Or, as the paper puts it: Imagine a world where most participants have Souls that store SBTs corresponding to a series of affiliations, memberships, and credentials. For example, a person might have a Soul that stores SBTs representing educational credentials, employment history, or hashes of their writings or works of art. In their simplest form, these SBTs can be “self-certified,” similar to how we share information about ourselves in our CVs. But the true power of this mechanism emerges when SBTs held by one Soul can be issued — or attested — by other Souls, who are counterparties to these relationships. Once users can stake their reputation on the blockchain, the possibilities are endless. Forget decentralised finance. A truly “decentralised society” — where “souls and communities convene bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to produce plural network goods across different scales” — would finally be within reach. Grasping the damn thing is another matter entirely, however. “I don’t expect most people will buy into our long-range vision,” Weyl said. “We need to give people breadcrumbs to follow. We want to get to a world where people are issuing SBTs, but they’re not going to do that because they want to build a radical future. That’s not what’s going to appeal to them immediately.” So what might? One example appears early in the paper: An ecosystem of SBTs could unlock a censorship-resistant, bottom-up alternative to top-down commercial and “social” credit systems. SBTs that represent education credentials, work history, and rental contracts could serve as a persistent record of credit-relevant history, allowing Souls to stake meaningful reputation to avoid collateral requirements and secure a loan. Loans and credit lines could be represented as non-transferable but revocable SBTs, so they are nested amongst a Soul’s other SBTs — a kind of non-seizable reputational collateral — until they are repaid and subsequently burned, or better yet, replaced with proof of repayment. What could possibly go wrong? Erm, quite a lot, as it turns out. The authors admit their bottom-up social credit system could be used to “automate red-lining of disfavoured social groups or even target them for cyber or physical attack, enforce restrictive migration policies or make predatory loans.” But hey, what’s one more dystopia between friends? DeSoc does not need to be perfect to pass the test of being acceptably non-dystopian; to be a paradigm worth exploring it merely needs to be better than the available alternatives. Whereas DeSoc has possible dystopian scenarios to guard against, web2 and existing DeFi are falling into patterns that are inevitably dystopian. FTAV asked David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50-foot Blockchain, what he made of the prospect of a blockchain-based social credit system designed to facilitate unsecured lending. Suffice to say, he was far from impressed. Everything about the “soulbound” paper is fractally wrong and bad. Even if any of this could actually work, it’d be the worst idea ever. What Buterin wants to implement here is a binding permanent record on all people, on the blockchain. It’s Black Mirror’s “Fifteen Million Merits”, except he seriously thinks this is a good idea. Considered as a tech startup, Ethereum is a huge success. This does not mean any other idea from its creator is worth taking seriously, except as a threat. Equally sceptical was Martin Walker, director of banking and finance at the Centre for Evidence-Based Management. The simple answer is don’t use a blockchain or lend money to people hiding behind a pseudonym. It really is that simple. This is where [Buterin’s] lack of understanding of the real world comes into things. For example unsecured lending (which can obviously go wrong) works because: 1. Banks make great efforts to identify who they are lending money to 2. Banks understand the borrowing history and other information about the credit history of the potential borrower. 3. Loan agreements (particularly for large amounts) are very detailed and have all sorts of covenants and conditions. They specify the seniority of debt, what sort of information the borrower has to provide the lender, conditions on how much other debt they can take on etc. What Buterin, Weyl and Ohlhaver have done is come up with a complex solution to a problem they created, Walker said. Soulbound tokens, however clever, do little to mitigate the risk of a loan going bad. “I see the uncollateralised lending thing, even though it could go wrong in several ways, as potentially better than our current lending environment,” Weyl said. Extending credit on the blockchain isn’t what excites him or his co-authors, he added — it’s simply “an illustration to people that are super close to the existing ecosystem” of how SBTs could be used to do the “basic things they want to do”. And yet there remains a chance that less high-minded actors confuse the means with the end. The road to web3 will be paved with good intentions.,,George Steer,2022-06-01T12:58:24.848Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/6bca0eef-92c3-413b-b2a9-2403b12a9f7d,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,DeFi’s promise of democratising finance remains a distant reality,Decentralised finance risks concentrating economic power and exacerbating existing inequities,The writer is a professor at Cornell, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of ‘The Future of Money’ A cryptocurrency winter has set in, with many cryptocurrencies’ prices and the overall value of such digital assets falling below half their peak values from six months ago. Dashed is the notion that crypto assets are immune to shifts in macroeconomic fundamentals and serve as hedges against inflation. The mayhem has shone a harsh light on decentralised blockchain-based finance, as weaknesses in its basic precepts are coming into focus. For all its promise in democratising finance and broadening financial access, the emerging reality suggests a concentration of economic power, while the risks fall largely on those investors least able to handle them. But the crypto shakeout might help the long-term viability of blockchain-based finance by damping rampant speculation while prodding regulators to act expeditiously. Decentralised finance, or DeFi, is built on three principles. It features decentralised architectures, with public digital ledgers maintained on multiple computers and synchronised in real time. Decentralised trust involves the validation of transactions through public consensus mechanisms rather than by trusted intermediaries. Finally, and crucially, decentralised governance is underpinned by a collective interest in maintaining the system’s integrity and security. Bitcoin is a good (albeit primitive) example of DeFi. These principles are proving incompatible with functionality. Cryptocurrencies that work well as mediums of exchange are in fact centralised. Stablecoins are typically backed up by reserves of fiat currencies, issued by a private party that validates transactions and keeps centralised accounts, and with operating rules set by the issuer. Meanwhile, algorithmic stablecoins, ostensibly backed by other cryptocurrencies but still managed by their issuers, have stumbled badly in recent weeks. Decentralisation is proving illusory even in crypto assets such as bitcoin. A handful of computing consortiums now dominate the process of validating bitcoin transactions and ownership is concentrated as well. The very design of some systems, which are more efficient than bitcoin’s inefficient “proof of work” consensus protocol, is leading to concentration of governance. “Proof of stake”, an alternative consensus mechanism which requires users to pledge a “stake” of digital currency, allows for quicker decentralised validation of a far greater volume of transactions than proof of work. But this system is also vulnerable to capture by a small group that acquires a large stake. Although it is not in the group’s interest to compromise the system’s integrity, they could shift the rules to their advantage. Cryptocurrencies and DeFi are useful under authoritarian regimes and in societies where the government machinery has broken down. For countries such as El Salvador and the Central African Republic, the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender provides a better alternative than any domestic currency could. But DeFi’s promise of creating new financial products and services, broadening access and undercutting traditional financial intermediaries remains a mirage. Existing institutions are co-opting the new technologies. Permissioned blockchains controlled by one or a small group of institutions are helping to improve traditional finance, but in turn could concentrate power among a choice few institutions and limit competition. Much of DeFi involves fully or even over-collateralised financial instruments. This helps maintain trust and financial stability but is hardly conducive to broadening access. After all, lack of collateral is a major stumbling block for indigent households and small-scale entrepreneurs seeking access to credit and other financial products. Moreover, the lack of financial literacy and investor protection has inflicted heavy losses on unsophisticated investors who failed to understand the risks (or ignored them) and invested heavily in crypto assets. Regulators must act swiftly to head off the risks associated with decentralisation, while limiting unintended concentration of power. They must also corral DeFi products and services that have escaped oversight because of their technological novelty. The notion of community self-interest leading to self-correcting mechanisms that limit risks, and contentions that these products are by design safe and secure, are not tenable. A well-designed dose of regulatory oversight might be just the tonic needed to bring stability to this sector, prevent it from exacerbating existing inequities and allow us to glean the benefits of these new technologies while limiting the risks.,,Eswar Prasad,2022-05-31T12:31:09.589Z,

The problems started with Terra and Luna, a linked set of digital tokens popular with crypto traders, but the growing fallout has hit the value of more established cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. On the Money Clinic podcast this week, presenter Claer Barrett talks to two young investors who have lost significant sums of money dabbling in unregulated assets. In Bangalore, 29-year-old Subbaiah could only watch in horror as his $7,000 crypto holdings were reduced to a few hundred dollars following the collapse of Luna. Not only has he lost his life savings, he still has to repay money he borrowed on credit cards to boost his trades. In London, 34-year-old listener Dan has seen thousands of pounds wiped off his holdings in bitcoin and ether. Although he had limited his stakes to a small percentage of his overall portfolio, the crash has shaken his faith in crypto’s long-term investment potential. Scott Chipolina, the FT’s digital assets correspondent, and Ilan Solot, a partner at crypto group Tagus Capital, discuss what the future could hold for crypto as an asset class, what more could be done to protect consumers — and the steps investors can take to protect themselves.

Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every weekday Good morning. Ethan here; Rob’s out sick. All eyes were on JPMorgan’s investor conference yesterday. On top of raising its 2022 interest income target, it put in a much-needed good word for the health of the consumer. Consumer credit, executives said, largely looks strong. JPMorgan stock rose 6 per cent, dragging the market up. Email us: robert.armstrong@ft.com and ethan.wu@ft.com. “It’s blockchain, not bitcoin” was something you used to hear more often. The idea was that bitcoin was a mostly trivial project with an interesting technology at its heart. Enterprising companies would extract the value blockchain had to offer and bitcoin would become irrelevant. But as crypto expanded past bitcoin, people dropped the refrain. Google searches for “blockchain not bitcoin” peaked in 2017. Five years on, here’s a story from the FT’s Eva Szalay: BNP Paribas has joined JPMorgan in using digital tokens for short-term trading in [repo] markets . . .  JPMorgan’s blockchain allows banks to lend out US government bonds for a few hours as collateral, without the bonds leaving their balance sheets. Post-crisis regulatory requirements demand that banks hold large amounts of liquid assets — which can be bought and sold easily even during times of market stress — such as Treasuries as a safety buffer. By tokenising these assets banks can temporarily turn them into collateral for a few hours, but without lowering their safety buffers, which are calculated at the end of each day. The token represents a digital version of a Treasury and borrowers can exchange it for cash. Details such as the length of the loan and settlement time are governed by a smart contract, which ensures that the cash is in the borrower’s account and that collateral locked up against loans is released at the end of the deal. More than $300bn worth of such short-term loans have taken place . . . since December 2020. If you’re a long-term holder of (say) ethereum, is this good news for you? It doesn’t look like it. What it looks like is a mainstream institution using blockchain in a way that won’t do anything to encourage adoption of any cryptocurrency. Unlike most popular tokens, JPMorgan’s blockchain is “permissioned”, meaning it gets to select who can participate in the network. It is, in other words, not decentralised. Ethereum-style “smart contracts” are involved, but that’s about it. There is one theory of how this could benefit the crypto ecosystem, though. The idea is that once banks start trading a few assets as tokens, the efficiency gains will prove enticing enough that they’ll want to move other assets on to a blockchain. Some will go to private blockchains such as JPMorgan’s, but existing public chains such as ethereum can compete for that business too. Perhaps public blockchains could start looking better than private ones. As one proponent of this “asset tokenisation” idea explained to me: The banks are going to effectively disintermediate themselves. Not happily, there’s going to be a big battle, but that’s ultimately the direction we’re going in. One important difference between JPMorgan’s blockchain and a public one, however, is the law. JPMorgan can sign agreements with its partners laying out what happens if there’s a glitch or dispute — smart contracts backed by dumb contracts. Are smart contracts on the open internet legally enforceable? It’s unclear. The larger point is that if decentralised crypto — as opposed to a blockchain run by a bank — is going to play a big role in markets, that will involve dealing with some very centralised institutions. Yesterday’s letter made the point that a bear market is a time for greed. Long-term prospective returns are improving. As signs of capitulation and indiscriminate selling emerge, so do buying opportunities. But a number of readers cautioned that we are likely to be a very long way from capitulation. A bubble that took more than a decade to inflate will take more than a few months to deflate. One FT commenter wrote: I fear that when all is said and done, we will look back at these times and say “remember how [at] minus 20 per cent we thought we were close to capitulation? The adjustment was barely starting”. About 100 days since the S&P 500 peaked in January, another reader, Paul Hodges, looked back at how long it took past overvalued markets in 1928 and 1998 to bottom out: We expect it to take a similar 650-700 days to bottom — with obviously some major rallies, or “false dawns”, on the way. Brian Coleman, a former Goldman Sachs trader, argued that the standard bear market playbook may not work this time. “This does not feel like a traditional bear market. It’s been eerily orderly”, with corporate results and economic conditions not yet consistent with recession. It might be, he suggests, that what we are seeing is not, or not only, a bubble deflating but a shift in market paradigms, with a generation of low interest rates, globalisation, growth and relatively free markets coming to an end. The end of the coronavirus pandemic, with all its economic peculiarities, muddies the picture further. In all, history may be a poor guide to what happens next. He thinks we need to “focus on known unknowns”: If there is an elephant left in the room, it has to be (as always) in opaque parts of the markets. And the last man standing in this regard seems to be privates [private equity and debt]. We have all read about privates not wanting to test valuations, so they raise convertibles etc. Let’s see where that goes . . .  Our friend Dec Mullarkey at SLC Management is more optimistic: The sell-off has been broad and deep as investors and companies handicap how aggressive the Fed will be . . . History suggests these monetary episodes don’t end well, but equity markets are pricing a very nasty outcome with an overwhelming number of industries getting pummeled . . . The sell-off has been remarkably non-discriminating. But markets generally need a macro reason to turn. A quick retracement in inflation would help. Therefore, could be a sideways market for a while. To be more optimistic, what we need to see is “a hint that investors are becoming more discriminating on value as they pore over the wide swath of beat-up valuations”. And on Monday, we saw one such hint, as bank stocks rallied after JPMorgan raised its outlook for interest income, “an indicator of a conservative quality buyer deciding the dividend yield looks attractive given the backdrop of solid balance sheets. Feels like an encouraging step, indicating investors are becoming more comfortable picking over areas that have been savaged.” Rana Foroohar is sick of Davos.

The French bank has joined a blockchain-powered network run by its US rival, which has already attracted more than $300bn of deals since its launch in December. The arrangement represents the first steps in efforts to use digital tokens in one of the crucial links of the global financial system. The repurchase, or repo, market is used by investors to borrow high-quality assets for a couple of days, and by central banks to conduct their monetary policies. Three-quarters of deals are backed by government bonds, according to the Bank for International Settlements, making the market a key source of high-quality collateral for banks to fund their balance sheets or find the funds to support their derivatives positions. JPMorgan’s blockchain allows banks to lend out US government bonds for a few hours as collateral, without the bonds leaving their balance sheets. Post-crisis regulatory requirements demand that banks hold large amounts of liquid assets — which can be bought and sold easily even during times of market stress — such as Treasuries as a safety buffer. By tokenising these assets banks can temporarily turn them into collateral for a few hours, but without lowering their safety buffers, which are calculated at the end of each day. The token represents a digital version of a Treasury and borrowers can exchange it for cash. Details such as the length of the loan and settlement time are governed by a smart contract, which ensures that the cash is in the borrower’s account and that collateral locked up against loans is released at the end of the deal. More than $300bn worth of such short-term loans have taken place on JPMorgan’s blockchain technology platform Onyx Digital Assets since December 2020. Joe Bonnaud, global markets chief operating officer and head of engineering at BNP Paribas, said the two main-use cases for the bank were securities financing and intraday repo. “This is not just proof-of-concept work, we see this as part of our efforts to utilise the technology for the whole trading and operations lifecycle as the market evolves,” he added. Scott Lucas, head of markets DLT at JPMorgan, said that the bank was exploring other fixed-income assets against which traders could borrow. “We are looking at broadening the set of eligibility criteria in addition to US treasuries,” Lucas said. More participants are joining the platform, including banks and their clients from Europe, the UK and Asia. JPMorgan has made a big push into digital assets in recent years despite its chief executive Jamie Dimon often hitting a critical note about digital assets such as bitcoin. The bank’s Onyx unit has been experimenting with deploying blockchain technology across traditional markets, with a former senior executive in the division Christine Moy recently noting that JPMorgan was the first bank to provide regulated crypto exchanges with bank accounts. In mid-February, JPMorgan also became the first major bank to set up a presence in the metaverse. Aside from broadening its collateral criteria, the bank is also looking at ways it could provide its professional clients with access to new markets. Tyrone Lobban, head of Onyx Digital Assets at JPMorgan said that the bank was also exploring the possibility of using Onyx as a gateway to decentralised finance markets for institutional investors.,,Eva Szalay,2022-05-23T07:23:11.615Z,

The maggot-infested meal struck a chord with the disgruntled Shanghai public weeks into an indefinite lockdown without access to basic food and medical supplies. One student penned an angry response that quickly became a symbol of silent resistance, spreading across social media platforms. Censors deleted reposts of his outburst on the microblogging site Weibo, but the expletive-laden message was immortalised online after being turned into a small piece of digital art preserved on the blockchain. The incident spawned a series of non-fungible tokens, a form of digital artwork, which have spread during the Shanghai lockdown as a way to preserve criticism of the city’s Omicron outbreak beyond the reach of censors. China’s censors have been at the forefront of the information battle during the country’s worst coronavirus outbreak in two years. They have systematically erased critical articles and posts on mainstream social media sites about the heavy burden of the strict lockdown measures. But the growing popularity of blockchain technology has presented a fresh challenge to the country’s censorship regime. Once data is sent to a blockchain network, it cannot be deleted or altered by higher authorities. The country’s internet police worked in a frenzy to erase the viral “Voice of April” video from domestic social media, a six-minute protest video documenting the suffering experienced by people in Shanghai cooped up at home. Just as the video was taken down from Weibo and the messaging app WeChat, tech-savvy netizens uploaded snapshots of the video to the blockchain, casting them into NFTs. “Censors cannot delete information from the blockchain,” said Barney Tan, head of the school of information systems and technology management at UNSW Sydney. One Chinese blockchain enthusiast said the technology has become more user-friendly in the past few years, making it easier to upload and read articles on the decentralised database. “People have been posting critical articles on the blockchain, so the government cannot delete them. It’s happening more now because blockchain technology is getting better,” the person added, who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. But Tan noted that even though censors cannot scrub out information from the blockchain, “they can still block access to it” by preventing people from sharing links on social media. Chinese citizens have found creative ways to adapt to online life under censorship. The blockchain enthusiast noted that in many of his WeChat groups, friends were sharing censored articles flipped upside down to avoid algorithmic screening. However, censors are typically only one step behind, quickly discovering the attempts to avoid censorship and ensuring that new leaks of sensitive information do not spark wider online protests. The goal is to prevent critical posts “from becoming viral or politically mobilised,” explained Rogier Creemers, an expert on China’s digital technology at Leiden University. Liu Lipeng, who used to work as a censor for Weibo before moving to the US, said censors do not solely rely on deleting posts. “Now they also spread fear” to stop sensitive information leaking online, he said. In Shanghai, which is now in its eighth week of lockdown, residents have recorded videos of pandemic workers warning them against spreading “false rumours” about life under lockdown. Liu said the measures had stifled public discussion in Shanghai. China’s censorship has been more effective during the financial city’s current lockdown than during the initial outbreak in Wuhan two years ago, Liu added. He noted that several prominent critics and whistleblowers emerged during the early months of the lockdown, including writer Fang Fang and doctors Ai Fen and Li Wenliang. “In Shanghai, no one dares to speak up publicly,” Liu said. This month, a leaked article from a prominent Shanghai law scholar condemning the city’s lockdown policies as unconstitutional appeared to break the silence. Professor Tong Zhiwei from Shanghai’s East China University of Political Science and Law warned that the city’s lockdown measures would lead to “some kind of legal disaster”. Recommended “Pandemic protection needs to be balanced with ensuring people’s rights and freedoms,” he wrote, casting doubt on the legality of some of the city’s heavy-handed measures, including forcing residents living in the same apartment block as a positive Covid-19 case to move into centralised quarantine facilities. Tong’s article circulated on Weibo and WeChat for several hours before censors deleted it. But by that time, it had already been permanently etched into the blockchain. The article is still visible to people in China with the technological knowhow and time to find it. But experts said that from a censorship perspective, in an age where people are inundated with information, it is enough that the sensitive information has been banished to an inaccessible corner of the internet. “The information control system is never going to work perfectly. But in China, it works well enough to limit information to a small number of computer nerds,” said Creemers. “From the perspective of regime integrity and stability, the censors have reached their goal,” he added.,,Eleanor Olcott Gloria Li,2022-05-19T04:00:30.423Z,

According to people with knowledge of the company’s plan, Japan’s largest investment bank will combine a number of digital asset services under a single wholly-owned subsidiary that will have a staff of about 100 by the end of 2024. Last week, Nomura successfully executed its first bitcoin futures and options trades on Chicago-based futures exchange CME by DRW’s crypto-trading arm Cumberland. The unveiling of Nomura’s plans, which have been under discussion for four years, coincides with a spectacular crash in the value of some of the world’s most prominent cryptocurrencies, sparking concerns about the entire crypto market. While crypto investors are keen to interpret the recent volatility as a “correction”, the bitcoin price last week slumped below $30,000 for the first time since last summer and tether — the largest stablecoin — failed to maintain its link with the US dollar. The new company, which will be run by current Nomura executives but will hire extensively from outside, will allow the Japanese brokerage to compete with other major global banks already offering institutional clients services and products linked to bitcoin, stable coins and other digital assets. Nomura joins Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Bank of New York Mellon and other global financial institutions that have all become active in the cryptocurrency market in recent years. What is behind the turmoil we've been seeing in the cryptocurrencies markets recently? @ScottChipolina @jemimajoanna @kadhim and @SVR13 will be discussing this on Twitter Spaces today at 3.30pm BST/10.30am ET. To send questions, reply below https://t.co/mC48dfhapI “If we don’t do this, then it’s going to be more difficult down the line to be competitive,” said one of the Nomura executives, who said that despite the questions that surround digital assets, the opportunity cost of failing to offer investment facilities to institutional clients was too high. Despite the risks associated with digital assets, Nomura executives said that interest from institutional clients was strong and would continue to grow as the market for cryptocurrencies, NFTs and other assets grew attractive as a means of diversifying more traditionally run portfolios. “Any asset class at the moment that has discounted cash flow is all under huge stress in an inflationary environment. But I think . . . many managers will be looking and thinking about potentially allocating towards blockchain technology and blockchain opportunities,” the Nomura executive said.

Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the digital asset exchange FTX, said the proof of work system of validating blockchain transactions, which underpins bitcoin, was not capable of scaling up to cope with the millions of transactions that would be needed to make the cryptocurrency an effective means of payment. “The bitcoin network is not a payments network and it is not a scaling network,” said Bankman-Fried. His comments came as the fast-growing cryptocurrency market was hit by a punishing sell-off that left bitcoin down by more than 35 per cent since January, at its lowest level since late 2020. Bitcoin is still seen by some crypto enthusiasts as a way to conduct everyday transactions. Countries such as El Salvador and the Central African Republic have adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender. But recent research by academics in the US found that Bitcoin has scarcely been used for daily payments in El Salvador, despite the rollout of bitcoin ATMs and other measures to encourage its use. The 30-year-old billionaire, who has expanded FTX into one of the world’s largest virtual asset exchanges, said an alternative type of blockchain known as proof of stake, or other technological innovations, would be required to create a functional crypto payments network. What is behind the turmoil we've been seeing in the cryptocurrencies markets recently? @ScottChipolina @jemimajoanna @kadhim and @SVR13 will be discussing this on Twitter Spaces today at 3.30pm BST/10.30am ET. To send questions, reply below https://t.co/mC48dfhapI Ethereum has been working to move to a proof of stake system, which is intended to be less energy-intensive. “Things that you’re doing millions of transactions a second with have to be extremely efficient and lightweight and lower energy cost. Proof of stake networks are,” said Bankman-Fried. His criticisms of bitcoin underscored serious environmental concerns about the amount of energy needed to run proof of work crypto systems. Some European regulators have called for a ban on the systems owing to their carbon emissions. Mining bitcoin consumes more energy than many countries, including Norway and Sweden, according to Cambridge university’s Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. Recommended “It has to be the case that we don’t scale this up to the point where we’re spending 100 times as much eventually as we are today on energy costs for mining,” Bankman-Fried said. FTX has used carbon offsets to compensate for the company’s emissions, which Bankman-Fried said was worthwhile but not a complete solution “because you just run out of things to offset at some point”. But despite his views on bitcoin, Bankman-Fried said he still believed the world’s biggest digital asset had a place in the crypto market. “I don’t think that means bitcoin has to go,” he said, adding that the token may still have a future as “an asset, a commodity and a store of value” akin to gold.,,Joshua Oliver,2022-05-16T04:00:35.604Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/536c4e3f-bb25-4137-884e-5a7273b02865,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,First crypto ETFs to launch in Australia underwhelm on debut,Funds from ETF Securities and Cosmos beat rivals to market despite delays,Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools The culmination of a five-year battle to launch the first spot cryptocurrency exchange traded funds in the Asia-Pacific region has been greeted by muted demand. Bitcoin and ether ETFs managed by Sydney-based ETF Securities, in conjunction with Switzerland’s 21Shares, started trading on Thursday on the Cboe Australia exchange. Fellow Sydneysiders Cosmos Asset Management’s bitcoin feeder ETF also launched the same day on the same exchange. The listings mark the latest stage in the globalisation of exchange traded products investing in “physical” cryptocurrency, which have hitherto only been available in Canada, Brazil and a swath of European countries. US regulators have only permitted futures-based crypto ETFs so far, while the UK has not even done that. The Australian launches come five years after ETF Securities first approached regulators with the idea of launching a crypto ETF in 2017. However, the end of the lengthy gestation period comes just as digital currencies have fallen out of favour, with bitcoin falling below $30,000 for the first time since July this week — cementing a 50 per cent slide from November’s highs — and turbulence erupting in the market for so-called stablecoins such as Tether and TerraUSD. ETFS 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (EBTC) saw total trading volume of A$1.4mn in its first two days and ETFS 21Shares Ethereum ETF (EETH) A$1.2mn, with the Cosmos Purpose Bitcoin Access ETF (CBTC) seeing volume of A$648,000. “In our view, the lower-than-expected trading volumes owe to the state of the crypto market,” said Kanish Chugh, head of distribution at ETF Securities. “The prices of cryptocurrencies have fallen sharply the past seven days. Stablecoins are under attack, with Terra imploding. This has sent ripples throughout the crypto industry.” Chugh also pointed to the “unprecedentedly high” margin requirements for crypto ETFs set by clearing house ASX Clear, which “have made it very expensive for brokers and platforms to support trading”. ASX Clear set the margin requirement for crypto ETFs of at least 40 per cent in order to cover settlement risks, due to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. “The lack of broker and platform connectivity has meant many Australian investors who want to buy bitcoin and ether ETFs cannot do so,” said Chugh. “We understand some influential brokers are pressuring the clearinghouse to change the margin requirements.” Nevertheless Chugh remained upbeat, saying: “Australian investor interest in cryptocurrencies has not waned in recent months even as we have seen underperformance. And with bitcoin’s recent sell off as well, it may present an opportunity for investors who have been looking for attractive entry points into this new asset class”. The single largest source of buying in early trading was Commsec, the largest self-directed trading platform in Australia, he noted. Recommended ETFS and Cosmos will be hoping to secure “first-mover advantage” in the market, with New York-based VanEck expected to launch a rival product on the ASX, Australia’s primary exchange, in the coming weeks, and Canada’s 3iQ Digital Asset Management to debut another ETF on the Cboe Australia exchange. Both ETFS and Cosmos had been planning to launch their funds two weeks ago, only for a last-minute problem to emerge with what 21Shares chief executive Hany Rashwan called a “downstream infrastructure provider”, believed to be a prime broker or clearer. The products take different approaches. CBTC is a feeder fund that buys units in the $1.1bn Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC), which listed in Toronto in February 2020. In contrast, EBTC and EETH invest directly in the underlying securities. They have been built in partnership with 21Shares — the largest crypto ETP manager in the world with more than 30 products and $2.5bn of assets under management — which provides research and operational support. All three vehicles have annual fees of 1.25 per cent. ETF Securities said the funds were a “major step in the mainstreaming of cryptocurrency ownership”, allowing investors to trade and own crypto in a “tightly regulated environment with government oversight”. “Up until now, Australians wanting to buy bitcoin or ether have been forced onto unregulated crypto exchanges, which come with weaker investor protections,” it added. For his part Rashwan saw the listing an “early entry point to the entire APAC region”, given Australia’s role as an Asia-Pacific investment hub. Rashwan, who launched the first crypto ETP in the world in Zurich in 2019, added that 21Shares was “looking at several dozen countries around the world” in a quest to launch more such vehicles. “We are expanding beyond Europe,” he said. Established North American crypto managers are also keen to muscle in on the Australian — and wider Asian — market even if they have been beaten to the punch timing wise. The planned offerings from 3iQ, which claims to be Canada’s largest manager of digital assets, with $2bn, will also be feeder funds. The 3iQ CoinShares Bitcoin Feeder ETF and the 3iQ CoinShares Ether Feeder ETF, also due to be listed on Cboe Australia, will purchase units in two existing ETFs listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. VanEck also has experience in the field, running a bitcoin futures ETF and private spot bitcoin fund in the US, and more than a dozen spot crypto exchange traded notes in Europe, alongside a wide range of other offerings. Its proposed Australian ETF will invest directly in bitcoin and be listed on the ASX, which last week formally added digital assets to the list of eligible underlying assets for funds listed on the exchange. Arian Neiron, chief executive of VanEck Asia Pacific, was unperturbed about rivals getting to market first. “For something as commoditised as bitcoin, it will come down to the quality of the product and the price. The ASX was our choice of exchange and we’re confident that’s the way to go,” he said. Because Australians primarily invest via superannuation schemes, Neiron said “they have a conservative disposition. They want a strong brand and a strong balance sheet that is global and [a fund] that is on the main board of the ASX.” Visit our ETF Hub to find out more and to explore our in-depth data and comparison tools,,Steve Johnson,2022-05-15T16:40:30.887Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/0064e0a2-2210-45de-b366-b0439cb575a2,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Can blockchain smooth global supply chains?,Digitising shipping processes throws up a range of regulatory challenges,From finance to art, blockchain enthusiasts have long claimed the technology can transform a range of industries. But, now, lawyer Martyn Huckerby believes the technology could help solve the global supply chain crisis. Huckerby is head of competition law at Tiang & Partners, a Hong Kong-based law firm. And, recently, he led a team of lawyers as they helped establish the Global Shipping Business Network (GSBN), which was launched last year with the aim of increasing digitisation in the global logistics industry. “There are a lot of challenges in the [shipping and logistics industries] at the moment,” he says. “The founding members [of GSBN] have seen an opportunity. “It is the kind of thing most lawyers would like to have the chance to work on. And it is something that will hopefully help the world,” he adds. The supply chain is a very fragmented market with participants who largely rely on paper The global supply chain certainly needs assistance. From the outbreak of Covid-19 to the war in Ukraine and China’s recent lockdowns, a string of extraordinary events has upended the system that ensures the smooth movement of goods across the world. GSBN’s aim is to use blockchain to build a repository of digital data on global trade flows that will help “streamline operations across the entire supply chain”. To try to achieve this ambition, Huckerby and his team had to tackle a number of legal and regulatory obstacles, not least because some of the founding members are Chinese state-owned companies. “The supply chain is a very fragmented market with participants who largely rely on paper,” explains Bertrand Chen, chief executive of GSBN. He believes digitising logistics will speed up trade. “The biggest issue is: how do we share the data?” Blockchain — a technology typically associated with cryptocurrencies — is a catch-all term for a type of encrypted digital ledger used for recording transactions. Law firms face challenge of taking political stance on clients US-China rift becomes a legal feud Legal ideas that boost business in the Asia-Pacific region Tech skills help transform lawyers’ working habits GSBN, whose membership comprises eight shipping and port operators across the world, hopes to use it as the backbone for a secure database that various businesses can contribute to, and draw insights from. From supermarkets across the world struggling to fill shelves to carmakers waiting for parts, fractures have emerged quickly in the network of manufacturers, shippers and financial institutions that work together to deliver goods. By helping these businesses to work collaboratively, GSBN believes that its technology may “simplify global trade for all”. However, the prospect of some of the world’s largest shipping and port groups pulling together to share proprietary data was always likely to raise questions about the project’s compliance with competition laws. In the context of the political environment, we had to tread very carefully Convincing US regulators to get on board has been a particular challenge, given nervousness among officials in the country about the integration of Chinese technology into international infrastructure. GSBN, based in Hong Kong, counts Chinese state companies Cosco Shipping and Shanghai International Port Group among the alliance, for instance. “In the context of the political environment, we had to tread very carefully,” Huckerby says. But he notes that GSBN received the go-ahead in July 2020 from the US’s Federal Maritime Commission, which regulates international ocean transportation. Addressing regulators’ concerns was made more complicated by the Covid pandemic. Because GSBN is international in scope, Tiang & Partners had to ensure the project was compliant with a range of national antitrust laws — and, in one case, that meant testimonies being given to Chilean authorities via video chat. The use of a technology so closely associated with crypto was also likely to make regulators wary. “Because GSBN is based on blockchain technology, we are dealing with issues the competition regulators have not seen before,” says Huckerby. [Authorised users] will only see the data they are supposed to see To Chen, though, the technology is key to the project’s success. “Blockchain is actually the most inefficient way to store data — we don’t want to do it if it’s not essential,” he says. But the encryption technology ensures that GSBN management cannot read the data and that authorised users will “only see the data they are supposed to see”, he explains. In July 2021, GSBN announced it had launched a service called Cargo Release in China. It said that, by eliminating the need for the exchange of paper documents, the time taken to process forms to release cargo in Shanghai has been cut from two to three days to less than three hours. The service has since been rolled out across south-east Asia and in Rotterdam, the EU’s biggest port. More recently, GSBN has announced the launch of a finance advisory group with Singapore’s DBS, HSBC bank, and Bank of China, to consider how banks can use its data for risk assessment when providing financing to the shipping sector. GSBN’s products are still in the early stages, but both Huckerby and Chen argue that blockchain has a long-term role to play in global supply chains. With other blockchain projects for the shipping industry in the works, however, there is no guarantee that GSBN’s project will emerge as the blockchain tool of choice. “It does not have to be us, we are not that arrogant,” says Chen. But, he adds: “We believe that long term, the industry has to adopt some form of technology. Blockchain has to stay in the industry”. Creating new standards Enabling business growth Case studies in best practice. Researched and compiled by RSGI. “Winner” indicates the organisation won an FT Innovative Lawyers 2022 award; other organisations are listed alphabetically. WINNER: Mori Hamada & Matsumoto The firm advised cloud-based video management platform Safie on its initial public offering, which included a rarely used feature called oyabike, which allocates securities at the behest of the selling shareholder. Normally, a “gun-jumping” rule pertains that prohibits solicitation of shares prior to an IPO. However, partner Katsumasa Suzuki convinced the Japan Securities Dealers Association that oyabike could be used to include cornerstone investors that commit to investing a fixed amount of money or shares, without breaching this rule. The approach has been replicated in other recent IPOs and increases Japan’s appeal as a listing location. Anand and Anand The firm represented US-based hotel chain Renaissance Hotel Holding in a long-running trademark infringement case in India. The firm appealed against an earlier decision by the Supreme Court of India that had stated there was no copyright infringement. The lawyers successfully argued that there is no other relevant factor in whether copyright has been infringed besides which business registered the copyright in India first. The judgment in January 2022 ended 14 years of litigation by the client and has clarified the law for brand owners. Baker McKenzie TV boxes, or “illicit streaming devices”, are commonly sold in Malaysia to stream television and films illegally. Acting for television company Astro, the firm successfully argued in the Kuala Lumpur Intellectual Property High Court that selling these boxes is copyright infringement. The decision contributed to an amendment to the Malaysian Copyright Act in December 2021 that makes it one of the first countries in the Asia-Pacific region to legislate specifically against illegal streaming technology. Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas The firm advised the Indian government on its sale of heavily indebted national airline Air India. A previous attempt had failed in 2018 because of lack of buyer interest. The firm restructured the parameters and processes of the divestment to attract bidders. In 2021, Air India was sold to Tata Group, the country’s largest conglomerate, following recalibrations to reduce the buyer’s exposure to the airline’s debt. King & Wood Mallesons Since 2020, the firm has worked on behalf of more than 115 private equity funds launching in Hong Kong under the Limited Partnership Fund Ordinance — legislation enacted that year to bolster the private equity market in Hong Kong. Partner Jingjing Jiang negotiated with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Hong Kong’s de facto central bank, and the Companies Registry to obtain an amendment to the Ordinance. This allows funds to have multiple managers, aligning the regime with other jurisdictions and making it a more attractive proposition to the funds. Lander & Rogers Property lawyers collaborated with the firm’s innovation team and Australian blockchain company BeNext to develop a user-friendly contract that gives real estate agents authorisation to act on behalf of sellers. The lawyers consolidated the varied legislation across Australian states to standardise and simplify the agreement. Using BeNext’s platform, real estate agents can draft, store and track contracts digitally. Nagashima Ohno & Tsunematsu In March 2021, Japanese messaging app Line reported that its users’ personal information had been accessible to a Chinese subsidiary since 2018, leading to public outcry. The firm’s crisis management team, led by Daisuke Fukamizu, determined that, although there was no breach of contract, internal procedures at Line had to change. The case resulted in proposals from the firm and client for improving Line’s corporate data governance, which other Japanese companies are also implementing. WongPartnership The firm advised HSBC in the bank’s provision of rescue financing to interior design company Design Studio Group, including a “roll-up” — or conversion — of pre-existing debt, whereby all or part of the rescue financing proceeds go towards paying off the pre-existing debt owed to the rescue lender, which is upgraded to a super-priority debt. The High Court of Singapore had not previously approved a rescue financing structure that included a roll-up. By successfully arguing its case, the firm set a precedent that financial institutions in the region can use when financing other distressed companies. Case studies in best practice. Researched and compiled by RSGI. “Winner” indicates the organisation won an FT Innovative Lawyers 2022 award; other organisations are listed alphabetically. WINNER: Tiang & Partners In 2021, Tiang & Partners law firm, collaborating with PwC Consulting in Hong Kong, helped a consortium of shipping carriers and terminal operators to create Global Shipping Business Network, a non-profit blockchain platform for shipping-industry data. The project raised a number of competition law questions, including securing antitrust clearances relating to many countries. But the use of blockchain provides security because it allows data to be amalgamated for collaborative automation projects without being shared between unauthorised parties. The first tool launched on the platform, Cargo Release, automates the documentation for cargo to be released at a port. In trials in Shanghai, the tool cut the process time from up to three days to a couple of hours. Allen & Gledhill The firm advised on CapitaLand’s S$10.3bn restructuring in 2021, to separate the property developer’s real estate and fund management units. CapitaLand’s real estate development business was put under private ownership of CLA Real Estate Holdings, and the rest of the business listed separately as CapitaLand Investment Management, in order to maximise shareholder value. It is unusual for a privatisation, demerger and listing to take place in one transaction in Singapore. Corrs Chambers Westgarth The firm advised on the US listing of Tritium, an Australian company that designs and manufactures fast chargers for electric vehicles. This was the first time an Australian company has listed in the US by merging with a US special purpose acquisition company — a so-called de-Spac structure. The firm project-managed the Australian side of the deal, negotiating with the regulators and working out the structure. Tritium DCFC received a $1.2bn dollar valuation. Dechert The firm advised on the delisting of asset manager New Century Asset Management’s real estate investment trust (Reit) from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in August 2021. As the first delisting of a Hong Kong-listed Reit, the team had to ensure fair considerations were given to unit-holders, negotiating details with the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong. This created a template for the dissolution of Reits, which has since been replicated. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer In January 2022, telecoms providers Indosat and Hutchison 3 Indonesia announced a $6bn merger to form Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison, Indonesia’s second largest telecommunications company. With support from local Indonesian law firm HHP, Freshfields devised a merger structure and led on drafting agreements and obtaining regulatory approvals for a public merger between unrelated parties — a market first for Indonesia. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer The consumer finance arm of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, one of Japan’s largest banks, acquired a $1bn, 49 per cent stake in FE Credit, a Vietnamese consumer loan provider. On behalf of the bank, the firm’s cross-border team negotiated with Japanese and Vietnamese regulators to complete a deal that provides a model for future Japanese finance and fintech investment in Vietnam. Latham & Watkins Following the January 2020 revision of the implementing rules in the Philippines Real Estate Investment Trust (Reit) Act, the firm advised on five Reit offerings, including the very first one. Representing real estate company Megaworld, Benjamin Carale, a partner at the firm, led a team that developed the blueprint for Philippine Reit offerings, with more due to be announced this year. Pinsent Masons The firm advised Ventia, the Australian infrastructure operations and management company, on its successful bid for a 25-year operations contract for the state of Victoria’s largest road and tunnelling project: the North East Link. The bid model, which is also being replicated elsewhere, included a unique risk allocation framework and an adaptable plan to allow for more energy efficient technologies that become available over the lifespan of the project. The contract is worth A$15bn. S&R Associates In the first Term Loan B facility debt financing involving an Indian company, the firm enabled Oyo, a hotel, hospitality and tech company, to raise funds from a pool of global investors. The firm created a structure that navigated Indian exchange and control regulations and raised $660mn. This means of financing has since been replicated by other Indian businesses. Sullivan & Cromwell The firm helped telecoms company China Mobile list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange in January 2022 after it was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. This initial public offering was the first time a Hong Kong incorporated and listed company has listed in mainland China. The firm navigated a variety of complex legal issues including revising China Mobile’s constitutional documents to comply with both Hong Kong and mainland Chinese laws. China Mobile’s Shanghai IPO raised $7.5bn.,,Oliver Telling,2022-05-12T21:30:54.281Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/f5e3bdb1-0ef3-4923-abd8-00e9297d3508,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Web3 for beginners — a new realm with endless possibilities,This new version of the internet is complex but there are ways to get a handle on it and discover its potential,The writer is an investor in technology start-ups at Samos Investments Web3 — or the new internet — is edging into the mainstream. This new version of the web is built with blockchain technology, which is based on the concept of decentralisation and allows for more transparency. Blockchain supports digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The art, fashion, gaming and finance worlds are already exploring the potential of this new realm. From Starbucks’ plans to launch NFTs for coffee drinkers to gain access to “experiences” to Gucci auctioning an NFT to raise money for Unicef USA. However, the complexity of the space and lack of engineering knowhow to create tokens have been a barrier to participation — many people just don’t know where to start. I am a late adopter, but I am fascinated and decided I needed to learn much more. A friend of mine told me about a community she was part of called Astro Girls Society. With a collection of 3,888 painted “Astro Girl” NFTs, it is an initiative to bring women into Web3 and is the perfect place to learn from other NFT owners. Of course, the first condition of joining was to purchase an Astro Girl NFT, which I did through NFT marketplace OpenSea. As a member, I have access to learning sessions. More importantly, the artists who design the NFTs receive a portion of funds generated from their sale. But selecting an NFT is like picking out art — you won’t know if it will go up in value, so buy something you really like that grants you access to a community you value. Once I found the NFT I wanted (“Peaceful Saturn”, with purple hair and covered in stars), I bought it using MetaMask, a cryptocurrency wallet. I was then accepted into the Astro Girls Discord channel — an online group hangout. And so the learning began. Recommended The gaming world’s transition to web3 is probably the easiest for beginners to understand. Sandbox, started in 2012, is a gaming metaverse where players can build, own and monetise their games. Sand, a utility token built on blockchain technology called Ethereum, is used for transactions and interactions. For those struggling with the concept of owning real estate in the metaverse, Sandbox helps to put it into context. You need to own digital land in order to build digital assets. If you have experience of online gaming platforms Roblox or Minecraft, it is similar to being responsible for building up a patch of the game that others can experience. Web3 is also changing approaches to recruitment. TechTree, a hiring marketplace, has built an online community for developers that incentivises them to refer the best developers for jobs using “bounties” as a reward. For anyone tired of recruiters pocketing commission, or referring friends for jobs and receiving no reward, this is a solution. The platform makes you feel as if you are in the “metaverse” and bounties can either be cashed in or given to a charity. But the intersection between Web3 and finance is one that could really accelerate positive change, reducing inequality and increasing economic participation. For example, in Africa “the potential and importance of DeFi [decentralised finance] can’t be understated”, says Yele Bademosi, the co-founder of Nestcoin, a Nigerian start-up focused on making cryptocurrencies accessible. Those in hard-to-reach communities lack access to bank accounts and other financial services, but Bademosi adds that anyone with an internet connection and a smartphone can access stablecoins and savings accounts. Stablecoins are less volatile cryptocurrencies pegged to an asset or to a fiat currency. There are downsides, however. Some blockchains use algorithms that require enormous computing power and are therefore energy intensive. Further, while blockchain is considered highly secure, it is not impenetrable. High-profile hacks include the more than $300mn worth of ether, another cryptocurrency, stolen from Wormhole, a bridge that facilitates the movement of crypto from one blockchain to another. These concerns are not to be taken lightly, but the opportunity to redistribute power and widen access to finance, and even job opportunities, is exciting.,,June Angelides,2022-05-09T03:00:34.791Z,

https://www.ft.com/content/91a96ce3-6bec-42fe-a174-d293d4be0b60,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Rishi Sunak wants Britain to be a “global hub” for crypto. Sigh,Because being a global hub for other dodgy assets has worked out so well.,Oh, Rishi. What a pity! Where did those simpler times go, where you were content to just sit there looking all dishy in your hoodie, perfecting your P-Diddy-style celebrity autograph? Why must you insist on being so fishy? It feels like you are starting to take the Royal mickey! Yes, we are referring to Monday’s news that the Right Honourable Rishi Sunak, Chancellor of the Exchequer, is following in the right honourable footsteps of the “world’s coolest dictator”, El Salvador’s bitcoin-bro president Nayib Bukele, by commissioning the Royal Mint to issue an NFT in a bid to turn Great Britain into the world’s number 1 crypto nation. Why is the Treasury doing this at such a time of trouble? This must be somehow connected to Britain’s cost-of-living crisis or something equally serious, right? Almost. The NFT will serve as “an emblem of the forward-looking approach the UK is determined to take”. So a blockchain-based digital receipt for a JPEG that you don’t actually own is emblematic of Britain’s future. Just marvellous. From our Rishi on Monday: We're working to make the UK a global cryptoassets hub. We want to see the businesses of tomorrow, and the jobs they create, here in the UK. Today @JohnGlenUK set out how we are going to encourage crypto investment and technology in UK markets. 👇https://t.co/MdZ5IOLZtH In the speech Sunak is referring to (the whole thing is worth reading in full but please make sure you have not just eaten), economic secretary John Glen sets out which side the Treasury is on when it comes to the debate around crypto. Here’s an excerpt (with our emphasis): If there is one message I want you to leave here today with, it is that the UK is open for business — open for crypto businesses. We’re still right on the cusp of this technology breaking through. But there isn’t even consensus on what the implications of crypto are . . . when or whether we’re going to reach some kind of steady state . . . or even whether crypto itself is a good thing. There’s a massive debate between the sceptics and the evangelists, and there are a wide range of views in between. Some people worry deeply about crypto . . . and about how it’s going to harm consumers . . . or provide a platform for illicit activity free from government oversight . . . or drive-up carbon emissions. Others say it’s the best thing ever. They argue that crypto could do things like revolutionise global finance . . . by making financial exchanges more transparent, efficient and democratic, and placing currency in the hands of people not nations. That leaves us here in the UK with a big question to answer: How are we going to respond? Our answer is this: If crypto-technologies are going to be a big part of the future, then we — the UK — want to be in, and in on the ground floor. We’re not sure about you, but to us it rather feels like the Treasury is choosing to ignore all that boring stuff about illicit activity and carbon emissions, and instead to embrace the side that thinks crypto is “the best thing ever”. The side that thinks it will make financial exchanges “more transparent, efficient and democratic” (groan) and who believe in “placing currency in the hands of people not nations” (bigger groan). After some fluff about how the UK will ensure that “regulators have the right tools to manage the associated risks” and how the government would be “looking closely at energy usage associated with certain crypto-technologies” (that should do it), the crypto-evangelism intensifies: We see enormous potential in crypto . . . and we want to give ourselves every chance to take maximum advantage. We aren’t going to lower our standards, but we are going to maintain our technologically neutral approach. Having robust and effective regulation won’t hinder innovation, it’ll actually boost it — by giving people and businesses the confidence they need to think and invest for the long-term . . .  We have a detailed plan . . . we are, I am, determined to learn quickly . . . and the government will lead the way in harnessing the potential of blockchain and supporting the development of a world-best crypto ecosystem . . .  There’s a genuine opportunity to build on our strengths in fintech, seize the capitalist energy which has already made UK financial services what it is . . . and use it to unleash the potential of crypto-technologies. That’s right, lads, seize that capitalist energy! Unleash the potential of crypto — the UK is wide open for business! WAGMI! It’s almost as if the government hasn’t learned that they should be a little more careful about who and what Britain gets in bed with, isn’t it? We guess that, having lost a few bed partners lately, we’re in need of some fresh meat under the sheets. What could possibly go wrong? Rule, Bit-tannia!

https://www.ft.com/content/52012a01-b608-4a73-a242-4e8bb4f265d4,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Solana: the blockchain touted as an alternative to Ethereum,In addition to volatility, there are valid concerns about security following outages,Cryptocurrency prices may be trading well below their 2021 peak but blockchain euphoria lives on. The dream of instantaneous, automated, transparent and decentralised online transactions is encouraging fresh investment in networks. Solana, launched in 2020 and backed by Silicon Valley venture capital company Andreessen Horowitz, has grabbed attention as the blockchain with a business case. Like Ethereum, it enables smart contracts to be built using its technology. But where Ethereum is slow, only able to handle 13 transactions per second, Solana boasts that it is both faster paced and lower priced. The co-founder of Ethereum claims Solana is paying users more to validate transactions — effectively paying for speed in a way that he says is not sustainable. Sounds like sour grapes. Interest in Solana can be seen in prices for its tokens. The cryptocurrency is now the world’s sixth-largest digital coin according to CoinGecko. A fresh upswing has sent the price up by about a third in the past week. Boosters include use for non-fungible token (NFT) collections and inclusion on large cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. But at $136.50 it remains below the $259 November peak. Like every cryptocurrency, volatility is constant. Investment in blockchain technology requires faith that this represents the building blocks of the next phase of life online and not simply a mechanism for launching more frothy digital currencies. Solana’s ability to support decentralised applications and the idea that it is scalable are the real draw. It is, however, a work in progress. In addition to volatility and the nagging question of future regulation, there are valid concerns about security following outages and legitimate queries about just how decentralised Solana is, particularly when the founding team of Solana Labs accepted a large portion of tokens distributed. It is not even clear that multiple blockchains are necessary. Ethereum’s head start could leave Solana trailing far behind.

https://www.ft.com/content/de3de04f-2675-4d17-bcc9-20bec74bf567,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Musicians turn to NFTs in hunt for fresh profits,More artists experiment with digital tokens but critics question valuations and ultimate worth for fans,DJ Justin Blau was opening up for his superstar peer Avicii on a beach in Mexico when he met the Winklevoss twins, who introduced him to bitcoin. “It couldn’t get more cliché than that,” he says of his 2014 meeting with the Harvard classmates of Mark Zuckerberg, who have since become blockchain evangelists. As a university student, Blau dropped his finance studies and turned down an internship at asset manager BlackRock to pursue a DJ career. Years later, he has combined his dual interests — music and finance — into a business aimed at disrupting the record industry through blockchain technology. On Tuesday he teamed up with longtime friend Diplo, the popular electronic musician, to sell 20 per cent of the streaming royalties of a song to fans in the form of digital tokens. “I’m just fascinated with the idea of there being value for the ownership of music,” Thomas Pentz, known professionally as Diplo, told the Financial Times. “The more people behind your record, whether its fans or investors who are interested in the technology, it’s great to have more people on a team.” In recent months the hype surrounding Web3 — the buzzword for a decentralised, blockchain-powered iteration of the internet — has swept the music industry, drawing the world’s largest music companies to the fray and fuelling hope that non-fungible tokens will become a new source of money for musicians. To sell an NFT, musicians assign their song, video or other piece of media to a digital token. The token is sold through an online auction enabled by blockchain technology, which keeps a record of the transaction. Beyond songs or images, NFTs could also be used to sell perks such as backstage passes or meetings with stars. Head-spinning examples abound. Rapper Snoop Dogg in February sold an NFT attached to Bacc on Death Row, his latest album, that reportedly generated more than $40mn in sales in just five days. DJ Steve Aoki claims he has made more money through NFTs than he did from a decade’s worth of advances from record labels. “Some of these valuations are out of control. As an investor, I’m seeing a lot of it and have to laugh occasionally,” said a senior executive at a major music label. But after getting knocked over by the internet via the advent of file-sharing company Napster two decades ago, the big music companies are looking to get ahead of technological change this time around, making them willing participants in the market. Universal Music, the group behind Taylor Swift and Drake, has struck partnerships to create NFTs for its artists — including a virtual band featuring characters from the Bored Ape Yacht Club — as have rivals Sony and Warner. After spending more than half a billion dollars buying the copyrights to Bob Dylan’s songbook, Universal and Sony are now working with the musician to sell Bob Dylan NFTs. Spotify has been drawing up plans to add blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens to its streaming service, the FT reported earlier this month. “There’s been a lot of waxing and waning of irrational exuberance around this space”, said Jonathan Dworkin, senior vice-president of digital strategy at Universal. “As the smoke now starts to clear, there’s some really interesting opportunities . . . there’s a real revenue opportunity” he said, pointing to the ways tokens can directly connect fans with artists. But so far, most participants in music NFTs are crypto enthusiasts rather than ordinary fans, and the market is tiny — taking in just $83mn in primary sales last year, according to industry blog Water & Music. There are plenty of sceptics. “It feels like the music industry is desperately trying to find a way to insert itself into NFTs without actually thinking: what is the underlying use case?” said Mark Mulligan, analyst at Midia Research. Mulligan argued it is hypocritical of musicians to sell streaming royalties to fans, after years of complaints over the minuscule payments artists themselves receive in streaming royalties. “If you sell someone a fraction of that fraction, and charge them a lot of money for it because it’s an NFT, I’m not sure how it would be a valid investment.” Diplo maintained it is a good investment for music lovers. “For a fan, what you can do is buy merch, you can buy tickets for a concert . . . but really, this is what you’re a fan for. You’re a fan because of the music.” Most of the $17.7bn worth of NFTs traded last year were for visual art, games and collectibles, according to market tracker Nonfungible.com. While the NFT market itself has shown signs of slowing with daily trading volumes on OpenSea, the biggest marketplace for NFTs, falling since the start of the year, some people view music as a space ripe to break out this year. Royal, Blau’s company, is among the most prominent of a crop of music blockchain start-ups that aim to revolutionise the industry. Through Blau’s personal connections — and Silicon Valley optimism around blockchain — Royal secured $55mn from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Peter Thiel, without ever making a pitchbook. Blau, who last February sold $12mn in NFTs attached to his songs, wants to scale that into a business through which ordinary fans can own music, “as opposed to just record labels, private equity and hedge funds”. 0.004% of streaming royalty rights 0.05% of streaming royalty rights plus more music 0.7% of streaming royalty rights and a meeting with Diplo Royal’s project with Diplo, for example, offers fans the option of paying $99 for a token representing 0.004 per cent of the streaming royalty rights to “Don’t Forget My Love”, the first single from his recently released album. For $999, you receive 0.05 per cent of the royalty rights, as well as an “exclusive DJ mix,” while $9,999 gives you 0.7 per cent of the royalties and a meeting with Diplo at a concert. These tokens do not equate to owning the copyrights to songs. Asked whether this is a good investment for fans, Blau said that there is an emotional attachment to the ownership, as well as the possibility of betting on the success of an artist before they become a star. “In real estate . . . if you own a single family home there’s the rental income and then there’s the actual asset appreciation, right?” he argued. Another longtime music label executive said that some of these projects “haven’t hit because people are concerned about the exploitative nature”, referring to the questionable investment value of streaming royalties. “There’s a lot of detractors that say: there’s only rich white dudes that are doing this and driving up the price of NFTs. “But I don’t think we can discount that technology is evolving,” the executive added. “We’ve been in playlist land for the past decade. I think that blockchain tokens are going to be fundamental to our world in 10 years, and anyone that says that’s not true is not looking back on history.” For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click,,Anna Nicolaou,2022-04-01T04:00:23.058Z,

On Monday, Euroclear added a little extra weight to the movement to bring new digital assets into the mainstream. The clearing giant is investing in Fnality, a payments consortium whose members include Nasdaq and UBS. The deal paves the way for financial institutions to clear and settle dealings in digital securities using a distributed ledger system. Euroclear, in common with other traditional finance institutions, cannot afford to get left behind as digital assets are used more widely. Blockchain-based securities could supplant the conventional stocks and bonds Euroclear handles. They may feature as proxies for the latter as well as outright alternatives. Existing systems of clearing and settlement involve verification by a centralised body that are both time consuming and costly for participants. Proponents say that it, in contrast, it should be possible to settle large volumes of digital asset transactions using blockchain technology in real time, much faster and more cheaply. Nearly instantaneous transactions clearly bring benefits. But the biggest savings could come from reductions in cash liquidity requirements for participants. Using synthetic central bank digital currencies, another potential development, would enable this change. This reduces the financing strain and cost for banks on either side of transactions and in theory lowers overall financial stress from funds tied up in the system. Euroclear settled almost a quadrillion (1,000 trillion) euros of securities transactions last year. It has chosen Fnality for a reason. Set up in 2019, the payments company already has the backing of some of Europe’s largest banks, including Barclays and Santander.

https://www.ft.com/content/9e77bf41-5814-4c18-96f6-f800f6b41216,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Spotify draws up plans to join NFT digital collectibles craze,Job ads fuel excitement in crypto and music industries over potential of NFTs to boost artists’ earnings,Spotify is drawing up plans to add blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens to its streaming service, fuelling excitement in the crypto and music industries about the potential of NFTs to boost artists’ earnings. Two recent job ads show Spotify is recruiting people to work on early stage projects related to “Web3”, a tech buzzword for a blockchain-powered network that some crypto enthusiasts hope will wrestle control back from the Big Tech platforms that dominate today’s internet. Spotify is the latest tech giant to venture into NFTs and head off potential competition from crypto start-ups. This week, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg confirmed a Financial Times report earlier this year that Instagram would soon start to support NFTs. Other social media companies, including Twitter and Reddit, are also working to build new features for displaying or trading NFTs. NFTs use blockchain technology to certify ownership of digital assets. The vast majority of the $17.7bn worth of NFTs traded last year were for visual artworks, games and collectibles, according to market tracker Nonfungible.com. But even as the frothy NFT market has shown signs of deceleration in recent weeks, many in the crypto industry have tipped music as a breakout new application for NFTs this year. That could include selling digital albums or using NFTs to unlock perks at gigs, from merchandise to backstage passes. Musicians such as rapper Snoop Dogg and DJ Steve Aoki have already become prominent NFT collectors, while Kings of Leon and Grimes have sold NFTs of their music. Major labels Warner and Universal have forged partnerships with NFT projects, including a virtual band featuring characters from the Bored Ape Yacht Club. Start-ups including Royal and Catalog have begun selling NFTs created by musicians, often pitching the crypto tokens as a more lucrative alternative business model compared with streaming services such as Spotify, which pay out fractions of a penny for every time a song is played. Recommended Spotify’s recruitment in the sector appears to be at an exploratory stage. It pointed to Web3 in a recruitment notice for an engineer on its “experimental growth” team. “This small and full-stack team is responsible for driving growth through new technologies, like Web3,” the ad said. A separate Spotify job listing, for a manager in its future-gazing “Innovation and Market Intelligence” group, shows the music streaming service is looking for a candidate with experience in “content, creator, media, web3, and emerging technology industries” to “help define Spotify Moonshots”, a term for ambitious new projects. A Spotify spokesperson declined to comment on its NFT plans. These Web3 hires would not be Spotify’s first foray into crypto tech: the company was an early collaborator on Facebook’s ill-fated cryptocurrency project, Diem. When what was originally dubbed Libra was unveiled in 2019, Daniel Ek, Spotify’s chief executive, told a company podcast that cryptocurrencies and blockchain could allow users of “a service like Spotify . . . to be able to pay artists directly”, especially across international borders or in regions where few people have traditional bank accounts. “That can open up massive opportunities where all of a sudden, a user in Japan might pay a creator in Argentina. And that opens up huge opportunities for how we can further our mission,” Ek said at the time.,,Tim Bradshaw,2022-03-17T05:00:09.150Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/47279272-db0c-4acc-a65d-677aafaf15e0,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Ethereum co-founder hits out at economics of fast-growing Solana blockchain,Joseph Lubin says rival must ‘figure out a more sustainable business model for the network’,Ethereum’s co-founder Joseph Lubin has questioned the sustainability of rival projects, including the fast-growing Solana blockchain, as venture capital pours into a raft of new cryptocurrency networks. The Ethereum blockchain has become one of the world’s most widely used digital ledgers, but it is facing challenges from rivals such as Solana, which has set lower transaction fees to draw in users. Lubin told the Financial Times that Solana, which pitches itself as a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum, was paying outsized rewards to users who validate transactions on the network compared to the revenues generated by those transactions. Solana needs to “figure out a more sustainable business model for the network”, Lubin said. “That’s natural,” he said. “All the projects in our ecosystem essentially fake it until they make it, or they die.” The fast-growing blockchain project has faced doubts before. Some critics have argued that Solana sacrifices security for greater efficiency, and the network has experienced multiple significant outages. In response to Lubin’s criticism, Solana Labs, the company that developed the blockchain, said that “simply looking at protocol revenue doesn’t tell the full story of the long-term performance” of a blockchain’s economic model. Lubin’s comments came as tech investors make big wagers on new projects trying to create more efficient alternatives to Ethereum — including Avalanche, Near Protocol and Solana — in a race to capitalise on growing mainstream interest in cryptocurrency applications. ConsenSys, a cryptocurrency software company led by Lubin and closely tied to Ethereum, said on Tuesday it had more than doubled its valuation to $7bn in a new $450mn round of financing. The company has soared in value as an influx of new users turned to its products to navigate Ethereum. Ethereum is the most widely used digital ledger for rapidly expanding areas such as decentralised finance and non-fungible tokens. Lubin has become one of the project’s loudest advocates on Wall Street after playing a hand in the network’s development. Recommended MetaMask, an app developed by ConsenSys with more than 30mn monthly active users, has recorded almost $330mn in transaction fees since late 2020 through a feature that lets users swap between cryptocurrency tokens on Ethereum, according to public data. Venture capitalists invested the new money in ConsenSys Software, an entity Lubin created with the help of JPMorgan during a restructuring that was finalised in 2021. It comes after almost three dozen former employees of its Swiss-incorporated predecessor company, ConsenSys AG, recently challenged the legality of the restructuring and requested a special audit. The employees have alleged the deal undervalued the intellectual property behind MetaMask and other key products transferred to the new entity. Lubin said ConsenSys had been “extremely open” about negotiating with the former employees and “understanding their concerns”, and the company’s products were effectively “pre-monetisation” at the time of the transaction. “It’s a very different world in our ecosystem as we’re crossing the chasm into mainstream adoption than it was during the darkest moments of Covid,” Lubin said. ParaFi Capital, a cryptocurrency venture firm backed by KKR, led the new round of funding in ConsenSys. Microsoft, Singapore’s Temasek and SoftBank’s second Vision Fund also invested. ConsenSys declined to comment on whether Lubin or other shareholders sold any shares in the financing.

https://www.ft.com/content/a88fb591-72d5-4b6b-bb5d-223adfb893f3,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Facebook Libra: the inside story of how the company’s cryptocurrency dream died,It had the blue-chip partners, the tech and the right players. None of which could save it,On June 24 2021, Jay Powell and Janet Yellen sat down for their weekly breakfast amid the austere surroundings of the US Treasury building on 1,500 Pennsylvania Avenue. There was only one major question on the agenda: should they give the green light for a global cryptocurrency designed by Facebook? The chair of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury secretary were both DC veterans; Powell had replaced Yellen at the top of the Fed. But neither had had to make such an unusual decision. An alliance of tech companies led by Facebook proposed to launch a product it hoped would profoundly change the world. Rather than adhering to the social media giant’s one-time mantra “move fast and break things”, executives had come to Washington to ask permission first. Powell laid out his position with his customary precision. As Fed chair, he told Yellen, he was willing to give the go-ahead for Facebook and its partners to trial Diem, as the digital currency backed by the US dollar was called at the time. He knew the Treasury had concerns, not least the possibility that such a currency could become a vehicle for money laundering or grow so popular as to threaten global monetary stability. But on balance, his staff thought Diem was designed carefully enough to avoid such outcomes and would have the added benefit of setting industry standards. The social media company’s reputation was sullied in Washington, following a series of controversies over data privacy, misinformation and alleged censorship. During his presidential bid the year before, Joe Biden said he had “never been a big fan” of Facebook’s founder Mark Zuckerberg, describing him as “a real problem”. And prominent Democrats and Republicans alike had already spoken out against Diem specifically. A cautious operator, Powell wanted backing from Yellen, who is close to the president and popular among progressives. After weeks of deliberation, Yellen had made up her mind: she was out. “Yellen told him it was his decision to make, but that she would not protect him from the political fallout if he did so,” says one person briefed on the conversation. “And that was the end of Facebook’s digital currency.” Diem’s leadership would spend the next six months in a last-ditch drive to rescue the project that began by attempting to woo government regulators, then trying to browbeat them and, in a final folly, exploring working with Zuckerberg’s one-time nemeses. But this January, Diem confirmed that it was winding down for good. The remains of Zuckerberg’s digital money dream would be sold to a little-known Californian bank for $182mn, marking one of the most spectacular, if little-noted, failures of his career. Over the past few months, the Financial Times has spoken to some 30 people involved with the project, including executives, developers, lobbyists and the regulators and politicians who ultimately killed it. (Many of them spoke on condition of anonymity because Facebook requires employees and partners to sign non-disclosure agreements.) What emerges is a picture of Silicon Valley executives who thought they could charge into finance and make billions, if only they could surmount technical and regulatory barriers. What they failed to realise was that the very fact Facebook had conceived the idea, doomed it. As one government official involved in the process puts it: “Diem spent years trying to reverse engineer their project to fix all of its faults. But they could never fix being linked to Facebook. It was their original sin.” Meta, as Facebook has since been rebranded, is one of a handful of tech companies now threatened with much stricter regulation, even break-up, by US politicians and regulators who have come to see it as a malignant force in American commerce and democracy. Nowhere has the divide between Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill been more clearly exposed than in the tortured downfall of Diem. David Marcus was soaking up the Caribbean sun. It was the winter of 2017, and the dapper, French-born executive was on holiday in the Dominican Republic. Marcus, 48, was the head of Facebook’s Messenger app and a close confidant of Zuckerberg’s. His silver hair and slick suits set him apart from his younger, scruffier colleagues. Peers jokingly called him the “George Clooney of Silicon Valley,” and he was seen as powerful within the company. Lying on the beach, Marcus indulged in some blue-sky thinking. What if he could find a way to create a global digital currency and integrate it into Facebook? Marcus was no stranger to the worlds of start-ups and digital payments. He sold his first company at 27. In 2011, a subsequent mobile payments start-up he founded was acquired by PayPal for $240mn. Within nine months, he was PayPal’s president. In 2014, Zuckerberg recruited him to run Messenger, which he’d help grow to more than 1.3bn users. But three years on, he was restless. Meanwhile, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies had become useful tools for dark web criminals as well as the lofty obsessions of programmers and utopian technologists. But they had yet to be adopted by any big corporations. For Facebook’s more than two-billion-strong user base, crypto could offer a convenient and cheap way to move money around the world, Marcus thought. For the social media company itself, it could provide a treasure trove of data about what people spend their money on. Interrupting his holiday abroad, Marcus texted Zuckerberg to outline his ruminations. Intrigued, the CEO gave his blessing to explore the idea further. So Marcus began methodically crafting a tool beloved by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs: a memo outlining the new project’s objectives, defining success and quantifying how to get there. Morgan Beller was a 24-year-old whirlwind. Fast-talking and animated, she had been a partner at venture capital group Andreessen Horowitz before joining Facebook’s corporate development team in 2017. She was also a fierce blockchain advocate, who spent the latter part of that year trying to shop the technology to whichever Facebook executive would listen: why wasn’t the company embracing decentralisation and open protocols for its users? Could it get into bitcoin mining? Should Facebook groups be able to issue their own digital tokens? “It’s a really big company and taking really big risks is hard,” she tells the FT. “To give Facebook credit, the leadership was very receptive and very open. I didn’t have anyone say no, at least to meeting and brainstorming.” In early 2018, Marcus and Beller joined forces. At first, they worked in a small, empty room, walls adorned with whiteboards, on Facebook’s main campus in Menlo Park. Soon they moved to a larger, more secluded building on the outskirts of the company’s headquarters. Only employees with particular passes — the crypto experts, engineers and economists they brought on board — could access the facility. Their top-secret project was codenamed Libra. The team was “paranoid about leaks”, says Beller and was “like a secret Swat operation”. This would be the first of several incarnations, each intended to conform to the difficulties and demands of launching a digital currency from within Facebook. Initially, the dream was for Libra to be like bitcoin, a currency owned by no one group and built on open-source technology. This would allow individuals to store, spend and transfer money across borders with close to zero transaction fees. Unlike bitcoin, it would be backed by something real: a reserve of low-risk assets including bank deposits in various currencies and US Treasuries. (This kind of crypto is known as stablecoin.) Facebook declined to comment. Marcus, who also declined to be interviewed, wrote in a statement: “Libra was about building a protocol for money on the internet to enable people and businesses who are currently left behind by the current system to access sound digital money and cheap payments.” To get the project off the ground — before it was to become fully decentralised — leadership was needed to develop the technology. Marcus and Beller were conscious that Facebook alone should not be seen as directing the effort. So they created a non-profit association, also called Libra, of which Facebook was to be one of many members. To avoid appearing US-centric, it would be technically based in Switzerland, a more neutral financial centre that was also an emerging crypto hub at the time. (Marcus and Beller continued to work primarily from California.) For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click The set-up proved convincing. By mid-2019, Marcus and Beller’s pitching had brought on board some 28 companies and non-profits, including Uber, Vodafone, Spotify, Visa and Mastercard as founding members. Each would have equal voting rights and pay $10mn into the reserve; each would guide the project’s development and, eventually, integrate Libra into its services, bringing the digital coin to consumers worldwide. On top of being an equal founding member, Facebook would build its own digital wallet for the coin. Marcus would sit on Libra’s board but also run the digital wallet in a new Facebook subsidiary called Calibra. For Facebook, the possible multibillion-dollar commercial opportunities were clear: user transaction data, more engagement, more ecommerce, a slice of fees from transactions. “That was always their advantage,” says one regulatory official. “This would create tremendous opportunity and a lot of money for them. But if Facebook was going to be the reason it was very successful, they were also going to be the reason it would fail.” The Old San Francisco Mint is a neoclassical granite slab of a building sitting amid high-rise office blocks and upmarket hotels close to the city’s theatre district. Constructed in the 1860s, the Mint was one of the few buildings that survived the great quake of 1906 and resulting fire. It is a behemoth of permanence that once held one-third of the country’s gold reserves; now it’s a venue for corporate events. It was here that Marcus chose to host the press launch of his new project in mid-June 2019. In the interim, Facebook had gone from relatively under-scrutinised to the black sheep of Silicon Valley, as a result of repeated scandals, including the Cambridge Analytica revelations, which stoked concerns about users’ data privacy. In this light, Marcus and Beller had thought it wiser to ask for permission and share their plans publicly. “We took some of the lessons learnt in other jurisdictions and said, we’re gonna do this as we would think a regulator would want a company like Facebook to do this,” says one staffer involved. After a tour of the vaults, journalists were called in to a cavernous, high-ceilinged room to watch Marcus give one of his characteristically slick slideshow presentations, revealing the plan in full. The Libra sign in astrology signifies the scales of justice, he explained. Libre is French for free. “Freedom, justice, money, that’s all this is about,” he said. Throwing the launch at the Mint made for terrible politics. American politicians were already worried about a Facebook cryptocurrency encroaching on the power of the US dollar. Seeing it launched in a building that used to make those dollars only exacerbated their concerns. One person who spoke to Zuckerberg about the plans in its earliest days says, “It comes back to Zuckerberg’s inability to understand how the world sees Facebook: ‘From the people who ripped your data off, they can now get into your wallet.’” During a bruising week in July 2019, the extent of the political backlash became clear. First, came the dreaded Potus tweet. “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,” president Donald Trump wrote on July 11. Four days later, Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin repeated that message at a press conference, warning: “[Libra] and others have a lot of work to do before they get us comfortable.” The following day, Marcus addressed a congressional hearing for the first time. His testimony in front of the Senate banking committee was a chance to reset, to show members of Congress that he was listening to their concerns and that Facebook was willing to make changes to accommodate them. Marcus had barely settled in his seat — much less spoken — when the onslaught began. Sherrod Brown, the gravelly voiced Democratic senator from Ohio, set the tone. “[Facebook] is like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches,” he said. “Facebook has burned down the house over and over and called every arson a learning experience.” Republican senators were just as hostile. “I don’t trust you guys,” said GOP senator Martha McSally. “Instead of cleaning up your house, you are launching into a new business model.” Marcus blinked slowly from behind his rimless glasses as he soaked up round after round of criticism. If he believed he was seeing his passion project collapse in front of his eyes, he gave little sign of it. But many watching from the outside believed that was exactly what was happening. “The attacks were absolutely bipartisan because both sides agree: you don’t mess with the money,” says David Gerard, author of Libra Shrugged: How Facebook Tried to Take Over the Money. “This is what happens when the dreams of bitcoin bros meet reality.” By the late summer of 2019, sentiment among Libra’s backers was that something needed to change. When the Wall Street Journal reported that Visa, Mastercard and others were getting cold feet, Marcus felt compelled to rebut the notion of disharmony between members. “I have no knowledge of specific organizations plans to not step up,” he tweeted on October 2, “commitment to the mission is more important than anything else”. The next day, executives from the consortium’s member companies met in the National Union Building in Washington DC’s Penn Quarter. According to multiple sources involved, some members had begun to feel spooked by the political backlash. Facebook had, they believed, underestimated the scrutiny Libra would draw and had overpromoted members’ involvement. Facebook, meanwhile, wanted members to be more vocal in their support. The gathering was particularly pressing because Libra backers were due to signal their continued support by signing a so-called declaration of membership. Amid the tensions, some Libra staffers failed to notice that representatives from one member — PayPal, where Marcus had been president — weren’t there. The next day, PayPal announced it was pulling out, arguing Facebook had not done enough to address regulators’ concerns. The news blindsided Libra’s top management. Things were going to get worse. Days later, Brown and his Democratic Senate colleague Brian Schatz wrote to Libra’s remaining payments members — Visa, Mastercard and online payments processor Stripe — warning them that if they remained part of the scheme, they could expect increased Congressional scrutiny. “It’s as close to a Sopranos threat as you’ll ever read,” one Libra insider says. Within a matter of days, Libra lost 25 per cent of its members, Visa, Mastercard, Stripe and eBay among them. Back in Silicon Valley, Marcus was wounded. He realised that, for his dream to have a chance of surviving, he would have to make major concessions. For the next 18 months, Marcus did just that. First, he removed himself from the limelight. His attempted Washington charm offensive had only further lashed Libra to Facebook. Even Zuckerberg acknowledged the problem. “I understand we’re not the ideal messenger right now . . . I’m sure people wish it was anyone but Facebook putting this idea forward,” he told US lawmakers in 2019. “But there’s a reason we care about this. Facebook is about putting power in people’s hands.” To underscore its independence, Libra turned to Stuart Levey, the former Treasury official in charge of the US government’s efforts to stop terrorism financing. In May 2020, Levey was made the Swiss non-profit’s new chief executive. The 58-year-old had been appointed by George W Bush but had stayed on under Barack Obama, making him one of a handful of political appointees to serve both Democratic and Republican presidents. Levey, who peers describe as statesmanlike but also lively, headed HSBC’s legal team in the intervening years, so was well versed in financial regulation. Libra also tapped Steve Bunnell, former chief of the criminal division at the US attorney’s office and justice department counsel, to become its chief legal officer. Both hires were a coup. “The people were really extraordinary, some of the very best,” says Ari Redbord, who was the senior adviser to the Treasury deputy secretary and the under-secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence at the time. “They basically put together the team that regulators would want to hear from when they are looking [at] how you’re going to build out a compliance programme.” There was also a rebranding. Libra was renamed Diem, while Calibra — Facebook’s digital wallet — became Novi. Marcus took a back seat within the Libra association to focus on building Novi. Beller left Facebook and joined a venture capital firm. Under Levey’s direction, Diem shrunk. To placate European and US regulators, the project’s scope was narrowed to the creation of a digital currency backed one-for-one by the dollar rather than a basket of currencies and other low-risk assets, which some were concerned might challenge the dominance of the dollar. A team of crypto engineers spanning Europe and Silicon Valley worked feverishly to build a system to monitor transactions for signs of money laundering or sanction breaking. They also came up with ways to prohibit anonymous transactions and vet the outfits that could build services to support Diem currency. By now, the world was in the pandemic’s grip. Would-be schmoozing turned into Zooms. Diem’s future was being thrashed out over video calls, as regulators bombarded the project’s leadership with detailed queries. Some Diem staffers found there were so many officials, they often did not know which agencies were present. Even by government standards, it could be tedious work. Redford recalls extended calls “going through line by line the very technical compliance programme they were building in response to the Treasury’s requests”. All of which started to seem worth it by spring 2021. By then, Levey and the rest of the senior team, including Marcus, felt confident enough to test issuing a small amount of Diem currency as well as trialling a version of the Novi digital wallet. The test would be available to a small group of users, but the team was jubilant at the prospect, according to several people involved at the time. Reaching the major milestone required the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, Finma, to approve Diem’s licence. The application papers were on the regulatory agency’s desk, and Finma had convened a college of more than 20 regulatory watchdogs from around the world to guide it through the process. It just needed the final green light from the US Treasury. It was at this point that the Treasury issued its first devastating “No”. Officials told Finma and Diem that they were requesting a temporary delay of the pilot. The Biden administration was still settling in, they said, and needed time to review the project. Levey was indignant, convinced that these were not substantive concerns. Dante Disparte, Libra’s head of policy and a key point man for members, quit in frustration. Levey was not finished yet; he felt he could still answer any lingering concerns the Treasury held. So Diem morphed again. Levey relocated the Swiss-based project to the US and began working with US-regulated bank Silvergate to issue Diem currency, an overhaul designed to further placate regulators. Now, if the US government wanted to intervene, it could do so thanks to the regulatory relationship it had with Silvergate. To Levey, and even some within the Fed, this seemed to be the final missing piece. Diem executives informed the Fed and the Treasury that another launch was scheduled for June 29 2021. But it was not to be. After Yellen’s intervention, the Fed relayed the message to Silvergate and Diem. In a testy phone call, the Fed’s general counsel Mark Van Der Weide told Levey that the government was uncomfortable condoning any project until it had put a “comprehensive regulatory framework” for stablecoins in place, and he expressed nervousness about a coin with the potential to “massively scale” as Diem might. According to Diem staffers, something seemed off about Van Der Weide’s delivery during the call. He was stiff, almost robotic. When they compared notes with colleagues at Silvergate, they found that a call they’d received from Van Der Weide had played out in a suspiciously similar way. They concluded that the official must have been reading from a script; both groups felt slighted. The Fed and the Treasury both declined to comment. “It was a last-minute rug-pulling exercise, the night before the proposed launch date,” says one person who was involved. Diem’s team was blindsided and “immensely fucked off”. Bruised and frustrated, Levey retaliated using a method that only has traction in DC: a strongly worded letter. The missive, which has not been previously reported and has been seen by the FT, is addressed to Yellen and Powell and is dated July 6 2021. In it, Levey berates regulators for blocking the project, outlining all the steps it had taken to appease them. Previous requests to meet Yellen and deputy Treasury secretary Wally Adeyemo had been declined “without explanation”, he wrote. Now he was demanding a meeting with both for an opportunity to be heard. “While Diem continues to welcome engagement and scrutiny, we also deserve fair and equal treatment,” Levey continued. “Stopping a limited, legally permissible pilot while other stablecoins grow unchecked is neither fair nor equitable.” The current status quo would mark a “death knell” for the project, he added. Recommended The requested meetings never materialised. Behind closed doors, some who worked on the project argue the episode was more than just unfair. Neutral regulators had strung them along and were then swayed by a combination of politics and the interests of big banks, they believed. “It’s kind of like a banana republic,” says one Facebook staffer involved. “Here you have the Federal Reserve that’s supposed to be an independent central bank for the US government, appointed to set terms that span over the course of presidencies to take politics out of money. It is a shame that politics came into play.” Even some regulators remain sympathetic to Diem’s plight. “For years, we treated Facebook like we were pulling the wings off a fly, while doing nothing about these others,” says one senior official, citing dozens of other stablecoin projects that make up the $127bn market. “Not allowing Diem to go ahead was worse than a crime, it was a blunder.” Inside the US government, Levey’s letter did not land well. The link to Facebook remained front of mind. The Treasury department would not bend to Diem’s timeline, whether the demand came via the earnest visionary Marcus or the seasoned pragmatist Levey. The letter was “like you had a friendship, and it went bad and they were detailing their grievances”, one official scoffs. The person adds, “What they were after was always fantastical.” And so Diem entered the final “Hail Mary” phase of its doomed existence. Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss are the identical twin Olympic rowers who knew Zuckerberg at Harvard in the early 2000s. Their feud and lawsuit over the idea for Facebook was memorably fictionalised in the 2010 film, The Social Network. The suit was settled for $65mn in 2008 and, in the interim, the Winklevii founded Gemini, a crypto exchange and stablecoin group, and became bitcoin billionaires. After the humiliating Fed rejection (and bow-out from Silvergate) in June, Diem executives had one last contingency: find another stablecoin issuer that was instead regulated at a state level. New York has its own crypto regulatory regime under the eye of the New York Department of Financial Services. Enter Gemini. Diem had a long history with the crypto company. When Marcus and Beller were initially reaching out to potential partners, they had held talks with Gemini about how it might be involved in the initiative — for example, by listing the Diem coin on its exchange. But now, according to multiple people familiar with the matter, Diem’s leadership explored working with Gemini to actually issue the currency. The NY DFS team at the time — particularly then-superintendent Linda Lacewell — welcomed the tie-up, details of which have not been previously reported. The irony of Zuckerberg’s company possibly counting on the Winklevii to act as white knights was not lost on staffers. “The amount of power you are giving up by bringing in Gemini shows how desperate they were,” one government official involved says. But when New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who had been battling allegations of sexual harassment for weeks, resigned, Lacewell went with him. The furtive Gemini plan was scuppered. Then came what some insiders deem the final mis-step. Marcus, who had been watching from the sidelines, re-entered the picture when he decided to launch a pilot of Facebook’s Novi digital currency wallet in October. Instead of using Diem, the trial would rely on Paxos Dollar, a rival cryptocurrency. The move was designed to relieve some of the pressure on Diem but instead engendered a vicious political reaction from Congress, which still saw the two initiatives as inextricably linked. “All hope was lost,” says one member, when the Treasury put out a report in November on stablecoin issuers “that limit affiliation with commercial entities” in order to “address additional concerns about systemic risk and concentration of economic power”. Internally, this was read as a direct message to Facebook. Diem’s investors had become fatigued by the process. Zuckerberg had grown exasperated with negative news cycles when he wanted to focus on casting the company as innovative, according to those close to him. At times, he wanted to hold back and wait before trying to launch the various pilots. But eventually he also conceded defeat, alongside Marcus. “Mark is a smart businessman. There’s only so much money you’d throw at it,” says one former senior Meta staffer. By the end of the month, Diem began to consider pursuing a sale. Where Libra had entered public discourse with a bang, Diem collapsed with a whimper: when Levey delivered the news over Zoom in a mid-December 2021 meeting, the three dozen or so participants on the call fell silent. Marcus had already resigned from Facebook several weeks earlier. Those close to him say he was despondent. “If walls mysteriously keep popping up that you don’t know about,” says one senior Facebook staffer who worked with him, “there’s only so many times you can keep walking down that same path.” Diem received interest from several US banks, including Silvergate, which on January 31 bought its remaining assets to pursue its own stablecoin plans. To the extent it has one, Diem’s lasting legacy may be that it focused the attention of regulators on digital currency. “It forced regulators and governments to start to educate themselves on the technology and stimulated venture capital investment in other initiatives because there was such a frenzy of focus,” says Lisa Ellis, head payments analyst at investment research group MoffettNathanson. Levey declined to comment but provided a statement reading in part: “What Diem demonstrated is that it’s possible to build an efficient blockchain-based payment system that explicitly prohibits anonymous transactions and includes robust controls to protect consumers and combat crime.” Recommended But Marcus has still not achieved what he had set out to. “This mission that motivated the team to challenge the unacceptable status quo — against all odds — for a better system, remains as relevant today as it was on the first day of that journey,” Marcus wrote in his statement to the FT. In a tweet, he said he welcomed “another chapter with a maybe more ‘acceptable’ promoter driving the vision forward” — a concession that Facebook’s brand destroyed his vision. “With David Marcus, I sensed a bit of: ‘We will be able to survive on the pure charismatic goodwill that we are bringing with this project,’” says one person who worked with him. “I think they thought good faith would carry the day.” Facebook is now busy with a new grand project: its plan to build a metaverse where billions of people could one day gather as avatars. Novi staffers have been instructed to focus on what digital currency might look like in this virtual world. “What are we supposed to do?” says one former Facebook employee, who laments Diem’s demise. “Sit back and just do ‘likes’? Companies are supposed to grow, we have shareholders to deliver to. That’s the ethos of Silicon Valley.” Hannah Murphy is an FT tech correspondent. Kiran Stacey is an FT Washington correspondent.

https://www.ft.com/content/879ae372-bb3b-4aa1-a264-ce32304a77d9,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Web3 allows tech to indulge in its love of both speculation and idealism,Catch-all term suggests digital utopia but may really be a way to rebrand crypto investment,Does it seem as though Web3 sprang into existence just a few months ago? It is the same here in San Francisco. All of a sudden a mythical digital utopia is being referenced in earnest by some of the biggest companies in the world. This is not by accident. Web3 was willed into being by tech investors. But it has given the wider sector a much-needed jolt of optimism. That optimism was on full display at ETHDenver, the biggest crypto conference in the US. Held in snowy Denver last month, the event had a distinctly low key aesthetic. The main stage looked like it had just finished hosting a warehouse party. Most attendees turned up in hoodies and jeans. Because I wore a smart coat I was frequently mistaken for an event organiser. But ETHDenver was also one of the most good-natured conferences I have ever been to. So what if the price of ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, had crashed from a high of $4,815 to less than $3,000. The ethereum blockchain on which it is built was going to save the world! No one mentioned money. The focus was co-operation online. “I believe that this is the mechanism for a new society,” said one speaker. “This is how we create a pluralistic civilisation,” declared another. Elon Musk’s younger brother Kimbal appeared on stage to talk about philanthropy. Vitalik Buterin, the 28-year-old Russian-Canadian co-founder of ethereum, spoke of a culture focused on new ideas. Does that sound confusing? It was. If you have trouble wrapping your head around Web3 that is because it is still an amorphous catch-all used to cover cryptocurrencies, the metaverse, non-fungible tokens and the idea of a community-driven, “decentralised” internet. Some of this is new, some not. The idea of users owning the internet goes back decades, though the term Web3 is credited to ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood in 2014. It reached critical mass last September when tech venture capitalist Chris Dixon published a Twitter thread describing it as a distinct new era of the internet. First came Web 1 (1990s decentralised internet), then Web 2 (Big Tech circa 2005-20), now Web3. The dates are an invention, just like the dividers used to describe one generation as boomers and another as millennials. But they are a neat way to think about the timeframe in which large tech companies took power and to imagine a different future. That future hinges on blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. In some ways, Web3 is really a way to rebrand crypto investment. Bitcoin’s volatility and lack of real-world application mean it is still dismissed by some as a fad. Web3 is presented as something more high-minded and tenable: a way to use the same mechanism to change the way the world works.

It is seeking to raise up to $4.5bn for new crypto funds. It is also helpful for companies seeking a new start. The same month Dixon was posting tweets about Web3, Facebook rebranded to Meta and declared its future was in the metaverse. There is a further connection. The company expects users to access the metaverse via virtual reality hardware like its own Oculus headsets. Dixon led Andreessen Horowitz’s early investment in Oculus. Does this add up to a spur for radical, positive change? Or is it just a new way for tech investors and companies to pull in money? Maybe it’s both. In Web3, tech has finally found a new way to indulge in its love of both speculation and idealism.,,Elaine Moore,2022-03-04T16:49:36.111Z,

Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Monday Greetings, readers, from a very blustery London (and to US readers, a happy President’s Day)! One topic that’s been on my mind over the weekend is the continued importance of independent journalists in crypto-scoops. See “on-chain sleuth” Zachxbt, who uncovered that the co-founder of Quadriga and convicted felon, Michael Patryn, was involved in running a decentralised finance product. Even as media coverage of cryptocurrencies has ballooned, these blockchain detectives remain significant — news sites understandably can’t cover every new coin in depth. It certainly feels like a more tangible example of decentralisation in action than the freewheeling talk of Web3. In this week’s edition, Milan correspondent Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli talks about NFTs linked to physical art, I interview Asher Ismail at Uncapped and two NFT stories make it into our Fintech Fascination section. As ever, drop Imani (Imani.Moise@ft.com) or myself (Sid.V@ft.com) your emails with thoughts and suggested topics for coverage. Have a great week! In the distant past of 2018, there was talk that the blockchain could one day be a tool for the art world. A report from the University of Oxford and the Alan Turing Institute noted that digital ledgers could be useful for establishing provenance, but concluded that at the time blockchain was “more a narrative than any specific technology”. Fast forward two years and we’re in the midst of a the non-fungible token boom based on blockchain technology. Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks are two of the best known examples, but there are dozens of other NFTs in the space. Critics may quibble about the quality of some of the most popular examples, or point to the questionable practices of those selling works from creators who have not given their consent — but art is probably the most ubiquitous use of NFTs today. Virtual clothing for games and virtual worlds is currently a smaller if growing ecosystem, while the idea of NFTs for contracts, mortgages and legal purposes remain largely abstract. A Milan-based start-up, Aesthetes, is launching a new type of NFT, which it says will link the physical art world to the blockchain by connecting to a digital artwork and to a physical one. The NFTs will be based on artworks owned by Aesthetes or third parties. The company also says that it will make the buyer the full owner of the digital artwork, which they could go on to resell. They would also own a share of the physical artwork, which they can similarly successively resell for a profit. Aesthetes will manage the NFTs, but also be the curator for the physical artworks. The company’s stated aim is to make the art market “more democratic”. “We want to break the concept of elitist access to art in order to make it [accessible to everyone],” said co-founder Claudia Cimaglia. Unlike most NFT platforms which are powered by ethereum blockchain, the Milanese start-up employs XRP Ledger, a decentralised public blockchain which it says allows for NFT transactions at a lower cost and with a much lighter impact on the environment. Cimaglia and co-founder Luca Bertolani make the case that the €22bn NFT market will grow further. They say that the average investor is under age 40, and they hope to build a transparent and safe marketplace for young art collectors — although digital assets as a whole are still grappling with their use for illicit purposes. If the image of crypto-art was once just a powerful narrative tool, with NFTs it has become a reality. One issue from 2018 remains salient, though — the divide between creating art for the sake of art and producing it to make more money. Given the prices at which some of the most popular NFTs are sold, that tension has only gotten worse. (Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli) Every week we ask the founders of fast-growing fintechs to introduce themselves and explain what makes them stand out in a crowded industry. Our conversation, lightly edited, appears below. Last week, I spoke to Asher Ismail, co-founder of Uncapped. Founded in 2019, the company provides revenue-based financing to other start-ups as an alternative to banks or venture capital firms. This allows the nascent businesses to acquire cash to cover expenses such as marketing without needing to give personal guarantees or surrender equity. To date, it has made over 500 investments and raised $120mn; its last round in May 2021 raised $80mn, and was led by Lakestar. Previous investors include White Star Capital, Global Founders Capital and Mouro Capital. What was the inspiration for Uncapped? We’ve been looking at reinventing fundraising for founders. Many of them face challenges around affording inventory and hiring without having to give personal guarantees [to banks]. Every founder is thinking about ‘how can we get capital?’, but many don’t even have a chief financial officer in the business and face a lot of money challenges. What have been some of the shifts for fundraising as a result of Covid? We launched just before the pandemic started, and many of the investors we spoke to were completely freaked out. One of the powerful things we had was that we could connect the live data that companies use to run a check, compared to a traditional bank where you come in with a business plan and a profit and loss statement that you don’t necessarily believe in. What we saw across the sector was 10 years of ecommerce growth in the first three months of the pandemic, and we believe that one day ecommerce will just be commerce. I think one big shift from pre-pandemic has been a democratisation of capital. Previously, it was a lot easier if you were in a major hub. What Uncapped found was that 70 per cent of businesses would be outside the major metropolitan areas. How do you see the London fintech ecosystem shaping up? We see the trends in London following similar patterns to corporate funding globally. Capital is at its peak — we’ve never had this dynamic level of venture capitalists reaching out or sending gifts, trying to get in and have a conversation. You can feel this rush, and it’s part of something more global. American VCs are much more interested in the market too and it’s a long time coming, which is only beneficial for the London fintech scene. For us, it’s also great to be able to get backing to build a fintech and reinvest into the [London] community. What are the trends around diversity when it comes to start-ups and fundraising? Obviously this topic became of great interest following the Black Lives Matter protests. What I find a little frustrating is that a lot of people made promises about what they’re going to do and little action has come of that. Our solution: we try to remove the bias from fundraising, we aren’t looking at your CV, we’re fundamentally working with the data you’ve created in the business to make a decision. That’s the foundation of how Uncapped works. The broader ecosystem, I think, has a long way to go with that. The taxman’s taken all my NFTs Emma Agyemang reports on the first case of HM Revenue & Customs seizing three non-fungible tokens as part of a wider seizure of crypto assets worth about £5,000. The UK tax authority has released details on how individuals should record, report and pay tax on crypto transactions. The true size of the NFT world is tiny The hype of NFTs usually centres on the endorsements from the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Justin Bieber and the $24bn-worth traded to date. But as Tim Bradshaw writes, even optimistic estimates put the total audience size in the low single-digit millions, and that’s without accounting for wash trading to inflate figures. Payments company Flutterwave becomes most valuable African start-up Neil Munshi in Lagos writes about Flutterwave, a Nigerian payments company, which has reached a $3bn valuation after raising $250mn in a round led by US-based B Capital Group.

https://www.ft.com/content/37b8c103-b044-435e-98cd-58a87d37041e,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,What’s the story, blockchain Tory?,Matt Hancock has a new passion, and it’s not one of his aides this time.,Long-time Alphaville readers will remember that back in 2018, after a certain cabinet minister — then a mere disgraced Tory MP — resigned from two appointments related to blockchain technology when we discovered a secret crypto pay deal, we saw it fit to initiate a series called “What’s the Tory crypto story?” (This title will resonate if you happen to be over the age of about 30 and British.) After that slight embarrassment for now Transport Secretary Michael Green Grant Shapps, the Tory crypto train has kept on chugging merrily along. There was the spectacular flop of Tory Baroness Mone’s crypto project, EQUI; there was then-chancellor Philip “Spreadsheet” Hammond promoting blockchain as an easy solution for the Irish Border problem; more recently there was chair of the UK foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhat preaching the virtues of crypto by deploying unforgettable syntax such as “when the queen’s head leaves the coin and goes on to the blockchain”. And before any of them, of course, there was David Cameron — a man known for his impeccable taste in all things financial. It’s not just crypto; it’s blockchain too. In a November report entitled “Blockchain Industry in the UK Landscape Overview 2021” by “Innovation Eye” and the “Big Innovation Centre”, the ruling party’s love affair with all things related to the distributed dream ledger over the past five years is charted. It’s a nice and politically informative chart: Just look at that sea of blue! If you’re wondering about the block of red in the second line, well that’s Chi Onwurah, Labour MP for Newcastle Upon Tyne Central, who has a background in technology. But when she mentions blockchain, it’s to say things like: “For some, blockchain is a way of avoiding government”, and that the “libertarian idea that technology is the answer to everything has driven our regulatory approach for too long”. Music to our luddite lugholes, tbh. Over on the other side of the chamber, though, there’s a new crypto playa in town. And the new pusher of virtual currencies is none other than king of virtual tears himself, Mr Matthew Hancock, a former cabinet minster and now mere disgraced Tory MP (you might notice a theme). Having resigned from his job as health secretary following an affair with an aide, it seems our Matt has turned his sights towards loftier things. So lofty in fact, one might say he is heading to da moon — the MP for West Suffolk’s current pinned tweet is the following: It is vital the UK becomes home to new innovations, like fintech and crypto currencies. My piece in @CityAM on making Great Britain the international centre for financial innovation post-Brexit ⬇️https://t.co/gcpuiGBU1Z That’s right. According to Hancock, Britain should not just embrace the famously above-board and stable world of cryptocurrencies but actually become “home” to them, whatever that might mean. From his piece: Every second advert on the tube seems to be for cryptocurrency. Britain should be the natural place to develop new markets like this – with a liberal, progressive regulatory regime that allows this radical new innovation to flourish, and allows people to take their own risks . . .  We need a commitment to a progressive, liberal environment for fintech, including cryptocurrencies, which allows people to invest their own money as they choose, to make – or lose – as much as they want. We must embrace modern technology to make life easier for people – for example making payments, especially international payments, easier and cheaper. Yeah come on regulators! Why would you try to protect people from losing all their money? There are adverts on the tube, OK? This stuff must be legit! He continues: Britain should be welcoming, embracing, and leading these changes. But over the last few years our lead in fintech has run into a reactionary risk aversion among regulators. Instead we need to embrace change, not fear it. This means putting in place a regulatory regime that protects people, especially from any systemic risks. Um, is it just us or does the final sentence there rather contradict the previous paragraph? How can Hancock be pressing for a regulatory regime that protects people and guards against systemic risk while simultaneously be pressing for a less risk-averse regulatory framework for fintech? In his comments on crypto and fintech in parliament a few days earlier, Hancock had gone even further, declaring: Post Brexit, the UK has the chance to be the home of fintech, which not only can be an economic driver, but can help to cut fraud and financial crime because of the transparency it brings. Now, we have to be honest: cutting fraud and financial crime are not *quite* the first things that come to mind when we think about crypto and fintech, but we guess we should give this man the benefit of the doubt. But all this crypto and fintech and blockchain shilling — he told the Express last week that blockchain had “a wide range of uses, in terms of secure contracts and greater transparency” — did get us wondering what was going on. Was Hancock just proving his techy credentials before gearing up for a run at the leadership in a post-Boris future? Was he eyeing up one of those cushy crypto jobs that Hammond recently landed? Or was there something else to it? In our quest for an answer, we stumbled across the Linkedin profile of Matt’s brother, Chris. It turns out that he’s the founder and CEO of a fintech firm called Crowd2Fund, a peer-to-peer lending company that claims to offer “a new generation of investments to pioneer a cultural shift away from the traditional banking systems”. The Guardian has written about this company before, back in 2019, reporting that: As minister of state for skills and enterprise in 2013, Matt Hancock worked in the government department responsible for setting up the regulatory framework for crowdfunding. In 2013, Matt Hancock told the House of Commons: “We are supporting crowdfunding on financial terms, not least through the new business bank, but we are also making sure that it can operate in a high-quality framework . . .  On a different occasion, Matt Hancock urged a fellow MP “to look also at peer-to-peer finance, whether equity or loan, because that is a small but growing part of the market that companies can look to when trying to access finance”. Hancock’s urging, according to Hansard, was in October 2013. According to Chris Hancock’s LinkedIn and Companies House records, Crowd2Fund was founded just a few months later. And Crowd2Fund isn’t Chris Hancock’s only venture into the world of fintech — he has his finger in the blockchain pie too. He has a company called Finblocks, a “global, security, compliance, deposit and payments system” that “allows clients to leverage the benefits of blockchain simply, easily and in a compliant way”. Last April, Matt Hancock was accused of “cronyism” by Labour, after he declared that he owned a 15 per cent stake in Topwood Limited, an approved supplier to NHS England. Hancock’s sister, Emily Gilruth, is named as a director of the company on Companies House. We asked Matt Hancock whether he thought there was any conflict of interest in his advocating for barriers to be removed for the fintech industry and for crypto and blockchain projects, given his brother’s work. We also asked if he had any comment on the timing of Crowd2Fund’s founding. A spokesman for the MP told us: As explained to the FT, this factless insinuation of wrong doing is not only false and baseless but embarrassing. Matt has a long-standing expertise in digital matters and the idea he shouldn’t talk about something he has detailed knowledge of because his brother is an entrepreneur is clearly absurd. This is unfounded speculation not journalism We were then sent two updated versions of the comment that took out the “embarrassing” bit and the “unfounded speculation bit”, and added that Hancock is a “champion of fintech”, but we preferred the original. We understand that Matt Hancock has no investment in crypto nor any financial interest in his brother’s fintech companies.,,Jemima Kelly,2022-02-18T16:11:28.490Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/e425dd1f-bc93-48bd-b7e6-413d8345b76d,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Silicon Valley bets on blockchain nuts and bolts,Need for infrastructure will remain after crypto craze fades, investors believe,The telecommunications bubble at the end of the 1990s never earned a place in the popular imagination to match the dotcom bubble that occurred at the same time. Deregulation and early internet euphoria combined to produce a massive over-building of new networks. An estimated $2tn of telecoms stock market value went up in smoke when the mania passed. But the new fibre optic cables that had been laid lived on, meaning that the infrastructure was already in place when companies such as Google and Facebook emerged to drive a much bigger wave of digital activity. In the world of cryptocurrencies, could something similar be taking shape with a different kind of infrastructure? When the crypto craze passes, many of the currencies that have sprung up in the shadow of bitcoin will be worthless. But their soaring transaction volumes have created demand for real infrastructure and big investments are being made. If blockchains represent a new architecture that will shape the future of online activity beyond crypto speculation, then the need for infrastructure will remain. Picking the ultimate winners in this game requires making assumptions about how this world will evolve. Will it lead to complementary, but linked, blockchains, with room for many players? Or will this be a winner-takes-all industry where a handful of networks each becomes dominant in a particular type of transaction? And will the software and services needed to make the technology usable by non-experts give rise to dominant companies in different parts of a new technology “stack”? Big investments made in two companies this week highlight where some of the most prominent venture investors are placing their bets. They also show how one of the ideals behind the cryptocurrency movement — that it will lead to decentralised networks beyond the control of narrow government or corporate interests — may not survive the twin realities of technology and capitalism. Alchemy, which has raised $200mn, supplies tools that make it easier for businesses to interact with the blockchain. When they want to post to a network or call information from it, it is often through Alchemy’s technical links, removing the need to interact directly. That puts Alchemy in a strong position to mediate the data flows to blockchains, supplying the analytics and other tools users will need to operate. The emergence of companies like this shows that new bottlenecks may already be forming in the supposedly decentralised blockchain world. The second investment — a $450mn token sale by Polygon — represents a bet on the Ethereum network. Ethereum, which was the first to offer the “smart contracts” that are at the heart of decentralised applications being built on blockchains, is severely constrained. It handles a maximum of only 13 transactions per second, and is years behind in its efforts to upgrade its network. That has driven up transaction costs, as users bid for a scarce resource. To relieve the pressure, Polygon, and companies like it, are building on top of Ethereum which could make the blockchain the central hub of a much bigger tech ecosystem. This highlights what has become known as the “blockchain trilemma”. Ideally, the networks would combine security, decentralisation and low cost. But in practice, only two of these three conditions may be possible at the same time. Ethereum has achieved security and decentralisation. Companies like Polygon, for their part, focus on security and low costs, while sacrificing a degree of decentralisation. Inevitably, this opens the door to the risk that new tech suppliers could end up controlling important parts of the value chain. Ethereum’s slow network, meanwhile, has also created an opportunity for newer networks designed to handle much higher transaction volumes. They include Solana, whose tokens are now worth a total of $34bn, and Avalanche, the latest to shoot to prominence, with a token “market cap” of $21bn. With more developers being drawn to these networks and with bridges being built between them, the odds are rising that multiple chains will coexist, with Ethereum exerting the biggest gravitational pull. Ultimately, the high valuations already being put on this new infrastructure will only be justified if the applications they support become central to the online life of many millions of people. There’s a high chance that boom will turn to bust before the ultimate answer to that question becomes clear. richard.waters@ft.com For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click ,,Richard Waters,2022-02-10T18:05:51.261Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/2d50d5ed-b652-4667-833d-9e2533a61555,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,US arrests two and seizes $3.6bn in cryptocurrency from Bitfinex hack,Prosecutors charge New York-based couple with conspiring to launder billions stolen in 2016 breach,The US Department of Justice has arrested two people and confiscated more than $3.6bn worth of cryptocurrency that it said was stolen during the high-profile 2016 hack of the Bitfinex exchange, executing the government agency’s largest financial seizure. New York-based Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, and his wife, Heather Morgan, 31, were arrested on Tuesday and accused of conspiring to launder proceeds of 119,754 bitcoin valued at $4.5bn, prosecutors said in a statement. The cryptocurrency was allegedly taken when Hong Kong-based Bitfinex was breached. The justice department’s operation came as authorities have poured resources into cryptocurrency enforcement after vowing to crack down on the criminal use of digital tokens. “Today’s arrests, and the department’s largest financial seizure ever, show that cryptocurrency is not a safe haven for criminals,” said Lisa Monaco, deputy attorney-general. US prosecutors alleged that the Bitfinex hacker launched more than 2,000 unauthorised transactions that sent stolen bitcoin from the exchange to a digital wallet controlled by Lichtenstein. The assets’ value shot from approximately $71mn at the time of the breach to more than $4.5bn due to the rise in bitcoin’s value, authorities said. Some of the stolen tokens were transferred to accounts controlled by the couple via a “complicated money laundering process” that included “chain-hopping” — jumping between different cryptocurrencies, often in rapid succession — and using tokens that have extra anonymity built into them. More than 94,000 bitcoin allegedly remained in the wallet. Representatives for Lichtenstein and Morgan could not immediately be reached for comment. They were scheduled to make initial court appearances in Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon. Morgan is also known as Razzlekhan, according to court documents. The website razzlekhan.com describes Razzlekhan as a “rapper [who is] also a software CEO, a writer, an economist, and a few contradictory other things”. Responding to questions about her own digital assets, Morgan told a virtual currency exchange: “My boyfriend (now husband) gifted me cryptocurrency over several years (2014, 2015,), [sic] which have appreciated. I have been keeping them in cold storage,” according to court documents. Bitfinex said it was “pleased” the justice department had recovered a “significant portion” of the bitcoin stolen during the hack and that it would continue to co-operate “extensively” with the agency. Cryptocurrencies have become a payment method of choice for cyber criminals including thieves as well as ransomware attacks that encrypt victims’ data until a ransom is paid, typically in bitcoin. Recommended However, every transaction is recorded on an immutable blockchain, giving investigators opportunities to monitor and trace payments, a burgeoning field known as blockchain analytics or forensics. “Today, federal law enforcement demonstrates once again that we can follow money through the blockchain, and that we will not allow cryptocurrency to be a safe haven for money laundering or a zone of lawlessness within our financial system,” said Kenneth Polite, assistant attorney-general at the DoJ’s criminal division. Lichtenstein and Morgan have been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum punishment of 20 years in prison, and conspiracy to defraud the US, which has a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

https://www.ft.com/content/2d00d0e4-0297-484d-aaa5-069bf4df64b7,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,World’s first DeFi ETF to launch in Brazil next month,Fund will invest in tokens generated by decentralised apps rather than crypto or listed companies,The world’s first exchange traded fund dedicated to decentralised finance networks is due to launch in Brazil next month, deepening the $10tn ETF industry’s foray into virtual assets. The move will allow investors to track a basket of projects betting on decentralised finance, trading and lending networks whose standards are automated and often decided by consensus. The fund, called the Hashdex DeFi Index ETF, marks a departure for an industry that hitherto has encompassed funds investing in listed crypto businesses, or popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether — where permitted by regulators. It will list on the Brazilian stock exchange on February 17. “By offering the first DeFi ETF in the world, we are providing our global investors with the ability to play a part in the next evolution of the crypto ecosystem,” said Marcelo Sampaio, chief executive of Hashdex, a Brazilian crypto asset manager. Decentralised finance aims to do away with a centralised intermediary — like a bank or an exchange — to provide financial services such as lending and trading through an algorithm. Supporters say it offers greater transparency, resistance to censorship and faster settlement times than traditional finance. It was one of the fastest-growing areas of the crypto asset industry although interest has cooled in the past two months as crypto prices have fallen. Decentralised applications (Dapps) hold about $107bn of customers’ funds, down from a November peak of $180bn, according to data from DappRadar. The Hashdex DeFi Index ETF will invest in the tokens developed by Dapps, networks built on blockchain technology and use preprogrammed algorithms to execute cryptocurrency trades. Dapp tokens can be traded on other crypto markets but also allow owners to vote on governance proposals and developments for the network. The ETF will invest in eight Dapps, as well as related service providers such as oracles, which gather data on asset prices from the outside world and send it to a blockchain or distributed ledger. The Dapps it has targeted include Uniswap, used to exchange cryptocurrencies and tokens; lender Aave; Polygon, a service designed to speed up transactions on blockchains; and Chainlink, an oracle. The ETF will track the CF DeFi Composite Index-Brazil. The launch highlights a divide between global financial centres that have thus far permitted little innovation in the growing field of digital assets, and relatively laissez-faire secondary financial hubs. While Canada, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Jersey and Liechtenstein all boast spot cryptocurrency ETPs, and Australia and India are poised to join them, US regulators have only approved futures-based versions, while those in the UK, Hong Kong and Singapore have not even permitted these vehicles. Not everyone is convinced by the more liberal approach, however. “This strikes me as an artefact of a race to the bottom with respect to crypto asset regulation in general and the regulation of registered funds that invest in such assets more generally,” Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, said of the Hashdex fund. A rival issuer described the ETF as “cool”, but said it was “more iterative, rather than highly innovative”, building on the network of crypto basket exchange traded products already available. Bruno Sousa, head of global operations at Hashdex, said Dapp tokens are “structurally very different” from cryptocurrencies. Many use the ethereum blockchain, which can hold financial assets and allows programmers to code functions for buying and selling into smart contracts. That allows them to be used for lending, insurance, trading and staking assets. “These are similar to start-ups. They have solutions for given sections of the market. If they do well they will grow, if they don’t they will diminish and the token will dwindle in value,” Sousa said. Formed in 2018, Hashdex at present has one ETF in Brazil, the $350m Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETF (HASH11), which it claims is the largest crypto basket ETF in the world, attracting investors ranging from retail to macro hedge funds. It also runs a similar US-based private fund in conjunction with Victory Capital. Recommended Hashdex hopes to launch similar products elsewhere but is reliant on the speed of regulatory change. “Other places are moving with different rhythms. Given the current regulatory landscape in the US, there is no clear pathway for a spot ETF,” said Sousa. “Our expectation, in general, is that the regulators will become ever more comfortable with structures like this and acknowledge that this is a way to buy into the market that the regulator can see and touch, and can engage with the issuers,” he said. In the meantime, launching in Brazil gives Hashdex “the ability to test new products and see how the public react”. DEFI11 will charge an annual fee of 1.3 per cent, high for an ETF but competitive for digital asset funds, particularly multi-asset baskets. With smaller market capitalisations than cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, the underlying tokens may be even more volatile. Amid a global market sell-off, the CF DeFi Composite Index-Brazil has fallen 44 per cent since its launch on December 1 last year. “That is a consequence of assets that are seen as risk assets in general, from stocks to crypto,” Sousa said. “Crypto does respond to the regular market. Over longer periods there is less correlation but in times of high stress, that does affect investors [as] they will have hands in different pots. “This is normal. A 40 per cent dip is something that happens with some frequency in crypto, but what happens is that it continues to grow,” Sousa argued. “Look at this with intellectual humility. This is a phenomenon that is based on a technological advance that is massive. This is a major advance like the internet in the 1990s.” Additional reporting by Philip Stafford For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click Click here to visit the ETF Hub,,Steve Johnson,2022-01-31T07:26:45.240Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/f5d5bed3-8cf2-40c6-8f85-6b824a223ffe,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Would you buy a home in the metaverse?,Millions are being invested in virtual property — but what do you get for your money in reality?,For many homeowners, the Covid-19 pandemic forced a change in perspective on where they wanted to live. Why stay in a cramped apartment in the smoggy city when you can Zoom into your meetings from a country farmhouse or Edwardian manor or Martello tower? Or why not buy your own island, complete with villa? Part of an exclusive 100 person community called Fantasy Islands, far away from the hustle and bustle of crowded city streets, its website lists it as the creation of “lady pirate poet” Agadora Humphries. And with prices starting as low as $104,000, it’s a steal —less than half the average cost of a first-time buyer’s house in the UK. There is one slight catch, though — you can’t actually live in it because it only exists online. It exists in The Sandbox, a metaverse: one of many virtual worlds filled with digital assets ranging from dresses and sneakers to art and cars. Users buy a digital receipt of the property, a non-fungible token (NFT) that is recorded on a shared digital ledger known as a blockchain, similar to how cryptocurrency transactions are logged. Welcome to the future of real estate — at least according to enthusiasts, who point at the millions of dollars already being thrown into the space. For its detractors, it looks like a rehash of earlier virtual worlds, with blockchain hype stuck on the end. Prices start at $104,000 — less than half the average cost of a first-time buyer’s house in the UK In 1992, long before the blockchain went viral, Neal Stephenson’s cyberpunk novel Snow Crash touched on the idea of virtual real estate. Jordan Fragen, senior market analyst at gaming data company Newzoo, says that would-be digital tycoons first got the chance to buy online virtual property in the mid-2000s. Platforms such as Second Life and science-fiction game Entropia Universe, which both predate Facebook, were the lab. In 2012, part of a “planet” in Entropia Universe sold for $2.5m; landowners receive a cut of the planet’s gross revenue generated via its internal economy, and can rent out land for virtual events, such as hunting trips. But even that sum has been dwarfed by a $4.3m purchase in The Sandbox, one of the better-known metaverses. Metaverse company Republic Realm bought the land as part of a venture it intends to develop with games company Atari, says chief executive Janine Yorio, adding that the business began as an experiment during the pandemic. “We launched the first project in March and it very quickly became clear it wasn’t nuts and that there were other people trying to figure it out,” she says. Facebook’s choice during its annus horribilis last year to rebrand itself as Meta has also helped drive interest in the metaverse phenomenon, she adds. Recommended Republic Realm launched Fantasy Islands last August, a development of 100 islands with villas that buyers can “visit”, remodel, use to show off their NFT artworks and host friends in. Ownership also grants access to a members-only channel on chat app Discord. Yorio says 90 sold within the first 24 hours after their listing, with no plans to list the last 10 for sale any time soon. Resale listings for Fantasy Islands on NFT marketplace Rarible range from 40 ether-1,000 ether, a cryptocurrency value equivalent to, at the time of writing, $104,000 to over $2.6m (although the highest bid on Rarible is just under $1,700 at the moment). Last year, Republic Realm sold “The Metaflower”, a superyacht the company describes as “fit for after-parties and beach retreats alike”, for $650,000 in The Sandbox. The unknown buyer’s only other NFT on OpenSea — an online marketplace for NFTs — is a list of fantasy loot, including a wand and dragon’s crown which could be used in role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons. Republic Realm is also looking at products such as “a customised metaverse real estate” with a diverse portfolio of property across different metaverses, custom-builds and property management. Prices start at 350 ether, more than $900,000 . A more modest upcoming option is a customisable storefront, with rents starting at 20 ether a year (over $50,000). Proximity to points of interest, such as the virtual mansion the rapper Snoop Dogg is building, will probably command higher value. The company has also bought into rival metaverse Decentraland, building a digital shopping space called Metajuku— digitally measuring 16,000 sq ft— inspired by the Tokyo district Harajuku, known for its distinctive fashion. Decentraland is divided into exactly 90,000 parcels of land, prices for which start at $10,000. As in The Sandbox, location is everything. Land close to public plazas such as Dragon City, Vegas City and Decentraland’s own red light district are more expensive, regardless of the fact “you can teleport wherever you want” at the click of a button, says Adam de Cata, Decentraland’s head of partnerships. Yorio sees an opportunity for early investors to buy up prime real estate that will play host to interactive experiences. “Shopping is a really exciting proposition,” says Yorio. “We could be both at Nike.com, and we can do it together without being in the same place. I could pick up a pair of sneakers and show them to you and you could say, ‘It’s just not you.’” The German sports company Adidas bought land in The Sandbox last year, describing its “acquisition of a plot of land on the platform [as] a way of expressing our excitement around the possibilities it holds”. Yorio says that real-world property developers are mistaken if they believe they can simply transition into the metaverse. “We’ve confused an existing industry, whose skills in bricks and mortar are inappropriate for a virtual world. Every day I wake up to a barrage of emails from real-estate developers . . . but nobody needs serviced apartments in the metaverse,” she says. “The metaverse is better than reality, it’s different than reality — that’s what’s going to make it part of our lives.” De Cata echoes that sentiment. “There’s a level of absurdity to the metaverse, there aren’t the limits you need to deal with in a physical space,” he says. Last year, the socialite Paris Hilton DJ-ed at a Decentraland festival hosted in outer space. While those looking to buy ready-built developments can turn to companies like Republic Realm, would-be land buyers can go direct to metaverse owners or through marketplaces such as Parcel, the self-described “Zillow for the metaverse”. Parcel is currently mainly selling undeveloped virtual land, says Noah Gaynor, chief executive and co-founder, reflecting the early state of the metaverse. But he sees a bright future in more complex transactions. “We also want to facilitate rentals, like you want to Airbnb out your virtual condo, and financial services like mortgages, and then also bring together service providers and landowners,” he adds. Gaynor says there has been interest from family offices, hedge funds and wealthy individuals looking to buy up land in metaverses alongside institutional investors. But the space is more complex for investors than buying land offline, says Lorne Sugarman, chief executive of Metaverse Group, which invested $2.5m in Decentraland space to host virtual fashion shows. Sugarman and Yorio both say that family offices buying undeveloped virtual land are unlikely to get the most out of their investment without teams of experienced 3D games designers. We’ve confused an industry whose skills in bricks and mortar are inappropriate for a virtual world Despite all the excitement over virtual land, it is not hard to find scepticism from those who have watched previous efforts with virtual worlds. “MMOs [massively multiplayer online games] have certainly sold virtual property before and from that perspective they have been successful,” says Fragen. “What is less clear is if these MMOs have successfully turned these properties into profitable investments for their owners on a consistent basis.” Edward Castronova, professor of media at Indiana University and an authority on virtual economies, is equally critical. “I’ve been saying the same thing about virtual real estate for 20 years or so: I never thought it was a good model and I still think it’s not.” For Castronova, the techno-utopian excitement of metaverse acolytes belies the core question — is the content good enough to compete with distractions including Netflix, YouTube, TikTok and other games, and to encourage players to return in ever-growing numbers? Those who have made money through virtual land have been the beneficiaries of hype cycles, he says, not investors in products that offer solid value in the attention economy. Dominant market leaders are also yet to emerge. Virtual events can draw in viewers for one-off occasions, but they do not offer a barrier against new entrants. “There’s nothing stopping anybody else from building this,” says angel investor Paul Griffiths, who likens owning metaverse land to “star registries”, the unofficial lists of naming rights for stellar bodies with no real provenance. Recommended “It’s kind of the same problem you see with NFTs,” says software developer and crypto-sceptic Stephen Diehl. “Who’s to say what’s the ‘real marketplace’ when there’s 40 different chains and 30 different markets, and each one is claiming to be the source of truth?” Diehl is also critical of the artificial scarcity of metaverse projects. Griffiths says the main utility is in creating the virtual simulacra of real buildings, which offers bragging rights. “Selling something that’s a big physical 3D asset [like a virtual version of a physical house] is where I see virtual transactions being helpful,” he says. “I don’t think people will go to a virtual world to order food.” Gaynor acknowledges that the next generation of metaverses will have a “second mover advantage” and are likely to move away from the generalist approach taken by current competitors. With a few exceptions, such as blockchain game Axie Infinity — which allows players to earn cryptocurrencies that they can cash out into the physical economy— there are no “killer applications”. There are also questions about what happens to the long-term future of metaverse purchases. Game servers have been shut down once companies deem the cost of running them too high — The Matrix Online, based on the film franchise, was shut down following a notably grisly body horror sequence. “Let’s imagine you’re playing a blockchain game, and you have an NFT of 62 houses and the game goes offline — it’s true that you own the NFT, but it has no value,” says Castronova. “No court has established an obligation of a company to continue to provide electricity to servers so you can access it.” Gaynor, who says that Parcel is not tied to a single metaverse, believes the future is not necessarily “winner takes all”. “I think there’ll be a few very dominant worlds, and maybe some niche worlds, but I do see a future of interoperability where we’ll be able to go from one world to another and trade between them.” At the start of Snow Crash, protagonist Hiro Protagonist looks back a decade to the unfinished nature of The Street — “the Broadway, the Champs-Elysées of the Metaverse”, remembering that “at the time, it was just a little patchwork of light amid a vast blackness”. The current state of metaverse projects feels similar. The Australian Open is currently hosting an event in Decentraland that features a digital Melbourne park stadium with NFTs, tennis-themed mini games, but no live television streams at launch due to technical problems. (Novak Djokovic is yet to make an appearance, despite the lack of vaccine passports in the metaverse.) Recommended External criticism of metaverse projects has also been scathing. A tweet of a rave in Decentraland has drawn unfavourable comparisons to Club Penguin , an online multiplayer game that ran from 2005 to 2017. Advocates argue that this is simply the start of a transformation. “The metaverse will probably see a meaningful transition to a business phase in 2022, with a wide range of services appearing on the scene,” says Yosuke Matsuda, president of vaunted game developer Square Enix, in a letter released on New Year’s Day. But Griffiths outlines the stark bet for potential metaverse investors. A project that does well and continues to build user growth could offer considerable returns. If the project fails, the land that you’ve bought is basically worthless. “There is a tonne of weird stuff that’s going to happen and it’s not clear who’s going to win.” Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan is the FT’s banking and fintech correspondent; George Steer is an FT markets reporter Follow @FTProperty on Twitter or @ft_houseandhome on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first Letters in response to this article: While you’re at it, why not invest in my boutique? / From David Sharp, London SW15, UK Virtual real estate carries climate change price tag / From Barbara Mullarney, London W36, UK,,Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan George Steer,2022-01-28T05:00:10.812Z,

Upbit launched its crypto art marketplace in November and plans to release a range of NFTs featuring members of BTS in a joint venture with the boy band’s management company, Hybe. But members of the band’s powerful young fan base have criticised NFTs and the crypto industry in general over the energy consumption involved in mining and tracking ownership of the tokens. Sirgoo Lee, chief executive of Upbit’s operator Dunamu, told the Financial Times in an interview that the joint venture with Hybe would use “low carbon, eco-friendly” technology to mint the NFTs. Lee said that Upbit’s NFT marketplace used blockchain technology developed by another Dunamu subsidiary, Lambda256, that claims to use 99.99 per cent less energy on its Luniverse platform than leading blockchain-based platforms such as ethereum. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click “We will try to explain to the fans that this is not environmentally harmful,” said Lee. The first token purchased on the platform, an image of a painting of a girl holding a cat by artist Jang Koal called “Mirage Cat 3”, was sold in November for about $173,000 of bitcoin. Luniverse claimed that the energy consumed for its entire blockchain network including NFTs was estimated to be “around 842.53kWh a year”, an amount roughly equivalent to the monthly electricity consumption of a US residential utility consumer. South Korea has one of the world’s biggest digital currency markets. The Korean won is the third most widely used currency for bitcoin trading, after the dollar and yen, accounting for 3.4 per cent of global trading, according to data from Coinhills, an industry tracker. Lee also said that there was a need for global action to address issues such as money laundering and cyber theft. In 2019, cyber criminals hacked the Upbit exchange, stealing about $49m of ether, the ethereum cryptocurrency. “One of my nightmares is being hacked and losing all [the investors’] money. It’s a huge responsibility and it keeps you up at night,” said Lee. Recommended “I’m not worried about going to jail, I’m more worried about being stabbed to death by our investors.” Many young South Koreans are enthusiastic buyers of digital assets, motivated in part by high youth unemployment and surging housing prices, according to experts. The crypto frenzy has driven a surge in bitcoin prices in South Korea, where it is trading at a 2-3 per cent premium compared with the US, narrowing a gap that reached 20 per cent last year. Lee deflected criticism that indebted young Koreans attracted to NFTs and large gains from crypto trading were being exposed to excessive financial risk, arguing that their understanding of the asset class was underestimated. “In the west, young people grew up playing consoles after school, whereas in Korea these young folks go online to play games, they are used to collecting and buying digital items,” said Lee. “These young guys understand that there’s this value in digital assets.”,,Christian Davies Song Jung-a,2022-01-26T00:15:40.684Z,

The Monetary Authority of Singapore on Monday published a set of guidelines instructing crypto businesses to stop marketing or advertising their offerings to retail investors in public spaces, both physical and virtual, calling the trading of such assets “highly risky and not suitable for the general public”. The guidelines are not legally binding, but the announcement comes as authorities have already disappointed several businesses with the slow pace of approvals for platforms looking to set up operations in Singapore. Effective immediately, cryptocurrency players should not solicit customers through ads on social media platforms or other public websites, on public transport such as buses and trains or the venues where they stop, or through broadcast and print media. They are also discouraged from providing physical ATMs for dispensing crypto tokens. This article is from Nikkei Asia, a global publication with a uniquely Asian perspective on politics, the economy, business and international affairs. Our own correspondents and outside commentators from around the world share their views on Asia, while our Asia300 section provides in-depth coverage of 300 of the biggest and fastest-growing listed companies from 11 economies outside Japan. Subscribe | Group subscriptions These digital asset service providers should also not engage external parties, such as social media influencers, to promote their crypto-based offerings to people in Singapore. They can, however, continue to market or advertise on their own corporate websites, mobile applications or official social media accounts. “The trading of cryptocurrencies is highly risky and not suitable for the general public,” Loo Siew Yee, MAS assistant managing director for policy, payments and financial crime, said in a press statement on Monday. “DPT service providers should therefore not portray the trading of DPTs in a manner that trivialises the high risks of trading in DPTs, nor engage in marketing activities that target the general public,” she added, referring to digital payment tokens, which Singapore’s central bank uses as a broad classification to cover cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ethereum and similar assets underpinned by blockchain technology. Singapore-based Foris DAX Asia, which operates the crypto.com trading platform, has been promoting its portal in movie theatres in the city-state. The company even splashed out to hire American actor Matt Damon to front its ads. Across multiplex screens in Singapore, the Hollywood star has appeared in a promotional video uttering the tagline “fortune favours the brave” for crypto.com before movies start. According to MAS guidelines, such advertisements should no longer be used in public venues to market the wares of DPT players. “The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) requires us to provide this risk warning to you as a customer of a digital payment token (DPT) service provider,” a disclaimer on crypto.com reads. “Please note that you may not be able to recover all the money or DPTs you paid to Foris DAX Asia Pte Ltd if Foris DAX Asia Pte Ltd business fails.” While there is no specified penalty should crypto service providers fail to follow the guidelines, the financial regulator is likely to take note of digital asset companies that ignore the public safeguards, which may in turn affect whether they are allowed to continue operating legally in Singapore. While the marketing framework came into effect on January 17, DPT players are being given some leeway to wind down any advertising efforts that run contrary to the guidelines, for instance if certain contractual obligations need to be fulfilled. Singapore’s central bank is taking a similar stance on the matter to the UK, where the advertising watchdog has moved to clamp down on “misleading” marketing carried out by crypto players. The city-state’s guidelines also come as regulators across jurisdictions tighten scrutiny of the emerging crypto sector, which is known for operating across borders and away from regulatory oversight. But for crypto players, the move by the MAS to curtail their ability to target Singaporean customers adds to the difficulty many of them already face operating in the city-state. These businesses have raced to set up in Singapore in the past few years to leverage its status as a prominent hub for the growth of financial technology services. They run the spectrum from exchange platforms for trading crypto, to investment managers and financial advisers looking after digital asset portfolios for the wealthy. Authorities, however, have set a high benchmark for granting licences, with only a handful awarded so far. Under Singapore’s Payment Services Act, businesses that provide offerings relating to DPTs are regulated primarily for money laundering and terrorism financing risks, as well as technology risks. To operate legally, they need to apply for licences in the area of “digital payment token services”. Since the Act took effect in January 2020, there have been about 180 applications for permits for such services. But only five of these have been awarded in-principle approvals, the MAS said. Sixty DPT applications were withdrawn, while three have been rejected. This failure rate comes in stark contrast to the image cast of Singapore as a crypto-friendly location relative to other jurisdictions such as China, which has banned the digital asset. In view of the rapidly changing landscape for the industry, the MAS said it would continue to review the provision of DPT services to the public by providers and may update these guidelines as necessary. The regulator had asked crypto stakeholders and the Singapore FinTech Association, a lobby group for tech-based financial businesses in the city-state, for feedback on the guidelines before they were published. The SFA said in a statement that the new framework demonstrates that Singapore continues to see blockchain and cryptocurrencies as innovations that have the potential to gain mass adoption in the community, acknowledging that such adoption should be “balanced with pragmatic guardrails”. “The technology behind blockchain has the potential to open many exciting opportunities for the industry and bring benefits to consumers,” said Shadab Taiyabi, president of the SFA. “Opening the doors to innovation also requires a system of checks and balances to be put in place before consumers gain full awareness and understanding of the new tools.” A version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on January 17 2022. ©2022 Nikkei Inc.

Demand for property soared during the pandemic, but an analysis of Land Registry data found the full sale process took an average 295 days from start to finish, as estate agents, solicitors, mortgage brokers, lenders, buyers and sellers grapple with the paperwork. Coadjute is the latest attempt to digitise the UK’s convoluted conveyancing process. It has now begun a national roll out, enabling all parties involved in a property transaction to securely share data and track live progress of the deal from start to finish. Backed by Swiss venture capitalist firm Blockchain Valley Ventures, Coadjute comes after two previous attempts to modernise the conveyancing process by the Land Registry and the Law Society ended in failure. Dan Salmons, chief executive, said that because Coadjute is a digital network that uses private blockchain — a record of asset ownership — to connect to existing systems that different groups of professionals already use, it can enable data, documentation and live updates to be shared in real time without having to use a standalone piece of software. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click It is already integrated within the most popular case management systems that are used by property professionals, such as Redbrick, and he said consumers would also be able to see live updates on their housing transactions in real time later this year. Salmons, a former NatWest director who spearheaded the introduction of contactless cards, said the ability for different professionals to use blockchain securely to share centralised documents, such as identity checks, title deeds and local searches would “synchronise what is a highly fragmented process” and speed up transaction times. He added the technology would make it easier for professionals to spot omissions and other factors holding up deals, making the homebuying process less stressful for consumers and more efficient for professionals, who will pay to use the service. One of Salmons’ team is currently moving house. “Since his offer was accepted nine months ago, he’s made 323 phone calls chasing up where the deal has got to,” he said. “The problem is, the people you’re calling don’t know the answer. They have to make another phone call to find out, and the consumer has no visibility over where they are in the process.” Coadjute is one of several fintech innovations attempting to crack this problem, others include View My Chain, a data-driven chain management tool for agents, buyers and sellers. Industry professionals believe Coadjute’s chances of success will depend on how widely its data-sharing model is adopted. “The time is absolutely ripe for technology to resolve these issues, but everyone needs to be on board for this to succeed,” said Andrew Montlake, managing director of mortgage broker Coreco. “I was sceptical at first, but when you look at the number of case management systems, estate agents and search companies Coadjute’s got involved, it stands a good chance,” said Beth Rudolf, director of delivery at the Conveyancing Association, a trade body for the industry. Recommended “For consumers, the difficulty is this process only starts when their offer is accepted. There are so many problems with leaseholds, title and restrictive covenants, it would be better if this data were collected up front and made available at the point of sale.” She added that, currently, 34 per cent of property transactions fall through. “It can be easy to fix these problems if you have time to do it, but not if you have a buyer desperate to proceed.” The ability to collect and share data up front could also help to minimise disputes and delays caused by rows over what fixtures and fittings are included with the property. Coadjute is taking part in a pilot scheme to improve this process with the Home Buying and Selling Group, a government initiative to bring the industry together to improve the consumer experience. “A lot of these industry problems are fundamentally issues of not having secure access to data,” Salmons said.,,Claer Barrett,2022-01-21T12:49:27.107Z,

It’s a small company, only elevated to the Nasdaq last year. You could look at the bividend as a stunt, a canny bit of investor relations with a Twitter-friendly brand name. It’s a possibility that BTCS’s chief executive, Charles Allen, cheerfully acknowledges. He wanted people to see the value in the company and read its filings. Success! Behind the bividend is a bet that, if correct, could have much larger consequences. Allen is offering to pay investors in bitcoin in part because BTCS has 90 bitcoins sitting on its balance sheet that have value, but no productive purpose. Bitcoin, according to Allen, is a unproductive asset, “just literally sitting there”. It might appreciate. But it doesn’t generate revenue, which has historically been the purpose of a publicly listed company. BTCS was founded as a pure cryptocurrency company in what now seems like the Precambrian era in 2013. It started in ecommerce, selling products for bitcoin. It moved on to bitcoin mining, suffered through what Allen calls a “crypto winter”, then spent some time buying bitcoin and ethereum, thinking about what to do next. According to its last quarterly filing, the company now holds two kinds of cryptocurrencies, which sit on different parts of its balance sheet. Along with dollar cash and prepaid expenses, the company holds $3.2m in “digital assets/currencies”. These are the 90 bitcoins, sitting in treasury, doing . . . nothing. The company also has $8.8m in “staked digital assets/currencies”, the core of its new strategy. The staked currencies are mostly ethereum. They have a job, and generated $1.2m in revenue last year (the number is unaudited, but is consistent with the company’s audited quarterly reports). Again, these are small numbers. What matters is the distinction. The ethereum has a job. The bitcoin does not. BTCS has begun staking — placing ethereum and some other cryptocurrencies in a kind of digital escrow, vying for a chance to verify a ledger of transactions. The more coins you have staked, the higher the likelihood you’ll get to verify the ledger. The reward is a fee of more coins. The company is also running so-called validator nodes — staking pools that will bring in others’ coins from outside its balance sheet. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click The bitcoin protocol is not designed for staking. Bitcoin, by design, supposed to just sit there, hopefully becoming more valuable, transferable if necessary. This is good if you hold bitcoin and are optimistic about its future. It is bad, however, if you’re a publicly listed company, trying to figure out how to produce revenue. The bet on bitcoin in particular has always been that the more people hold it, the more useful it will become. There’s a difference, however, between “holding” and “useful”. The bividend is not, strictly speaking, a dividend — profit, paid out to shareholders. Rather, it’s a return of capital. Conveniently for shareholders, this makes the bividend tax free. It also makes it a bit like a share repurchase, a tacit confession that says here, you take this, because we don’t have any plans for it. If BTCS is right, bitcoin is headed for a strange twilight. It is not quite ready cash. Nor it is a productive asset. After BTCS made its announcement Hanno Lustig, an economist at Stanford Graduate School of Business, pointed out that the company was part of a long tradition of paying out dividends in kind. In the 17th century, he wrote, the Dutch West India Company paid out dividends in cloves. Other early modern joint stock companies used the same model. England’s Royal African Company paid out its dividend in gold coins that only over time came to be known as guineas, named for the African coast the gold came from. Guineas were a dividend first, and only became a unit of account over time. The joachimsthaler, the big silver coin that served as a model for taler and daler coins around the Baltic — and eventually what came to be known in the US as the Spanish dollar — was originally a dividend, too, paid out to Saxon joint-stock investors in a Bohemian silver mine. But this isn’t quite what BTCS is doing. All these early-modern joint stock companies paid their in-kind dividends out of revenues. The Royal African Company exported gold from Africa — the gold itself was a revenue. The West India Company exported cloves. The Saxon joint stock companies mined silver. BTCS’s revenues, however, come in the form of ethereum, or the other coins on its balance sheet that it can stake. In its actual business, it does not earn bitcoin. According to Allen, the company may in the future pay out actual dividends in ethereum. But for the time being, it is merely paying a bividend — a return of capital in the form of bitcoin, an asset that has value, but no purpose.,,Brendan Greeley,2022-01-08T05:00:37.199Z,

Worldcoin offered free digital tokens to anyone willing to have their eyeball scanned. More than 100,000 people signed up. The demand suggests 2022 could be the year alternative coins challenge bitcoin’s supremacy. In today’s column we make a series of predictions for the year ahead. For now, bitcoin remains the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency. It has a market capitalisation of $887bn, according to CoinGecko. This is about twice the size of the second-largest, ether. Amid the usual volatility, prices hit new heights in 2021 amid hopes of greater mainstream acceptance. In April, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase listed in the US. In October, the first US exchange traded bitcoin fund was launched. Bitcoin’s price jumped above $67,500 in November before falling back below $50,000 this month. Uneven price progression will continue. Company interest in alternative currencies is not yet consistent. Tesla declared that holding bitcoin as an alternative to cash proved its liquidity. It then sold down its holding and decided bitcoin could no longer be used to buy its electric vehicles. The future of all digital tokens still rests with regulators. The US Securities and Exchange Commission permitted a bitcoin ETF to proceed because it holds futures contracts traded on a regulated exchange rather than bitcoins directly. The world’s biggest crypto exchange, Binance, remains unregulated and unlisted. It has clashed with regulators in Singapore. China announced in September that crypto transactions were illegal. The head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, has warned that investors could get hurt without more oversight. Yet while watchdogs prevaricate, the institutions that fret that blockchain and cryptocurrencies could eliminate their expensive third-party services will continue to stake a claim in the sector. Governments will continue to promote their own, central bank-run digital currencies.

Ether is used to purchase non-fungible tokens — now a $15bn market — and is at the heart of decentralised finance.

The collective, CityDAO, has no official leader. Its members organise themselves using the chat app Discord. Every major decision must go up for a vote. Nonetheless, the group of 5,000 successfully mobilised in under four months to purchase a 40-acre plot of land in Park County, Wyoming, near the Montana state border. Members are still debating what comes next, but the DAO’s lofty goals include widening access and lowering the costs of property ownership and developing new systems for public finance. And they want to do it all using cryptocurrency software. “It’s a community experiment,” said Scott Fitsimones, the unofficial founder of the project. CityDAO is one of the most visible examples of the hundreds of so-called decentralised autonomous organisations, loose groups of cryptocurrency users who band together for a central purpose, whether it be governing an open-source software program or buying real-world assets. The groups have recently soared in popularity among cryptocurrency die-hards, who envision a future where software code plays a larger role in governing large organisations. DAOs can have more “accessibility and transparency” than corporations, said Linda Xie, co-founder of the cryptocurrency investment group Scalar Capital. “No one is controlling it,” Xie said. “It’s like a collective decision making.” But even some of cryptocurrency’s most ardent supporters have struggled to define DAOs, and the projects face many legal hurdles in the US, where companies and other organisations must adhere to strictly defined regulations. “It’s not a binary thing, like you’re a DAO or you’re not,” Xie said. “People use the term very freely.” Advocates for DAOs said they are more democratic than corporations, allowing practically anybody in the world to participate in decision making. They also argue that blockchains make it easier to create permanent, unalterable records and govern the large, loosely arranged groups. DAOs take on many forms, but they usually organise on digital ledgers such as the ethereum blockchain that allow developers to write software programs, or “smart contracts”, that automatically execute transactions when the right conditions are met. Many issue cryptocurrency tokens that give owners the ability to participate in governance. “Web3 is starting to turn users and contributors into investors, and vice versa,” said Ian Lee, co-founder of the DAO software company Syndicate, referring to a term for token-based cryptocurrency apps that aim to create a new version of the internet. In practical terms, most DAOs look like chat rooms with a shared bank account. Most importantly, according to members, DAOs should not be controlled by any single person, though in practice some look more like centralised corporations with venture capital backers and other insiders owning significant chunks of tokens. DAOs are tiny compared with the rest of the corporate world, with a total of $12.1bn in cryptocurrency assets in reserves and about 1.6m members in groups tracked by the data service DeepDAO. However, they have already captured the attention of Wall Street. Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager, has invested in Syndicate, which wants to make it easier for people to create investment DAOs. In November, a group known as ConstitutionDAO raised $47m to buy an original copy of the US Constitution, only to be outbid at auction by Ken Griffin, founder of the hedge fund Citadel. Some DAO members have complained that they can be unwieldy to manage compared with centralised organisations. Like other new cryptocurrency experiments, they face legal jeopardy. The first attempt at a DAO, called “The DAO”, raised more than $150m in 2016 as an experiment in community-directed investing before an attacker exploited holes in the code to steal one-third of the funds. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click In response, members of the ethereum community voted to effectively alter code backing the hacker’s funds, creating a new version of the blockchain and returning the funds back to the DAO. Critics said the decision undermined the supposed permanence of the software network. The state of Wyoming, which first developed the limited liability company structure, passed legislation this year that allowed the formation of “DAO LLCs” managed by smart contracts. More than 110 entities have registered as DAO LLCs in Wyoming since the state passed legislation, including four that switched from normal LLCs, a representative for the state treasury said in an email. Critics of the legislation have argued its language does not clearly define how DAO LLCs should be managed. Legislators are considering amendments to the original law. Cryptocurrency lawyers said for-profit DAOs had largely registered as Delaware LLCs, one of the most popular corporate structures in the US. “A lot of the things that people are doing are probably legal,” said Chris Rothfuss, a Democrat who co-chairs a Wyoming state Senate committee on blockchain technology. “Probably legal is not a comfortable phrase.” Rothfuss said he hoped the law would bring more financial technology entrepreneurs to Wyoming, helping diversify the state’s economy away from mineral extraction. Fitsimones said he had become inspired to start CityDAO because of Wyoming’s legislation and that he hoped it would make it easier for larger groups to collectively own and manage land using the blockchain. “There’s something really cool about land because land feels like such a primitive piece of the puzzle,” Fitsimones said. “If you can put land on-chain, what is the next step?” Members of CityDAO must purchase one of 10,000 non-fungible tokens to take part in discussions. They can sell their NFT at any time if they want to quit. Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of the ethereum blockchain, and Brian Armstrong, chief executive of the cryptocurrency company Coinbase, have both purchased the “citizen NFTs”, which do not give the holders a stake in the physical land or the rights to any income. Fitsimones acknowledged the project still faced hurdles, and its core team members have said most of their time is spent on legal issues. “The worst-case scenario for this law is in a court some judge is like, ‘I’m not reading the smart contract code. This is a bunch of baloney’,’’ Fitsimones said. “And the best-case scenario is this law becomes this fundamental link between digital assets, crypto and the physical world.”,,Miles Kruppa Hannah Murphy,2021-12-27T05:00:45.009Z,

It highlights the applications that banks are trying to find for blockchain — digital ledger technology that records and verifies transactions and underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, to further automate areas like payments. Siemens said the improved automation is needed to process the far greater number of payments it expects due to the growing popularity of payment models like pay per use. “If the business would stay the same as it is today, I would say we are fine regarding our treasury set-up. We can automate a bit and maybe we reduce costs and cash allocation,” Heiko Nix, head of cash management and payments at Siemens, told the Financial Times. “This is not the reason why we are doing this. The reason is that we are seeing a huge change due to the emerging digital business models, because we will no longer be able to forecast cash, for example.” The system is being used to transfer money automatically between Siemens’ own accounts.

https://www.ft.com/content/b8d78b6b-a7fa-4525-8c68-99c468aac241,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Bankers quietly mould crypto innovations for their own use,Conservative corporate treasurers are being offered blockchain solutions to legacy problems,When Elon Musk revealed this year that he had invested $1.5bn of Tesla’s corporate cash in bitcoin, many grown-up financiers winced. No wonder. The world of corporate treasury management is supposed to be a deadly dull place, where safety rules. No one expects treasurers to dance with the crypto kids. But these days something striking is quietly happening on Wall Street: some grown-up bankers are starting to offer those conservative treasurers some crypto-focused solutions too. Take JPMorgan. This year, Umar Farooq, head of the bank’s Onyx project (which has created a JPMorgan crypto coin and ethereum-style blockchain platform), revealed that it is developing so-called “programmable money” for corporate clients. This aims to enable treasurers to cut deals with partners via a shared computing ledger, on autopilot, with an innovation known as “smart contracts”. It sounds futuristic. But the bank is poised to announce that one of the world’s biggest industrial groups is embracing this crypto innovation. No, this is not the same as Musk’s adventures with bitcoin: instead of using crypto as a store of value (ie investment), the JPMorgan initiative uses it as a payment method to transfer values linked to other assets — including fuddy-duddy fiat currency. However, this second usage of crypto will almost certainly end up being far more important than bitcoin for the business world, not least because it comes as other banks are racing to develop crypto-innovations, too. To cite another example: this week HSBC and Wells Fargo revealed plans to use blockchain to settle foreign exchange transactions between financial institutions. The impetus behind these experiments is a recognition among financiers that treasurers face at least three big headaches. The first is that companies need armies of staff to execute (and check) treasury transactions, which is costly and carries the risk of human error as transactions rise. The second is that settling treasury transactions typically takes a few hours (if not days), particularly across borders. That creates a third headache: to offset these execution lags, companies and banks need large buffers of cash to cover delays and risks. In theory, these three issues could be resolved (or reduced) if legacy financial systems became better automated, offering faster execution and settlement. This is now happening to some degree, as the competitive threat of crypto (belatedly) forces traditional systems to become more cutting-edge. The saga around the Swift messaging system is a case in point. However, in practice it is often very difficult to upgrade legacy systems and a wider business dash into digital is leaving companies drowning in cross-border micropayments. So the “programmable money” project tries to offer a workaround, by, say, enabling a micropayment to be instantly made and settled at moment of “sale” and netted against other transactions in a corporate account, or so JPMorgan hopes. Will it work? It remains to be seen. JPMorgan has already had some success in using blockchain and its own crypto coin for bank-to-bank transactions; with over 400 banks using these. Entities such as DBS, Standard Chartered and HSBC have digital initiatives too. But some non-financial corporate experiments have been less successful. Back in 2018, for example, BP and other energy companies unveiled a blockchain-based system to trade oil. Yet earlier this year Karen Scarbrough, a senior technology associate at BP, admitted that the project “really hasn’t panned out like we thought”, and had been rolled back. The reason, it seems, was that it is cumbersome to update a shared computer ledger with current blockchain technology — so “blockchain is not an excellent tool for tracking and tracing”, yet. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click Crypto enthusiasts retort that blockchain is now far more efficient due to tech upgrades. But we simply do not know yet whether it can scale. Nor do we know how regulators will respond; the devil will be in the digital detail. Nevertheless, there are already three important lessons that investors should note. First, while enthusiasts used to assume that crypto innovations would disintermediate legacy institutions, the establishment is fighting back. Second, while crypto enthusiasts also used to extol the idea of “public”, permissionless blockchains (ie ones that anyone can join, without asking), the real action for companies is with “private” chains (ie those where access is controlled). This focus on private chains may be temporary. The internet started life in the form of private “intranets”, which were subsequently linked to create the public net. But the increase in private — not public — chains raises a third key point: the reason why big companies and banks might want to use blockchain for payments is not to be anonymous, but for reasons of flexibility, automation and speed. Crypto is no longer (just) a tool to create trust where none exists or subvert authority. This subtle twist might horrify libertarians. But it is also a sign that the crypto world is growing up. All eyes are now on how regulators and corporate treasurers respond to the idea of “programmable money”; even if it is not as readily tweetable as Musk. gillian.tett@ft.com Letter in response to this column: What blockchain owes to Kubrick’s masterpiece/ From Neil McNaughton, Editor, Oil IT Journal, Sèvres, France ,,Gillian Tett,2021-12-16T17:58:29.150Z,

From Monday, they will use blockchain technology to reconcile and pay out on deals in dollars, sterling, euro and Canadian dollars between the two banks, using HSBC’s FX Everywhere platform. The agreement means they will bypass CLS, the nearly two-decades-old utility that central banks urge market participants to use to neutralise the risk of certain trade failures. The move is the latest example of blockchain technology seeping into the $6.6tn-a-day foreign currency market, and resetting relationships between the big investment banks and central banks. Earlier this month, the central banks of Switzerland and France successfully tested the first cross-border payment on the blockchain as part of a series of projects around central bank digital currencies. Mark Jones, co-head of macro at Wells Fargo, said it would be the first time blockchain technology had been used to settle live cross-border payments. “We believe this will be the first step of many utilising transformative technology across our industry in the years ahead,” he added. He acknowledged the move would cut out CLS, the US Federal Reserve-regulated entity that settles trillions of dollars worth of global currency deals and ensures both sides of a trade are paid simultaneously. The two banks also said they hoped to expand the system to other banks and emerging market currencies that CLS does not settle. Mark Williamson, global head of FX partnerships at HSBC, said the banks were also talking to financial market infrastructure operators about their potential involvement. He declined to name the parties but said a decision was likely to come next year. The agreement is an extension of HSBC’s plans to use blockchain technology more widely in making sure that currency trades are correctly logged and settled after it launched its FX Everywhere platform in early 2019. By using the technology, both HSBC and Wells will have real-time transparency of the settlement status of foreign exchange trades in the four initial currencies. Recommended Blockchain’s growing role in post-trade processes highlights the various ways in which banks approach cryptocurrency and its underlying technology. Christine Moy, global head of Liink Onyx, the blockchain division at JPMorgan, said on a panel at the FT’s Global Banking Summit that while the bank does not trade bitcoin, it has been active in researching and finding applications for blockchain technology for six years. Moy noted that JPMorgan completed a blockchain-based intraday repo transaction in December and it was the first bank three years ago to provide bank accounts to regulated crypto exchanges such as Coinbase and Gemini. “When people think of a bank in crypto the first thing they think is: are you doing custody, are you trading spot? We don’t . . . but we’ve been supporting the crypto ecosystem in [different] ways,” she said. Wells will pay HSBC a small fee for using the platform, but the costs are likely to be lower than using CLS.

There was little they could do. Maduro had tightened his grip on the country’s purse strings; tough US sanctions had exacerbated an already dreadful economic crisis; and neither the government nor the browbeaten opposition could spare any cash for doctors and nurses. But the president’s opponents had one potential weapon: access to Venezuelan state funds frozen in US bank accounts. Ever since Venezuelan congressman Juan Guaidó launched his audacious attempt to unseat Maduro in 2019, the US government has recognised him as the legitimate president of Venezuela. Washington argues, therefore, that Venezuelan state money seized by US authorities belongs to Guaidó’s administration — not Maduro’s de facto government. Recommended Guaidó’s people figured that, if they could persuade the US Treasury to release the money, they could pay health workers a bonus. They asked US law firm Sullivan & Cromwell to help. Sergio Galvis, head of its Latin America practice, led a 14-strong team including experts in “a huge range of disciplines — banking, cyber security, sanctions, payment systems and foreign exchange controls”, he says. Sullivan & Cromwell’s first job was to convince the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (Ofac) to release the funds. “It was very, very important to Ofac and the US government that the money was really going to the intended recipients,” Galvis says. The next hurdle was to find a way to send the money to Venezuela securely, without it being intercepted by the Maduro regime or the many creditors suing for compensation for broken promises and assets expropriated during the past 22 years of revolutionary socialist rule. Post-Trump Supreme Court faces stern tests of impartiality People-focused leadership Radical change from joint efforts Creative practitioners crack tough legal problems The brainstorm that triggered a blockchain breakthrough The lawyers battling to right historic wrongs That meant sending money through the Venezuelan banking system was not an option. So Sullivan & Cromwell joined forces with tech businesses, including digital currency company Circle, to funnel the money to Venezuela via other means. “We were able to put in place an aid disbursement pipeline that leveraged the power of USDC — dollar-backed, open, internet-based digital currency payments — to bypass the controls imposed by Maduro over the domestic financial system,” Circle says on its website. The money was deposited in digital wallets created by online payment platform Airtm. Doctors and nurses had to register on the Airtm website to receive payment. This caused some problems. Guaidó’s team says the Maduro regime blocked Airtm, forcing recipients to use VPNs (virtual private networks) to access payments. Canadian VPN company TunnelBear provided free access to its services for a while, arguing that “healthcare workers deserve the benefits of an open and uncensored internet”. Once the recipients had the money in their digital wallets, they could spend it online, transfer it to local bank accounts in the Venezuelan currency, bolívars, or send it to other Airtm users. In all, Guaidó’s team says the scheme channelled $18m to more than 60,000 doctors and nurses. The payments were set up as $300 per person in three monthly instalments of $100. In a country where the official minimum wage is less than $3 a month, it was appreciated at a time when healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, had to survive on little. Did the system work? Generally, yes, says Mauro Zambrano, a union representative for Venezuelan health workers. “There were some problems, and some workers only received two of their three payments, but a lot of people got the money and it made a difference,” he says. There were some problems . . . but a lot of people got the money and it made a difference Guaidó, Ofac and Sullivan & Cromwell might regard the money transfers as a noble enterprise but, to Maduro, they were theft. From his point of view, the US had stolen Venezuelan state funds and handed them to a puppet administration led by the unelected Guaidó, which in turn disbursed them to selected health workers without proper oversight. For Galvis, though, the legal case is watertight. He says his firm’s client “was a government recognised by the US, operating in compliance with US law, which is pretty clear on this”. Once the US secretary of state “has designated ‘X’ as the recognised government of a country, that is binding on all arms of the US government”, he adds. Galvis explains the essence of what Sullivan & Cromwell was trying to achieve: “We had to come up with a system that complied with US sanctions rules and could lawfully get money into the electronic wallet of a nurse sitting in Caracas so she could go to the supermarket and buy milk.” Rescue, restructuring and recovery; dispute resolution. All case studies researched, compiled and ranked by RSGI. ‘Winner’ indicates the organisation won an FT Innovative Lawyers 2021 award WINNER: Milbank The firm implemented a novel financing structure that enabled carriers American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Air Canada and Spirit Airlines to raise capital during the coronavirus pandemic. Milbank acted as legal counsel to lead underwriters in these transactions. The airlines used their frequent flyer loyalty programmes as investment assets, turning them into separate subsidiaries. The financings last year — $6.8bn for United, $10bn for American, and $9bn for Delta — were among the largest in the industry’s history. Their structure provides a model for other loyalty programme financings for airlines globally. Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld In collaboration with the National Independent Venue Association (NIVA), which represents more than 3,000 music clubs and performing arts venues in the US, the firm ran the Save Our Stages campaign, which lobbied the federal government for Covid relief funding for venues. The firm secured bipartisan support by focusing on economic arguments. The Save Our Stages Act was signed into law in December 2020, securing $16bn in emergency funds — equivalent to nearly half of the venues’ revenues in 2019. Bracewell The firm secured an order from the federal energy regulator to secure $800,000 owed by Gulfport Energy Corporation to its client, the Rockies Express Pipeline, before Gulfport filed for bankruptcy. This order stated that Gulfport was not allowed to cancel contracts unless it was in the public interest. The firm had to secure this declaration before the bankruptcy was filed because automatic stay, which halts certain actions against the distressed party in a bankruptcy, would have prevented the regulator from acting. Hogan Lovells The firm advised the republic of Ecuador on the restructuring of $17.4bn of the country’s external debt. The firm used a collective action clause, which is uncommon for a restructuring of this size. To persuade a large and disparate group of international investors to accept the terms, the clause allows a supermajority of bondholders to enforce a legally binding restructuring on all holders, including those that vote against it. The firm has since been approached by the city of Córdoba in Argentina to restructure $150m of debt using the same approach. Kirkland & Ellis The firm represented US department store chain JCPenney in its bankruptcy proceedings. The company was split into an operating company, which manages the business, and a property company — a holding company that owns the property. Under this arrangement, the operating company leases the real estate from the property company. The firm brought in an external consortium led by real estate investors Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners, which owns malls that house JCPenney stores, to buy the operating company. The restructuring preserved 60,000 jobs at JCPenney, two-thirds of the workforce. Commended: Josh Sussburg Milbank Representing the first lien holders in the JCPenney bankruptcy proceedings, the firm worked with creditors to identify attractive assets for the department store chain’s property company. The retailer had acquired hundreds of properties over many decades, held in different legal entities, which the law firm organised into the property company — a single legal entity leased to Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners, owners of the operating company. The opco-propco structure could be replicated for other distressed retailers. Morrison & Foerster The firm structured the California Rebuilding Fund to help small businesses in the US state weather the Covid-19 pandemic. The fund acquires capital from private, philanthropic and public sector resources, and provides loans to businesses. It does this through community development financial institutions, such as development banks, which underwrite the loans. The fund has raised more than $100m to date and has received applications from more than 3,000 businesses. Sullivan & Cromwell The Venezuelan opposition, led by Juan Guaidó, wanted to use assets frozen under international sanctions against the Nicolás Maduro government to provide financial support for the country’s healthcare workers during the Covid-19 crisis. The law firm designed the legal framework and secured licences, allowing frozen assets held by the US to be released. Funds were transferred to healthcare workers’ mobile phones using blockchain platform Circle, to be spent as cash via Airtm, a digital payments platform. Weil, Gotshal & Manges AMC, one of the world’s largest cinema chains, capitalised on the boom in retail share trading in June by relying on at-the-market equity offerings to avoid an in-court restructuring. At-the-market offerings are a way for companies to raise money by incrementally selling newly issued shares, or shares they already own, on the secondary trading market — normally a risky way for a company facing bankruptcy to raise capital. The firm worked with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to gain regulatory approval for the plan and negotiated significant concessions from the cinema chain’s landlords. White & Case The firm advised car rental company Hertz on its restructuring of $19bn of debt. Securitisation was the principal source of exit financing from the bankruptcy — a first for a transaction of this size. Securitisation and an exit from bankruptcy are traditionally difficult to execute simultaneously. The structure helped Hertz avoid funding costs, and equity investors and debt holders have both been paid in full. The company has since relisted on Nasdaq. WINNER: Cravath, Swaine & Moore In 2014, the US Federal Trade Commission brought an antitrust case against technology company Qualcomm for requiring buyers of its chips to pay licensing fees, as well. In August 2020, the law firm secured a final decision by a US appeals court that Qualcomm was not infringing antitrust law — persuading the court that, while customers can license Qualcomm software without buying its chips, it was fair for those that did buy chips to also license the software. This precedent gives clarity on competition law and standard essential patents, showing that cases fall under the jurisdiction of patent or contract law, rather than antitrust regulation. Arnold & Porter Representing medical technology company Hologic in the US Supreme Court in April, the firm established legal confirmation on the assignor estoppel doctrine, which limits the ability of a company that has sold a patent to make changes to what that patent includes. In another case, the firm secured state and federal court victories for biopharmaceutical companies Sanofi and Regeneron against biotech group Amgen, arguing for a narrow definition of what a therapeutic antibody patent covers. Hausfeld The firm represented the plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS), a federation of some 35 health insurance companies in the US. The companies were alleged to have entered into non-compete agreements with one another. The case spanned eight years and required complex economic modelling to show the impact of BCBS’s business practices. Last year, the court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement agreement of $2.67bn. Significantly, the agreement demands changes to BCBS’s business practices, increasing competition in the US health insurance market. Latham & Watkins The firm secured victory for medical practice management software company NextGen Healthcare after an eight-year litigation. A former board member and major shareholder had claimed losses of $400m because alleged misrepresentations from the company — which had made positive statements about its financial prospects — led him to retain his shares rather than selling them at a higher price. This is the first claim of its kind tried before a jury in the US in 86 years, and a first in California, creating an important precedent. White & Case The firm represented health insurance provider Anthem in its litigation with fellow insurer Cigna over an unsuccessful merger. The lawyers filed a temporary restraining order to keep the merger in place within 24 hours of Cigna’s filing for a termination of the deal. This protected Anthem from immediately having to pay a $1.85bn reverse termination fee. It also bought time to find evidence that Cigna had deliberately derailed the deal, meaning Anthem did not have to pay the fee at all.,,Gideon Long,2021-12-10T04:30:36.737Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/fd57521c-a2e9-415b-9c4f-4f74b4587f9e,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Blockchain-powered breakthrough on mutual fund,A new, tech-based breed of fund promises potential big savings for clients,Dechert partner Timothy Spangler well remembers standing next to a whiteboard on Franklin Templeton Investments’ San Mateo campus in California, about three years ago. He was with some of the asset manager’s senior executives. The hype about blockchain technology — which instantly creates secure digital records on a distributed database — was close to fever pitch. Experts across the world were speculating on its potential to disintermediate old financial services systems where simple jobs can take days. Franklin Templeton wanted in, and executives had gathered to brainstorm ways to exploit blockchain. But, unlike many other companies hunting for a blockchain application, Franklin Templeton — which has $1.5tn of assets under management — happened on an idea it would actually execute. It was also one it predicted could generate big savings for clients. “We came up with the idea of a mutual fund whose shares were built on a blockchain,” recalls Spangler. It resulted in Franklin Templeton’s OnChain US Government Money Fund — the first mutual fund to use blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership. We made it very clear that this was not about trying to sneak bitcoin and crypto into a money-market fund Mutual funds, which pool investments across low-risk assets such as government bonds, are owned by almost one in two households in the US. Traditionally, they are administered through brokerages, but redeeming holdings is not instant. Spangler says a mutual fund powered by blockchain can trade 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, so “you don’t have to wait 24 hours to have a human being shuffle the paper around”. It will also result in a more secure system and a “highly significant decrease in fees”, he says, though he admits the level of those savings has “yet to be determined”. The blockchain technology that powers transactions for the OnChain fund is the only feature that makes it different from the many similar funds Franklin Templeton has been creating and selling for decades. Still, securing approval took months of extra negotiating with regulators. “We made it very clear that this was not about trying to sneak [cryptocurrency] bitcoin and crypto into a money-market fund,” explains Spangler. He says the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator that licenses such products, saw “clear blue water between blockchain technology in the abstract and highly volatile cryptocurrency being put into retail [investment]” products. ‘The pay rates for lawyers are unsustainable’ Creative practitioners crack tough legal problems Crypto collaboration brings relief for Venezuelan health workers Smoothing the transition for markets to life after Libor Lawyers focus on ediscovery tech to meet compliance pressures Franklin Templeton stressed that the only thing changing was how records were kept and how transactions were done. The move had already been made from paper ledgers to spreadsheets stored in the cloud. Using blockchain technology was a “minimal change”, it argued. “If you see it as just the next tech upgrade, it’s not nearly as frightening in that sense,” Spangler adds. The SEC was persuaded — after an approvals process that took significantly longer than the four to six months that is typical for new products. The OnChain fund launched in pilot form in April, with $1.4m of seed money and investment from Franklin Templeton’s US employees. Its gross expense ratio is 3.5 per cent, which is far higher than the 0.52 per cent on the manager’s $3.3bn US Government Money Fund, partly reflecting the blockchain fund’s pilot status. The fund is also yet to benefit from the cost savings of blockchain because it is maintaining traditional records in parallel. If you see it as just the next tech upgrade, it’s not nearly as frightening Spangler thinks the market does not realise how disruptive OnChain could be, and sees potential for it to pave the way for other funds, from Franklin Templeton and rival asset managers. “A number of my clients believe that . . . in a small number of years the near entirety of transactions in financial assets will either occur on the blockchain or be blockchain facilitated,” he says. Spangler adds that Franklin Templeton’s work with the SEC means approving new blockchain-based funds will take only about 10 per cent longer than for traditional funds. Recommended Asset managers could also look at putting existing funds — or part of them — on a blockchain infrastructure. In one approach, an asset manager could carve out units of an existing fund, put them in a digital depository and create the digital equivalent of a depository receipt for ownership. Those receipts could then trade on the blockchain. “I don’t think any of this is flying cars,” Spangler says. “Every year from now is going to be marked by a step change in the permeation of blockchain in financial services.” He is not worried that consumers might find the idea of blockchain-based funds too radical. “We buy cars without having any idea how the engine runs,” he says. “No one is being forced to buy blockchain based products. It’s an opt-in process.” Researched, compiled and ranked by RSGI. ‘Winner’ indicates the organisation won an FT Innovative Lawyers 2021 award WINNER: Sullivan & Cromwell Luxury US retailer Tiffany & Co hired the firm to advise on its acquisition by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French luxury group. After the deal was initially agreed in 2019, the lawyers perceived that LVMH might be trying to delay closing, to negotiate a better price. The lawyers spent several months preparing for litigation. When LVMH claimed in September 2020 that the French government had instructed that the deal be put off until the new year, the law firm was able to respond by filing a complaint with the court in Delaware. The lawyers’ preparedness helped Tiffany close the deal for $131.50 per share, which was down from the originally agreed price of $135 but substantially higher than LVMH’s proposed $120. Kirkland & Ellis In June 2020, the firm represented food-delivery service Grubhub in its acquisition by rival Just Eat Takeaway.com. To manage the business uncertainty at the time, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, the deal terms included a tiered approach to risk allocation, in which Grubhub was able to make some business decisions without approval, whereas others required consent from Just Eat. The approach has since been used by the firm as a template for other deals. The $7.3bn transaction closed in June and created one of the largest food-delivery services globally. Morrison & Foerster The firm advises leading tech companies that are entering uncharted territory in legal risk. Bringing together a multidisciplinary team of experts in intellectual property, corporate law, data privacy, regulatory and competition law, the firm has advised clients on several significant transactions. These include cloud software company Salesforce’s $27bn acquisition of workplace communications app Slack, and SoftBank’s sale of chip-design business Arm to US software company Nvidia. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison The firm represented PRA Health Sciences — a US-based organisation to which life sciences companies outsource research — when it was acquired by Irish competitor ICON. The lawyers secured terms that ensured ICON could not claim “material adverse effects” of the Covid-19 pandemic on PRA’s business as a reason to not complete the deal. This type of company is a relatively new phenomenon and the acquisition presented novel antitrust questions on top of the complexities of a cross-border transaction. Ropes & Gray Led by partner Hannah England, the firm advises on collaboration deals between leading pharmaceutical companies and smaller biotechnology businesses. Unlike acquisitions, in which a Big Pharma company might bring a biotech business’s research in-house, these joint ventures are designed to facilitate continuing collaborations that enable more innovation. This way, the lawyers can think less adversarially and adopt a longer-term view. The firm worked on seven of the 15 biggest deals of this kind in 2020, including a $3bn agreement between biotech company Shape Therapeutics and pharmaceutical group Roche on a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases.

Sign up here to get the newsletter sent straight to your inbox every Monday Hey Fintech Fam! The past five years have seen more innovation in the payments industry than during the previous two decades, the chief executive of Visa, Al Kelly, told me when we chatted for the FT’s Global Banking Summit last week. Regulators also know this to be true and are scrambling to keep up with the pace of change which has led to whiplash-inducing guidelines from financial authorities around the world. In this week’s newsletter, we get an update from Chloe Cornish in India, where regulators have floated an all-out crypto ban. Read on for stories that highlight how the world is trying to adjust to a changing payments landscape. Plus, there’s a Q&A with Socure, the largest start-up in the digital identity space helping finance companies combat fraud as payments move online. Write to the FintechFT team at imani.moise@ft.com and sid.v@ft.com. Venture capital investors unnerved by China’s tech crackdown are chasing opportunities in India and showing an acute interest in the cryptocurrency space. More than half a billion dollars have poured into Indian crypto companies so far this year, according to Venture Intelligence, compared to just $25m the year before. But as Siddharth reported from Chennai in last week’s newsletter, jitters are beginning to develop in India’s growing crypto market. A proposal was introduced in parliament to “prohibit all private cryptocurrencies” in the country, sparking a sell-off. Newcomers to the turbulence of crypto-land may have been, understandably, spooked by the threat of a ban. But old crypto hands will have seen regulatory panics hitting the market before. Crypto start-ups have had a rough ride in India, in contrast to the government’s enthusiastic leadership on the country’s impressive digital payments infrastructure. A 2018 central bank order forbade Indian banks from providing services to crypto businesses, making it painfully difficult for trading platforms to operate in India. But the Reserve Bank of India’s interdiction was overturned by a Supreme Court decision in March. The flood gates opened: crypto exchanges’ aggressive marketing, fuelled by huge venture capital injections, introduced millions of Indians to digital currencies. One new trader told me “FOMO” had caused her to start buying into bitcoin last spring — she’d seen friends buying iPhones with their trading profits, and she didn’t want to lose out on the opportunity. She did not want her name published in case bitcoin and other digital tokens became illegal, but doubted a total ban was imminent. Indian officials in favour of a ban fear that inexperienced traders are especially vulnerable to the sharp swings of digital currencies. This newbie trader however is trying her luck with crypto alongside the stock market investments in her “systematic investment plan” or SIP. For her, bitcoin and ether make up “another SIP, a more fun SIP.” For now, she plans to sit on her modest crypto gains. Considering there are nearly 1.4bn people in India, crypto makes up a small percentage of overall trading. While platforms like CoinSwitch Kuber boast more than 10m registered users, they admit the number of people who have actually bought coins is much lower. Ashish Singhal, CoinSwitch Kuber’s chief executive, told me that only 6m of the platform’s 13m registered users had transacted at least once. That’s coming from India’s most highly valued crypto start-up, at a cool $1.9bn, which snared Andreessen Horowitz’s first-ever Indian investment. Of course, starting small means there is massive space to grow. And in a sign that India’s government is interested in pursuing the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies’ underlying blockchain technology, India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology published a national strategy paper on Friday. A ban on cryptocurrencies would be the worst-case scenario for the burgeoning sector, but lawyers and crypto business leaders said regulation was more likely than prohibition. So far there are few details about what India’s crypto bill will ultimately say, so traders there will have to wait and see how safe it is to HODL. (Chloe Cornish) Every week we ask the founders of fast-growing fintechs to introduce themselves and explain what makes them stand out in a crowded industry. Our conversation, lightly edited, appears below. I caught up with Socure CEO Johnny Ayers shortly after a $450m Series E funding round brought his company’s valuation to $4.5bn. This makes Socure the most highly valued private company in the digital identity verification space. Banks and fintechs alike reported a surge in fraud activity as the pandemic forced more transactions online, and finance firms have flocked to technology providers like Socure to help them verify that customers are who they claim to be. How did you get started? The idea was that the way that identities were verified historically just didn’t work. You had credit data being the foundation of where a lot of identity information was being used, and then you had the kind of rules-based systems not using any graph databases, or machine learning to actually verify [a specific customer]. So we’ve spent the past nine years building out [a database of] every element of identity — email, phone, address, date of birth, social device, IP, and physical documents — to be able to deliver the most accurate comprehensive identity verification service in the US. Who are your investors? Capital One, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Synchrony Financial and Santander You’ve built out a system to manage fraud risk, do you want to do credit risk as well? I am now at this nucleus, where I’m seeing all these identities at scale. Why can’t I then start to go into ‘This is the real consumer, but do I want to do business with this consumer?’ And so if I have all these customers and this huge network reporting back into me I know if this person has bounced checks, does she dispute [charges], or does she have three to five accounts that are all in good standing and have been in good standing for 15 years? That becomes really valuable to the network. We’re developing right now and we’ll move into that type of risk grading. Does your US focus make it hard to win business from international companies? We’re primarily focused on the US today, because we generally find it’s 40 per cent of the global total addressable market in our world. A global issuer generally has country-specific strategies that they’re developing. We generally find those types of global issuers are not building global strategies that flow everywhere. They have regional data sources. That doesn’t scale internationally. There’s also data storage requirements where data can’t move across countries. There’s privacy requirements. So generally, we find folks building strategies with best-in-class providers in that country. ‘Cash is King’ but monarchies fall Global cash payments fell 16 per cent in 2020 and are unlikely to rebound as fintech companies in emerging markets accelerated a shift toward digital payments, according to a new McKinsey study. As cash becomes less relevant around the world, we need to rethink the way we approach financial literacy, the FT argues as part of its Financial Literacy and Inclusion Campaign. Singapore blocks crypto exchange Singapore’s financial regulator suspended prominent digital currency exchange Bitget after a digital token on the platform falsely claimed ties to K-pop sensation BTS. The south-east Asian regulator is only the latest to scrutinise influencers’ role in advertising financial products. But as online shopping shifts from retail sites to social media platforms, influencers continue to have a growing impact on how people use their money.

https://www.ft.com/content/6cea9227-aaa2-4850-ac7a-b2ca18cccbe3,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,How secure are digital assets?,Exploring possible security risks and the options for safekeeping,Any holder of digital assets must take steps to safeguard them, and there are a range of options with varying levels of security. Owners of crypto assets must also be as vigilant about scams and hacks that target them personally as they would be with traditional money. Best protection methods depend on how a user stores assets, and with which institutions, as both security and reliability differ widely in this burgeoning field. Over the past 10 years, there have been 126 big breaches, totalling $3.1bn, of crypto “wallets” (see below) and exchanges, according to data compiled by Crypto Head, an industry intelligence site. The average breach has cost about $25m. Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, remains the most targeted digital asset. Digital asset holders need their unique “private key”, a long password that serves a similar purpose to a bank-card PIN to unlock access to their crypto. It is vital not to lose or forget this private key. Decentralised digital assets are not guaranteed by banks and will not have a password reset hotline, meaning it is almost impossible to recover digital keys once lost. According to Chainalysis, a blockchain data provider, more than $100bn in bitcoin may have been lost in this way. Recommended The keys — and therefore crypto — can be kept in online or mobile wallets, known as hot wallets. This makes it easier to access funds swiftly — say, for traders who want to connect quickly to exchanges, brokers or other services. Indeed, many cryptocurrency exchanges offer online digital wallet services that link seamlessly to their trading systems. This is, however, the least secure method of holding crypto, leaving digital assets more vulnerable to hackers. In 2014, Mt.Gox, then the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, filed for bankruptcy after losing more than $450m, largely in bitcoin, when hackers allegedly stole its hot wallet private keys. Today, some large exchanges, such as Coinbase, have added protection for investors in the form of crypto insurance. If an individual’s password is compromised, they will lose their funds forever. But if, for example, the company itself is hacked or breached, the insurance will cover the losses for the user. Yes. The most popular alternative is what is known as cold storage — a device that is not connected to the internet. Hackers would typically need access to that device, as well as any associated passwords or codes, to steal crypto assets. More than $100bn in bitcoin may be lost because of users losing or forgetting private keys Cold storage options to control digital assets that do not involve intermediaries include physical USB keys, specific offline computers or sophisticated hardware wallets — small USB-like devices that are designed to be impenetrable by hackers and can cost several hundred dollars. Cryptocurrency exchanges, particularly the largest ones, increasingly offer cold storage custody options. Other specialist third-party services go to even greater lengths to protect customers’ crypto assets by, for example, holding private keys in vaults with human guards. In southern England, Vo1t, which was bought last year by crypto trading company Genesis, has an underground bunker patrolled by ex-military personnel, according to Forbes. The servers are rigged to delete digital assets stored on them if intruders trigger any hidden trip switches (Vo1t has back-up servers in other countries). Other services offering military-grade protection, such as Prosegur Crypto, use biometrics, including facial recognition and thumb prints, for clients to access their digital assets. On top of attacks on digital asset exchanges and custodians, hackers have been able to exploit the nascent code of new crypto initiatives in the growing field of decentralised finance (DeFi). About $1.1bn in attacks have occurred in this area in the past 10 years, according to Crypto Head. Recommended One such digital heist this year targeted Poly Network, a decentralised trading network that developed a computer protocol allowing users to transfer tokens tied to one blockchain to a different network. Hackers stole about $600m worth of cryptocurrencies, one of the largest ever such thefts, through a flaw in the protocol itself. Finally, crypto frauds remain the biggest form of crime by which digital asset holders lose funds. Losses stand at nearly $15bn over the past decade, according to Crypto Head, or $364m on average per fraud. The largest crypto fraud to date was the $4bn OneCoin Ponzi scheme, which had billed itself as a new cryptocurrency. Ruja Ignatova, its Bulgarian founder, has been on the run from law enforcement agencies since 2017, though she was charged in absentia in 2019 for securities fraud. Last year, the PlusToken Ponzi scheme defrauded millions of investors of some $2bn in total, according to Chainalysis. Becoming a victim of a fraudulent project is always possible where scammers are highly convincing and sophisticated. But investors are advised always to carry out due diligence and explore the “white paper” and other documentation about any digital asset initiative.

https://www.ft.com/content/78431430-1afb-4712-bb75-424788c60583,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,A history of cryptocurrency, from gaming tokens to a $2tn market,The crypto timeline has taken surprising twists and turns over nearly two decades,Facebook’s decision, last month, to rebrand itself as Meta is actually quite retro. The metaverse might look like a cutting-edge concept, with people creating digital versions of themselves to interact with other avatars in a virtual world, but this is a nearly 20-year-old idea, only slightly updated. The origins of digital assets — such as bitcoin and ether, non-fungible tokens, smart contracts and the thousands of “shitcoins” out there — can be traced back to video games where avatars played and sometimes worked, acting out fantasy lives imagined by their human creators. It may seem unlikely today, when cryptocurrency markets are worth more than $2tn, that their ancestry lies in World of Warcraft and Second Life, the once-popular virtual-reality games. In the early 2000s, former child actor Brock Pierce, a US presidential candidate in 2020, realised that gamers were happy to buy tokens to reach the next level instead of completing tasks to earn them. “Just because something is not tangible, it doesn’t mean it’s worthless,” Pierce says, recounting how he employed hundreds of people in China and South Korea to play video games and earn the in-game tokens, which he then sold to lazier customers in the west. Together with William Quigley, now chief executive of the Worldwide Asset eXchange, the largest non-fungible token (NFT) platform, they created a market place for in-game tokens that is now worth $200bn. In the process, they laid the foundations for the cryptocurrency industry. Recommended “After World of Warcraft gold, the intellectual leap required to recognise the value of bitcoin was very small,” Pierce adds. Pierce was an early adopter of bitcoin, after an unknown author using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper in October 2008 outlining proposals for a new technology called blockchain, which would rely on the agreement of users to operate, rather than work as a centralised entity. It would be the basis for a digital currency called bitcoin, which can be “mined” by deploying computers to solve puzzles. Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21m units. Nakamoto then mined the first bitcoin in January 2009, marking the date the blockchain network and digital coin went live. In May 2010, a man in Florida paid 10,000 bitcoin (the equivalent of more than $600m at today’s prices) for two pizzas, the first purchase with the digital coins. To say this made a splash would be an exaggeration. Interest rates had plummeted in the wake of the global financial crisis and central banks had launched massive bond-buying programmes to shore up their economies. But, against this shaky macroeconomic backdrop, interest in bitcoin was starting to pick up. First came libertarians and computer geeks, followed by currency traders and the wider financial trading community, some of whom were intrigued by the fact that the technology made it impossible to change or erase past transactions. Others, such as billionaire investor Michael Novogratz, were attracted to bitcoin because of its scarcity, with the 21m unit cap. By 2011, bitcoin had become sufficiently popular for trading platforms to gain traction. These early exchanges — for example, Mt.Gox — were based in Asia, catering to retail investors in the region who had developed an appetite for the asset from their gaming background. They allowed early adopters to mine their own coins as well as trade them. The launch of trading platforms triggered the first bubble in bitcoin’s price, when the exchange rate ballooned to $32 before collapsing to around $2 in 2011. The shortlived run in the price put bitcoin on the map, according to Max Boonen, the founder of B2C2, one of the largest trading companies in crypto today. He notes that the coin has been through a series of bubbles, with each top higher than the previous one. Recommended “The big names we know as ‘whales’ [owners of large holdings] today got into bitcoin just before the 2013 bubble,” Boonen says. He notes that, at the time, Greece’s debt crisis and subsequent bailout spurred many wealthy investors to buy digital coins as a hedge of last resort. “It was the first time that bitcoin was influenced by macroeconomic events, so it was quite significant.” But the wider world was still showing little interest, largely ignoring the launch of tether, the first stablecoin, which was created to link together the world of digital currencies and fiat money. It was also the time of the first ever initial coin offering, from Mastercoin. The first filing to launch a bitcoin exchange traded fund — from the Winklevoss brothers — went almost unnoticed in 2013. And the arrival in 2015 of the Ethereum blockchain and ether, its native currency, the second cryptocurrency to be created, also failed to make waves in mainstream finance, despite its key role in crypto markets today. Ethereum’s ability to carry data in its code was an important innovation and forms the basis for decentralised finance markets, where algorithms carry out transactions as well as settlement and other functions. This market is worth $236bn and, to many, it represents the cutting edge of finance. Bitcoin’s profile then soared in 2017, when small-time investors around the world suddenly took an interest as the price moved above $20,000. Initial coin offerings also became popular. The following year marked the biggest crash so far, heralding the so-called crypto winter, in which bitcoin was written off by many as a gimmick with no future. An influx of hedge funds and family offices into bitcoin made it the digital equivalent of gold for some The crypto mood turned more positive in March last year, when the pandemic hit and triggered an influx of hedge funds and family offices into bitcoin, drawn by its limited supply. This shifted the narrative from bitcoin being an unsuccessful currency to it becoming the digital equivalent of gold for some. Billionaire hedge fund managers then added weight to the rally in the bitcoin price, drawing in other institutional investors, as well as banks and Tesla electric-car tycoon Elon Musk. In the past 18 months, cryptocurrency markets have exploded in popularity and new assets such as NFTs are thriving. The hype has given rise to thousands of alternative coins, such as dogecoin, some of which have questionable value propositions. On the other hand, blockchains such as Cardano, Solana and Polkadot have also emerged, with the aim of making the technology more efficient. Bitcoin has had a bumpy ride and remains exceptionally volatile. But the overall direction has been up: from around $0.08 in 2010, bitcoin hit a high of just below $67,000 in October this year. Not bad for a 13-year-old.

https://www.ft.com/content/a5a67709-44b5-4ab0-815c-2e0fdeb62d08,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Who owns the most cryptocurrency?,Some early entrants have accumulated large fortunes, often benefiting from initial distributions,Several early buyers of bitcoin are likely to have ended up as the wealthiest people in the cryptocurrency markets. Many have promoted a strategy of holding on for future profits — “hodling”, in the vocabulary of cryptocurrency advocates. One anonymous bitcoin account that began purchasing the tokens in March 2011 — and has never sold any — sits on a fortune of $4.8bn, according to the cryptocurrency analytics website BitInfoCharts. A recent paper from the US National Bureau of Economic Research estimated that the top 1,000 Bitcoin investors control about 3m bitcoin, or roughly one-seventh of the cryptocurrency’s total potential supply. Only a small handful of those holders have revealed their identities. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twin brothers best known for losing a legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg over the social network idea behind Facebook, purchased a reported 120,000 bitcoin in 2012, a haul that would be worth $7.2bn as of mid-November. Recommended In a 2014 auction, venture capitalist Tim Draper (pictured above, left) beat other bidders to buy 29,655 bitcoin that US Marshals had seized from the dark web emporium Silk Road. Those tokens would be worth $1.8bn at today’s prices. Draper declined to say at the time how much he had paid in the auction, but the Marshals put the lot’s value at about $18m. Michael Saylor, chief executive of MicroStrategy, a software company, said last year he had over time bought 17,732 bitcoin at an average price of less than $10,000; that holding would be worth $1.1bn at current prices. Founders of newer blockchains such as Ethereum have also reaped large fortunes. Vitalik Buterin (pictured above, bottom right), its creator, received a reported 553,000 ether from an initial endowment set up by the co-founders, a holding that would be worth $2.3bn at today’s prices. The teams behind several cryptocurrency projects that aim to rival Ethereum adopted a similar approach, rewarding themselves with substantial chunks of their own token supplies. Binance coin, the token associated with the Binance Smart Chain, has soared to a market capitalisation of nearly $100bn in four years. The founding team, which includes the Binance exchange’s outspoken founder Changpeng Zhao (pictured above, top right), awarded itself 40 per cent of the token’s total supply. Solana, a blockchain that has gained popularity as an alternative to Ethereum for decentralised finance apps, sold just under 13 per cent of the token’s total supply to the founding team for 20 cents per token. At current prices those tokens would be worth $13.5bn. Some analysts have questioned the fairness of these initial token distributions, arguing that they contradict the supposedly decentralised nature of cryptocurrency networks. “Those allocations would be fine if these were companies — it’s not crazy to see that much ownership,” says Ryan Watkins, a senior research analyst at Messari, a cryptocurrency analytics service. “But, when you’re building systems that are supposed to be more democratic, it just isn’t democratic.” Brian Armstrong, co-founder of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, ranks as the wealthiest founder of a public crypto services company. Recommended Armstrong owns more than 36m shares in the company, worth more than $12bn. He also sold shares worth more than $290m on the day of Coinbase’s direct listing, an alternative to the traditional initial public offering that has no restrictions on stock sales. Armstrong’s co-founder, Fred Ehrsam, owns shares worth $3.8bn. Other cryptocurrency start-up founders hold large stakes in their companies that could be worth billions of dollars on paper. Forbes estimated that Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was worth $22.5bn this year, much of it from his roughly half stake in the $25bn start-up. Barry Silbert, founder and chief executive of Digital Currency Group, a digital assets company, told the Financial Times that he owns just under 40 per cent of the company, which investors recently valued at $10bn during a private secondary share sale. Silbert says he has not sold any shares in the business. Big cryptocurrency holders typically are reluctant to discuss their buying and selling decisions because of fears about hacking, tax authorities and other risks. “I think anybody involved with cryptocurrency is certainly reluctant and, in my case, unwilling to share anything,” Silbert says. “I joke that I lost all my bitcoin in a boating accident,” he adds, referencing a meme among bitcoin investors about a putative excuse given to tax authorities about losing a crypto wallet. While blockchains can make it easier to publicly track the flow of cryptocurrencies, they also mask the identities of their owners. Some applications, such as Nansen, attempt to match blockchain addresses to investment funds and other big holders, but they can be unreliable. The volatile and concentrated nature of cryptocurrencies means large purchases and sales can have a big effect on the market. Some start-ups have attempted to solve the problem by acting as intermediaries that route orders to multiple venues providing the best prices. Large crypto transactions can also draw a backlash from other traders. Earlier this year, cryptocurrency watchers began buzzing about an anonymous investor who had turned early purchases of shiba inu tokens in August last year into a $5.7bn stockpile little more than a year later, following a big rise in the token’s value. However, the trader soon attracted attention after moving $2.3bn of the stake to four different cryptocurrency wallets, sending the price of the token plummeting without even apparently making any sales.

In March 2019, Berlin-based company Brickblock tokenised a real estate vehicle containing a €2m property in Wiesbaden, western Germany. This was believed to be the first such transaction in Europe in which property shares were registered as digital tokens on the blockchain. A joint study by Hamburg Commercial Bank and the Frankfurt School Blockchain Center think-tank, published in September, suggested an estimated 41 companies in 17 countries, including the US, Germany and Switzerland, had been trialling tokenisation of property. The report said that the market was “still in its infancy”. However, the study emphasised this was a rough estimate due to a lack of transparency in the market and suggested that tokenising and fractionalising large buildings into small tradable units can make it more accessible to investors. It has been argued that tokenisation can allow retail investors with as little as €1 or $1 to participate in a rise in house prices without ever being a property owner themselves. Recommended In the US, a company called RealT offers investors the chance to buy into the country’s property market through fractional tokenised ownership using blockchain. Ownership of properties in cities such as Detroit is recorded by digital tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Tokens have also been issued against other real assets, such as high-end whisky collections and limited-edition gins. Gold is another asset that has been tokenised. Paxos, a US-regulated blockchain infrastructure company for digital assets, has issued PAX Gold, a digital asset where one token represents one fine troy ounce of a London Good Delivery gold bar, stored by Paxos in secure vaults in London. Investors in PAX Gold, built as a token on the Ethereum blockchain, own the underlying gold without having to worry about storing the precious metal themselves. Paxos says on its website that holders of PAX Gold can see on its website the serial number and purity of each gold bar to which their tokens are allocated.,,Jane Croft,2021-11-30T04:00:40.793Z,

Web3 is a tech utopia. It envisages a world of decentralised collaboration that would end the supremacy of major companies by wiping out lucrative markets for data collection and digital advertising. Yet building that world would require exactly the sort of investment that only Big Tech can provide. Hitting the refresh button on the internet looks tempting after years of disinformation and data hacks. First came the web — a scattered collection of open-source information. Then came Web 2.0, in which companies such as Google organised information and helped users to interact online while building walls around data. Tech giants amassed trillions of dollars of market value and now dominate the US stock market. Just five companies account for over a fifth of the S&P 500 index by market capitalisation. Web3 provides the backlash to this concentration of power. It is imagined as a decentralised system built on the blockchain in which companies no longer act as gatekeepers. User information will freely move across the internet. Instead of platforms making decisions about content, users will self-moderate. Tokens will be generated as rewards and everything will be on public blockchains, making the web transparent and safe. That is the theory anyway. Most of this does not yet exist. But the idea has gained momentum with the boom in newly fashionable non-fungible tokens (NFTs), digital ownership of online ephemera and decentralised finance projects running on public blockchains. Venture capitalists already use Web3 as a point of focus for investment in cryptocurrency projects. New VC fund Paradigm One raised $2.5bn in November to focus on applications that operate on ethereum. Its token ether now has a market capitalisation of more than $500bn, up from $68bn a year ago. A planned upgrade from energy-intensive proof-of-work — solving a math problem — verification to proof-of-stake will raise ethereum’s profile further. Yet the end of Big Tech’s hegemony seems unlikely. The ethereum blockchain has limits on transactions and much of the public remains wary of digital tokens. Plus, these wealthy companies have no plans to hand over control either. Social media platform Twitter has announced a dedicated crypto team. Facebook’s name change to Meta and plans to become a “metaverse company” are linked to the idea of a future in which digital assets can be moved safely around the internet. These early investments hint that new walls are being built before Web3 becomes a reality.

https://www.ft.com/content/b07d9777-8ac7-47ac-a358-12924711f2c8,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Coinbase co-founder launches biggest VC fund in crypto,Fred Ehrsam is behind $2.5bn fund Paradigm One, to which investors jockeyed to commit money,Cryptocurrencies are booming, and a three-year-old investment firm has raised the largest new venture capital fund in history to keep the party going. Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia Capital partner Matt Huang have finished raising $2.5bn this month for Paradigm One, their first venture capital fund. Investors jockeyed to commit money to the fund, allowing them to raise twice the amount they initially targeted. “It is probably small relative to where we’re going in 10 years,” Ehrsam told the Financial Times at Paradigm’s sparse headquarters in downtown San Francisco, where plastic wrap covered new office equipment. Paradigm’s eye-popping fundraise could stoke fears about a bubble in cryptocurrencies, especially in the niche corners of decentralised finance where the firm has made its name. Earlier this year, VC firm Andreessen Horowitz also raised twice as much as it had hoped for a new cryptocurrency fund, bringing in $2.2bn, which at the time it said was the “largest crypto fund ever raised”. More than any other investors, both firms have staked their fortunes on an expanding ecosystem of applications based on ethereum, a digital ledger that allows programmers to write contracts automatically executing functions such as money transfers. The programs run on what are known as tokens, digital assets that are granted to users over time, often giving them a say in governance. Paradigm has accumulated some of the largest token holdings in the sector by placing early bets on development teams, giving it rights to future distributions. Paradigm’s first fund, which raised an initial $400m in 2018, made an annual internal rate of return of more than 200 per cent through the first half of this year, according to figures viewed by the Financial Times. The fund’s assets have reached as high as $10bn, though they can fluctuate sharply with the price of cryptocurrencies, said people familiar with its holdings. Paradigm structured it like a hedge fund, meaning it does not need to return capital to investors by a certain date, a requirement of VC funds. Paradigm declined to comment on performance. Paradigm’s founders said the world of token-based apps, sometimes referred to as web3, still had more room to grow. Several so-called decentralised finance protocols backed by Paradigm, such as the token exchange Uniswap, have soared in value in the past year as more people move money away from the legacy financial system. In areas such as gaming and music, developers are also experimenting with new ways to distribute value to consumers using tokens. “The biggest companies in the world are large internet tech companies powered by network effects,” Ehrsam said. “We think decades into the future it’s very clear the largest entities in the world will be powered by tokens.” Ethereum still faces doubters. The network has struggled with high transaction costs during busy periods, and some cryptocurrency entrepreneurs have challenged its dominant status as the infrastructure for decentralised apps. “History has yet to be decided on it,” Ehrsam said. Paradigm isn’t solely betting on ethereum either, investing in a lending app called Jet Protocol that runs on rival network Solana, which claims faster transaction speeds. Paradigm’s founders said they viewed their token investments as long-term holdings that could take at least 10 years to pay off. Like bitcoin, the assets can be highly volatile depending on the whims of cryptocurrency speculators. “If liquidity were to dry up in the space, they’re going to be left holding a lot of assets,” said Graham Duncan, an early investor in Paradigm. But he’s still confident on their odds. “I think their time horizon will take them through it,” he said. Start-up founders said Paradigm had rapidly grown into a desirable investor, partly by recruiting a five-person research team to work with portfolio companies. Financial services groups and the firm’s investors, which include the Harvard and Yale university endowments, have also turned to Paradigm for advice on the workings of digital assets. At times, Paradigm has negotiated sweetheart deals with cryptocurrency groups seeking its endorsement. During a recent $73m token sale for Lido, an app for earning yield on ethereum and other blockchains, Paradigm led a group of investors that received a discount of about two-thirds compared with the token’s open-market price at the time of the initial proposal. Optimism, a public benefit corporation developing a programme to make ethereum transactions more efficient, contacted Paradigm for investment after the firm brought on programmers it had previously hoped to hire. “If we wanted to access their time, it made sense to go and try to get a check from Paradigm,” said Jinglang Wang, co-founder of Optimism. Opyn, a cryptocurrency options program, chose an investment offer from Paradigm this year that valued the company lower than what Andreessen was willing to pay, said one person briefed on the deal who asked to remain anonymous. Andreessen declined to comment. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click Paradigm purchased approximately 20 per cent of the company at a valuation of $28m, along with the rights to a proportional share of any tokens Opyn eventually creates. After investing, Paradigm worked with Opyn chief executive Zubin Koticha and other employees to design a new kind of cryptocurrency derivative during a week-long retreat in rural North Carolina. Dave White and Dan Robinson, two Paradigm researchers, emerged as the lead authors of a paper introducing the concept. Investors tend to be sceptical of large VC funds, which can be difficult to invest profitably. Huang said he had few doubts about Paradigm’s strategy. “If Fred and I ever found ourselves working in some kind of low growth, low return situation, I think we would prefer death,” Huang said. ,,Miles Kruppa,2021-11-15T14:09:49.077Z,

Pricing in options, tools that let investors bet on future movements in financial assets, suggest market participants are wagering that ethereum will more than treble to $15,000 by March next year. The move comes a week after the Securities and Exchange Commission cleared the way for the launch of the first bitcoin-linked ETF. Investors poured more than $1bn in to the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy fund, prompting it to buy up futures contracts that track the price of bitcoin. This, in turn, propelled the price of bitcoin to an all-time high. Traders are now betting on a repeat scenario for ethereum ETFs: “Simply put, the market seems bullish with regards to ethereum’s potential by year-end or the first quarter,” Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer at Deribit, one of the biggest crypto options trading venues, said. Buying interest has “exploded” in derivatives contracts traded that give investors the right but not the obligation to buy ethereum at $15,000 in March next year, according to Adam Farthing, chief risk officer for Japan at crypto specialist trading firm B2C2. Farthing said the timing of these bets suggested that investors were optimistic about a similar decision for the second most-traded digital coin. Ethereum was trading in striking range of record highs at $4,000 on Wednesday. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click “This flow began around the time the bitcoin ETF was confirmed, and is thought to be whales positioning for an ethereum futures ETF announcement,” Farthing said, referring to large holders of the digital tokens. The launch of the ProShares fund, which was followed by a similar futures backed product by Valkyrie Funds, has fuelled expectations that the SEC will make a positive decision on the more than 20 applications under review. “The SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have shown they are going to be deliberate but open-minded about the crypto-related funds they are willing to allow, and the past week has shown there is demand for these kinds of products,” Steven McClurg, chief investment officer at Valkyrie Funds. Still, ETF sponsors remain sceptical that the SEC is poised to act in the near futures. ProShares and digital asset manager VanEck had filed applications with the SEC to launch ETFs on ethereum earlier this year, but they subsequently pulled their plans. Both ProShares and VanEck declined to comment on their reasoning. Valkyrie’s McClurg said that due to thin trading activity in ethereum futures markets, expecting regulatory approval before the end of next year was a “long shot”. Joshua Lim, head of derivatives at Genesis Trading, said that traders abandoned positive bets on bitcoin and placed them on ethereum instead in the run-up to the approval of the ProShares ETF in a bid to benefit from a positive reaction in ethereum’s price if the SEC gives the nod.,,Eva Szalay,2021-10-28T04:00:40.266Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/c28799d4-88bf-42b9-8ad5-53ab5647ba60,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Cryptocurrencies will be as useless in the metaverse as they are now,Both ideas are about making a few people rich, not about building a decentralised paradise where everyone prospers,In case you hadn’t heard, the metaverse is coming. Maybe Facebook will build part of it. Maybe it’s already here, in the form of video games such as Fortnite, digital collectibles known as non-fungible tokens and even cryptocurrencies. Maybe there will be more than one metaverse; maybe there won’t ever really be any. It’s all a bit unclear. What is clear, however, is that we are meant to think of this amorphous metaverse as a place of infinite wonder and possibility. It is envisaged by techno-utopians as an interconnected web of virtual worlds in which our “digital twins” can wander about buying virtual art, attending virtual gigs and having virtual relationships. “The metaverse is the new land of opportunities,” crypto investor Vignesh Sundaresan (known by his crypto name MetaKovan and for spending $69m on an NFT by the artist Beeple earlier this year) told a panel last week. “It’s not about the commerce behind it, but having a place where people from different parts of the world can . . . have an opportunity for prosperity.” Apparently MetaKovan has no interest in making a land-grab for this new sphere, never mind that his pseudonym might come from a partial translation from Tamil to mean “king of the metaverse” or that he might run one of the world’s biggest NFT funds. But there is, of course, a financial incentive here: crypto enthusiasts are hoping that NFTs, which are meant to represent the ownership of digital or physical assets stored on a blockchain, will become a key component of this future world, along with the cryptocurrency used to pay for them. NFTs representing plots of virtual “land” in the metaverse have already been sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of cryptocurrency. One company selling such virtual goodies is Somnium Space, invested in by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s old rivals, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss — these days better known for being bitcoin billionaires. After the twins tweeted about it on Tuesday, Somnium Space’s native token, “Cube”, soared in value by 260 per cent. “The race for the metaverse is on!” one brother tweeted. He gave the game away. As far as I’m concerned, the hypocritical fantasy that underpins crypto also lies at the heart of the metaverse. This isn’t about building a decentralised paradise where everyone can prosper and live in harmony; this is about making a small group of people rich. “The metaverse is a marketing offensive,” says Janet Murray, a professor of digital media at the Georgia Institute of Technology and author of Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace. “There’s a very vague fantasy at the base of this . . . This sense that technology will magically provide this alternate thing, and there will be some way to make a lot of money out of it, because technology has provided things that we didn’t think were possible before, and people made a lot of money out of those.” Even if the metaverse does end up becoming the future of the internet, why would we want to use crypto tokens to pay for stuff there? Surely we would prefer to use money that we can also use in the real world. After all, we might be able to buy virtual clothes in the metaverse, but we still need real ones — and to eat real food and sleep in real beds. We need real money to pay for all that. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click Using cryptocurrency means being exposed to the volatility inherent in these speculative tokens. It also means having to pay an exchange fee — the standard rate charged for exchanging fiat currency to crypto, or vice versa, is around 2.5 per cent. There is no reason to use crypto in the metaverse — the vast majority of money nowadays only exists digitally anyway. Cryptocurrencies, in other words, will have as much use as money in the metaverse as they do in the real world. I have always suspected that one of the reasons people keep buying into crypto — which I consider akin to a Ponzi scheme — is that they don’t really understand it. In some ways, therefore, the elusive metaverse is a perfect partner. Talking up ideas that people find confusing is a great way of obfuscating things that people find objectionable, as Zuckerberg seems to have discovered. It’s also apparently a great way of making a quick buck — or much more for a privileged few. jemima.kelly@ft.com,,Jemima Kelly,2021-10-27T16:10:34.812Z,

Is this a moment of vindication for the pioneers who promoted digital currencies as an asset class and heralded a technological and financial revolution? Or is it a sign that the hype cycle is reaching its final, frenzied moments before the fever breaks? I wish I knew — because I am one of those sceptics. And now I own a non-fungible token, or NFT. The annual survey of family offices by Citi Private Bank, which landed in September, found 23 per cent now have crypto assets in their portfolio, and another 25 per cent are considering them. Of family office executives who attended a Citi forum connected to the report, half said they expected to increase allocations to crypto in the next year. These are big numbers from often conservative managers of other people’s money. Interest in digital assets, which spread first from the over-thinkers (crypto-utopians thrilled by a complex solution to an unasked question) to the under-thinkers (herd-followers seeing a quick buck in a barely comprehended trade), appears to have finally reached the consensus-thinkers. I have a theory as to why. If there is one thing wealthy individuals and their advisers know about, it is art — and, this year, the worlds of cryptocurrency and art have collided, in the form of NFTs. Recommended These NFTs are pieces of code that represent an artwork — or a clip from a basketball game, or a tweet, or a photo of William Shatner. They can be bought with cryptocurrency or conventional funds converted into crypto. Ownership is recorded on a digital ledger called a blockchain and transferred using that blockchain’s cryptocurrency. It has been easy to dismiss the utility of blockchain technology. We already have ways to record and transfer ownership of digital assets (like money in a bank account) and an established legal infrastructure to ensure trust in that system, which blockchain does not have. I still don’t know that we need a different way. But it is no longer defensible to say that the use cases for blockchain are entirely theoretical. The reason I own an NFT is that an artist/developer friend of mine has been minting them. Not only are they a way for him to make money from his work, they are a unique way. Code embedded in the token guarantees him a royalty when a piece is sold on, something no artist is able to insist upon in the physical world. That is a use case. So now I am the proud owner of a token on the Tezos blockchain that represents a piece of generative art, a gif of a hexagon that dissolves and spins and reforms on an endless loop. You can download the gif if you want. But I am the only one with the token. Recommended I am under no illusions as to what I have here. I want to see what happens. Quite apart from whether an artist’s work is deemed to have merit in the future, what happens to an NFT will depend on whether we agree that owning a unique token is different and superior to copying the gif or watching it on a webpage. The blockchain where the token exists, and the cryptocurrency in which it is valued, are other variables. Blockchains can and do fall into disrepair. Tezos has powerful backers but it ranks in popularity well below ethereum, which is staking a claim to be the blockchain of choice for higher-value NFTs, new financial services, games and many other developer experiments. There may be more value in whatever is created and traded next using blockchain technology. I also have no idea how to value the currencies that allow each blockchain to function. The biggest investment opportunities may not be in crypto assets at all but in the companies operating and exploiting the technology. But I understand more about the possibilities now than I did before I plunged in. The point is, we are in the midst of a great experiment and investors that may have once dismissed it, ought now to consider taking part in it. I’m with the 25 per cent in that Citi family office survey that said they are “still in research mode seeking advice”. Whatever a family office is spending on research and advice, they may glean equally valuable insight by diverting a little into crypto, to see what happens.

Prices set records this year as bitcoin reached an all-time high. Yet future growth in the NFT market is likely to come from gamers, not aesthetes. NFTs can range from images to videos to animations to tweets. What is for sale is claim of ownership. A digital identifier is recorded on the blockchain. Physical objects backing the digital counterpart can exist, but they do not have to. What matters is authenticity. Anyone can replicate or view a digital image, but there is only one true owner. The NFT market is already worth about $15bn, according to analytics platform DappRadar, up from a few hundred million dollars last year. Analysts at Jefferies believe it could be worth almost $80bn by 2025. Gaming NFTs are likely to drive this growth. Axie Infinity, an NFT-enabled online video game created in 2018 by Vietnamese studio Sky Mavis, involves players acquiring and doing battle with cute pet characters. It has generated almost $3bn of transactions and now has nearly 1m players. In the art world, NFTs trade on exclusivity. Digital art collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape have just a few thousand owners. Gaming NFT transaction volumes are far higher. The biggest sales may be artworks, but the highest volumes are in gaming. Gamers have been spending large sums on in-game purchases for years. NFT purchases stand out because they require cryptocurrency. Transactions are often made using a game’s own tokens, which can be converted to ethereum and then to the player’s home currency. Axie’s token is called AXS. As NFTs grow more popular, the potential for abuse rises. There are concerns that they might be used for money laundering. Plus, even with blockchain technology, fraud is still possible at the tokenisation stage. NFT investor Pranksy found this out when buying what was thought to be a Banksy NFT for $341,000 that he says turned out to be a scam.

One of the latest comes from Switzerland. It is underpinned by unquoted shares in a sports resort business and backed by Credit Suisse, a traditional institution with a taste for bracing new financing techniques. The bank is placing equity security tokens, as they are called, in Alaïa, whose businesses include an Alpine sports centre. Investors will be able to trade these on the Taurus Digital Exchange, a platform operated by a cryptocurrency services company. Promoters of security tokens like to distinguish their issues from the initial coin offerings (ICOs) that flourished a few years ago. These were frequently fraudulent and imploded in 2017. Tokenised securities can represent shares, bonds, real estate and intellectual property rights. Security token offerings (STOs) may have the blessing of local regulators, giving investors a legal claim over the underlying asset. In the case of putative investors in Alaïa that means the group’s ethereum-based shares have a claim on earnings and a traditional — though low — ranking for recompense in the event of a liquidation. The tokens have obvious appeal to start-ups and other small businesses. Issuance costs may be as little as a fifth of those for a traditional public equity offering, says Ulrik K Lykke co-founder of crypto hedge fund ARK36. Issuers have raised some $500m from 55 deals globally in 2019, according to Blockstate, a token specialist. Three-quarters of transactions so far are for equity and almost all are based on the ethereum cryptocurrency. Traded STO market capitalisation almost doubled to $1.1bn in August compared with March this year. Tokenised securities create intriguing jeopardy for banks such as Credit Suisse. Placing big issues of stocks and bonds is an important business for them. So far, technology has assisted traditional bookbuilding rather than replacing it. That may be about to change, pushing down fees and upending old hierarchies. The only thing more dangerous to incumbents than disruption itself may be a failure to participate in it.

https://www.ft.com/content/b856c2fd-5019-4002-b549-5b047c35e00f,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,DeFi is a reminder of the risks of unfettered financial engineering,While they rely on libertarian ideals of self-governance, nascent blockchain systems are vulnerable,The writer is author of ‘The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution is Transforming Currencies and Finance’ Decentralised finance, or DeFi, is the next frontier in finance. New forms of financial intermediation are using blockchain technology to open up access to finance and bypass inefficient and lumbering traditional institutions like commercial banks. DeFi even makes it possible to sidestep government oversight and regulation. In China, for instance, a national ban on investing in cryptocurrency is pushing traders towards DeFi. While there is no doubt that the technology opens up exciting opportunities, this kind of unfettered financial engineering also opens the door to new risks. At face value, DeFi might seem a more secure way to conduct transactions. The system is characterised by transparent digital ledgers maintained on multiple computers, so there is no centralised point of failure. Its governance is also decentralised — control rests with the members of a network rather than a central authority. Trust is achieved through public consensus: community members must themselves agree about the validity of transactions, rather than relying on third parties. In principle, these features make DeFi invulnerable to hacks of particular computer nodes or malfeasance by individuals or institutions. DeFi also enables “permissionless composability”. That means a developer can easily connect together multiple DeFi applications built on open-source technology to create new financial products and services, without having to seek permissions. Several innovative DeFi products are already available. Flash loans, for example, enable borrowing without collateral, using that money for a transaction and then returning the borrowed amount, all for a small fee. A flash loan is initiated, executed, and completed in the blink of an eye, using just computer code. They have many uses, from helping to arbitrage price differences across markets, to increasing market efficiency. Since they are instantaneous, default and liquidity risks are reduced. Then there are smart contracts, which allow financial and other assets to be exchanged using computer code with no attorney or escrow agent involved. Computer tools can perform rigorous economic risk assessments of smart contracts and specific DeFi products. The open source nature of the applications helps uncover and eliminate security and other weaknesses. Still, sophisticated hackers have been able to take advantage of vulnerabilities in DeFi products. Malevolent agents can exploit the larger “attack surface” that is created when combining multiple applications. They are also more vulnerable to software bugs and users who do not fully understand the risks. The absence of a central authority to police bad behaviour also has risks. Researchers at Cornell University found that automated bots could front-run certain trades — for instance, executing open orders at an unfavourable price before they can be cancelled when prices change. With no one to report this flaw to, the researchers published a blog post detailing the risk, assuming the community would protect itself. Instead, a cottage industry of bots emerged to exploit the idea before the loophole could be closed. It is worth remembering that while DeFi may rely on libertarian ideals such as its own rule of law, with the community creating and enforcing rules in the broad interests of stakeholders, in reality nascent blockchain systems are vulnerable to governance capture by small groups of stakeholders, who could twist rules in their favour. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click Moreover, while blockchains are self-contained, they still need information about prices and ownership of assets to execute certain transactions. For instance, on-chain hog futures contracts need access to hog prices from commodity exchanges. Computer programs called oracles obtain such off-chain information and pass on-chain information back to the real world. These oracles are vulnerable to technical risks including hacks and even problems with external data providers. Given all this, regulators are in a quandary — even open-minded ones who see potential in DeFi but worry about financial stability risks. They can now intercede only at the point where these products intersect with institutions they oversee. As decentralised finance grows in size and scope, regulators will have to pay attention to risks building up in these markets and their spillovers into traditional financial markets. Updated regulatory frameworks that encompass DeFi will eventually be needed, although they should strike a reasonable balance in the innovation-risk trade-off. At a minimum, naive retail investors swept up by the technological razzle-dazzle must be protected from taking on outsized risks. ,,Eswar Prasad,2021-10-21T12:03:58.517Z,

This structure enables the transfer of digital assets without the need to go through a central party, such as a bank, broker or intermediary — making transactions quicker and easier.

https://www.ft.com/content/2691366f-d381-40cd-a769-6559779151c2,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,What are digital assets and how does blockchain work?,Demystifying the benefits and risks, plus how the underlying technology makes it possible,Digital assets are electronic files of data that can be owned and transferred by individuals, and used as a currency to make transactions, or as a way of storing intangible content, such as computerised artworks, video or contract documents. Examples of digital assets include cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, so-called asset-backed stablecoins, such as tether, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) — certificates of ownership of original digital media. Records of ownership of digital assets are held securely on a type of decentralised database, or electronic ledger, called a blockchain, which is distributed among its users. This structure enables the transfer of digital assets without the need to go through a central party, such as a bank, broker or intermediary. This can make transactions quicker and easier. A blockchain is a type of electronic ledger, in which digital asset transactions are recorded in blocks of data that are “chained” together in a specific order and protected using complex computer “hash” codes. Details of every new transaction must be verified by a network of computers, or nodes, before they can be added to the ledger. This verification process involves the details of the transaction being sent to all of the nodes in the network, which attempt to solve complex mathematical problems to prove that the transaction is valid. A majority must conclude that it is valid — it must be a consensus decision by the network. All the nodes in the network can access the information and compete to be the next to validate a new transaction and add it to a block. Unlike traditional ledgers, therefore, a blockchain database is decentralised and there is no master version. Each consensus-verified transaction is added to a block of data, and the blocks are connected to each other in a chain. As each new block is added, the blockchain becomes a growing database of time-stamped transactions that, in practical terms, is impossible to alter. Each new block that is appended to the blockchain contains a complex and unique computer-generated code, called a hash. This is like a digital “fingerprint”. Each block also contains the hash, or fingerprint, of the previous block in the chain, to which it is now attached. These matching hash codes prove that the chain is intact, in the correct order, and unaltered. If any attempt is made to tamper with the contents of a block, this will generate a new hash for that block, which will then differ from the hash of the previous block — breaking the chain. In order to conceal this tampering, a hacker would have to recalculate the hash code held in the next block in the chain, which would have the effect of changing that block’s own hash, requiring the next block’s hash codes to be recalculated, and so on. Every hash in every subsequent block in the chain would therefore have to be recalculated — a process requiring so much computing power that it would be extremely difficult. The database is therefore, in effect, “append-only” — it is not possible for anyone to go back and revise it later. Several technology platform providers facilitate the building of blockchains. According to industry estimates, 60-70 per cent of public blockchains are run on the Ethereum platform. Some believe this could become the preferred provider of technology for a range of decentralised processes. However, newer rival blockchain platforms with greater processing capacity have now sprung up, including Avalanche, Solana and Cardano. Solana has been used as a platform for the sale of new collections of NFTs. Digital assets can be quicker to issue than paper-based or physical assets. Their electronic-only format can also streamline the transaction process, reducing administrative and physical storage costs. These are some of the reasons that central banks and commercial banks are considering the use of digital assets and blockchain technologies. Digital assets held on a blockchain can pose both investment and security risks. The main investment risk is that digital assets that are not backed by physical holdings or fiat currencies issued by governments or central banks can fluctuate widely in value — driven by sentiment and demand. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have been known to double or halve in value against conventional currencies within the space of a few months. In October, Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe warned: “A massive collapse in crypto asset prices, similar to what we have seen in tech stocks [in 2000] and subprime [mortgage-backed securities in 2008], is certainly a plausible scenario.” A similar risk is that the high prices currently being paid for NFTs — such as the $69m paid for a token conferring ownership of a digital collage by the artist Beeple — will not be sustained. The main security risk is that digital asset exchanges, which allow individuals to buy and sell assets such as cryptocurrencies, can be hacked by criminals. A further risk is posed by electronic “wallets” which can be used to store cryptocurrencies and are protected by complex 16-digit “private keys”. Cybercriminals can trick users into giving away their private keys, and then steal their assets. Or users who forget their private keys can permanently lose access to their assets, as there is no central ownership register. Banks and fintechs have been working on ways to use blockchains to improve payment systems. By using distributed ledger technology, payment systems can, in theory, be made faster and more secure. Some banks are experimenting with issuing bonds on blockchains, as well, which could streamline the existing process, cut costs and reduce risk in the settlement process. The World Bank has already sold and managed bonds using blockchain technology, and the European Investment Bank recently raised €100m from a two-year bond registered on the Ethereum blockchain network. A blockchain’s decentralised structure could also remove the need for intermediaries — so bonds would no longer need to be registered with a central securities depository.

https://www.ft.com/content/c717654d-1847-4832-afd8-844176daae09,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Cryptocurrencies: how do they work and what are the risks?,A simple guide to the assets, from what they are to what investors need to know,Cryptocurrencies are assets that have been created digitally by a private company to serve as a store of value, which can be used to exchange for goods and services. But, unlike the money that is widely used today, a pure cryptocurrency is not created by a central issuing authority and its value is transferred and recorded on an open public ledger known as a blockchain. Furthermore, the currency’s provenance, and transfer of ownership, is secured and verified by cryptography. There are dozens of cryptocurrencies, the best known being bitcoin, ether, binance coin and cardano. However, there is an important distinction between a cryptocurrency, also known as a coin, and a token. A cryptocurrency has its own blockchain; it is effectively the native currency of the blockchain on which it is issued and traded. By contrast, a token is a unit of value that represents projects that are built on top of an existing blockchain. For example, ether is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain. But a token such as dai is built using Ethereum. Dai itself is a stablecoin — a bridge between existing financial markets and the crypto world. Increasingly, observers are talking about crypto assets in a more encompassing way to describe all the projects under way in the industry. Other ventures include security tokens, which are a crypto-based version of an existing security and usually a regulated activity. The Bank of England has estimated that crypto assets have grown in value by roughly 200 per cent in 2021, from just under $800bn to $2.3tn. Even so, that remains a fraction of the $250tn global financial system, notes the central bank. The first versions of cryptocurrencies were intended to be a form of electronic cash whose value could not be manipulated by outside actors such as central banks. But their use in everyday life — to buy consumer items such as coffees or sandwiches — has been slow. That is partly because the technology to make payments is far slower than the contactless card or chip-and-pin systems of today. But the main reason is that the value of the asset is highly volatile, making it unsuitable for everyday payments. Instead, cryptocurrencies are being seen as stores of value in their own right. Cryptocurrencies are created in different ways. Some, like bitcoin, are created as a reward to “miners” for using computer power to verify transactions that are made on the bitcoin blockchain. But that makes bitcoin expensive to operate — and the industry has been heavily criticised for its energy consumption. Others are trying to find alternative processes to ensure deals on blockchains can still be verified but do not require the same amounts of computing energy. Newer projects are focused on third parties to take on the legwork of processing some payments, to make the system more efficient and scalable. Prices of coins can be volatile and can move rapidly in the short term. That is why some cryptocurrency owners use the mantra “hodl” (“hold on for dear life”). With bitcoin hitting record prices in 2021, it is easy to see why they feel vindicated. Still, the coins are largely unregulated around the world so, if something goes wrong and investors lose their money, they have little protection from the authorities. Other assets that are based on cryptocurrencies, such as futures, have more investor protections. Some exchanges that offer crypto-related trading, such as derivatives exchange CME Group, also have to meet local laws that ensure the integrity of their market. The value of a coin can also be affected if it is discontinued, delisted or undergoes a significant technology change. Currencies can be discontinued for many reasons, from low volume and liquidity to security breaches. Finally, developers or members of a crypto community may have differing views on the future direction of the network or want to change the rules, or protocol, that governs the blockchain. That can lead to a “hard fork” which, in effect, splits the protocol into two branches and creates a new cryptocurrency. Forks can create volatility in crypto prices and, over the longer term, the two versions of the currency may not produce the same performance. The owners of the assets are as responsible for safeguarding the asset, as much as they would be for protecting their cash. Digital currencies can be kept on a computer and there are several choices available to crypto owners. One option is a virtual wallet that is kept online. It is easier to access and makes it faster for users to trade because they can quickly connect to exchanges or other services. However, being online makes a wallet more susceptible to being hacked, so some people prefer to keep their assets in what is known as “cold storage” — on an electronic device but in a vault not connected to the internet. Cold storage wallets do not accept as many kinds of cryptocurrencies as online wallets, however, and they are more expensive storage options. Another problem is losing or forgetting the private key, which unlocks the digital wallet. Recommended Like other financial institutions, crypto service providers also have to make sure they are not hacked. Compromising the security of a blockchain is widely seen as a remote problem — to succeed, a hacker would need more computing power than all the other independent verifiers on the network. That often means the computer code written for new projects is the most vulnerable point in the system. Sometimes, the code is little tested before it goes live and is open for hackers to exploit and walk off with the assets. But so-called ethical white hat hackers can try to test and improve the service. In August, one hacker removed assets worth $600m from Poly Network, a decentralised trading network, when he found a flaw. He later returned them. ,,Philip Stafford,2021-10-21T03:00:51.629Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/df9f5795-2aaf-4088-a76e-304056db61ef,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,The FT crypto glossary,Want to speak crypto? This guide tells you all you need to know,Alt or alternative coins: Any cryptocurrency other than the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is known as an alt-coin. Alt-coins range from relatively well-established and popular coins like t through to joke currencies like dogecoin. The term is also sometimes applied to stablecoins or to tokens that represent a stake of ownership, such as a security token. Automated Market Maker: An actor that encourages buyers and sellers in a decentralised market. Like market makers on traditional markets, they aim to make money from discrepancies in pricing on different markets, until the asset price falls into line across all markets. An automated market maker deposits their own pair of cryptocurrencies into a smart contract and lets computer code handle buying and selling with interested parties, who are also using their own smart contracts. Owners of assets are incentivised by sharing in the pool of fees that are generated through trading activity. The process has been compared to YouTube because investors can generate and upload their own content. Automatic liquidation: A common feature in leveraged trading on a crypto exchange. A futures trader only pays for a small fraction of the overall value of their position, which is a bet on the direction of the asset. The leverage can magnify potential gains and losses. That payment, margin, is used to back the trade. In a traditional market, when the asset price goes against the direction the trader has bet, the exchange may ask the customer to stump up extra funds within a certain timeframe to keep the trade open. A position on a crypto exchange can work differently. The exchange monitors the market constantly and may automatically begin selling off some of the customer’s bets if the customer’s margin falls below a pre-determined level. Typically a user will receive an alert if their account is in danger — but given the volatility of digital assets, these kinds of forced liquidation events can leave traders wiped out extremely quickly. Bagholder: An investor who refuses to let go of a cryptocurrency despite its poor performance, delaying their exit long enough for the coin to eventually become worthless. Bankman-Fried, Sam: Known widely as SBF, Bankman-Fried is the co-founder and former chief executive of the now bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Once the crypto world’s most high-profile executive, a regular lobbyist in Washington DC and with a then net worth of about $26bn, SBF fell from grace with the collapse of his company. He was then charged by the US with multiple crimes, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit securities and commodities fraud and conspiracy to defraud the Federal Election Commission. Basel Committee on Banking Supervision: The world’s most powerful standards setter for banks. It determines how banks control risks and how much equity they should hold to protect themselves if markets or customers blow up. It has proposed differing digital asset categories for banks wanting to buy and sell crypto for customers or themselves. Banks can treat stock tokens and stablecoins on their balance sheets like existing assets, with some rule modifications. Bitcoin and others would come under a new “conservative” prudential regime, so banks would need to hold at least enough equity to more than cover all potential losses. Binance: The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, founded in 2017 by Changpeng Zhao. The exchange says it does not have a headquarters, but semi-autonomous units that allow it to operate around the world. However it has clashed with many regulators and in March 2023 the US Securities and Exchange Commission sued both Binance and Zhao, filing a total of 13 charges. They included Binance operating unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers and clearing agencies as well as misrepresenting trading controls and oversight on Binance’s US platform. Binance has said it will fight the suit. Bitcoin: The biggest and original cryptocurrency that launched an entire industry. It was envisaged by its pseudonymous creator (or creators) Satoshi Nakamoto as a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system”. BNB coin: The cryptocurrency of the exchange Binance. It was launched in 2017 with the promise that only 200mn tokens will ever exist. Every quarter, Binance uses a fifth of its profits to destroy already existing coins, in a bid to make them more scarce and in turn, more valuable. The coins can be used to pay for Binance services, to pay trading fees, or for trading — just like Bitcoin and others. Blockchain: A type of distributed ledger, written on open source software. It is a growing database of time-stamped transactions that cannot be altered. Each new transaction is verified by a network of computers and added as a “block” to the chain. You are seeing a snapshot of an interactive graphic. This is most likely due to being offline or JavaScript being disabled in your browser. Burning coins: Inflation is one of the enemies of cryptocurrencies. Thus, there is a counterpart to minting new coins: burning them, thereby removing them from circulation. For stablecoins, burning is particularly important to keep the token supply equal to the asset backing they have. Cardano: A blockchain network that can facilitate peer-to-peer transactions with its own digital currency, Ada. The name honours English mathematician and writer Ada Lovelace, who is viewed as the world’s first software engineer because she created an algorithm in the 19th century. It promises to use less energy than Bitcoin or ethereum because it uses proof-of-stake protocols to verify transactions. It was developed by Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of ethereum, who left after a dispute with other fellow co-founders, including Vitalik Buterin. Cardano’s Ada is one of the fastest growing cryptocurrencies, with more people holding it on trading platform eToro than Bitcoin. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs): Proposed digital currencies run by central banks, rather than created by private companies. They would use the same technology but would be backed by reserves. Central bankers have been spurred on by fears that efforts such as Facebook’s proposed cryptocurrency could impact monetary policy, and destabilise financial markets or cross-border money transfers. Coin: A cryptocurrency that lives on its own independent blockchain. Examples include Bitcoin and ethereum. Distinct from a token. Coinbase: The largest US-listed exchange for buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies and tokens. It also allows customers to deposit their crypto assets and lend them out, earning interest far in excess of prevailing bank rates. In 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission sued the San Francisco-based company, arguing it had been violating US securities law for at least four years, by failing to register as a broker, national securities exchange or clearing agency. Coinbase has said it will fight the suit. Cold storage: Storing crypto assets on a computer in a vault, which is not connected to the internet. Many cold storage wallets do not accept as many kinds of cryptocurrencies and are more expensive storage options. Consequently, many traders prefer to use a hot wallet. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) The main US regulator for derivatives. The agency has determined that, in legal terms, virtual currencies like Bitcoin are commodities. That means it has jurisdiction to oversee derivatives that use a digital currency and potentially hand out penalties if there is fraud or manipulation of those derivatives. Cryptocurrency: A currency created digitally, usually by private companies, and named after the cryptographic maths that make it possible. It was conceived in the depths of the financial crisis by Satoshi Nakamoto as a way for people to make electronic payments without going through any financial institutions. Crypto exchange: A venue for buying and selling cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and ethereum. They often also offer loans and custody of assets, and other services that a traditional exchange cannot. Examples of crypto exchanges include Binance, Coinbase, Huobi, Bybit, Kraken, Gemini, Bitfinex and Bitstamp. Crypto mixing- A type of money transfer designed to obscure the audit trails that would normally be available to the public on the digital ledgers that track cryptocurrency moves. In a mixing service customers can deposit tokens such as bitcoin using one wallet address. The funds are then mixed into a single pool containing all users’ funds. When it is drawn out it has a different address, making the owner untraceable. Unsurprisingly, the US thinks such services are ideal vehicles for illicit activity like sanctions busting, money laundering and supporting North Korea’s nuclear programme. DApp: A computer application that runs on a decentralised finance network, such as a distributed ledger. DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation): An organisation whose rules are automated or developed by consensus among the members. It is designed to work unlike a typical corporate structure, where power lies in the hands of an executive or board. Decentralised finance (DeFi): An umbrella term for a collection of cryptoasset projects that aim to do away with a centralised intermediary — like a bank or an exchange — to provide financial services. They use DApps to execute common services like lending, savings accounts and trading coins. Decentralised trading protocol: Sometimes referred to as a decentralised exchange, or DEX. It is a network that allows users to buy and sell digital assets directly with each other, bypassing intermediaries that might impose fees, such as an exchange or clearing house. Automated market makers use smart contracts which can trade 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Older trading networks, such as Uniswap and SushiSwap, are written on ethereum but newer networks may use alternative protocols like Solana or Polkadot. However, some networks may suffer from low liquidity. There is also little recourse for users who find their security hacked and assets stolen. Diem: The yet-to-be launched digital coin by Facebook and previously known as Libra. It has been credited with jolting central banks and regulators into realising that private cryptocurrency initiatives were becoming too big to ignore, and to start on their own CBDCs. The intense scrutiny led Facebook to change the name from Libra and scale back its ambitions in 2020. Digital Currency Group: Venture capital firm which has funded dozens of coins and companies in the digital assets industry, including exchange Coinbase and broker eToro. It owns investment firm Grayscale, trade news site CoinDesk, and is also parent to the crypto-lending unit Genesis, which filed for US bankruptcy protection in early 2023, and left creditors short on at least $3.4bn, after it was toppled in the industry-wide turmoil following the collapse of the FTX exchange. Distributed ledger: A public register of deals shared and replicated by a network of computers. They work together to verify transactions and create an immutable ledger, and do away with the need for a central authority. It is similar to a blockchain but it does not need to have its data structured in blocks. Nor does it need to use proof of work to mine tokens. dogecoin: An alt-coin that purposely began as a joke, to highlight the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies in 2013. It uses a Japanese Shiba Inu dog as its mascot and has surged in popularity and value despite its beginnings. Ethereum: The world’s second most actively-traded cryptocurrency and the token associated with the ethereum blockchain. Ethereum: A developer-run blockchain technology co-founded by Vitalik Buterin, a Canadian-Russian computer science student. Its aim is to make blockchains more useful and revolutionary than simply to serve as a database for transactions. Its technology can hold assets, enables programmers to code functions for buying and selling into smart contracts, and is typically also the building block for most DApps for finance. Fiat currency: A traditional currency backed and regulated by a central bank — such as the US dollar, euro, sterling and yen. Flippening: A term the moment when ethereum overtakes Bitcoin as the biggest and most valuable cryptocurrency. Fork: Developers sometimes disagree on how a blockchain should be run and, if they cannot settle their differences, the ultimate step is to create a fork in the network. One side will use newer software and the existing network will rely on the older version. It means that two incompatible versions of the blockchain emerge, based on different principles and with different user bases. Forks can take place for a number of reasons including concerns over outdated and insecure software, or a need to reverse the log of transactions following a hack, or a need to return investors’ funds to them. FTX: The now bankrupt company was one of the world’s largest and most high-profile cryptocurrency exchanges in its heyday. Founded in 2019, it rose to prominence by enabling investors to trade various digital coins and exchange them for traditional currencies. But it fell into financial difficulty and collapsed. Once valued at $32bn, FTX filed for bankruptcy in 2022, leaving customers short on as much as $8bn of its liabilities. Weeks later US regulators charged the company and several of its senior management with misusing client funds, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The relationship with its associated trading firm Alameda Research, at the time almost entirely owned by co-FTX founder and then-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, also came under scrutiny. FUD: An acronym for “fear, uncertainty and doubt”, used as a dismissive label for negative information about cryptocurrencies — and normally to imply that criticisms of digital assets are invalid or misleading. The Fud label is often applied to critiques focusing on Bitcoin’s environmental impact or the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering. People who spread Fud are called Fudsters. Funding rate: A measure of the direction of traders’ collective positions in crypto. It works in tandem with a perpetual futures contract. The funding rate is designed to bring the price of the futures contract closer to the index it tracks. The rate is based on the difference between the spot market and the futures price. It is expressed as a percentage. If it is above zero, it is described as positive as it shows there is more demand for long futures contracts. If it is below zero, it is described as negative. To balance the positions, traders betting in one direction pay traders who have taken the opposing position. If the funding rate is positive, traders who are long of a token price have to pay those who are short. If sentiment is negative, traders with a short position pay those who have gone long. The payments in either direction continue during a set window, often every eight hours, until the price of the future converges with that of the index again. The payments are based on the notional size of a trader’s position — meaning they can be substantial for highly leveraged bets. Gas Fees: The fees paid by users to compensate for the amount of computing energy needed to verify a transaction on the ethereum network. They are intended to prevent nefarious actors from spamming the network. Prices can rise and fall depending on demand. Users have complained about ethereum’s fees, which can cost anything from $20 — $100, because ethereum is so heavily used. Gemini: An exchange for buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies and tokens set up in 2014 by the Winklevoss twins. Customers can also deposit assets and earn interest far in excess of prevailing bank rates. Governance tokens: Tokens that give holders voting powers on a blockchain protocol. They are mainly used in DeFi projects so systems can remain decentralised and no one party makes the decisions on the project’s future direction. Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust: A fund that operates the world’s most popular Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Have fun staying poor: The ultimate retort from crypto enthusiasts to sceptics — expressing their pity for non-believers. It is usually used to counter criticism of Bitcoin or other digital assets and it implies that sceptics do not understand the full implications of blockchain technology. Hodl: The battle cry of the long-term cryptocurrency holder. Originally a humorous misspelling of ‘hold’ found on a cryptocurrency forum in 2013 and sometimes thought to be an acronym for “Holding On For Dear Life”, the frantic tone associated with its use has struck a chord with the wider crypto community. Hodling is not simply about keeping crypto-investments no matter how low they fall. It also reflects an almost religious belief in the inevitability of a return to profitability and a rejection of both the fickle, unmanly day trader and the myopic, untrustworthy crypto-sceptic. Hot wallet: A virtual wallet to store crypto assets. It is kept online which means it is easier to access and enables users to trade more quickly. But being online makes it more susceptible to being hacked, so some people prefer to keep their assets in cold storage. ICO: Like an initial public offering, an initial coin offering is a tool for fundraising. But the similarities end there. Investors get some of the new currency, as opposed to stock in the company. And, unlike IPOs, ICOs lack any investor protection: they can be set up with just a website, a utopian mission statement and some ad spend. After a surge in popularity in 2017-18, ICOs came under sustained scrutiny from regulators in the US, UK and Europe over the dangers they posed to consumers. In 2019, messaging apps Kik and Telegram were both sued over their ICOs by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Laser eyes: A social media meme in which users change or edit their profile pictures to make their eyes look like they emit red laser beams. It denotes a fan of cryptocurrencies, with the light-emitting powers variously interpreted to mean a user has special powers of sight and an iron will to make Bitcoin an instrument of economic empowerment. Layer 2: A secondary network or technology run by a third party and built on top of an existing blockchain to improve its efficiency. For example, some blockchains like Bitcoin and ethereum cannot handle vast quantities of trades at high speed, affecting the users of some DApps. A layer 2 network can handle the bulk of the transaction processing legwork, so the original blockchain can scale. Liquidity pool: A central feature of decentralised trading. Customers do not trade on an order book but against other participants in the pool, who have also filled up the pool with funds that sit on smart contracts. Maximalist: A crypto-purist who believes with unwavering conviction that their preferred coin, be it Bitcoin or Ethereum, is the only one that has value. Memecoin: A cryptocurrency that is associated with a meme or viral online joke. dogecoin is a popular example of a memecoin. Metaverse: A vision of the future internet. An immersive virtual reality world where people will be able to pursue all aspects of life as if in a parallel digital universe. Mining: The act of employing a large network of computers to work together to solve cryptographic calculations that verify cryptocurrency transactions. Typically, one party will solve the puzzle, known as a hash, that creates the next block in the chain. The others will verify it. In return for maintaining the blockchain, miners are rewarded with new tokens for being the first to solve the cryptographic proof. They also collect transaction fees. Mooning, aka Going to the Moon: When the price and trading volume of a cryptocurrency are both soaring. Musk, Elon: One of the world’s most influential cryptocurrency advocates, with the power to raise or drop prices of coins with a single tweet or Saturday evening TV appearance. Sometimes sells electric cars, too. Nakamoto, Satoshi: The pseudonymous creator — or creators — of Bitcoin. The seminal moment was the publication of a whitepaper in 2008, weeks after Lehman Brothers collapsed amid the global financial crisis. NFT: A non-fungible token. A unit of information stored as a token on a blockchain, usually an ethereum blockchain. However, it is not fungible — meaning it cannot be interchanged with another token. That makes the token unique and turns its blockchain into a digital form of provenance. It can only have one owner. Some artists and sellers of collectible memorabilia have begun experimenting with selling NFTs. But owning the token only proves that someone has ownership of the “original” work, and does not necessarily include its copyright or its intellectual property rights. NGMI: “Not Going To Make It” — slang for missing out on the profits of a trade. Its opposite is “GMI”, or Going to Make It. Nocoiner: A sceptic who doesn’t own any cryptocurrency, believes it has little to no value and suspects it might be a Ponzi scheme that will fail. Node: Its definition varies, but is usually understood to mean a physical point on a computer network where an activity takes place. Sometimes, it can be to collect and distribute information; sometimes, it is where transactions on a blockchain are verified. OpenSea: The world’s largest peer-to-peer marketplace for trading NFTs. Oracle: A third party that acts as a bridge between traditional markets and the crypto world. It gathers data from the outside world, such as asset prices, and sends it to a blockchain or distributed ledger. That data can be used in smart contracts for other crypto trading projects. It can also work in reverse, using information in smart contracts in the outside world. PancakeSwap: A decentralised trading protocol based on the Binance blockchain. Customers can exchange Binance tokens. It uses automated market makers to trade assets. Pig butchering: Drawing an unflattering analogy to fattening farm pigs before slaughter, the term refers to a type of cryptocurrency scam that involves befriending or entering into a romantic relationship with the unwitting victim, to gain trust before convincing them to make a sketchy investment. Perpetual futures: Type of futures contract more commonly used in crypto than in conventional markets. The expiration date on a traditional future that tracks the price of oil, gas or stock indices helps link the future to the price of the underlying asset, since the holder typically takes delivery of the asset on that date. Perpetual futures can be held indefinitely as the funding rate mechanism links the futures price with the spot price. Derivatives markets usually have more volume than spot markets, so often provide signals into sentiment and likely short-term moves in the spot market. Private key: The complex password needed to access a virtual currency wallet. Proof-of-stake: A system for mining cryptocurrencies that requires users to stake their coins as collateral to become a verifier on the network. It is largely associated with the ethereum blockchain. Unlike proof-of-work systems, verifiers are chosen at random to create blocks and validate proposed blocks. If they attest to fraudulent blocks, they will lose their staked coins. As no coins are mined, the process should not require vast amounts of computing energy. However, it has been hard to scale and ethereum’s blockchain has struggled to keep up with demand. Critics have argued the system favours richer participants because the more coins a miner owns, the more mining power it has. Proof-of-work Used in mining, it allows one party to prove it has solved the cryptographic puzzle to validate a transaction, while the others verify the work. Its aim is to prevent the same coins being spent twice with two different parties. Largely associated with the Bitcoin blockchain, it has been criticised for its high energy consumption and slow speed. Developers are looking at proof-of-stake mining as a cheaper, faster and less environmentally-damaging alternative. Pyth: A DeFi project and Oracle, built by some of the world’s largest high-speed traders as a “potential game changer” for trading stocks and other assets on blockchain technology. Rekt In the world of gaming, you might shout rekt when you gun down an opponent in Fortnite, the violent and popular video game. In cryptocurrencies, someone is rekt if they suffer a loss as a result of a bad crypto investment. A cryptocurrency that has gone down significantly in value could also be said to be rekt. Rugpull A common method of defrauding investors in the wild west world of DeFi, where anyone can list a coin and compete for investors’ money. Scammers set-up a new coin that promises to be the next big moneymaking opportunity. After attracting investors, usually via chat rooms or other social media channels, and convincing enough of them to put money into the projects, the developers of the coin then vanish into thin (decentralised) air. Security token: Similar to the securities that are traded on a stock or bond market but ownership is recorded on a blockchain rather than in a central depository. The tokens often promise a share in future profits or repayments. Regulators around the world usually regard them as in their regulatory jurisdiction. Securities and Exchange Commission: The US securities regulator. Its jurisdiction over crypto markets is limited but does regulate digital assets securities. The SEC chair, Gary Gensler, has called on legislators to give it the power to regulate crypto exchanges. Sharding: Splitting a network into separate but linked ledgers, so it can reduce the strain on each node in the network by no longer requiring it to validate every transaction. Saylor, Michael: Chief executive of MicroStrategy, a software company that has taken the unusual step of buying thousands of Bitcoins. In 2020, he tweeted that Bitcoin was “a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom.” Silbert, Barry: Entrepreneur, early investor in the crypto industry, and founder of Digital Currency Group. A Bitcoin whale. Smart contract: A computer program that can contain financial assets and be coded with the ability to execute actions by itself, if certain conditions are met. That could include transferring funds or sending notifications. Smart contracts play a crucial role in decentralised trading protocols. Stablecoins: Cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets, usually the world’s biggest and most stable currencies. They act as crypto-native dollars and a bridge between crypto and traditional financial worlds. They also allow traders to more easily convert traditional currencies into cryptocurrencies for trading. The coins can be lent as collateral for trading, or to generate high yields in the form of interest. They are supposed to have a fixed price and be backed by reserves at all times, allowing users to redeem them. However, critics have questioned where some stablecoins keep their reserves and whether the assets can be quickly recovered and redeemed. The two biggest stablecoin operators are Tether and USDC, run by Circle. A few stablecoins are backed by other cryptocurrencies or baskets of other cryptocurrencies. They use algorithms to buy and sell in order to keep themselves fully backed. But these algorithmic stablecoins can collapse if anything happens to the cryptocurrencies to which they are pegged. They remain a small part of the market. Solana: A blockchain protocol that can handle smart contracts and claims faster speeds and lower transaction costs than ethereum. Staking: A protocol that aims to boost asset owners’ earnings. Users lock their crypto in their wallet but give permission for a third party, often an exchange, to stake their crypto on DeFi projects that offer interest or yield farming. The barriers to staking are quite high and users normally need to hold a lot of a particular cryptocurrency first. Binance and Coinbase both offer staking. Tether: The largest and most controversial stablecoin, with over 60bn tokens in circulation. It is nominally pegged to the US dollar and says all its tokens are backed by dollars, one-for-one. It plays an important role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, because its tokens are used by investors who want to leverage their returns on more volatile cryptocurrencies. However, the New York attorney-general ruled it had deceived clients over its reserves after it suffered a serious loss of funds when its payment processors’ accounts were frozen. Tether did not admit to any wrongdoing, but paid a settlement of $18.5mn Its self-declared commercial paper (a form of debt security) holdings would make it one of the world’s largest investors in the market, according to JPMorgan. Token: A unit built on an existing blockchain and intended to be an incentive or reward for developing other projects on that blockchain. The best known example is ERC20, a token on the ethereum blockchain, which has built other digital assets and currencies. Distinct from a coin. Trustless: A central tenet of the crypto industry. Computing systems like blockchain eliminate the need for a trusted third party, like a bank or clearing house, to check or execute transactions. Uniswap: A decentralised trading protocol built on the ethereum blockchain. It is also the name of the company set up by Hayden Adams, the developer behind Uniswap. Whale: Much like their marine counterparts, cryptocurrency whales are reclusive creatures whose activity has an effect on the whole ecosystem. They are individuals or institutions that hold a large proportion of the coins of a particular cryptocurrency. A rule of thumb is that a whale owns more than 5 per cent of a given coin. That makes them key actors in the price of the asset. Holding the asset can keep it out of circulation, boosting its price. Selling can cause the price to dip, especially if the volume floods the market. In an unregulated market, it invites accusations they are manipulating the market. Few whales are known because identities are anonymous, but they can be recognised by the internet addresses controlled by a single network participant. Known bitcoin whales include the Winklevoss twins. Whitepaper: Part marketing tool, part technical documentation and part vision statement, a whitepaper sets out how a cryptocurrency works, what it is trying to do and the creator’s projections for profitability. Whitepapers have often been associated with the ICO craze. However, whitepapers are produced by almost all cryptocurrency companies as standard procedure. The most famous was written by Satoshi Nakamoto. Winklevoss, Cameron and Tyler: Twin brothers who were early and vocal backers of Bitcoin when it was still a hobby for enthusiasts in the early 2010s. Regarded as Bitcoin whales because they bought large holdings when the currency was worth only cents. They rose to pre-crypto fame because of their claims that Mark Zuckerberg stole the idea for Facebook from them. Wrapped token: A cryptocurrency token pegged to the value of another token. They have identical values but enable one token to lives on a Blockchain that it was not issued on. For example, Bitcoin and ethereum blockchains cannot talk to each other; but a wrapped token acts as a bridge between the two. Yield farming: The practice of looking through the DeFi world for best yields available from more obscure projects and coins. These opportunities can advertise interest rates as high as several thousand per cent to pull in digital cash but can also be short lived.

https://www.ft.com/content/f428a5da-ff3f-471a-b29c-c30a9cc9a304,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Does crypto belong in an ESG portfolio?,Probably not for bitcoin — but possibly yes for blockchain,Doug Miller is a staunch believer in the power of technology to solve environmental problems. As a masters student at London’s Imperial College, the American orchestrated a field study of office workers and energy consumption. He found that automating light switches was more effective and cheaper than relying on the last person leaving a room to turn off the lights. In his current role at global non-profit organisation Energy Web, he has gone even more high-tech: engineering a certification system for digital assets that rely on clean energy. “I come at this purely from an environmental point of view,” he says. “Blockchain forms a key part of the clean energy transition.” But asset managers with an environmental, social and governance brief may think differently. Blockchain is best known as the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin — assets whose carbon footprint and utility in illicit transactions put them beyond the ESG pale. That may change, however, as — thanks to the efforts of Miller and others — blockchain percolates into more areas of the economy. Recommended Cryptocurrencies owe their dubious environmental reputation to the huge amounts of electricity, often coal-generated, that computers need to create them. And because they are not subject to government regulation, they are a favoured medium of exchange for criminals and terrorists: the hackers who closed down Colonial Pipeline in the US in May, for example, received their ransom in bitcoin. European asset manager Candriam said earlier this year that “cryptocurrencies have a long way to go to satisfy ESG criteria”, citing money laundering and the environmental impact of “mining” coins (performing the complex calculations that generate them). Yet Miller is at pains to emphasise the difference between speculative currencies and the technology that supports not only them but other, more innocuous digital assets — such as the supposedly tout-proof tickets sold for the 2018 football World Cup. Central banks are also using the technology. Recommended “There is a risk of conflating blockchain technology and crypto,” he says. “Helping energy companies manage their grid better is very different from [cryptocurrency] Dogecoin.” Energy Web runs just such a grid project with an Australian electricity group. Last month, UBS Wealth Management said that, as well as healthcare and sustainability, “the digital transformation of sectors ranging from transport to manufacturing and financial services creates opportunities”. In a paper evaluating cryptocurrency investments, the wealth manager’s analysts recommended that “investors focus on companies exposed to the evolution of distributed ledger technology, rather than engaging directly in cryptos”. Distributed ledgers — of which blockchain is one type — are systems that rely on the collective agreement of users to verify transactions. Investor scepticism on ESG points to a maturing market Boards face growing pressure from ESG petitions Regulators put ESG fund names under the microscope Climate change drives push for greener pensions Bond funds wrestle with human rights dilemma Sustainable investors ponder Chinese opportunities Does it pay to steer clear of sin stocks? More recently, the technology has evolved in a way that cuts down on the number of users needed to approve transactions, making these systems more energy efficient. A recent study by University College London found that some new distributed ledger technologies — using the so-called “proof-of-stake” protocol rather than the older “proof-of-work” method — were up to three times more efficient than earlier systems. “Our work shows that [newer blockchains] . . . could even undercut the energy needs of traditional central payment systems, raising hopes that distributed ledger technologies can contribute positively to combating climate change,” the paper concluded. Further impetus may come from the Crypto Climate Accord, which aims to decarbonise the crypto industry by 2030 (and which Miller played a key part in founding). Crypto diehards also point to the fact that the carbon footprint of bitcoin mining is falling, especially since China this year banned private cryptocurrencies and shut down huge mining operations. Distributed ledger technologies can help combat climate change The impact is already showing up in data. In May, the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index estimated that bitcoin’s global electricity consumption was about the same as Sweden’s. This month, it is on a par with Kyrgyzstan’s — a significantly lower level. And conventional assets have issues of their own. “It could be argued that there is a much bigger but more subtle problem with fiat money as it pertains to the environment,” say analysts at Deutsche Bank in a recent report. Central bank-backed currencies, they argue, are “the ultimate tool in bringing forward consumption from tomorrow to today”, referring to national policymakers’ ability to print money through quantitative easing. Still, there are significant risks around cryptocurrencies, especially for responsible investors. The use of digital coins in illicit activities remains rife. Chainalysis, a crypto monitoring company, says bitcoin remains attractive for criminals “due to its pseudonymous nature and the ease with which it allows users to instantly send funds anywhere in the world, despite its transparent and traceable design”. Recommended Nevertheless, there are some hopeful signs for crypto fans. Chainalysis found that, in 2019, around $21.4bn worth of transfers were due to illicit activity, representing 2.1 per cent of all cryptocurrency transactions. Last year, such activities had fallen to about $10bn worth of transactions, or 0.34 per cent of the total. Many continue to believe that, ultimately, cryptocurrencies will fade out after crashing and burning, due to their speculative nature and lack of inherent value. Regulation and central bank digital currencies are also threats. “Bitcoin is a video game,” Jan Kregel, an economist and director of research at the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College in New York tells the FT. “There is potential for the crypto world to blow up and cause a bigger crisis than subprime.” The technology behind it, however, is probably here to stay.,,Eva Szalay,2021-10-18T03:30:13.435Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/4d17853c-5951-4473-91bc-31e2e4e27668,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,NFTs turn Japan’s manga and anime into genuine art,Original illustrations from One Piece reborn as high-end collectors’ items,Blockchain technology is lending new commercial value to Japanese manga and anime culture, turning illustrations into genuine artworks, raising money for artists and fostering the growth of the market and related businesses. The recent rise of NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, is helping to verify the provenance and authenticity of digital art, something that was previously difficult because digital works are easily copied. New companies are springing up to build platforms and assure buyers that the pieces they buy are genuine and can be tracked securely. One Piece, a megahit manga series of pirate tales that has appeared in a weekly magazine since 1997, published its 100th volume in September. In all, the series has sold more than 490m copies, which has previously set a record for the most printed comic series by a single author. To mark these achievements, publisher Shueisha has selected 10 classic scenes from the series to turn into luxury prints. They are priced at nearly ¥500,000 ($4,500) each. A lottery was held for the right to purchase one of up to 20 limited-edition prints of each illustration. The lottery, which ran from September 25 to October 3, attracted more than 3,000 entries in the first two days. Not only are the pieces printed by a skilled artisan on 100 per cent cotton paper, their authenticity is also guaranteed with a blockchain transaction history. Each print comes with a paper certificate with an IC tag that allows the owner to see when the artwork has changed hands by reading the tag with a smartphone. This article is from Nikkei Asia, a global publication with a uniquely Asian perspective on politics, the economy, business and international affairs. Our own correspondents and outside commentators from around the world share their views on Asia, while our Asia300 section provides in-depth coverage of 300 of the biggest and fastest-growing listed companies from 11 economies outside Japan. Subscribe | Group subscriptions “Blockchain is often associated with digital art pieces to ensure their value, but we would like to work on the technology with physical art pieces,” said Masashi Okamoto, who has led a project called Shueisha Manga-Art Heritage since March. He believes that registering information on the artworks’ owners will “help original manga illustrations raise their artistic reputation, even abroad”, as many entries for the One Piece illustration lottery have come from Asia, Europe and Oceania, Okamoto said. As manga artists often illustrate for weekly publications, little effort has been made to preserve their original drawings. There are artists who decline to take their original illustrations back from publishers; other drawings are gathering dust in storerooms. “Preserving these mangas for the next generation is necessary,” Okamoto said, adding that he started the project as a way to make use of a digital manga archive that he launched in 2007. He estimates the domestic market for digital comics at about ¥350bn, which puts it on par with the broader art market. “Manga can create a new form of art, instead of being categorised under an existing art framework,” Okamoto added. The blockchain technology used for the Shueisha Manga-Art Heritage project is provided by Startbahn, a start-up founded in 2014 by contemporary artist Taihei Shii. Startbahn issues the certificate, which also contains information on when and where the artwork was exhibited, preserved and restored, as well as which auction house it was traded through. Companies, including an auction organiser and an art ecommerce service, use Startbahn’s database, using the blockchain to confirm the authenticity of artworks. Shii, alarmed at seeing young artists being forced to sell their works cheaply and unable to make a living, came up with the idea of creating a platform that would allow artists to recoup some of the value of their artworks after they are resold by collectors who purchase them from galleries. “It is the same logic as registering real estate . . . The property you buy is not fake and belongs to you, but it isn’t quite like that in the art market,” said Shii. “And this uncertainty of authenticity has made the art market unstable.” One critical area of concern for art buyers is whether a piece is genuine. Except in cases where a collector buys a work directly from a gallery, there has been no way, until recently, for a buyer to verify the authenticity of a piece once it is resold. Paper records can easily be altered or forged. Shii believed a reliable mechanism to authenticate pieces was needed to expand the market — and to broaden the definition of art itself. Startbahn, together with Japanese advertising agency Dentsu, in July began offering a consulting service to companies looking to do business in NFTs. NFTs are digital assets used to track data on everything from items in online games to trading cards. The uniqueness of these items is verified using blockchain technology. The tokens, which can be bought, sold and traded in the same way as physical assets, created a buzz in March when digital artist Beeple sold an NFT piece at Christie’s for $69m, making it the third-most valuable artwork sold at auction by a living artist. A new wave has developed around generative NFT art, which randomly creates pieces using an algorithm. Art Blocks, a platform dedicated to generative NFT art, racked up sales of more than $95m over one week in late September, according to nonfungible.com, a website that tracks NFTs. Sales were three times higher last month. “Generative NFTs help to exponentially multiply the amount of art that you can create as an artist,” said Fungi, a New York-based artist, explaining the popularity of a new type of art in which neither the collectors nor even the artists themselves know what works will result. “As an artist today, you have to be prolific to be at the forefront of art because you have to be turning out products all the time” using platforms from TikTok to Instagram, she said. “That can be exhausting for artists . . . But generative art allows you to create [a piece] using just a few traits.” Fungi is also co-founder of Shroom Chan, a generative NFT art project led by women that aims to help anime creators in Japan and elsewhere in Asia. It is setting up a platform in October that will not only allow creators to make anime characters with just a few clicks, but also let them buy and sell images to make money. Japanese-style anime shows are drawing the attention of media giants such as Netflix, which said in March that it planned to launch 40 new anime titles this year. But in Japan and elsewhere, anime creators are struggling to make a living despite long hours of work. “I think it’s just really ridiculous that from this industry, which nowadays is valued at $25bn, people are making a lot of money. But is the money going to the actual creators? I’d say it’s not really happening,” said Kinoko, another co-founder of Shroom Chan. “We want to flip that equation and help these underpaid Asian creatives.” A version of this article was first published by Nikkei Asia on October 02. ©2021 Nikkei Inc.

https://www.ft.com/content/30854926-f9ca-4352-b17e-7e464b6a3a3d,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Celsius investment shows ‘conviction’ in blockchain, says CDPQ,Canadian pension fund ‘absolutely not’ considering investing directly in bitcoin,Canada’s second-largest pension fund has said its inaugural investment in the digital asset sector reflects a belief that blockchain technology will shake up the financial industry, even as cryptocurrencies attract mounting regulatory scrutiny. Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec (CDPQ), the US$300bn Canadian pension fund manager, on Tuesday joined WestCap, the fund set up by former Airbnb and Blackstone executive Laurence Tosi, in leading a funding round for Celsius Network — a crypto lending platform that has been targeted by US state regulators who say it has breached securities laws. Alexandre Synnett, executive vice-president and chief technology officer at CDPQ, said he expected that taking a stake in Celsius despite the regulatory pressure might appear unusual. “We knew from the beginning of this investment that we would have questions,” he said in an interview with the Financial Times. “The conviction that we have is around the blockchain technology,” he added. “In a positive way, I think it will change the way the financial services are interacting.” The move by the public pension manager to join Celsius’ $400m equity raising, which valued the company at $3bn, represents a fresh signal that money managers are willing to tolerate regulatory clouds hanging over many crypto businesses in order to tap what they see as a crucial investment opportunity in digital assets. But Synnett cautioned that there were limits to CDPQ’s enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies. He said the fund was focused on making “opportunistic” investments in “diamond in the rough” early-stage companies leveraging blockchain technology, as part of its $40bn exposure to financial services worldwide. “This is a small diversification play. We are not going to go all out on digital assets,” he said, adding that CDPQ would not consider allocating funds directly into digital assets. “Bitcoin? No, absolutely not,” he said. The backing from big investors comes a month after Celsius was drawn into a broad US regulatory crackdown on crypto companies that offer customers yields on deposits of digital assets. State authorities in Texas, New Jersey, Alabama and Kentucky said Celsius’ yield-bearing accounts amounted to an unregistered securities offering. Celsius, founded in 2017, offers its customers interest of as much as 17 per cent on deposits of cryptocurrencies. The company pays the interest in crypto, including in its own token.

Synnett said CDPQ had carefully considered the regulatory pressure as part of its due diligence, but that the scrutiny on Celsius reflected broader uncertainty surrounding the crypto industry. “We are all aligned with our partners in our willingness to work collaboratively with regulators, including in the US,” he added. “We want to be the good guys.” ,,Joshua Oliver Kadhim Shubber,2021-10-13T16:08:35.079Z,

New York-based ConsenSys develops and invests in projects built on the ethereum distributed ledger, a rival to bitcoin that can be used to create financial services apps and other automated software programmes. ConsenSys announced in April it had raised $65m from JPMorgan, Mastercard, UBS and other investors, in what the company called a “formation round”. It declined to comment on the fundraising. The financing would mark an important milestone for the seven-year-old company led by ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, who has weathered several public missteps in his attempts to capitalise on blockchain technology. Lubin has made staff cuts of more than 10 per cent at least twice, and ConsenSys restructured last year to split off its investment arm into a separate entity. Investors have poured money into digital assets this year as the soaring price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies attract developers and new users to the fast-growing but risky sector. Venture capitalists have invested $20.7bn in cryptocurrency start-ups so far this year, according to PitchBook data, an increase of more than 160 per cent from the previous record in 2018. Recommended Lubin has mostly self-funded ConsenSys with his personal holdings of ether, the digital asset associated with ethereum. MetaMask, an app developed by ConsenSys that is a popular gateway to decentralised finance programs, has grown rapidly as more people experiment with cryptocurrencies. Since October 2020, MetaMask has facilitated more than $8.9bn of trading through a feature that allows users to swap pairs of digital tokens, according to data on the cryptocurrency analysis site Dune Analytics. MetaMask takes a 0.875 per cent fee on each trade, translating to more than $78m in revenues during the same period. ConsenSys has projected that annualised revenues from MetaMask could increase to $1bn within the next year, said one person briefed on the numbers. MetaMask has more than 10m monthly users, the company said last month. Several other start-ups that develop apps on ethereum have recently attracted large valuations from venture capitalists. The development team behind the popular cryptocurrency-based video game Axie Infinity on Tuesday said it had raised $152m of funding led by Andreessen Horowitz, valuing the company at $3bn. Ether has gained more than 920 per cent in the past year, compared with a more than 400 per cent rise in the price of bitcoin.

https://www.ft.com/content/9c5a831f-4c3a-457f-b36e-950ba3a23b80,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,How London became a crypto-art capital,Its money, talent and tech have enabled blockchain think-tanks and galleries selling NFTs to flourish,One of the more creative disruptions accelerated by the pandemic has been the explosion of interest in crypto art, or art turned into tokens on the blockchain, both as an asset class and as a global cultural trend. The former can be put down to the boom in cryptocurrencies, the latter to a year’s worth of solitary confinement making the digital frame almost our default experience of images. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are the digital collectibles which have resulted from this shift; they can be linked to art, tickets and other real-world assets. Even though this world is digital, geography does still matter — and London has been at the forefront. Its role is less as a site of exchange — the majority of NFT marketplaces are hosted from New York or Silicon Valley — than as an engine of cultural creation, validation and innovation, alongside cities such as Berlin. Despite the recent exodus of labour across the wider economy, London still benefits from the wealth, global connections and absence of oppressive institutions that have fuelled its contemporary art, tech and media scenes since the 1990s. Robert Alice, an artist and curator based in London, collaborated with Sotheby’s last June on “Natively Digital”, an auction of NFTs that combined “old masters” of the scene such as Simon Denny and Anna Ridler with emerging crypto artists such as Fvckrender and Mad Dog Jones. For Alice, “London has long had support and curatorial interest in institutional and grassroots digital arts programmes such as Arebyte, the Barbican and 180 The Strand. These spaces, plus the increasing presence of mainstream crypto companies in London, have led to a diverse presence of artists, collectors and technologists that places London at the forefront of crypto art.” Invention is thriving in the shadow of necessity, says Rebecca Edwards, curator at Arebyte, a gallery which works with immersive or multimedia installations in physical and digital spaces. It is growing, she says, “in part because of recent cuts to art and culture in general. Artists are turning to alternative ways to fund, sell and make art and this undoubtedly includes cryptocurrency, NFTs and the blockchain.” For Arebyte’s founder, Nimrod Vardi, it is precisely London’s inchoate tech-art landscape “that gives space for smaller organisations that are more fluid and quick to respond”. The city has so far relied on an eclectic mix of early adopters from all across town: from Annka Kultys Gallery in east London to Gazelli Art House in Mayfair to Furtherfield in the north of the city. The Decentralised Arts Lab (Decal), run by Furtherfield, epitomises the success of leaner, community-facing organisations in championing the blockchain as a more progressive ecosystem. Its director, Ruth Catlow, thinks Furtherfield has paved the way for critical and creative experimentation with network technologies through its 2017 publication, Artists Re:Thinking the Blockchain, and its DAOWO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation with Others) initiative, which “seeks to produce a commons for arts in the network age”. Catlow says: “This is then turbocharged by London’s status as a financial centre and its rich connections with the artistic, technical and activist communities of the Berlin scene.” For Bernadine Bröcker Wieder, whose company Vastari co-organised inaugural Christie’s Art+Tech Summit in 2018, developments are still largely limited to the private sector. “While the Serpentine’s R&D Platform has been doing very important thought leadership,” she says, “traditional museum institutions have not been particularly active in the crypto art conversation.” That has, however, started to change, with the British Museum now selling NFTs of more than 200 works by Japanese artist Hokusai to coincide with its new exhibition Hokusai: The Great Picture Book of Everything. London’s galleries and auction houses have also been quick off the mark. Christie’s is currently offering five works by Nigerian artist Osinachi as part of a collaboration with the 1-54 contemporary African art fair, and gallery Unit London has just launched Institut as “the first art-world-led NFT . . . platform”, aiming to bridge the divide between crypto art and the “legacy” market. Its inaugural exhibition, NFTism: No Fear in Trying, curated by Kenny Schachter, was hosted across Unit’s Covent Garden space and in the virtual world of the “metaverse”, featuring works by Seth Armstrong, Yuma Yanagisawa and IX Shells, the highest-selling female NFT artist. For Unit’s co-founder Joe Kennedy, “bringing works into the physical space of the gallery is key to demystifying NFTs and moving the conversation from sales and commerce to the art form itself.” Sales of NFTs assuage the art world’s traditional problems of provenance, ownership and record-keeping. Verisart is the first company to certify art and collectibles on the blockchain, recognising the importance of reliable provenance and a transparent record of ownership to the NFT as a tradeable commodity. Its co-founder and chief executive, Robert Norton, formerly of Saatchi Art, sees London thriving as a cultural capital: “London is well positioned to capitalise on the NFT zeitgeist, both through venture capital and the kinds of cross-collaboration between art and tech, fashion and music that are so central to driving interest in NFTs.” Whether Institut, Verisart and others can bring down the firewall preserving the old art-world order is unclear. What is not in doubt is the growing drive towards digital collectibles in an age of dwindling physical resources.

https://www.ft.com/content/2aa6e4d4-f261-4f42-a588-ad529fc4c8ab,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,‘Fat finger’ $24m charge exposes fragility in crypto market,Erroneous fee is refunded, in proof to DeFi proponents of shared community values,A small crypto asset trading platform called DeversiFi received a shock last week when it erroneously paid out a $24m fee. A glitch in some little-tested software code left the London-based exchange wearing the charge when a user made an unremarkable $100,000 deposit. On the blockchain, transactions are instantaneous, irreversible and anonymous. Market participants have no recourse to a deposit scheme or regulator to try to recoup funds. This incident highlights the vulnerabilities that implies. But within days, the recipient paid it all back. To true believers in the emerging arena of decentralised finance - or DeFi - the return of the fee shows a generous ethos a world away from Wall Street and the City. “In the decentralised finance space there is a real desire across teams and communities to build and co-operate for mutual benefit,” said Will Harborne, chief executive of DeversiFi. “But having survived Monday I wouldn’t personally recommend to anyone else that they rely on the goodwill of strangers on the internet to return their $24m. “If we had not been able to recover the funds [that] would have presented a major challenge for us as a company,” he added. Numerical flubs and human errors -- collectively known as ‘fat fingers’ -- are a fact of life in all areas of old and new finance. In traditional markets, some errors are reversed over a handshake; some are not. Infamous past examples include the transaction that wiped 80 per cent off the value of conglomerate Jardine Matheson in Singapore in 2019. Deutsche Bank once wired $6bn to a hedge fund client by mistake. More recently, Citigroup sent $900m of its own money to creditors of cosmetics group Revlon. DeversiFi’s faulty bill shows crypto, where “code is law”, is equally vulnerable to costly slip-ups that have no formal resolution mechanism. “Right now, most of the users of DeFi are true believers in the technology and its potential, and so confidence may persist regardless of these events,” said Hilary Allen, professor of law at the American University Washington College of Law. “But if DeFi is more broadly adopted by people less committed to the technology, confidence will become more vulnerable - and the potential for panics that can come with damaged confidence should give us pause,” she added. Harborne’s company acts as a network for buyers and sellers to trade digital tokens automatically without going through a centralised exchange. It aims to skip intermediaries like banks and exchanges and also perform checks and reconciliation on transactions. Transferring deposits generates a fee, known in industry jargon as a “gas fee”, because users must compensate miners for the amount of computing energy they need to verify a transaction on blockchain. But this particular transaction, through a wallet controlled by exchange Bitfinex, generated gas fees of $23.7m, six orders of magnitude larger than intended. The only option was to persuade the miner to pay it back. In its analysis of the incident, DeversiFi disclosed that it could see, through the blockchain, that the recipient was one of the top 10 miners of the cryptocurrency ethereum and had periodically deposited Ether tokens at another exchange, Binance. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click “This led us to hope that although they were anonymous they might have significant holdings and not be tempted to keep the funds of someone who had been the victim of extreme misfortune,” said Harborne. DeversiFi said it contacted Binance, which it said passed on the platform’s email addresses to the miner. Within hours the money was on its way back to DeversiFi. Tim Swanson, founder of technology advisory firm Post Oak Labs, said the refund suggests miners are generally inclined to help with rebates. “Miners want to be perceived as good actors so they can earn more on other investments,” he said. That ethos may not endure. Allen pointed out that the consequences for losing money are much greater. “This is why finance is so highly regulated. At a minimum, regulatory structures that require developers to test for bugs in their DeFi applications are needed.” Without a safeguard, a polite request is one of the few options available. Compound, another DeFi project, said on Friday that it had accidentally handed tokens worth $90m to its users. With the assets gone and without the option to track down a single miner, its owner publicly threatened to report the new owners to the US tax authorities, before realising the shortcomings of the plan. “This was a bone-headed approach,” chief executive Robert Leshner tweeted. “That’s on me . . . I appreciate your ridicule and support.” Letter in response to this article: Fat finger caper exposes blockchain’s vulnerability / From Niccolo Caldararo, Department of Anthropology, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, CA, US ,,Philip Stafford,2021-10-03T04:00:09.569Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/b1ff8c39-a047-46ac-8df1-650265842c63,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Will the next web be built on ethereum?,Developers are flocking to the platform’s blockchain but nimbler rivals are emerging,Is ethereum the future of the internet? Interest in the ethereum blockchain has soared over the past year, as developers have turned to it to create a wave of decentralised finance projects, known as DeFi, and unique digital tokens called NFTs. The rise of new applications like these — among the first running on a public blockchain — have already created what supporters claim is a powerful network effect, as increasing activity brings more and more developers to ethereum. That could make it the platform of choice for what has become known as Web 3.0, where a series of decentralised apps could one day challenge Big Tech’s offerings. “Sixty to 70 per cent of the industry runs on ethereum. It’s very sticky,” said Sandeep Nailwal, co-founder of Polygon, one of a growing number of companies that operate on top of ethereum. As a result, the price of ethereum’s currency, known as ether or eth, which is used to pay for the computing power needed to run the blockchain, has jumped ninefold. At around $350bn, the outstanding tokens on ethereum are now worth more than 40 per cent as much as all the bitcoin in issue, more than double the proportion of a year ago. But there remain fundamental questions over whether ethereum, which is heavily behind schedule with a complex set of technical upgrades, will be able to compete with nimbler rivals, and whether any consensus will emerge on its long-term role as the crypto world evolves. “There isn’t a shared narrative in the ethereum ecosystem,” said Avichal Garg at Electric Capital, an investment firm in San Francisco. “Is it a commodity like oil, digital gold, a better bitcoin?” Until the investment world decides on an answer, the price of ethereum’s tokens, is likely to be volatile, he and others warned. The rally in the price of eth has been powered by two hopes. One is that ethereum has entered a new phase in which the number of tokens in circulation will grow far more slowly than it has in the past, or even shrink. For financial speculators, that has raised the possibility that its tokens will become more like bitcoin. The supply of tokens has already been reduced following a change last month to the way transactions are validated on the network. Some of the eth tokens that were previously paid in fees to miners who validate transactions are now destroyed, or “burnt”. Another big step could come late this year or early next, when the blockchain is due to move away from its current “proof of work” system, which relies on miners committing their computing power to the network in exchange for rewards. Instead, it will be based on “proof of stake”, in which validators participate by lodging some of their eth holdings. Along with the environmental benefits that come from cutting processing demands, the move has big monetary implications. A proof of stake chain was launched to run in parallel late last year. Some 6 per cent of the supply of eth has already been lodged there by holders to back transactions, earning holders an annual return of up to 5 per cent — an early sign, according to the bulls, of how much eth will be taken out of circulation once the full transition is completed. Until now, eth has been viewed as the crypto equivalent of oil, said Ninos Mansor at Arrington XRP Capital, a crypto investment firm — a commodity that is consumed to fuel the digital economy but where there is no cap on supply. But a big reduction in supply of the tokens could change that, making it more attractive to investors interested in a deflationary asset, he added. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click Unlike bitcoin, however, ethereum was not founded on a clear monetary vision or with an upper ceiling to the number of tokens that can be created. Vitalik Buterin, ethereum’s founder and lead evangelist, has said only that it will adapt to whatever needs its users have for it. That has left open the possibility of further changes in how tokens are created, and hence the long-term supply of eth, said Mansor. The second hope behind this year’s price spike is that ethereum will be a core part of the infrastructure because of its “smart contracts” function, software code that automatically executes when certain conditions are met and which enables peer-to-peer decentralised finance projects, for example. Yet the network’s capacity is severely limited, and a series of proposals to relieve the pressure is years behind schedule. The network’s maximum capacity of only around 15 transactions per second has meant that, at busy times, the so-called “gas” fees to use it have been bid up to high levels, squeezing out all but the most high-value transactions. That is one reason that financial applications have come to play a much bigger role on the network this year, according to Buterin. Meanwhile, newer blockchains with greater processing capacity, including Avalanche, Solana and Cardano, have sprung up. “What you’re seeing globally is a rush to scale — and there aren’t that many that are scalable,” said Emin Gün Sirer, founder of Avalanche, which last week disclosed that it had raised $230m through a recent sale of tokens. The new blockchains have been heavily backed but are yet to prove themselves. The price of tokens on the Solana blockchain has more than quadrupled since the start of August as it has become the platform for the sale of new collections of NFTs such as the Degenerate Ape Academy. But a technical failure earlier this month meant the network suffered a 17-hour outage. While ethereum’s limitations have provided an opening for newer blockchains, the network’s supporters claim its early lead in smart contracts will be unassailable. Recommended The hopes rest heavily on the large number of developers who are already creating applications using its technology. Solidity, the blockchain’s programming language, has become as much a part of life for crypto developers as javascript is among web developers, said Nailwal, the co-founder of Polygon. To attract more developers, most of the new blockchains let them run their applications in “ethereum virtual machines”, creating bridges back to the ethereum blockchain and maintaining the demand for eth to secure transactions in their applications. Other mechanisms that are starting to bring relief from the transaction processing bottleneck include so-called “layer two” networks like Polygon. These run on top of ethereum and take some of the strain, for instance acting as aggregators that process transactions on their own networks before batching them up and lodging them on the ethereum blockchain in a single transaction. According to supporters, today’s layer two networks contain the seeds of a wider technology industry that is starting to take shape, with ethereum at its heart. “We believe it will be a multi-chain world — but on ethereum,” said Nailwal. “There should eventually be space for all applications,” said Dan Finlay at Metamask, which offers wallets on ethereum and claims more than 10m users. But he added: “We’re still at a stage where a lot of scaling strategies are being tried at once. I don’t think any of them has been validated yet.” Ethereum itself, meanwhile, has embarked on a series of changes to its own network. The planned shift to proof of stake has become the biggest technical hurdle but is only one step in a series that could take years to play out. #techFT brings you news, comment and analysis on the big companies, technologies and issues shaping this fastest moving of sectors from specialists based around the world.

Another involves “sharding” the network — splintering it into 64 separate but linked ledgers, reducing the strain on each node in the network by no longer requiring it to validate every transaction. Buterin says he is also working on other changes to the underlying protocol to reduce the load on nodes, and says he is optimistic that within two years some of these initiatives will have greatly increased capacity. “The success of the currency will rely on ethereum opening up more,” said Jack O’Holleran, CEO of Skale, a network that operates on top of ethereum. “It will become the global settlement layer” for decentralised applications of all kinds, he and others predict. But with ethereum’s long-term role still a matter of debate, investors like Garg warn, the cryptocurrency markets could be overdue for a reversal that will see bitcoin vault back to unquestioned dominance. ,,Richard Waters,2021-10-01T04:00:09.885Z,

From the press release: Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), the No. 1 U.S. retailer and world’s largest grocer, is pleased to announce a major partnership with Litecoin. The eCommerce giant intends to give its millions of shoppers across the world an opportunity to seamlessly make payments with cryptocurrencies. Bullish for Litecoin right? Well, we’re not quite sure. First, because the press release has not appeared on either Walmart’s website, nor in the form of an 8-K on its SEC page. Second, because the email address given to contact Walmart’s chief marketing officer, William White, has a domain of www.walmart-corp.com which, if you visit it, doesn’t seem to belong to the big box retailer. Chuck that URL into registration data site ICANN, and you’ll also see the site was created on August 17. Then, of course, there’s the fact that Mr White’s email address does not appear at the bottom of any of Walmart’s most recent press releases. Still, it could be true. Walmart might have had a communication breakdown with the good folks at Litecoin Foundation, and forgot to co-ordinate on press release timings. So we called Walmart but its automated answering machine only directed us to its journalist contact page. Which, of course, we filled out. We’ll update the story either way if we hear back.

The deal will allow Mastercard to “differentiate its card and real-time payments infrastructure” by helping its customers to comply with regulations as they increasingly “build their own virtual asset offerings”, the company said on Thursday. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. The ability to hold most cryptocurrencies anonymously has made them attractive to criminals that are looking to launder dirty funds. However, every transaction is typically recorded on an immutable blockchain, leaving a visible trail for researchers. CipherTrace is one of an increasing number of crypto forensics start-ups that use sophisticated technology coupled with human intelligence to analyse blockchain transactions, helping companies and law enforcement monitor suspicious activity and map out the crypto-criminal ecosystem. The deal comes after Mastercard announced in February that it would start supporting selected cryptocurrencies directly on its network this year, following in the footsteps of fintech rivals PayPal and Square. Meanwhile, US regulators are increasingly circling the growing but loosely regulated industry. “Digital assets have the potential to reimagine commerce, from everyday acts like paying and getting paid to transforming economies, making them more inclusive and efficient,” said Ajay Bhalla, president of cyber and intelligence at Mastercard.

According to its website, it has 150 customers, including banks, cryptocurrency exchanges, agencies and regulators.

https://www.ft.com/content/949ee788-6630-4aac-9c4d-b6b0a45f4e25,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,How Joseph Lubin became Wall Street’s crypto whisperer,Gillian Tett meets ethereum’s co-founder, an increasingly powerful influence over the future of digital money,In the summer of 2016, a group of central bankers from the American Federal Reserve left their Wall Street branch office, crossed the East River and headed to Bushwick. Their destination was a graffiti-covered warehouse on Bogart Street, home to a small company called ConsenSys. Joseph “Joe” Lubin, a Canadian programmer in his mid-fifties and founder of the financial software-maker, waited as they walked down the street to a scrappy front door festooned in stickers. The besuited bankers looked out of place in Brooklyn. Lubin wondered if ConsenSys should be worried about them. The Fed officials were there to fact-find. ConsenSys was quickly becoming influential in the world of cryptocurrency, and Lubin was turning his company into the world’s first crypto conglomerate, a network of for-profit projects tied into bitcoin’s biggest rival, ethereum. As such, Lubin was not only an expert in blockchain technology — the databases underlying nearly all cryptocurrencies — but also an ardent proponent of decentralised finance. David Mills, an economist in the Fed group, had plenty of questions for the ConsenSys team. Who could access these new financial platforms? How susceptible were they to hacking? What, if any, was the role of central banks in a financial world like the one crypto’s boosters imagined? “It was a very warm, thoughtful conversation,” Lubin recalls, even though he tried to explain that “the reality you all know and operate in is going to be totally turned on its head in a few years”. The real topic of discussion was trust. The Fed and all central banks are the avatars of trust the world has been accustomed to for the past few centuries: people have faith in the financial system because these large, seemingly competent institutions appear to be in charge. Cryptocurrency proponents such as Lubin offer a different avatar: they want people to have faith in a financial system essentially guaranteed by computer code that normal people can inspect. “It’s a whole new foundation of trust for the world,” says Lubin. “And a new way to organise ourselves.” In the five years since the Bogart Street meeting, financial elites who once sneered at the idea of crypto have come around. The New York Fed, for example, is about to unveil a new cryptocurrency research hub, bringing some of the ideas being championed by ConsenSys into its orbit. The Boston Fed has been studying the viability of building a digital version of the US dollar, the world’s most important reserve currency. A host of central banks, particularly in Asia, are investigating similar ideas. And financial titans such as JPMorgan have created digital money of their own. Wall Street is starting to dance with Brooklyn. If you met him casually, you might not guess that Lubin has been pivotal in this change. For one, he prefers to listen, not talk. And when he does speak, his intonation rises at the end of each sentence, making him sound oddly self-deprecating. (The exception is when he starts to discuss ethereum, which analysts estimate will host some $8tn worth of transactions this year.) Until he hit his early fifties, there was little in his career to suggest he was about to play a crucial role in answering the most important economic question of this century: does crypto represent a revolution for global finance or merely a natural evolution? Somewhere along the way, Lubin became a go-to guy for crypto-curious central bankers, not to mention a putative billionaire on paper. (In 2018, Forbes named him the second-richest person in crypto, worth an estimated $1bn-$5bn.) All of which means this mild-mannered Canadian with the no-flash profile increasingly holds sway over the staging area for the future of money. Lubin was born in 1964 in Toronto to a dentist father and property agent mother. As a teenager, his main passions were squash and maths, a combination that helped him get into Princeton, where he studied engineering and computer science. He forged a tight-knit group of friends, including Michael Novogratz, now a billionaire hedge-funder. “Joe was one of the brightest among us, a forward thinker, but by 45 hadn’t done anything to stand out,” recalls Novogratz. “I don’t think any of our gang would have guessed how things would turn out.” After graduating, Lubin got a job managing the Princeton robotics lab, where he became fascinated by artificial intelligence. As a software and AI consultant, he worked for two computer companies in New York, before landing a job at Goldman Sachs, where he stayed for almost two years. “I was never really a Wall Street person. I was a software person,” he says. His growing disillusionment was catalysed during the 2008 financial crisis when, as he once told a ConsenSys summit, he realised “it was folly to trust all those structures that we implicitly felt had our best interests at heart. I felt we were living in a global society and economy that was figuratively, literally and morally bankrupt.” He was convinced “a slow, cascading collapse” was taking place. Lubin briefly toyed with the idea of moving to Latin America to build a survivalist bolt hole. Instead in 2012, he moved to Jamaica with a girlfriend who was trying to forge a career in dancehall music. For a couple of years he dabbled in music production, while also investing in bitcoin as a hedge against the collapse in traditional currencies he expected to see. In late 2013, Lubin travelled to Toronto to visit his parents over the holidays. On New Year’s Day he headed to a meet-up for bitcoin devotees at a downtown warehouse and met a teenager named Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, now 27, is a legendary figure among crypto enthusiasts; his persona is the basis for the creation myth that binds the ethereum tribe. A Russian-born wunderkind who emigrated to Canada as a child, Buterin grew up in Toronto and became so obsessed with bitcoin as a teenager that he dropped out of college and lived in anarchic computer coding communities in Spain and Israel. Then, in late 2013, aged 19, he wrote a white paper proposing ethereum and subsequently rallied eight software enthusiasts from around the world to build it. (For the differences between ethereum and bitcoin, see the panel below.) Lubin and Buterin only talked for a few minutes the day they met. “But he told me about his paper, and I read it that night and was blown away,” Lubin says. So much so, he joined the band of geeks Buterin recently compared to Tolkien’s “fellowship of the ring” who were working to turn his vision into reality. Over the next few months, they slummed together, student-style, in a series of shared houses in Miami, Toronto and Zug, Switzerland, creating the computer code that would underpin ethereum. Lubin always seemed an odd addition to the group. He was old; many of the others were in their twenties. Then there was his background at Goldman Sachs, as if Gandalf had shown up on the road to Mordor wearing a three-piece suit. “The people who are attracted to, and influential in, paradigm shifts tend to be out-of-the-box thinkers and on the fringes of society,” Lubin says, recalling the free-wheeling mood in the hackers’ houses. “I am an out-of-the-box thinker too, but I can speak different languages” — including that of Wall Street. Many in the group had a strongly anti-establishment bent. There was endless tension between a camp that wanted to run ethereum as a commercial, for-profit venture and those who wanted to make it a mission-driven non-profit instead. Buterin was among the latter, but Lubin wanted to build a business. So did Charles Hoskinson, the first CEO, who was eventually expelled from the group. Gavin Wood, the chief technologist, also left after repeated disputes. (Both Hoskinson and Wood now run ethereum rivals.) Lubin’s interests are not exactly aligned with Vitalik because he is more of a financial type pursuing commercial gains,” observes Alexander Lipton, a finance and maths professor, who recently published a book on blockchain. “Vitalik is a visionary and is pursuing the common good.” Lubin survived the feuds and forged a close bond with Buterin. The middle-aged man respected the “genius” of the teenager’s vision. He “really doesn’t care about material things at all”, says Lubin. “It’s about wanting to change the world.” Buterin, in turn, seems to have valued getting some seasoned counsel on politics and high finance. Presciently, Lubin insisted the ethereum team consult with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at an early stage, and that it hire high-priced lawyers from the Manhattan firm Pryor Cashman to minimise legal risks. “Joe is in the background,” says Novogratz, “but he is as important as Vitalik.” That was Lubin’s other advantage in the run-up to ethereum’s launch: his ability to slide into the background and remain level-headed when personal vendettas exploded. “With Joe, you never actually know more than 5 per cent of what he is thinking,” says Hoskinson. Or, as Lubin observes, “I am not reactive in the way that most humans are. It’s just how I am wired.” He also describes himself as “meta”, referring to an idea promoted by lifestyle guru Deepak Chopra. (In Greek, meta means “beyond”.) “You can take yourself out of the drama of reference and not react instantly and emotionally to things,” Lubin says. “So when other people are reactively bouncing off each other, I have a different perspective.” Meta-ness seems to shape not just Lubin’s dealings with colleagues, but his vision of how cryptocurrency could eventually remake finance and business. In the summer of 2015, Buterin finally launched ethereum via a non-profit foundation. Lubin was at his side, but he had worked out a way to pursue his commercial dream too. His company ConsenSys was a for-profit venture offering the infrastructure to make the products and services around ethereum work. These days, he describes ConsenSys as “just a software company”. Mere “software” is not something the SEC normally regulates. That modest label conceals a bigger ambition. As the concept of crypto has gone from marginal to mainstream, the money-making proposition has shifted. To make an imperfect analogy, once it became clear in the 1990s that the internet was a useful way of storing information, the business contest quickly became a fight between companies trying to help people easily find stuff online. In some sense, ethereum is trying to be to blockchain what Google has been to the internet: a service provider that creates order in a digital mess. But the early years of both ethereum and ConsenSys were rocky. Shortly after the platform launched, a hacker tried to steal about $60m worth of ethereum’s digital currency, ether. “The attacks were perpetuated with someone with a deep understanding and were designed to catch us off guard,” says Lubin. The hack failed. But the saga, coupled with fundraising controversies in 2017 and 2018 at ventures launched using ethereum, caused ether’s value to wobble. Lubin had to let go of about a tenth of the people he had hired to work at ConsenSys when the price was soaring. By late 2018, a Forbes article declared that “Lubin’s ethereum experiment is a mess” with “cryptopia in crisis” and asked how long the venture, largely funded by Lubin’s vast stock of ether, could survive. Lubin insists that ConsenSys was “almost intentionally decentralised”. It aims to seed and launch numerous ethereum projects, not control them all itself. This approach also created a sandbox in which mainstream companies could dabble in the hot new technology without much risk. Santander, the Spanish bank, started testing ethereum for payments. BHP Billiton experimented with it as a means of tracking mineral supply chains. John Hancock, the US investment company, explored creating a vaccine register. Then there was JPMorgan. Since 2016, it had been running two rival experiments, building a proprietary version of a blockchain system, while working with ConsenSys to import ethereum technology into its operations. “We wanted to test all the different scenarios, to see which would work,” says Umar Farooq, head of the so-called Onyx project at JPMorgan. The bank eventually settled on the ethereum system, and went on to work with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Temasek and the Singaporean bank DBS to create digital money. “We decided that the easiest way for us, as a central bank, to understand this new technology is to get involved in building a system ourselves,” says Sopnendu Mohanty, a senior MAS official. Lubin says Beijing’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, has also been in contact with ConsenSys. This behind-the-scenes activity was a striking twist, especially for long-time crypto boosters. When the mysterious person or group of people calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto first described their vision for bitcoin in a 2008 white paper, the rallying cry was that it should remove all the middlemen and gatekeepers who control global business and finance, allowing everyone to participate in the financial system on an equal footing. That, incidentally, was also the young Buterin’s mantra for ethereum. The idea of an open-to-all system is referred to as “permissionless” — a computing term meaning roughly that anyone can inspect or add code without permission from an authority figure. As institutions such as JPMorgan started to dive in, permissionless systems proved to have a few big problems. For one, the larger they are, the slower they tend to operate, since each new transaction recorded on the network requires computers to synchronise their records with each other. The more people involved in a platform, the greater the risk of hacks and leaks. And while such systems are supposed to build trust through transparency, since anyone can check everyone else’s records, this flies in the face of how banks have historically operated: their clients usually want to keep their finances secret. Last year, JPMorgan sold off its first, relatively open version of blockchain, called Quorum, to ConsenSys for an undisclosed amount and set about building a private system that would only be open to select clients, a quasi-crypto club. On paper, that seems like a betrayal of the whole blockchain ideal. But Lubin and Buterin admit that until a technological breakthrough occurs that can make permissionless systems run faster, private chains are a more practical solution for companies. Indeed, these days many blockchains are so-called private chains or permissioned chains. Users’ trust in the system tends to derive as much from the organiser behind that chain — a brand name such as JPMorgan, say — as the computing code itself or the theory of decentralised finance. So, too, with the central bank experiments. “Distributed finance is not really DeFi [decentralised finance] today,” says Hoskinson. “It’s actually quite centralised.” Another way to put that is that the old avatars of trust, namely large central institutions, remain important. Lubin argues that, in history, “We see these moments of revelation, when someone brings the tablets down the mountain and there is something profound and beautiful there. Then everyone starts to bicker about what the correct interpretation is, and we are in that moment now.” Rhetoric has collided with reality. “We were always really interested in this convergence strategy where revolutionaries build out this infrastructure and then meet the evolutionaries in their comfort zone,” he says. He thinks these private blockchains will eventually be interlinked. “We have always been pragmatic,” Lubin notes. Not to mention commercial. In the late summer, I found myself staying a few miles away from Lubin out on Long Island. So on a glorious sunny day, as we paced down a vast sandy beach, I quizzed him about where crypto is headed next. In many ways, the future seemed almost as bright as the summer skies: activity in ethereum is exploding. Last year ConsenSys restructured itself with $65m investment from JPMorgan, UBS and Mastercard, and is now engaged in a proliferating set of projects with financial institutions and central banks. It is developing new tests with non-financial companies too. Artists such as Damien Hirst are starting to use the platform to sell unique, time-stamped digital creations. Hollywood is looking into doing the same. “We are making a lot of money,” says Lubin, which is impossible to verify in detail, since ConsenSys is private. Nor would you know it from his scruffy jeans and T-shirts. Lubin shuns the glitzy toys of most Wall Street financiers and says that, on the rare occasions when he is not working, he hangs out with his fashion-designer girlfriend, cooking and engaging in simple pleasures such as caring for their pet tortoises. He doesn’t even own a car. “People like me have lots of houses,” says Novogratz. “Joe doesn’t do any of that.” Lubin says, by way of explanation, that he “never did ethereum or anything in my life for money” but because “I had an opportunity to build something profound that I think will transform life on the planet for a pretty long time”. Maybe. He also knows that the vision that drives him and Buterin is still in its infancy, and the sands could shift again. For one thing, regulators are increasing their scrutiny. For another, ethereum still faces unresolved technical challenges limiting how many transactions it can process at speed. Proponents argue this will be resolved when an important technological upgrade takes place early next year (the move from a “proof of work” system to “proof of stake”, which is far less energy-intensive). But the maths professor Lipton retorts that it will be hard to “fix” ethereum. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click “Ethereum [introduced] this brilliant idea of smart contracts. But I don’t think that ethereum is the last word in this,” Lipton says. “Other [blockchain] systems, like Cardano and Polkadot, use more advanced payment systems, are cheaper and they are going to win.” Cardano and Polkadot are rival platforms launched by Hoskinson and Wood, former members of Buterin’s “fellowship”. Lubin insists he is unruffled by his colleagues-turned-rivals or the doubts about ethereum’s long-term viability. “When people say ethereum won’t scale, that is pretty naive. You should never say that about technologies,” he says, arguing that history shows that people always overestimate how quickly new innovations will catch on and underestimate the scale and speed of disruption that can occur when those ideas are finally embraced. “Just look at the internet,” Lubin continues. “A few decades ago, nobody could imagine that. But it scaled to support all the economically viable use cases. Blockchain will do the same thing.” As I listen to him speak, part of me remains sceptical. No matter how much I read about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, something always remains opaque. Possibly sensing my doubt, Lubin asks, “Why am I doing this, rather than just hanging out in nightclubs? We are building a new organising principle for the planet and a new foundation of trust. Don’t you think it would be a good thing for humanity?” I wonder. Then I remember how many central bankers seem to think Lubin is on to something. Launched in 2009, bitcoin promised a form of online currency secured without a central authority, as opposed to government-issued currencies. Over time, one of the innovations underlying bitcoin — the blockchain — appeared to be useful for other purposes. The blockchain is a database that stores information in a way that decentralises control. Ethereum uses blockchain technology not just for maintaining a payment network, but also for storing computer code that can be employed for financial applications such as contracts. Ether is the currency used by applications and contracts on the ethereum network. Although it was supposed to complement bitcoin, ethereum has become a competitor on cryptocurrency exchanges.

https://www.ft.com/content/39c5ef2b-c69c-4611-88f5-f5a7f611d8c8,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,NFTs transform the art market for young novice buyers,Digital tokens offer a way to buy and own shares in instantly recognisable works by bankable, international artists,There he stands in the middle of a Mayfair gallery, $90,000-worth of fine, milky marble chiselled into the shape of a male torso: headless, fig-leaved and gloriously visible. His name is Kouros, but he could be a waiter in a West End café or a gym-obsessed banker over in the City of London, because large parts of his shoulders and back are obscured by an enormous, psychedelic tattoo. “Kouros” is the work of Fabio Viale, an Italian sculptor who takes fine stone, chisels it into replicas of classical statues, then inks tattoos on their marble flesh. He has adorned the neck of Michelangelo’s “David” with wings, and the shoulders of the “Venus de Milo” with flowers. Viale’s work may not be to older collectors’ taste, but it has been exhibited at galleries and art fairs all over the world. “Viale really resonates with the millennial generation,” says Elio D’Anna, co-founder of Artcels, the online art investment platform behind the exhibition at Hofa Gallery. (After exhibiting in London in the spring “Kouros” travelled to the Greek island of Mykonos for another show.) Also at Hofa were a glossed-porcelain Jeff Koons “Balloon Rabbit”, a Yoshitomo Nara woodcut and relief prints by the cult African-American artist Nina Chanel Abney, along with a couple of works by Banksy — signed screen prints of “Girl with Balloon” and “Grin Reaper”. But this is not a conventional exhibition. On offer are not the works themselves but a chance to make money from art in a new way. It works like a traditional art fund, the difference being that proof of ownership is recorded on the blockchain. Artcels even launched its own Swiss-based cryptocurrency, Artem, last year to facilitate trades on its platform. An initial 320 shares in the fund — called Millennials — were released in April at a price of £1,000 each in the form of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. These are lines of code locked into the blockchain, an encrypted record of ownership; each token is unique to the share it represents. The fund gives wealthy young investors a way to buy and own shares in instantly recognisable works by bankable, international artists of their own generation — but using currencies and forms that older generations are unlikely to, and possibly do not trust or even understand. Critics of NFTs may distrust the novelty of the form and its intangible nature, but fans see NFTs as secure — in that they cannot be copied — and more easily tradeable than units in traditional art funds. Many young investors are using the fund to add art to their portfolios for the first time. “The gain is the diversification, buying into 12 artists with a strong following. And very high-value auction results,” says D’Anna. (According to Artnet, an art price database, the market for Banksy’s works have tripled in value since 2019.) “That’s the criteria. And it resonates strongly with a millennial culture, especially in Japan, China, America and London.” Investors stand to make money when the works are sold. London-based Artcels launched its first fund, XXI, in February 2020, selling all the shares immediately. More than 90 per cent of the artworks have since been sold, it says, with “a double-digit net return” paid to investors last February — net profits accrued are paid as dividends annually. The company has not yet published data on Millennials but says it has accepted offers in principle for more than half the 12 works. The value of the portfolio at Millennials’ first release was just over $1m, which the company describes as an “internal valuation” (an external valuation by Doerr Dallas was 23 per cent higher, the company says). A selling point of NFT funds is the reassurance they give to those investors who are prepared to trust blockchain in principle. Encrypted, and thus essentially indelible, they cannot themselves be lost, destroyed by fire or faked. It is still possible, of course, that the underlying artwork turns out to be fake — here the buyers must trust the gallery and its authenticators, as they must with conventional art funds. But if they are sure of the authentication, investors who trust bitcoin will have faith in the value of the NFT. In the wider art market, some NFTs are works of art that exist only in virtual form as digital files, with no underlying physical piece — for example, “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” by Beeple, aka digital artist Mike Winkelmann, which sold at Christie’s in March for nearly $70m. But Millennials is a hybrid: a physical collection backed by crypto security. Investors receive a certificate of ownership — a share certificate — in the form of an NFT, along with a paper copy and a printed catalogue. Millennials may be a modest fund in a global art market worth $50bn this year, according to Art Basel and UBS estimates, but it is playing a long game. It is targeting the next generation of rich collectors, many of whom will grow wealthier, collect more and become increasingly sophisticated in their artistic taste and knowledge. The value of the global art market shrank 22 per cent last year as fairs, live auctions and exhibitions were cancelled. But online sales reached a record high of more than $12bn, double the previous year’s total. Dealers of works worth $10m-plus more than tripled their proportion of online sales to 47 per cent. The explosion of interest in and value of cryptocurrencies during the pandemic, and the rise of NFT artworks in the past year, are set to change the market further. “That’s the whole concept of NFTs . . . seamlessly acquirable through technology, tapping into a broader audience, giving the young an opportunity to collect. It will sustain the art market for years to come,” says D’Anna. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click The art world will learn a lot from the rise of NFTs, with the power shifting to younger people and the blockchain improving transparency on ownership and boosting royalties for artists, says Sibylle Rochat, founder of Rochat Art Consultancy, who advises private and corporate clients on building and managing their collections. She says the art world’s gatekeepers — galleries, auction houses, advisers and dealers — are aware of the potential for NFTs to upend the art market and how wealthy young collectors will adapt to it. Only three of the 33 bidders for Beeple’s work, for example, were previously known to Christie’s, and 64 per cent were millennials or from Generation Z. In March, Justin Sun, a 31-year-old Chinese technology entrepreneur and founder of social media app Peiwo and cryptocurrency platform Tron, launched the Just NFT Fund, which is in the same mould as Millennials, though more valuable. Sun’s fund holds about $30m worth of works, including a 1932 painting by Picasso called “Femme nue couchée au collier (Marie-Thérèse)”, for which Sun paid $20m. Sun said on Twitter that he submitted a losing bid for the Beeple work. In a blog post, he said he estimated that half the world’s “top-notch artists and artworks” would be recorded as NFTs in the next decade. Jos van Basten, a 35-year-old Netherlands-based investor, says he bought into Millennials, not because of the blockchain features but because it offers a way into art collecting that bypasses an intimidating world. “I always thought I should diversify my portfolio and invest in art, but I never got to it,” says van Basten, an actuary. “Then last year, when Covid hit and markets dropped, I thought, OK, maybe now is the time. But I know nothing about art. A picture is either pretty or not, to me.” Van Basten paid for his shares in conventional currency. “I’m kind of an old millennial,” he says. “I’ve dipped my toe into the wider [cryptocurrency] market, but it’s quite volatile. Art seems to be a more stable investment.” Davide Uglietti, an Italian in his thirties living in Switzerland, is another “curious” investor. He has invested 5-10 per cent of his portfolio in art funds, including Millennials and the more traditional Masterworks, a US platform for buying and selling shares in a portfolio with more than $150m worth of paintings, including works by Mark Rothko and Keith Haring. Uglietti, a physicist, says he was initially cautious about investing in living artists — “you need 50 years, maybe more, to figure out who is outstanding” — but he decided to try. “Some I really didn’t like. But you do it because you like it or because you want the profit.” Crypto features, he says, do not interest him. Do purely digital artworks have a future? Rochat has seen a rise in interest in original memes and videos, the digitalised memories from key moments in popular culture, sold as NFTs among young art investors. “My clients want their collection to reflect the time they’ve been living in,” she says. “They ask me to buy one or two for their collection, not to speculate or be part of any bubble but just to reflect this time. They want to participate in a new language. What the art world has lacked for a long time is a new way of consuming collectibles.” Can wealthy investors of the millennial generation be persuaded to buy intangibles? Van Basten says he would not hesitate to buy digital artworks in the form of NFTs. “You can’t hang it on your wall, but it definitely has value. It’s not physical, but it’s still something someone made, a digital asset, which is definitely appealing.” When they are not on display in a gallery, Viale’s “Kouros” and the other works are stored in a vault deep beneath London. If investors want to admire a piece, they can make an appointment. Gazing at a physical portfolio may be reassuring, but the fact that the technology that backs that portfolio’s provenance is invisible does not make it meaningless. For wealthy young collectors new to the art world — and its rarefied institutions and opaque codes of taste and refinement — the intangible may represent the future.

https://www.ft.com/content/c318f7e3-8c00-45d4-87d6-ea5599d3769e,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Seasoned investors pile into the industry behind new currencies,Wealthy individuals see rich potential in the industry underpinning blockchain,Some benefits of investing in cryptocurrencies can be quite unexpected. For billionaire financier Mike Novogratz, it was the chance to give a speech about digital art at a prestigious auction house — and settle an old score. “I was thinking: if only my third-grade art teacher could see me now,” says the 56-year-old former money market trader. “She didn’t think I was very good and here I am, on stage at Christie’s giving a talk.” It may not be his biggest achievement, but it adds to the pleasure he says he is finding in his current venture, Galaxy Digital, a specialist cryptocurrency financial services and investment management company. For him, the excitement of the crypto boom stands comparison even with his greatest professional triumph: the 2007 flotation of Fortress, the first hedge fund to go public. “That was a heady time but, of course, we ran right into the [2008] financial crisis and learnt our lessons,” says Novogratz, referring to the losses that then hit hedge funds. “[Crypto] has been even more fun in a way . . . it’s a young people’s business and it’s almost impossible to keep up with the innovation right now.” Novogratz is one of scores of wealthy individuals who are investing not just in cryptocurrencies, but in the industry that underpins it — exchanges, asset management companies and technology providers. Mostly Americans, they often bring money to crypto that they have made in earlier ventures, along with experience that could help turn a chaotic explosion of activity into a sustainable financial sector. But while there are plenty of fans of the blockchain technology underpinning cryptocurrency issuance and trading, there are also many critics who question how such an unruly mass of new businesses can win over mainstream investors or regulators. Investors such as Novogratz could make the difference. Unlike many crypto investors, he has a solid financial background, having worked for a decade at Goldman Sachs before the swaggering years of Fortress. He first invested in bitcoin in 2012, ploughing in $7m when it was trading at $95. With global financial markets then in turmoil, especially in Europe, he saw bitcoin as an alternative currency and “a really interesting speculative bet”, he says. Three years later, he bought 500,000 ethereum for $0.99 each from the coin’s co-creator, Vitalik Buterin. Recommended The punt yielded big profits, spurring Novogratz to announce he would build what he called a Goldman Sachs for crypto markets. He launched Galaxy Digital in 2018, taking his inspiration for the name from the Star Wars films and putting his entire crypto portfolio, worth $302m, behind the company. The business now has more than $9bn of assets. Novogratz thinks the arguments for crypto now are even more compelling, with cheap money threatening the credibility of traditional finance. “What’s happening today in markets makes the quantitative easing of 2012 look like a drop in the bucket,” says Novo, as he is known in the markets. “The blockchain revolution has a purpose: we are going to rebuild the financial infrastructure and we are going after the rent-takers.” This is not a new idea. Fans have long claimed the technology could make payments free, provide solutions for the unbanked, make it easier for individuals to own their own data and end counterfeiting. Critics say blockchain, or distributed ledger, technology destroys the environment (because of the vast amount of electricity it consumes), is clunky and is a solution desperately looking for a problem. A decade ago, blockchain was synonymous with bitcoin. Today, new ledgers such as ethereum power new markets, including decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Meanwhile, Ouroboro units, a new type of blockchain technology, are faster, more efficient and more environmentally friendly than the original ledger behind blockchain. Like Novogratz, Wyoming-based Charles Hoskinson believes in blockchain’s transformative potential. A key individual in crypto, he is the joint inventor of the ethereum blockchain and of the Cardano blockchain platform, and chief executive of blockchain research organisation IOHK. “I don’t really get weekends — I’m always on a project,” says Hoskinson, 33, who studied analytic number theory at university. When he does have some free time, he hunts with eagles in Mongolia, goes on week-long fasts and says he is “a keen user of cryogenic chambers”. And he has played football with an elephant. Hoskinson, who last year spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos about blockchain’s potential to power social change, likens bitcoin to an early steam engine: something that proved hugely valuable but only as a starting point. “There are about half a dozen third-generation cryptocurrencies that do what bitcoin does and much more, but don’t consume [the same amount of] power,” he says. “This progress will allow blockchain to spread beyond finance and create real social change.” Blockchain technology is seeping into areas beyond finance, including new applications in art, property and collectibles in the form of NFTs. Stablecoins — special digital assets that link cryptocurrencies with central bank-backed money — have a market capitalisation of nearly $115bn, according to cryptocurrency data website CoinMarketCap. Even football fans buying tickets to the recent Euro 2020 tournament were using a system that relies on distributed ledger technology. But hurdles remain. Crypto’s rapid growth has caught the eyes of regulators, including those in China and the US, who are concerned about the amount of money that has flown into the volatile market. This has cooled the crypto trading frenzy that gripped investors in the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. The industry is at a crossroads, heading either for a bust or the emergence of clear proof that the technology is here to stay. “Right now, I can attract the best and brightest from all universities but, if something happens and it all goes quiet for four years, they won’t come to crypto,” Novogratz says. “The regulatory overhang is real, the pushback from China is real, and [these] will be a real test.” We need to be more grown-up about how we approach regulation because blockchain really is a better system Risks abound. Regulators, fearful of losing control, dislike private cryptocurrencies and efforts to turn traditional assets into blockchain-based tokens. Cryptocurrencies draw hordes of fraudsters: in 2020 alone, scams cost crypto investors $1.9bn, according to crypto analytics company CipherTrace. Gary B Gorton, a professor of finance at Yale School of Management, wrote in a research paper: “Based on lessons learned from history, we argue that privately produced monies are not an effective medium of exchange because they are not always accepted at par and are subject to runs.” But that does not deter committed investors such as William Quigley. Back in the 1990s, the 56-year-old billionaire helped create the marketplace for virtual assets in video games, where players buy extra game items. Today, the sector is worth $200bn annually. He co-founded IdeaLab Capital Partners, the first venture capital firm focused on internet start-ups, which backed payments group PayPal. In crypto, he is a co-founder of Tether, the world’s first stablecoin, and half of the duo that developed the first crypto derivatives. He is also chief executive of the Worldwide Asset eXchange, the largest NFT platform. These pieces of computer code can store video or other multimedia content and cannot be counterfeited. They allow artworks to be “tokenised”, or sliced into pieces, with the rights sold to hundreds of customers and traded in secondary markets. Quigley’s affinity to digital art started with a fortuitous link to an artist with the same name, William Quigley, who exhibited his work alongside that of Andy Warhol. The entrepreneur contacted the artist, they stayed in touch and recently collaborated on a pack of baseball-themed NFTs that sold out in minutes. However, many blockchain early adopters were not sold on NFTs. Quigley recalls giving a talk in 2017. “I remember presenting a slide and saying these pieces could go for $50,000 and someone in the audience said: who would pay $50,000 for something that is backed by nothing? So I had to remind them that’s true of the whole crypto world,” he says. I had a playbook for how the space was likely to evolve whereas others didn’t Today, NFTs are all the rage. In the first six months of the year, NFT sales amounted to $2.5bn, compared with less than $14m in the same period last year. In March, a crypto investor known as MetaKovan paid a record $69m for an NFT by digital artist Beeple. Quigley’s web investment background made him an ideal candidate for crypto, though initially a reluctant one because of losses suffered in the dotcom boom. “I had scar tissue as a venture capitalist when my friend told me about bitcoin [in 2010],” he says. But, a year later, despite his caution, Quigley felt there was a marketplace for virtual items. “I decided to focus fully on blockchain because it reminded me of 1994 when the first commercial web browser [Netscape Navigator] launched,” he says. “I had a playbook for how the space [was] likely to evolve whereas others didn’t.” Recommended Quigley says NFTs could wipe out counterfeiting — whether of banknotes, art or Disney teddy bears. “Consumer products with a token that acts as a digital twin will allow buyers to check whether it is original, how many were made and where it comes from instantaneously, which is difficult to do with a dollar note or an ounce of gold,” he says. Meanwhile, investors have been flocking this year to bet on transaction systems (financial, but in future for any sale process) where blockchain tech cuts out intermediaries and replaces them with preprogrammed algorithms. Interest in this kind of decentralised finance has exploded since January, with the overall market now worth $53bn, up from $15bn at the start of the year, according to specialist data and analytics company DeFi Pulse. Novogratz is among the backers of DeFi. Through Galaxy Digital, he is helping to finance Bullish Global, a trading platform for DeFi recently valued at $9bn in a finance deal. “The global financial crisis wouldn’t have happened if we had DeFi then, because it’s a completely transparent system,” says Novogratz. “It’s scaring regulators right now because it’s growing so fast, but I think that will get resolved in the next six to eight months.” Novogratz supports regulation. “I keep telling the DeFi guys: dudes, if you keep flicking the bird to the US government you’ll find out that the long arm of the US law is very scary,” he says. “We need to be more grown-up about how we approach regulation because blockchain really is a better system.” We term this the ‘great reset’, but what the heck does that mean? What are we actually going to do? But blockchain retains a strong anti-establishment flavour. “Ultimately, we believe [blockchain] technology is a government replacement system,” says Hoskinson, who argues that disillusionment with authority is widespread, as evidenced by Donald Trump’s success in becoming US president, the Black Lives Matter movement, Brexit and environmental protests. “We term this the ‘great reset’ and there is a global conversation right now, but what the heck does that mean? What are we actually going to do? It’s not good enough to be angry . . . you have to take a step back and say, what do we do? What’s the solution?” But before it can change the world, however, blockchain technology has a monumental challenge: to show it can secure acceptance and trust from a much wider range of people. And turn a profit for the investors ploughing their money into it.

The Pyth Network has persuaded companies such as Jump Trading, Virtu Financial, GTS, Hudson River Trading and DRW Cumberland to put aside their traditional rivalry and join forces to explore the potential of decentralised finance, or DeFi. The project, which only began in April, has also drawn in US stock exchanges IEX and MIAX Pearl, currency venue LMAX and crypto derivatives exchange FTX as its momentum grows. Pyth (rhymes with myth) seeks to change how market data is distributed. Banks and traders have long complained about the data fees charged by exchanges and the legal restrictions they face to redistribute or own data they helped create. David Mercer, chief executive of LMAX said Pyth could “revolutionise and democratise market data provision”. DeFi offers a chance to build an alternative system, its backers say, because a blockchain guarantees the provenance of an asset and its owner. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click The traders and exchanges’ developers have built Pyth to be a bridge between traditional markets and the crypto world, known in industry jargon as an “oracle”. Pyth collects and distributes data on stock, conventional currency, crypto and commodity deals supplied by the high-frequency traders and exchanges and puts it on a blockchain, or distributed ledger. That data can be used in other crypto trading projects. Pyth anonymises the data and publishes the symbol of the asset, such as Apple or Bitcoin, an aggregate value and a confidence level, which reflects how far Pyth believes the broader market price is from its own prices. David Olsen, president of Jump Trading, an early supporter of the project, described Pyth as “hugely exciting”. “It remains to be seen how it develops. The wide range of outcomes remains one of the most intriguing developments of Pyth,” he said. Pyth is built on the Solana blockchain because it can handle 50,000 trades per second, a scale that puts it on a par with Visa, the payments company, and exchanges such as Nasdaq. Most blockchains can only handle a handful of deals per second. “[Current blockchains] aren’t for trading on but they’re very valuable for valuation purposes. Pyth has the best chance of becoming the capital markets oracle,” Mercer told the Financial Times. “Still, we have to be prepared for it to fail.” Solana has been backed by venture capitalists Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital, and Alameda Research, the cryptocurrency market maker co-founded by FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried. At present there is no digital token connected with Pyth, and the developers are finalising the governance structure that will mean users decide how it will develop in the future.,,Philip Stafford,2021-08-25T13:52:59.699Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/7eb3f5e1-821a-4707-b720-cfa58c1aa5d8,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Crypto Cummings is back,More blockchain bunkum from the bloke who brought us Brexit, BarnardCastleGate and (arguably) Boris.,When Dominic Cummings said back in May that he had the “only copy of a crucial historical document” and that he was going to auction it off as an NFT, we hoped that this was just going to be a fleeting flirtation with the world of blockchain. A way of showing off his tech bro credentials, perhaps, or even an attempt to push Brexit and Barnard Castle further down the suggestions list when you type “Dominic Cummings b” into Google. But alas, it appears our Dom is still riding that crypto wagon. Here’s his latest “very very unappreciated” (by us anyway) tweet: Think this is very very unappreciated in policy circles & there will be many startups solving government problems based on this https://t.co/hai7i7aQbD “This” doing a lot of work there isn’t it. What is “this” in fact? Blockchain? The enabling of automated accounting by something crypto-flavoured? And what specific “government problems” is he referring to? As you can see, Cummings was in fact quote-tweeting a quote-tweet by Balaji Srinivasan, a bitcoin-broish VC whose Twitter bio is: “Immutable money, infinite frontier, eternal life. #Bitcoin”. Balaji was quoting the following response to his tweet (yes it’s all a bit convoluted sorry): Ironically, the majority of the world (or at least US) is paid by the hour, a wildly inefficient system for rewarding output/impact. (The “Carry” there is a VC term that refers to “carried interest”, ie their compensation, not to anyone who has ever been cruelly called Princess Nut Nut.) We are not sure what crypto-enabled accounting has to do with people being paid by the hour, or how “more complex models for economic alignment” can help solve government problems. Does our Dom think complexity should be an end in itself? We guess policy circles just very very don’t appreciate cool techy complex stuff (and perhaps neither do we). Luckily, some sensible person on Twitter (yes they do exist) quickly pointed out to Dom that a lot of accounting is already automated and that crypto isn’t very helpful in this area, but Dom used real mathematical probability to win the argument: Chance you know more about crypto than Balaji is ~0% We asked our pal Martin Walker —director of banking at finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management, who has been advising banks on blockchain for about six years — for his thoughts on the matter, and he told us: People, generally who know nothing about accounting, have been coming out with this c**p for years. He then thought he’d better give us a slightly politer version, and said: There is a great deal more to accounting than keeping a ledger of transactions . . . Using some form of blockchain does not in any way make it easier to model financial transactions. Arguably, depending on what form of blockchain is used, it can make it considerably more complicated. In the process of writing this post, Dom has also retweeted the following, on the ability of “a coin’s community” to basically solve the problem of the lack of free speech: Prediction: a coin’s community will build the frontend, backend, and payments for a sufficiently decentralized version over the next 12 months. The tech stack is ready, the market is proven, exchanges exist, and decentralized social media already works. Just need the teams. https://t.co/Dd7VxTUJOW We give up.

https://www.ft.com/content/aef6cba4-1c94-4b9a-a4b3-329077b72dea,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Is there a correlation between US Covid cases and crypto prices?,Please refer to Betteridge’s law of headlines for this one.,You might recall that back in the very early days of Covid-19 (or just “coronavirus” as it was then known), some crypto nutters enthusiasts started getting excited about the idea that the virus would be good for bitcoin because “paper money” “might be the source of #CORONAVIRUS #SARS2 infection”. After all, “fiat is dirty”: @thebearablebull it’s time to switch to a digital currency. Fiat is dirty and is cause for the spread of the corona virus. Could this be the catalyst that advances utility of XRP??? Now, to be fair to the bitcoin bros (not great) and XRP army (worse), even the World Health Organisation had around that time started pushing the idea that Covid could be being spread by banknotes (while simultaneously recommending that people should not wear masks), now thought to be “very unlikely”. Even if banknotes were a key transmission vector, however, we are not sure that “dirty fiat” itself could be held responsible, given that the vast majority of it only exists in digital form. Why would you use bitcoin, or XRP, or any other crypto token when you can transact digitally using fiat currencies? Yet in some ways, the crypto crowd were not wrong. In the almost 18 months since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic, the price of bitcoin has risen by about 525 per cent, from just under $8,000 to a three-month high just above $50,000 on Monday. XRP has climbed by a similar amount to trade around the $1.25 mark. And that, we regret to inform you, has led to some rather silly thinking (highly unusual in the crypto community, we know), specifically of the chart-crime variety: Want to see an interesting relation? Check the relation between COVID case numbers and $ETH, #BTC. Numbers go up? (Credit to @JohnWRichKid's for first noticing). pic.twitter.com/7IBTyhZ9Xb Yes, a most “interesting relation” indeed. When Ethereum (or “ether” as the token that powers the network is called) hit its record high of just under $4,200 in early May (not of course higher than the bitcoin price at the time though you wouldn’t know that from the above), the chart shows Covid cases falling towards their lowest levels since April 2020. When bitcoin hit its record high of around $63,000 just a few weeks earlier, Covid cases had already fallen very steeply, according to the chart. And when Covid cases hit their highest levels in early January, bitcoin suffered its worst crash in eight months. It’s almost as if there is no correlation between crypto prices and Covid cases whatsoever, isn’t it? (Both crypto coins have risen in recent days, while cases have also risen; there’s not an inverse relationship either.) It should be noted that crypto prices also started rising more quickly when Donald Trump lost the presidential election, so we should probably have a think about the notion that Trump might actually be Satoshi, and that now with more free time on his hands he is focusing on pumping the market. After all it is highly likely that he is a Japanese-trained quantum physicist (do make sure you get to 2:09 in this for proof of his knowledge of thermodynamics, and to 2:45 for evidence of his reading Japanese): OK perhaps that’s a little far-fetched. But what is behind crypto’s crazy climb over the past 18 months, we hear you ask? We don’t mean to suggest that the pandemic hasn’t been involved, because we think it has, but not in the way that this chart criminal implies — not, in other words, because it’s some kind of safe haven that traders flock to when they are worried about Covid cases rising; the data don’t bear that idea out. It’s always hard to know exactly what is driving crypto prices given the opacity of the market and a certain rather large player whose name rhymes with weather, but we think it’s probably partly related to the same market madness that drove GameStop to da moon, as well as to a desire for an alternative to central bank-issued money due to worries about the government overreach (by means of Covid restrictions), and also endorsements from chief executives at the likes of PayPal, Tesla and Twitter/Square. We should also point out that if we had been given labels on the Y-axis (which obviously we are not), it might become clear that these “daily Covid cases” refer to US Covid cases. Because while a US chart looks exactly like the one above, a chart showing worldwide Covid cases doesn’t; instead it looks like this (according to Google): Perhaps a bit odd, then, to decide to chart crypto prices against US Covid cases rather than global cases, given crypto is traded globally. Very generously our tweeter credits another crypto fanatic for the remarkable analysis, who had drawn up his own chart just days earlier: When Covid numbers goes up, Bitcoin goes up. Based on this analysis I am issuing a BUY order on Bitcoin with a price target of $1 million by September. Attached is my analysis with the Bitcoin chart just above the Covid chart. All thoughts welcome. pic.twitter.com/AeMAEAixn9 Now one can ever be sure in this “space” but we *think* given that the blue line is so vertical that it literally bends backwards, and that the guy seems to have a sense of humour in his other tweets, this is a joke. We’re not sure “@unusual_whales” got the memo, did he, oh well. Can someone please make sure someone at Citi did?

https://www.ft.com/content/ee970452-02de-4d66-84a1-f2b1345f57d1,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,‘Mr White Hat:’ The story behind a $600m crypto caper,How an alleged thief morphed into a self-styled vigilante who captivated the digital asset world,An hour after the world discovered an alleged hacker had made off with $600m in one of the largest-ever cryptocurrency heists, the thief tipped a bystander $42,000 for warning that some of the assets were being frozen. The apparent act of generosity was only the first unexpected twist in a virtual robbery that has gripped the crypto industry and left many observers scratching their heads. The mystery hacker’s target was an obscure group called Poly Network, a project in the world of decentralised finance, known as DeFi, which links together some of the most widely-used digital ledgers. DeFi is the cutting edge of the digital asset world. Developers are building automated networks to allow individuals and companies to skip fee-charging intermediaries like banks and exchanges. In the crypto market, all transactions can be seen on digital ledgers. Poly took advantage of this feature in the same way a bank can alert authorities to the serial numbers on stolen cash. It called on other industry participants to “blacklist” the stolen loot, making it much more difficult for the hacker to move it without getting caught. With escape routes rapidly closing down to move such a large sum, the hacker began making the case that they were an altruistic thief, out for a good time and to showcase Poly’s vulnerabilities for the greater good. “I hope my life can be composed of unique adventures, so I like to learn and hack everything in order to fight against the fate,” the hacker wrote in messages that can be viewed on a blockchain. Working out the blind spot of Poly Network “would be one of the best moments in my life,” said the hacker, who has yet to be identified. As the incident unfolded this week, the hacker dubbed ‘Mr White Hat’ sent communiqués via the Ethereum blockchain, which can be viewed publicly. The blockchain conversation reveals part of the hacker’s negotiations with Poly Network and gives some clues to the motivation behind the theft. Here are some extracts from those messages: “Not so interested in money, now considering returning some tokens or just leaving them here.” — Mr White Hat “We can offer you a security bounty when you return all the remaining assets. We will provide a secure address through email.” — Poly Network “I have been exploring the meaning of life for a while.” — Mr White Hat “I know it hurts when people are attacked, but shouldn’t they learn something from those hacks?” — Mr White Hat “Q: Why hacking? A. For fun :) ” — Mr White Hat After quoting German philosopher Martin Heidegger, the hacker then took on a Batman-style vigilante attitude. “I prefer to work in the dark and save the world,” they wrote. To some, a homespun philosophy that mixed high and pop culture to justify taking $600m may seem a stretch. The DeFi market already had a reputation for being the wildest of the “Wild West” in the largely unregulated crypto world. Last year, DeFi represented only 6 per cent of all cryptocurrency activity but accounted for a third of all digital asset thefts, according to Chainalysis, a crypto data company. But as the dust began to settle, many crypto enthusiasts, a community that has long championed libertarian ideals, were already beginning to give him a sympathetic hearing. It had even given the hacker a nickname — “Mr White Hat” — in reference to supposed “ethical” hacking. “The world has up to now been too forgiving of people deploying insecure systems which companies manage rather than fix. The wonderful thing about DeFi is that it is not forgiving in that way,” said Mark Miller, chief technology officer at Agoric, which provides software for DeFi transactions. “We have an ecosystem here in which insecure participants get killed quickly so it gets to be populated by the survivors of the process.” The anonymous hacker’s sudden rise to fame began on Tuesday, after he identified a weak spot in Poly’s systems. Poly had developed a computer protocol, or set of rules, that allows users to transfer tokens tied to one blockchain to a different network. Many of the world’s most widely used blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum, operate independently. Their coins, offered as an incentive to users, run on separate technologies. That means investors cannot easily move tokens to a different blockchain to trade them elsewhere. Poly acted as a bridge but Mr White Hat found a bug that gave him direct access the ledgers. Shortly after 1.30pm London time, Poly alerted the world on Twitter that thousands of tokens had been removed from its network. Its response was to publish the unique alphanumeric addresses of the wallets to which the tokens had been sent, so other crypto players could identify and potentially block further transactions. Exchanges such as Binance and OKEx said they were monitoring the situation. Tether, the stablecoin operator, said it froze about $33m worth of its tokens. As the exchanges at the heart of the crypto system began to block the hacker’s path, the adventure took yet another turn. Users of the Ethereum blockchain can create crypto trades and attach comments for the world to see. The hacker’s helpful informant used this feature to warn Mr White Hat the assets were being locked off. Others began tipping Mr White Hat with tokens, accompanied by messages asking for funds to be returned. While most tips were worth less than $1, a handful of the more than 1,300 transactions involved tokens worth hundreds of dollars in the hope of receiving a more substantial payout. Poly left a message on Ethereum asking the hacker to contact them. Less than an hour later, Mr White Hat responded on the same channel. Attacker and target were communicating in public. In more conciliatory language, Poly then offered a bounty worth $500,000 as a reward for finding the bug and returning the assets. “We hope it will be remembered as the biggest white hat hack in history,” the organisation said. The appeal to the hacker’s vanity worked. He gave no indication he would take the money but, the next day, began transferring small amounts to a joint account. Like a police negotiator in a movie, Poly encouraged the hacker to continue: “You are moving things [in] the right direction.” By Friday, Poly said almost all of the funds had been returned and it was preparing to take full control of the assets to hand back to their owners. As the hacker surrendered, the thief remained defiant; “Hacking for good, I did save the project”, he wrote via Ethereum. For some the episode had represented an important lesson about the fallibilities of the system, especially protocols that look to connect blockchains like Poly. “A blockchain can be extremely secure but only in its own world. The moment it needs to talk to something else outside the blockchain that potentially opens up problems,” said Kevin Werbach, an academic at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton business school. Lawyers said it was unclear whether users whose funds were caught up in the caper would or even could launch a legal challenge. Poly’s website offers no terms governing its use, nor does it reference a legal entity. DeFi systems use software programs called smart contracts to transfer cryptocurrencies, removing any human intermediary and complicating the task of assigning liability to any one party. Some developers have argued that the rules created by software programs constitute the “law” — a notion that many lawyers contest. But it may be the hacker who has the biggest impact on how aggressively regulators look to supervise DeFi activity, said Charlie Steele, a former US government lawyer and now partner at Forensic Risk Alliance, a regulation consultancy. “I don’t think regulators would be too comfortable relying on Robin Hoods out there to police the system.” For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click ,,Philip Stafford Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan Miles Kruppa,2021-08-13T20:00:24.381Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/b9f6c876-22bb-498c-a425-78287455a3e1,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,China lays down challenge to the west on crypto,Governments and private sector must adopt more unified approach in response to Beijing,The writer is president of Queens’ College, Cambridge and an adviser to Allianz and Gramercy The time has come for more western governments to stop dismissing the crypto revolution as some mix of illicit payments schemes and reckless financial speculation. Instead, they should be more open to embracing the innovations of crypto and channelling them in a better direction for finance, the economy and society at large. At the same time, crypto supporters need to recognise the growing systemic consequences of the continuing and future disruptions, deepening their engagement on regulatory and energy issues. They need to shift away from a “zero-sum” mindset where their gains can only come from the losses of the established financial system. Overall, the policy debate in western economies over crypto remains too narrow relative to the importance of the issues in play and excessively polarised, with participants speaking different languages. This has intensified the underlying tug of war between accelerating private sector adoption and government/central bank discomfort. As the former steadily increases, we have started to see divergence in the western world on the cost-benefit of trying to channel the crypto revolution towards improving financial services, making things even more complicated. In contrast, China is pressing ahead with a more forceful, unified top-down vision, setting the stage for transformational dynamics that have the potential to extend well beyond the country itself. What happens next will have profound implications for financial services, monetary policy, investment outcomes, payment platforms and the configuration of global reserve currencies. It will also influence the control and use of big data, as well as China-US technological and economic competition. Three on-the-ground developments show how things are shaping up. First, the technologies driving the crypto revolution, including digitally-distributed ledgers of transactions known as blockchains, are becoming more disruptive to a financial industry that has remained for too long relatively inefficient and a source of excessive profits. The combination of regulatory moats that deterred industry entrants and traditional customer inertia are no longer strong enough to discourage a tech-driven wave of competition. Second, despite their instability, cryptocurrencies are gradually becoming a larger part of investor portfolios via allocations to two buckets — risk-mitigating assets that are an alternative at the margin to gold and some government bonds; and opportunistic bets on non-correlated assets. Third, cryptocurrencies are also somewhat more prevalent in the payments ecosystem. It’s worrisome for illicit payments (think of the growing number of ransomware attacks) but more positive for remittance transfers, where too many traditional channels remain slow and expensive. But the broader evolution into global currencies continues to be undermined by price volatility, lack of broad trust and regulatory concerns. The big question now in whether crypto disrupters and regulators in the West will succeed in converging on a more unified approach. The onus here falls primarily on the crypto world, which risks repeating the mistake that Big Tech has made — pursuing narrow business objectives without realising that their desired success will make them systemically important. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click They will not get far with governments and central banks without incorporating stronger anti-money laundering safeguards. They also have to respond to concern about a potential erosion of monetary policy tools. The need for governments and central banks to be open-minded is made more urgent by what China is doing. Officials in Beijing have understood the transformational power of the crypto revolution and wish to co-opt it in a holistic and highly directed manner. By doing so, it confronts the west with a challenge that goes beyond China being quicker to develop better payments systems and a central bank digital currency — all of which are likely to jump borders. It could also pose a new problem for the dollar’s reserve currency status, as well as providing China with more control over sensitive big data and closing what remains of the technological gap. Absent a more co-operative approach, both sides of the crypto world in the west may find their future being determined by what a faster-moving China is doing and intends to do.,,Mohamed El-Erian,2021-07-29T04:00:49.562Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/87d55cae-fe45-4041-961c-860f28e9a289,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Money’s quantum time bomb,Efforts are under way to protect the world’s financial networks from a quantum attack. But some question if the threat to crypto assets is really as existential as feared.,There’s a paradox at the heart of cyber security. It relates to the trade-off between keeping our secrets safe and protecting the communications of bad actors. Most people are blissfully unaware of it, but an uneasy balance was struck in the early 2000s following the conclusion of the Crypto Wars. After many years of fighting the ability to export secure encryption, US officials finally capitulated on restrictions in 2000, opening the door to a much larger share of the world being able to benefit from secure encryption protocols. While many saw this as too much of a concession to terrorists and criminal organisations, privacy advocates argued the benefits of secure communications for all outweighed the risks. With quantum computing around the corner, however, some believe the power balance struck in the 2000s could be on the verge of breakdown due to the technology’s potential to break current encryption standards. This time, they say, the consequences could be far graver than anything in the past because of the scale of economic value and infrastructure that has been linked in the interim to secure encryption. But others think the threat may be being overhyped by those who wish to profit from selling quantum security or by those who have an interest in getting institutions to migrate to platforms they control and can exploit. In the latest issue of the European Cybersecurity Journal, Jaya Baloo, the vice chair of the Quantum Flagship initiative, an EU-funded research initiative, argued that the impact of quantum computing has the potential to be bigger than the computing revolution. This is why, she says, quantum secure encryption must be rolled out well in advance to fend off any adverse effects. But rather than focus on building more secure systems, Baloo also noted there are still many officials lobbying to weaken existing encryption regimes via backdoors and system overrides in the name of national security and fighting crime. Baloo compared this to the arguments made during the Vietnam war that the best way to save a village was to burn it down: We’re looking at the same absurd situation when it comes to encryption. People with noble ends — stopping crime, terrorism, child pornography, and human trafficking — are proposing means to those ends — weakening encryption with backdoors — that would in fact destroy the very end goal of security and privacy for everyone. As it stands, banks are probably the most ahead when it comes to fending off quantum decryption risk. Many have discreetly begun assembling teams to think hard about moving — if not already moving — their systems to quantum secure levels. Much of this activity is being done in the shadows because of the downside of accidentally signalling to would-be attackers (especially state-level ones) how insecure one’s system currently is. Nobody wants to let the proverbial quantum security cat out of the bag since doing so would invite a perpetual arms-race between attackers and defenders, with encryption having to be continuously adapted to new threats. Even so, this scenario may eventually become unavoidable. Amit Katwala, the author of Quantum Computing, how it works and why it could change the world, told FT Alphaville that while quantum is likely to break certain types of encryption eventually, there’s a good chance it will be contained in counter-encryption upgrades. “By the time these devices are ready to break those types of encryption, there will be new types of encryption in place that will be harder for them to break.” Not all in the crypto security world are convinced by the urgency of the matter. In some quarters, an active debate is being had about whether quantum computing will ever be strong enough to break standard encryption protocols. The question is of particularly relevance to those active in the cryptocurrency sphere, since so much of the sector depends on secure cryptography to retain its value. Opinions, however, remain hugely divided. Among those who see it as a big problem are the founders of Arqit, a British network security company that claims to have solved some key problems in the quantum security field. Stephen Homes, Arqit’s chief product officer, argues in a new paper co-authored with Liqun Chen from the University of Surrey that quantum computers could in theory use Shor’s algorithm, a number crunching technique, to break Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures, which many cryptocurrencies depend on. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click To fend off quantum attacks, the paper outlines, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin will have to adapt in ways that would make usability increasingly cumbersome for users. Keeping on top of the threat, they say, “requires a significant change in user behaviour and a cryptocurrency becomes increasingly less usable as each additional protection is added.” To achieve user-friendly security, the authors add, cryptocurrencies would have to migrate to quantum safe digital signature schemes. But doing so would require a hard fork, which is a notoriously complex process that involves high levels of community consensus to ensure successful implementation. One other option, Holmes and Chen note, is migrating one cryptocurrency to a new cryptocurrency platform designed specifically to be quantum resistant. “This could be achieved relatively easily through an exchange process as a cryptocurrency is becoming more at risk to the ever increasing performance of quantum computers,” they say. But many top-level bitcoin developers and experts remain sceptical. Some argue there’s no clear indication that quantum computing will ever be strong enough to break either ECDSA or the Sha-256 secure hashing algorithm that underpins bitcoin. Stepan Snigirev, a former quantum physicist now involved in the crypto space, told FT Alphaville that it is unlikely that quantum computers will become a threat to bitcoin in the next 20 years. As he noted: In order to break elliptic curve cryptography, one needs ~10 thousand physical qubits and their quantum state should survive several million operations. The current state of the art Quantum Computers are tiny and very noisy - 20 qubits with ~100 operations is what you can expect today. Optimistically one can expect ~10x improvement in both parameters every 5 years. Or maybe in 3 years if you have unlimited funding. So these simple estimates give us about 15-20 years to develop and deploy quantum-safe cryptography. Others in the community go further than that. They claim the true agenda of those circulating fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) about bitcoin’s resilience to quantum is to sabotage trust in the novel financial system, since it poses such a threat to incumbent powers. A counter-narrative that might best be described as “quantum denial” has thus appeared in some quarters too. The views of those developing quantum computers sit somewhere in the middle. “Certainly quantum computing is not a hoax,” Dr Kuan Yen Tan, chief technology officer of IQM Quantum Computers, told FT Alphaville. “There is of course lots of hype around, but some of that is very good because quantum has great potential. We think it is going to eventually change everything because it is like a new force of nature that we are taking into use.” His colleague Prof. Mikko Möttönen of Aalto University and chief scientist at IQM however caveated that “for quantum computers to become a security threat, in the sense that you define, you would need something called quantum error correction. So you would need a machine that makes almost no errors at all . . . and that kind of machine is beyond 10 years from now.” Irrespective of how great the quantum threat really is, efforts to provide the market with pre-emptive solutions are coming. Holmes’ company, Arqit, is among those looking to cash in. In recent months Arqit has come to market claiming it has figured out how to commercialise symmetric key encryption, a much stronger method of encryption that has until now been viewed as impossible to scale. It works on the basis that if two counterparts can access the same genuinely random number that only they share, they can encrypt their communications in a way that is most likely to be quantum secure. The method is most famous for protecting high security assets like the US nuclear codes, using the nuclear football. But it also comes with a big disadvantage: in most circumstances it calls for the physical exchange of passwords between two parties, meaning it is no good for encryption between distant parties that never have the chance to meet in person. But Arqit’s CEO David Williams says the company — which consists of a plethora of former GCHQ code crackers and former British and US military types — has solved the trickiest part of the problem by using another quantum process known as quantum key distribution (QKD). At the heart of the solution is a mechanism that draws on the spooky properties of quantum states to help distribute the keys securely over distance. The quantum properties ensure that if a message is intercepted it disappears before it can be read. “If you try and read quantum information, you break it, and it doesn’t get used,” says Williams, while pointing out that the downside of quantum key distribution is that its resistance to hacking is also what makes it highly sensitive to more benign forms of interference it the real world. “It unfortunately only lasts a few dozens of kilometres because the quantum information bumps into glass molecules and dies,” says Williams. Arqit solves this problem by using satellites to distribute the keys to terrestrial receivers, a process which extends the transmissibility of the codes by many hundreds of kilometres. It also claims to have found a way to branch off that security and offer it as a service to mass-market telecoms providers, ensuring everyone’s personal computers and mobiles can benefit from QKD. Arqit, however, is not the only venture to claim to have solved QKD using satellites. In 2016, China launched a quantum communications satellite known as Micius, that was also set to transmit encrypted keys from space. Xinhua reported at the time that the satellite was “designed to distribute keys between relay stations on two different continents using high-speed coherent lasers” and that “as a quantum photon cannot be separated or duplicated, it becomes ‘impossible to wiretap, intercept or crack the information transmitted through it.”” But Williams claims Arqit, which fetched a $1.4bn valuation on Nasdaq in early May via a merger with Spac, is far ahead of the Chinese effort. He says Micius unlike Arqit has not yet solved the “global versus trustless” conundrum, which allows for the quantum encryption to be distributed beyond its end point on the ground. Solving this means the technology can be applied not just to direct communications but much more broadly, including to protect new blockchain-based financial systems from quantum attack. “Our customer announcement will be about a central bank digital currency, which we think is the best legitimate regulated use of blockchain technology, but only works if it is quantum safe,” he told FT Alphaville. The idea central banks may be inclined to draw on quantum properties to secure their currencies is certainly intriguing. One of the big challenges facing CBDC issuance, after all, is how they will be able to maintain users’ privacy while simultaneously complying with their own Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money-Laundering rules, which require active supervision and monitoring of all transactions. As it stands the two requirements are paradoxical. From a users’ perspective, siding more firmly with one or the other requirement also risks alienating users either way, whether that’s on privacy grounds or on stability and risk grounds. In that context, being able to say “we’ve solved this impossible problem with quantum” seems an awfully convenient thing to be able to promote. Such assurances, however, are unlikely to satisfy the eternally distrustful crypto community. One high-level cryptographer source told FT Alphaville that even if QKD has been achieved at scale, it doesn’t mean the wider system is necessarily unhackable. If the attacker controls the endpoint in a QKD pair, they said, it is possible they could see the key being generated and that would then give them access. “That’s how governments will backdoor it,” they noted. “They will be using a keyed random number generator, so the question is: how do you audit the independence of the random number generator? And the answer is you can’t.” For now at least we guess that means the paranoia in the sector is unlikely to be abated.

https://www.ft.com/content/91342189-978f-4d44-9dcf-b993983f08f9,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,How blockchain is shaking Swift and the global payments system,A crucial linchpin of the world’s financial plumbing is ripe for disruption,Last month, the Brussels-based utility called the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift) announced that six global banks had embraced its plan to upgrade cross-border payment systems. So far, so boring, many might think. Payment processes rarely grab public or political attention, unless they go wrong. In that sense they are like household plumbing. But investors should wake up. For this joint initiative (together with the Bank of China, Citi, Bank of New York Mellon, Deutsche, Standard Chartered and BNP Paribas) is one sign of a potentially vicious battle now erupting due to the rise of cryptocurrencies and the technology behind them. The wider public tends to view digital tokens, such as bitcoin, primarily in terms of whether they can act as a store of value and medium of exchange. Many politicians are simultaneously caught up in the emerging debate around the potential of central bank digital currencies. But what is equally important — and often overlooked — in all of these conversations is what blockchain and the cryptocurrencies it supports could do to financial plumbing, not just inside countries but between them. This could reshape not just finance, but US geopolitical leverage as well. Swift is currently both a crucial linchpin of global finance and a peculiarity which seems ripe for disruption. It first sprang to life back in 1977, when American and European banks created a jointly-owned utility to perform correspondent banking services. (As an admirably lucid new book, The Pay Off, explains, this occurred because Citi was developing a proprietary payments network, and its rivals hated the idea of a monopoly sitting in private hands.) Today Swift remains a non-profit co-operative, with 11,000 members and facilitating payments worth an eye-popping $1.5tn a day. It does this not by actually moving money, but by enabling banks to dispatch messages that credit or debit their accounts as payments occur. This makes it akin to an electronic post system. Swift officials, however, prefer to dub it the world’s large “fintech”. Maybe so. But its Achilles heel is that it is anything but “swift”. On the contrary, as the Pay Off notes, critics have sometimes complained about slow and costly payments in the correspondent banking network around Swift. Some financiers also say that the utility itself has been slow to embrace innovation, because it had a bureaucratic culture and weak governance structure. Unsurprisingly, this has prompted fintech upstarts, such as Ripple and Facebook’s Diem project, to create plans to challenge Swift with innovations such as distributed ledger technology (“blockchain”). Some of Swift’s own members are also challenging it. JPMorgan, for example, is developing a particularly bold blockchain initiative system called Onyx with a messaging system called Liink. This is already moving “billions each day’, according to officials. Meanwhile, the Russian and Chinese governments are reportedly creating rival platforms, since countries subject to US sanctions, such as Iran, have occasionally been excluded from the network. (Gottfried Leibbrandt, the former Swift head and co-author of The Pay Off, recently explained to an FT forum that while the utility is technically independent, Washington has sanction power because half of Swift’s payment flows are in dollars.) Will these challenges topple Swift? Definitely not in the short term. Even if Russia and China build rival systems, it is unlikely others would choose to rely on these in a world where the overwhelming majority of global trade is currently invoiced in dollars. And while fintech start-ups are performing small-value, cross-border retail payments — and aim to dominate specific niches — none have any scale, yet. Moreover, the key thing to understand about platforms such as the ambitious JPMorgan Onyx/Liink system is that they are “closed loop”, as opposed to Swift’s open system. Rivals thus have an incentive to collaborate with Swift to promote interoperability. Fintech is a world of frenemies. But even if short-term challenges can be fended off, the long term is uncertain. It is very unlikely that the US Treasury would choose to let Swift be disintermediated, given its geopolitical significance. Washington and Wall Street thus have a joint incentive to help the utility fend off competition, by following others’ innovations. And Swift is trying to do precisely that. Four years ago it introduced one big upgrade: a new “global payments innovation” to improve processes. The recent announcement in partnership with the banks is supposed to deliver more digital capabilities in November 2022. A 15-month plan, however, looks achingly slow to anyone in Silicon Valley — or in Beijing, which is racing ahead with its digital currency. Swift’s ambitions also seem modest compared to the promise of blockchain. So the issue being fought over in Brussels is not just one of technical and geopolitical importance — must cross-border payments occur via messages? Should America weaponise dollar flows? — but also commercially critical. Can an incumbent monopoly ever effectively steal from disrupters? The fact that the answers are uncertain is unnerving. And more important than the hype around cryptocurrencies. gillian.tett@ft.com This article has been amended to clarify that the book The pay-off did not accuse SWIFT of having a bureaucratic culture and excessively high costs, as it originally stated.

https://www.ft.com/content/00ee2bf6-3c19-4e81-ad0c-dd5b66606b3f,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,DeFi paradoxes,Why using crypto smart-contracts to remove financial intermediaries comes with its own trade-offs.,You might have heard the term “DeFi” making the rounds in the cryptosphere. Like us, you may even have tried to understand what it was all about but given up due to the complexity, opacity and jargon surrounding its key aspects. Others have tried to shed light on its mysterious operations. The FT’s Miles Kruppa and Hannah Murphy, for example, noted as far back as the heady pre-pandemic days of December 2019 that DeFi operates as a broad umbrella term for blockchain projects that aim to eject human involvement in financial services by using smart contracts. To accomplish this, DeFi depends on the creation of “liquidity pools” and overcollateralised repo-style arrangements. Even so, DeFi, which stands for “decentralised finance”, remains a murky if increasingly hyped up corner of the crypto world. To be blunt, FT Alphaville’s initial knee-jerk reaction — based on what we should confess was not that much research at all — was that the very idea of decentralised finance being something new or exciting was hugely naive. The story of financial markets, after all, is one of continuous decentralisation, innovation and engineering to synthesise seemingly risk-reduced returns and free lunches, which usually turn out to be anything but. Crypto is just another part of that story. From repo markets to eurodollars and commodities, the story always starts with decentralised frameworks arising quite organically, being heralded as amazing wealth generators, then turning risky, then blowing up, then having regulatory forces battle to contain them — usually by centralising their processes and slowing down their growth by forcing expensive checks and balances on the systems. Were the alchemic solutions being offered by DeFi really immune to that age-old pattern? We somehow doubted it. It’s for this reason a new paper DeFi Protocol Risks: the Paradox of DeFi, by Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures and Linda Jeng, a visiting scholar at Georgetown University Law Center piqued our curiosity when it crossed our radar. Neither Carter or Jeng are openly hostile to crypto, in fact quite the opposite — Carter is a well known advocate of bitcoin and crypto. That their incredibly well researched work should arrive at conclusions that fitted with our base assumptions seemed noteworthy, therefore. To be clear, Carter and Jeng do see potential in DeFi bringing down the cost of financial services and broadening access. But they are also incredibly realistic about the challenges and risks. Notably, they are also wise to many of the inherent paradoxes of financial systems that we at FT Alphaville are so fond of flagging. The paper is a dense read, but of course it would be: it’s DeFi. Nonetheless the authors do a good job of explaining the background of the movement, laying out the current landscape and then setting the scene for the risks. But it’s their concluding points that really should not be missed, since they speak not just to the heart of the issue that faces of crypto but also to fintech and financial innovation more broadly. Basically, that there really is no free lunch. And, as Grossman-Stiglitz highlighted as far back as 1980, there is also “a fundamental conflict between the efficiency with which markets spread information and the incentives to acquire information”. This means prices will never reflect the information which is available “since if it did, those who spent resources to obtain it would receive no compensation”. Which de facto means if you remove the incentive (a.k.a. cost) to hunt for information, you will get bad prices and thus incur risk. Here in any case is a similar concluding point from Carter and Jeng (with our emphasis): Many of the risks described above stem from the decentralized nature of blockchains. The goal of automating the delivery of financial services and reducing human dependencies also has the congruent effect of reducing oversight and control. Disintermediating traditional intermediaries reduces high fees and entry friction, but also creates new opportunities for new types of intermediaries. These new types of intermediaries require the sufficient economic incentives and, thus, could be potentially more costly and risky than the monopoly rents extracted by today’s centralized intermediaries. Ultimately, this new host of intermediaries in a decentralized financial ecosystems could stymie the drive toward the twin goals of democratizing financial services: lowering cost and improving access. They also observe just how difficult it really is to disintermediate a system from its base source of value, which stems from the core system. (This of course is something the eurodollar and MMF markets also found out in 2008): External dependencies on traditional finance, namely banks, is another important source of risk as well as a transmission channel for risk. Although one of the goals of DeFi is to create a new kind of financial system without traditional intermediaries, the irony is that as DeFi struggles to make itself more useful in the real world, its dependency on the established financial system grows. Its reliance on traditional finance is not only a source of risk but can potentially serve as a transmission channel for risk between traditional financial and DeFi systems. DeFi leveraging stablecoins’ backing by fiat or other financial liabilities is an excellent example of this type of risk. Another dependency is that the crypto industry still needs to bank with commercial banks in order to conduct the cash legs of their transactions. Last, here are some insightful observations about why it is so much harder to remove back-office personnel than many appreciate: Wholly new risks are introduced by DeFi stemming from the reliance on open protocols and the fact that the underlying infrastructure is un-owned. Removing the back office and human oversight results in many efficiencies, but they also introduce risks. Thus, it is up to the end user or contract administrator to monitor the risk of the protocols themselves, and many would not want the burden. These risks are amplified when financial primitives collide with automated, hard-to-intervene contracts. Here is where all the chaos in DeFi is really from - systems that are built to be scalable and automated but that are underspecified or not understood by their creators. In sum, blockchain technologies bring many benefits. But the tools or processes used to disintermediate or gain efficiency also have costs in recourse, reversibility, risk management, etc. – the ‘paradox’ of DeFi. In short, where there is a burden associated with processing information or familiarising yourself with an opaque, jargon-heavy new system that promises to be safe as houses and efficient but demands you to just trust it on that, there is and always will be a market for a trusted third party to do the due diligence for you. And that, to a large degree, is why the Financial Times has a business model.

In a Twitter thread, Dorsey said that Square planned to create a “new business” with the “goal of making it easy to create non-custodial, permissionless, and decentralised financial services”, in what would mark one of the first big projects of its kind in the nascent market. Decentralised finance, or DeFi, is the name given to the growing number of cryptocurrency projects that are trying to build an interlocking financial system denominated in cryptocurrencies that cuts out traditional middlemen. Proponents say it will provide a new way to access financial services ranging from lending and trading to insurance and savings products. Dorsey, who is chief executive of Square and Twitter, said that Square had “some ideas around the initial platform primitives we want to build”. However, it is unclear what exactly the business would offer to prospective developers or how it might be monetised. It is to be called TBD, until a name is chosen. “We’re going to do this completely in the open. Open road map, open development, and open source,” Dorsey said, adding that Mike Brock, an executive who has worked on Square’s push into cryptocurrency, would head up the platform. Recommended Private investors have backed more than 70 DeFi companies this year and although the area remains small, its value has ballooned in tandem with the cryptocurrency bull market. The assets in DeFi products have grown from about $2bn a year ago to more than $55bn today, according to data from DeFi Pulse. The freewheeling space has also captured the attention of regulators, who have raised concerns about the security and accountability of projects, as well as the potential for fraud. Dan Berkovitz, commissioner at the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has asserted that many DeFi apps could be illegal. Many DeFi projects are built on the ethereum blockchain because it can be used to easily create smart contracts — essentially computer code that is automatically triggered when certain conditions are met. However, Dorsey said that the “primary focus” of the platform would be bitcoin, the oldest and most popular blockchain.

Earlier this year, it acquired a majority stake in Tidal, the struggling streaming platform owned by Jay-Z, for $297m, making an unexpected entrance into the music industry and putting the rapper on the Square board. TBD would be the latest in a number of bets on cryptocurrencies made by Dorsey, a fierce bitcoin advocate.

Blockchain — the digital ledger that records and verifies transactions and underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin — has the potential to streamline the process of selling new debt, leading to substantial cost savings, bankers say. “I think blockchain has a real future in debt capital markets,” said Sean Taor, head of European debt capital markets at RBC. “If you can use blockchain from start to finish, you take out a lot of the costs, a lot of the risks in terms of counterparty and settlement risks.” In April the European Investment Bank raised €100m from a two-year bond registered on the ethereum blockchain network, in the first such deal involving a syndicate of banks. The deal came three years after the World Bank sold the first bond to be created and managed using blockchain. Singaporean food producer Olam International last year sold a bond using HSBC’s blockchain-based settlement platform, while JPMorgan has also tested the use of blockchain technology for issuing financial instruments. For the issuers the motivation is obvious. Over the life cycle of a bond, using blockchain technology could save at least 35 per cent of the costs associated with issuance, according to a study last year by German fintech firm Cashlink, by automating processes such as the emailing back and forth and manual updating of bond documentation. Use of blockchain could also cut down the number of intermediaries involved in the process — for example the bonds would no longer need to be registered with a central securities depository. A similar 2019 study by HSBC looking at the green bond market — where a public ledger would help streamline the process of tracking the use of the bond’s proceeds — identified much larger savings of up to 90 per cent. Blockchain issued bonds are not denominated in cryptocurrencies, but they use the same underlying technology to reconcile orders from different systems, record and update ownership of the asset, and allow the transaction to be settled without the need for extensive manual cross-checking. Rather than settlement taking three days, as is typical, money can flow to the issuer seamlessly once the bond is priced. “It’s essentially a glorified database,” said Matthew McDermott, head of digital assets at Goldman Sachs, one of the banks which handled the EIB deal along with Santander and Société Générale. “This technology reduces the number of intermediaries involved in any given transaction.” The bank has had more than 100 one-to-one meetings with investors and would-be issuers about the potential use of blockchain as a result of the interest generated by that transaction, McDermott said. Some of this is just hype around a new technology. I’m not sure it’s quite as revolutionary as it’s sometimes made out to be Blockchain also offers a way to easily locate current holders of bonds — often a tricky task in the relatively fragmented world of fixed income where bonds are often traded directly “over the counter” rather than on centralised exchanges. Billions of dollars have been poured into analytics to help traders locate debt securities to buy or sell, according to Kevin McPartland, head of market structure at Coalition Greenwich. “A universal database of who owns what, at least in theory, avoids the need for that,” he said. Issuers would also find it much easier to communicate with investors — some bonds, for example, contain clauses which allow bondholders to sell back to the company if it changes hands. Moreover, banks could also save money on fees charged by trading venues and allow deals to be negotiated without giving away data to the rest of the market. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click By lowering some of the barriers to participation in bond markets, blockchain technologies could eventually open them up to much smaller players, according to Denis Coleman, co-head of the global financing group at Goldman Sachs. “This is just the very start of a journey, but you could see the democratisation of bond markets,” he said. The HSBC report, which was co-authored by the Sustainable Digital Finance Alliance, recommended the setting up of “DIY” bond platforms on blockchain, which would enable smaller companies to tap debt markets with a minimum of fixed costs. Some of the claims made about its potential may be overblown, McPartland said. The massive investment necessary to change the systems that underpin debt markets will probably happen slowly, and regulators won’t necessarily approve, he argued. “Distributed ledgers will have a role to play in helping markets become more liquid and transparent,” he added. “But some of this is just hype around a new technology. I’m not sure it’s quite as revolutionary as it’s sometimes made out to be.” ,,Tommy Stubbington,2021-06-30T04:00:54.051Z,

The event featured presentations by the decentralised exchange Uniswap and derivatives trading venue dYdX, among other popular so-called DeFi programs, according to people familiar with the conference. Representatives from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission also attended the event, which was hosted by the International Organization of Securities Commissions, the people said. The gathering, which has not been previously reported, shows how financial regulators have begun paying greater attention to DeFi, a collection of cryptocurrency projects that aims to cut out the middleman and provide financial services such as lending and trading using automated software programs. Lawyers and cryptocurrency advocates said the rapid growth of DeFi in the past year had caught authorities off guard, while also raising unprecedented questions about the nature of financial regulation. Bitcoin is the most high-profile effort to bypass traditional financial systems but the so-called DeFi sector extends far beyond cryptocurrencies into insurance, derivatives trading and even savings accounts. In the US, CFTC commissioner Dan Berkovitz has suggested that many DeFi apps could be illegal, and SEC chair Gary Gensler has singled out the programs as raising “a number of challenges” for investors and regulators. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click “There’s so much happening so quickly that regulators just cannot respond, as a practical matter,” said Lewis Cohen, a partner at DLx Law, a cryptocurrency law firm. Cohen compared the boom in DeFi to a “giant DDoS attack on global financial regulation”, referring to a kind of cyber security assault where hackers overwhelm their targets with huge volumes of activity. A representative for Iosco declined to comment on the event, saying that it had been organised to “support internal work”. The CFTC confirmed the agency’s attendance but declined to comment on the discussions. Uniswap, dYdX and the SEC declined to comment. While employees at DeFi projects said they would welcome clearer guidance from regulators, increased oversight could pose an existential threat to the growing sector, which has ambitions to create an entirely new financial system. Regulators have traditionally monitored the activity flowing through intermediaries such as banks, and may decide that the decentralised nature of DeFi apps makes the sector unaccountable. Founders of some of the largest projects, such as Uniswap, have begun introducing governance systems that aim to spread responsibility for the apps among their users, rather than with a central authority. Several projects have also distributed tokens that have surged in value in the past year, raising concerns that regulators might classify them as securities and introduce greater oversight. The total assets pledged as collateral in DeFi applications has soared in the past year, growing from less than $2bn to more than $50bn, according to data collected by DeFi Pulse. Cryptocurrency advocates have resisted early attempts to regulate the underlying software programs, arguing that the open-source projects are protected speech. “If you try to put prior restraint and permission-based regulations on these activities, what you’re basically doing is creating a ban on certain types of speech,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, an advocacy group. An early flash point emerged around new guidelines developed by the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental organisation that develops standards to prevent global money laundering. A draft version of the group’s newest guidance appeared to widely expand the group’s definition of “virtual asset service providers” to include decentralised software programs. Cryptocurrency groups have protested against the measures, which could force DeFi apps to begin implementing know-your-customer rules similar to those required of banks, and FATF said on Friday that it would delay the final guidance until October. US regulators have also taken notice. Berkovitz, the CFTC commissioner, said in a recent speech that automated software programs for derivatives trading appeared to violate the Commodities Exchange Act, which requires futures contracts to trade through regulated bodies and bars individuals with less than $10m of invested assets from entering swap contracts. “I’m totally open to having certain applications that can be done more efficiently without intermediaries,” Berkovitz said in an interview. “But the intermediaries in many respects do serve an important function, and we can hold them accountable.” Berkovitz’s comments suggested that the CFTC could begin regulating DeFi apps if they begin replicating traditional derivatives markets. So far, though, the CFTC and SEC have not taken any concrete action against DeFi. Recommended “If it were to be an unregulated direct competitor in the futures market, that would be problematic,” Berkovitz said. DeFi project founders argued that users of their open-source software programs benefited from transparent, rules-based systems for executing transactions. For the SEC to take action against DeFi, it would need to assert “securities jurisdiction” over the programs and their related digital assets, said Michelle Bond, chief executive of the Association for Digital Asset Markets, a cryptocurrency industry body. “Just as a doctor shouldn’t recommend heart surgery for a knee scrape, regulations from one asset class or platform shouldn’t be broadly applied to non-similar asset classes or technologies,” Bond said. Antonio Juliano, founder of dYdX, said the project had held multiple discussions with the CFTC, and its so-called perpetual contracts were not yet available for trading in the US largely for regulatory reasons. “A lot of things that had to be done manually before, no longer have to,” Juliano said. “That’s great for investors.”,,Miles Kruppa Gary Silverman,2021-06-26T08:00:08.304Z,

The cryptocurrency had been released only a couple of years previously and was still far from a global phenomenon. “Bitcoin was only really known in geeky tech circles and eventually currency traders in London found out about it around 2010,” says Ro. She invested in the cryptocurrency, made a substantial fortune and is now chief executive of the Global Blockchain Business Council, a Swiss non-profit organisation that promotes the technology behind cryptocurrencies. With a background in markets at global banks such as Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley, Ro was quick to grasp blockchain’s revolutionary potential. “What really piqued my interest was whether the tech could disintermediate financial markets. I thought, what the heck?” she recalls. “Bitcoin was trading at a couple of hundred bucks at the time and I bought a bunch thinking, what if it works? And guess what? It did!” Today, bitcoin and its digital peers are becoming mainstream. The hype reached new heights this year after the cryptocurrency gained 600 per cent in value in 12 months. The mania has swept up not only retail investors but also very wealthy people. Ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWs — people with assets of $30m or more) such as Paul Tudor or Stanley Druckenmiller were among the earliest backers of bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, and are prominent in the market today. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are also gaining traction as a store of value for financial institutions. Banks are queueing up to compete — Goldman Sachs is trading cryptocurrencies while Citigroup is considering providing trading, custody and financing services. Billionaire investors openly discuss their cryptocurrency-related investments, while some large publicly listed companies, such as software company MicroStrategy, hold billions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin on their balance sheets. Neither the sharp sell-off that hit cryptocurrencies last month nor the surrounding turmoil should obscure the fact that these are now huge markets, with a combined value of $1.6tn. That is big enough as an investment pool for even the richest private investors and largest family offices. But bitcoin still divides opinion. For some it is an obsession, for others a speculative bubble. Yet financial industry analysts say that few people really understand how it works. To make life more complicated, it has spawned scores of other cryptocurrencies, all based on complex computer-driven calculations but with different levels of liquidity and transparency. “We have seen UHNW individuals and family offices looking into cryptocurrencies and becoming interested in allocating some portion of their investments into crypto,” says Calvin Koo, a Hong Kong-based lawyer at Kobre & Kim. “But it’s important to make sure investors don’t inadvertently step into a minefield.” Recommended Clearly, what makes the crypto field tempting are the stories of those who have struck gold. Ro is reluctant to say how much she is worth as a result of her bitcoin punt, as she has been targeted by scammers and has received death threats after talking about the subject. But she was able to leave full-time banking in 2017 — the year of bitcoin’s first significant rally, when prices rose from just above $800 to almost $20,000. Bitcoin’s surge to $63,000 earlier this year increased Ro’s fortune. “Let’s just say, I have done very well. I have gone from being a banker to working at a non-profit,” says Ro, who studied at Yale and Columbia universities. “Getting in early because the tech seemed really cool also worked out as an investment, so that’s also pretty cool.” Being an early investor meant she has had to try a dozen exchanges, suffered hacks and been locked out of investments. Her friends have also done well from her foray, as she recalls giving them bitcoin “just to test out how it works”. “I wasn’t surprised by bitcoin doing well, but there were always a lot of risks. There were hacks, regulatory risks and exchanges going bust,” she says. “Crypto used to be messy. Now there are multimillion-dollar companies being built.” Another early believer is Olivier Janssens, a Belgian-born entrepreneur who states his profession on LinkedIn as an investor in bitcoin since 2010. He is also proudly “self-educated” with an attraction to “libertarian and voluntarist” ideas and forged a career as a software entrepreneur. In 2014, when bitcoin was trading at around €600, he became the first person to pay for a flight by private jet with the cryptocurrency. He settled the bill for the trip from Brussels to Nice with, he estimates, 15 bitcoin — in hindsight, a pretty costly trip. “[That] would be worth about €400,000 today,” he says. Crypto used to be messy. Now there are multimillion-dollar companies being built Janssens has also realised actual losses in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, notably in the saga of the collapsed exchange Mt. Gox, one of the largest crypto-linked financial failures. More recently, the huge gain in the price has left early investors like Janssens dealing with the problem of having too much bitcoin as a proportion of their overall portfolio. Some bitcoin investors who vow never to sell their cryptocurrencies are known as “hodlers” (holding on for dear life). “I sometimes rebalance my portfolio when it becomes 50 per cent of my assets. I’m smart enough to sell sometimes — I’m not a hardcore hodler,” says Janssens. Seven years after the Belgian’s historic trip, paying for private charters by bitcoin is not quite mainstream but no longer newsworthy. More than one in 10 flights were settled with bitcoin in January at jet-hire company PrivateFly, where the share of cryptocurrency revenues grew to a fifth of the total. Denison, a US luxury yacht charter company, published a list of its 372-strong fleet in February with prices in bitcoin. Recommended However, Janssens is slightly disappointed in bitcoin’s evolution from a peer-to-peer means of payment to a perceived store of value, which he says is “completely against the original aim” of the cryptocurrency. “It’s interesting to see big companies buy bitcoin as a digital gold, but I have personally shifted my focus to currencies like ethereum,” he says. There are hundreds if not thousands of alternative coins with varying characteristics. Like bitcoin, all are created by computers solving complex mathematical equations, churning out digital code. Some, known as “shitcoins”, are created purely as get-rich-quick schemes. Janssens is among wealthy investors who think ethereum, launched in 2015 and now the second-most traded cryptocurrency, could be bigger than its erstwhile peer. Supporters say it could rewire the financial infrastructure. Billionaire financiers Mike Novogratz, Peter Thiel and Alan Howard are among investors who recently announced their backing of a venture that relies on ethereum. Bitcoin might drop 20% in a day but it’s still up 85% this year; it’s about how far out you see the big picture While bitcoin is just a piece of digital code, ethereum acts as a store of data and a marketplace for assets as well. It can perform the tasks of brokers, exchanges and other intermediaries, with the help of so-called embedded smart contracts. These ensure transaction details are correct, funds are paid and assets change hands as set out in a preprogrammed piece of code. Ethereum is also behind most non-fungible tokens, which are digital representations of things, people or concepts that investors can buy in the form of units of data stored on a secure computer ledger — artworks, for example. Christie’s, the UK auction house, is preparing for the sale of digital tokens created around the works of American artist Andy Warhol. “Digital art is gaining momentum,” says Emma Cunningham, a Christie’s spokesperson. But not everyone is convinced the future is bitcoin-shaped. The cryptocurrency’s volatility might be attractive to investors seeking fortunes. Those who are already wealthy, though, often avoid the rough and tumble. “Our clients have already created substantial wealth, so they’re in preservation mode and only a very small proportion of clients have the high risk tolerance required for crypto,” says Mohammed Kamal Syed, head of asset management at Coutts, the UK bank. That does not mean UHNW individuals will ignore the siren call of extreme profits, says Syed. “All clients have Fomo [fear of missing out], all the time. But with crypto, if anything, they’re bewildered; they don’t understand why it’s gone up or down — because no one knows,” he says. Sky-high valuations this year have raised fears of a bubble — an outcome some hedge funds backed by wealthy investors are betting on. “I believe we have passed the point of peak speculation — crypto and bitcoin have this glamorous image, but that will get questioned ultimately,” says Barry Norris, chief executive and fund manager at Argonaut Capital, a London-based equity specialist. He has started shorting crypto exchange Coinbase and software company MicroStrategy, a corporate holder of bitcoin. Recommended Cryptocurrencies also face broader challenges. A growing concern is their environmental impact — a Cambridge university study suggests the computers used to generate bitcoin consume more electricity than Sweden. Meanwhile, governments in the US, China and the EU are raising questions about the sector’s potential instability and lack of transparency. Criminal investigators say cryptocurrencies can be used for financing terrorism or other illegal activities, while tax inspectors are focusing on investors’ huge capital gains. Koo at Kobre & Kim says that despite a reputation for anonymity, cryptocurrency transactions are a lot more traceable than most investors think. “Many UHNW individuals value privacy for different reasons, so they often have to make a choice between privacy and security,” he says. But despite these concerns, the potential returns keep the investors coming, including family offices. “You can’t find alpha like this in any other asset class,” says Kevin Kang, founding principal of New York-based cryptocurrency hedge fund BKCoin, whose clients include rich individuals. Kang and his co-founder, Carlos Betancourt, manage $50m of assets in the fund they established in 2018. Among the better-known individual cryptocurrency enthusiasts is Derrick Brown, a former NBA basketball player. Now chief executive of US venture company Free Fenix, he says he is “an investor first and foremost, who also happened to play sports in the past”. He adds that were he starting his sporting career now, he would ask for part of his pay to be in crypto. Brown first invested in cryptocurrencies partly through an allocation in specialist hedge fund BlockTower. “I look at everything from a diversification standpoint,” he says, noting that less than 5 per cent of his portfolio is allocated to cryptocurrency. “Bitcoin might drop 20 per cent in a day, but year to date it’s still up 85 per cent; it’s about how far out you see the big picture,” he adds. Ro agrees. “This is a market at an experimental stage and this is what happens,” she says. “I’m a typical hodler. I believe in crypto in the long run, but I’m not going to put all my life savings in it. I have stocks, real estate, jewellery, art . . . it’s about diversification.” This article is part of FT Wealth, a section providing in-depth coverage of philanthropy, entrepreneurs, family offices, as well as alternative and impact investment For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click,,Eva Szalay,2021-06-14T03:00:23.444Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/4b3f5b58-ea12-4119-955b-7bd4a349d566,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Another Tory shoots for crypto glory,“This Treasury needs to create a safe space for cryptocurrency development.”,You might remember that back in those carefree days of autumn 2018 — when we all still worked within spitting distance from other humans; when Boris Johnson was a backbench Tory MP and Dom Cummings just a glint in his eye — we initiated a series called “What’s the Tory crypto story?”. Why? Well, a number of Tory parliamentarians — Grant “Michael Green” Shapps, Baroness “cryptocurrency expert” Mone, and Eddie “a blockchain for Bloxwich” Hughes, to name but a few — had got decidedly excited about the potential of the distributed technicolour dream-ledger and the wondrous strings of 1s and 0s that run on it (which some call “cryptocurrencies”). With Mone’s “EQUI” project having flopped pretty spectacularly, Shapps deciding to quit the ICO he was “advising” as soon as we found out about it because he “just want(ed his) time back”, and with the market town of Bloxwich still apparently not actually running on a blockchain, it has been a bit quiet on that front lately. Yes, Cummings recently came out as a blockchain bro but these days he’s largely just a blogger, and it’s not like he was ever running the country or anything like that (don’t be so cynical). Fear not though, all ye coiners, as there is a new kid on the Tory crypto block and he is here to help. Introducing Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Conservative MP for Tonbridge and Malling, a former Territorial Army officer and co-founder of the China Research Group: As Tugendhat told crypto podcast Bankless, this was — believe it or not — the first mention of “the flippening” in our great parliament (“the flippening” is crypto parlance for the hypothetical moment that the “market cap” of ether, the crypto token underpinning ethereum, overtakes that of bitcoin). A proud moment for Britain. The video embedded in the tweet is just a partial clip of Tugendhat’s comments during the May 18 Queen’s Speech debate (which wasn’t actually about crypto or fintech or anything of the sort; this was shoehorned into a debate on housing). Tugendhat posted the full thing on Facebook, which you can watch here. If you’d rather not, here’s an excerpt (emphasis here, and elsewhere, ours): This bill - this speech - does not cover the changing nature of currency, the changing nature of the economy, and the innovations that we’re seeing online through various forms of cryptocurrencies. I’m not going to go in, in the few moments left to me, of (sic) the flippening and why I’m going to be bullish on ether and not bitcoin, or the nature of the change in the Treasury that is needed to enable innovation that sees the sharing of prosperity on a global basis rather than a local one . . .  This Treasury needs to create a safe space for cryptocurrency development. Because setting the standard for this new economy will shape a new electronic age; a new digital world. Just as our laws - the laws passed in this place and in that old parliament - created the trading economy that enabled so many to prosper under concepts of individual ownership, of corporate responsibility, and indeed private power - we now need to see those values injected into a new change. If we do not get this right, those standards will be set by authoritarian governments with no interest in innovation, or in wild places where there is no regulation and no accountability. As we come to the end of this Queen’s Speech tomorrow I hope the government - and the Treasury in particular - will reflect very hard on the nature of crypto exchanges because they fundamentally will be underpinning, the understanding, of a new trading world. Tugendhat also recently posted a monologue on SoundCloud following his speech in parliament, in which he goes into a bit more detail, concluding with this: When the queen’s head leaves the coin and goes on to the blockchain it will be because that constancy that she has enabled through her reign has enabled innovation, entrepreneurialism - adventures, if you like, off it - and given people the confidence and stability to know that whatever change comes, it won’t disorientate and it won’t leave them lost. That’s the speech I wanted to give. I hope it makes sense. Thank you for listening. Now when we heard this we felt a little bad about dashing his hopes, but we had to be honest: it made absolutely no sense to us at all. So we thought we’d better get Tugendhat on the blower and ask him to clarify. Our first question for Tugendhat was a fairly obvious one: in his entry in the Register of Members’ Financial Interests, there was no mention of any crypto HODLings. Yet in parliament he said he’s “bullish” on ether. So we asked, does he hold any of the thinking man’s crypto? Oh, pennies. I don’t have any money, I’m an MP. Right. So how many pennies? Oh about £500? Something like that - not more. Peanuts. We put it to him that given he had bought some crypto, it struck as a little bit unethical that he seemed to be shilling it in parliament, particularly given that he hadn’t disclosed his holdings. For £500? It’s peanuts. When we put it to him that £500 is not actually “peanuts” for many people and that, furthermore, in the Wild West of crypto, things can increase in value by several-thousand per cent at the drop of an Elon Musk tweet, he said: It’s not like I put thousands of per cent in there. I put pennies in there and they bounce around. All I’m doing at the moment is using it to see how the thing works. I’m not investing in it. I don’t have a serious investment in it and I’m not going to have a serious investment in it, because I don’t — it’s not something I have. We guess because he didn’t put “thousands of per cent in there”, it’s fair enough that he didn’t disclose it. Ahem. At this point, we began to feel that Tugendhat didn’t have the firmest grip on what he was talking about. And this feeling intensified when he started talking about “predict(ing) the future”: People look at it like it’s currency - it’s not currency, it’s nothing to do with currency. It’s to do with the ability to understand and predict the future - effectively to write algorithms that answer future questions on the basis of considerations agreed today. That’s what Ethereum’s decentralised contracts are - effectively they’re ways of doing legal cases without courts . . .  That’s what it’s all about, it’s not about whether bitcoin gets to $50,000. That’s why I’m bullish on ethereum not bitcoin. Bitcoin might well get to $100m, I haven’t got a clue - there you’re just speculating on gold, that’s all you’re doing. Whereas with ethereum you’re speculating on future contracts, based on a different kind of ledger - one that doesn’t require a complete redrawing of the ledger every time you draw on it. Look, Tugendhat seemed to us like a decent enough guy. He was a good sport on the phone and admitted that some of what he had said was “because I’m a politician and I’m trying to get heard”. But Ethereum’s “algorithms” cannot predict the future and talking about the “flippening” — which is not about whether the ethereum blockchain is going to enable some kind of new trading environment, but about people selling their bitcoin and buying ether — in parliament, particularly when you are a holder of ether and other cryptos yourself, seems . . . a bit off. And no, the Treasury certainly does not need to create a “safe space” (read: loosely regulated environment) for cryptocurrency development — it’s rather too “safe” already, if you ask us. FT Alphaville feels quite strongly that if you are going to choose to talk about something like this in parliament, your understanding of the subject matter should be . . . better than Tugendhat’s words suggest his is.

https://www.ft.com/content/424b29c4-07bf-4612-b7d6-76aecf8e1528,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,What are cryptocurrencies and stablecoins and how do they work?,The digital tokens have grown into a popular and often highly volatile asset class,Cryptocurrencies, which first emerged in the wake of the global financial crisis, offered a vision of money free from central bank control. Since their creation, they have boomed into a highly volatile and divisive asset class. Bitcoin, the most traded cryptocurrency by volume, has a market value of around $700bn alone, according to CoinMarketCap, but can suffer huge losses from a single tweet. Policymakers have grown increasingly concerned about potential fallout from cryptocurrency markets, launching crackdowns and regulatory consultations. Proponents argue cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to centralised financial systems, a way to wrest control from central banks and stimulate innovation; but the market has also been exploited by fraudsters, while their creation has raised environmental concerns and the spectre of wider financial implications. Here is a guide to the key concepts: Cryptocurrencies are pieces of digital code that are traded as an asset. These digital coins are built on blockchain, a decentralised ledger technology that offers a permanent, immutable record of transactions divided among different nodes. Proponents claim that this offers greater autonomy and privacy. New units are created by computers solving complex equations, a process known as mining. The oldest and best-known cryptocurrency is bitcoin, which launched in 2009. Today there are thousands of digital coins available to buy and sell, but only a handful — such as bitcoin and ethereum — are traded on key exchanges. Cryptocurrencies have steadily crept into the mainstream over the past year as bitcoin gained popularity, and its price has soared, despite its high volatility. In the first few months of 2021, bitcoin rose 116 per cent to a high of over $60,000 per coin, before crashing over 40 per cent since mid April. Crypto exchange Coinbase became the first main company in the space to go public, listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange in March. There are also growing concerns about the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies as the process of “mining” some popular coins is highly energy intensive. This process not only creates new coins, but is crucial to the functioning of the overall network because this is how transactions are logged and verified. Recommended Fears about possible market manipulation, scams and the use of digital assets to finance nefarious activities, such as ransom payments demanded by the hackers who shut down the Colonial fuel pipeline in the US this month, have also caught the attention of global regulators, including the US, China and South Korea. In the broadest sense, cryptocurrencies can be divided into two camps: bitcoin and the thousands of “alt-coins” created after it. While bitcoin remains the top cryptocurrency by market cap, several other coins have gained traction among investors. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has emerged as a contender for bitcoin’s crown owing to its use in the rapidly growing world of decentralised finance, or “DeFi”. Aimed at eliminating intermediaries, DeFi uses computer codes known as smart contracts to conduct and settle transactions in real time. While many alt-coins are designed for serious use cases, there is a large class that are designed as jokes, and some have been involved in “pump and dump” schemes that have caused investors to endure losses. Among the alt-coin universe, dogecoin has achieved huge popularity in recent months. Launched as a joke in 2013 and named after a popular meme of a Shiba Inu dog, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has plugged the coin, causing its value to rise nearly 7,000 per cent since the start of the year despite suffering losses during a cryptocurrency rout last week. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, stablecoins claim to be pegged to other assets, including traditional “fiat” currencies such as the US dollar or other digital assets. They promise lower volatility, which makes them useful for converting between fiat and other cryptocurrencies. Stable coins have seen a huge surge in popularity mainly because they are used in DeFi transactions. Central banks are also exploring them as part of projects around digital currencies. However, many stablecoins lack consumer protections and provide patchy, frequently unaudited accounts of the reserves meant to back their coins. Tether, the $60bn stablecoin, was fined $18.5m by the New York attorney-general over allegations it lied about its reserves. It did not admit or deny wrongdoing in the matter. Central bank digital currencies are official efforts to create a digital version of money using distributed ledger technology. CBDCs are central banks’ attempts to keep control of the monetary and payments system. They would be reserve-backed currencies and could use some of the blockchain technology originally proposed as a way to decentralise markets. These efforts have accelerated as policymakers have grown concerned that private initiatives such as Facebook’s proposed cryptocurrency could have effects on cross-border money transfers and the effectiveness of monetary policy. In most countries, CBDC plans are at an early stage. Officials are considering key questions such as whether the digital coins would be usable for international transactions or just domestically, as well as assessing the impact of these decisions on the broader financial system. The most advanced projects are in China, Sweden and the Bahamas. However, a survey from the Bank for International Settlements showed that central banks representing a fifth of the world’s population have said they would likely issue a digital representation of their domestic currencies. Emerging markets showed interest in these projects, but in recent months discussions have picked up in the US, Europe and the UK.

https://www.ft.com/content/ea38da33-1c20-4281-9ebb-2963fc1798cf,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Yes bitcoin’s crashing but you can now buy “bitcoin pizza” with . . .  dollars,When buying the f**king dip means buying the BBQ sauce.,You might have noticed that the price of bitcoin is going er, to da Earth. Over the past 24 hours it has fallen by about a third 40 per cent to just above $36,000, $34,000, $30,000 (although at this point we not only can’t keep up but also can’t even be sure because a number of price sources seem to be having issues pulling data — go figure). In fact, the whole of the crypto space is a bit of a bloodbath, to put it frankly. That darned technoking eh. Oh and China too — they banned financial and payment institutions from providing cryptocurrency services overnight. China is NGMI. So what you really want at at a time like this — short of another tweet from Elon which, let’s be honest, would be by far and away the best thing for creepto right now — is a compelling reason to buy it. All the better if it comes from one of the big names in the crypto world. Enter Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano — a man who objects to being called a bitcoin bro but continues to channel the vibe of a bitcoin bro regardless: As can be seen from the tweet, the Pomp is launching his own pizza company, Bitcoin Pizza. And to mark the 11-year anniversary of the first time someone paid for something — pizza — in bitcoin, Bitcoin Pizza will only be accepting er *checks notes* dollars. The video doesn’t seem to be on YouTube but you can watch it on Twitter by clicking here. In case you CBA, here is a partial transcript: What’s up guys? Bang, bang. [?!] Everybody knows there’s two things I love more than anything else in the world: bitcoin and pizza. That’s why today, we’re announcing Bitcoin Pizza. That’s right. What is Bitcoin Pizza? Bitcoin Pizza is a new national pizza chain that allows you to eat tasty pizza while also supporting bitcoin developers. Here’s how it works: you head to eatbitcoinpizza.com, you order the pizza that you want, you select the day and time that you want it delivered straight to your door, and a local pizzeria in your town will go ahead, they’ll make the pizza, they’ll put it in one of these awesome boxes that we’ve created, and they’ll have it delivered! Right to you, on the specified day and time. Hold on, hold on. You can order pizza straight to your door?! In a box? This is sounding pretty disruptive. Pomp continues: We’ll take 100% of the profits from this pilot and we’re donating it to the Human Rights Foundation Bitcoin Developers’ Fund. That’s right when you buy bitcoin pizza what happens is you’re actually funding bitcoin development. Well honestly thank God someone is looking after the human rights of the bitcoin developers. But what about the local pizzerias? As it turns out: When you order pizza at eatbitcoinpizza.com not only are you getting tasty food but you’re also supporting a small business and bitcoin developers around the world. Got it. So rather than supporting your local business by, say, ordering directly from them, this way you can actually make sure you can redirect some of their potential income into the pockets of bitcoin developers instead. One has to wonder: why didn’t anyone think of this before? But as Pomp points out it’s all in the name of decentralisation: Now we have to be honest, not everyone was as thrilled as us about this new non-bitcoin-accepting venture: But whatever. Haters gon hate. Have Fun Staying Poor bro. Honestly, if news of upcoming bitcoin-themed pizza disruption isn’t enough to shore up the prices, what will? Surely, exchanges won’t have to resort to mysteriously synchronised unplanned maintenance episodes to guard against too much capital flight? Oh but what’s this? By the power of digital transmutation of the Northern Rock queue, at pixel time, Coinbase was down. Down as in actually not functioning we mean, though the recently-listed stock was also down about 10 per cent in pre-market trading. Keep calm and HODL on everyone. Nothing to see here.

https://www.ft.com/content/529eb4e6-796a-4e81-8064-5967bbe3b4d9,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Tether says its reserves are  backed by cash to the tune of . . .  2.9%,Rather far off from the 100% it used to claim isn’t it?! But still, we now have “unrivaled transparency” AKA pie charts!,Sooooo remember Tether? The last time we wrote about the “dollar-backed” stablecoin around these parts was back in February, after the New York District Attorney’s office decided to suspend the company — and sister crypto exchange Bitfinex — and fined them $18.5m in a settlement because of their “illegal activities” in the state. That was, you might recall, on the basis that the companies had deceived the market by overstating their reserves, and by covering up approximately $850m in losses. You might have thought all this would have some kind of negative impact on Tether — which is pegged to the dollar — or even the wider crypto market, given how much crypto trading is done via Tether. But no, don’t be silly this is CREEPTO!! Since the settlement in February, when Tether was worth a piddling $35bn, it’s actually increased its circulation by more than $20bn to about $58bn. But what does this number actually mean? Yes, it represents the total value of these tokens that are washing about the cryptosphere, but what stands behind them? Tether used to claim all its tokens were backed one to-one by US dollars held in cash reserves, but in an April 2019 affadavit, its general counsel Stuart Hoegner revealed that in fact only 74 per cent of Tethers were backed by “cash and cash equivalents”, with the rest in a “less liquid form”. Under the terms of its February settlement with the NYAG, Tether agreed that it would provide quarterly breakdowns of the assets backing its tokens. So, on Thursday it appeared to say it had done that, as proudly announced by Chief Technical Officer Paolo Ardoino on Twitter (though rather than referring to the NYAG he says it is the “#crypto community” that asked for it 🤔): That link in the tweet takes you here, to a PDF demonstrating its unrivalled transparency, which is a whole . . . one page long. It doesn’t appear to have been audited but who cares, it’s not like trusting intermediaries is a problem for this community is it? Here is the breakdown, as of March 31 2021 — it should be noted that this is the first time since launching in 2014 that Tether has actually released any kind of breakdown of its reserves, so to that extent yes, unrivalled indeed: As you can see, the blue pie chart shows that 75.85 per cent of Tether’s reserves are, according to the company, backed by “Cash & Cash Equivalents & Other Short-Term Deposits & Commercial Paper”. The smaller, orangier pie chart breaks down that 75.85 per cent, and it turns out that the stablecoin that used to say it was 100 per cent backed by cash reserves is in fact . . . 2.9 per cent backed by cash reserves (3.87 per cent of the 75.85 per cent). Fancy that! We asked the NYAG’s office whether this would satisfy their reporting requirements and they told us: We cannot confirm if this will suffice at this time. An interesting response. At this time. Before we move on to the rest of the breakdown, we asked some of our friends — well-known FUDsters, as our beloved crypto-enthusiast commenters will no doubt point out — what they made of the fact that only 2.9 per cent of Tether’s reserves were in cash? Frances Coppola, financial commentator and operatic wonder, told us (emphasis ours here and throughout): Tether’s reserves analysis published today confirms what many people have said for a long time, namely that Tether has almost no cash dollars on its balance sheet. Actual “cash” is 3.87% of what Tether describes as “cash and cash equivalents, which in turn make up only 75% of its total assets. We know from the March attestation that nearly all of Tether’s liabilities consist of tokens it has issued. And we now know there are hardly any real dollars backing these tokens. We have come a long way since Tether claimed on its website that all USDT in existence were 100% backed by real US dollars. Yup. Indeed. It’s almost like Tether thinks it is some kind of bank, isn’t it? Well, kind of. In the 2019 affadavit, Hoegner pointed out that commercial banks operate under a similar “fractional reserve” system, and that this was “hardly a novel concept”. But 2.9 per cent is really quite the fraction isn’t it? And the difference here, of course, is that commercial banks are subject to stringent regulations and thorough independent audits, neither of which apply to Tether. When we asked Tether about this a couple of months ago, Hoegner told us that “Tether does not purport to be a bank, call itself a bank, or carry on a banking business”, and that “Tether Limited is registered as a money services business” and was regulated as such. So it doesn’t purport to be a bank, but it points out that it operates a fractional reserve system like banks. Doesn’t that crypto-cake taste so damn good when you can have it and eat it all at the same time? Martin Walker, director of banking and finance at the Centre For Evidence-Based Management, told us: It is pretty clear looking at the makeup of the reserves — a tiny proportion of the reserves are cash on account at banks — that Tether is operating like a bank but with none of the normal disclosure. They are creating a dollar substitute and basically running a banking and payments business but without the oversight that anyone else doing a similar kind of business would have. How the peg in value between Tether and the USD at exchanges is preserved is beyond any reasonable economic explanation. The resilience of the Tether dollar peg shows there is something rotten in the state of the whole crypto market. And Nicholas Weaver, a lecturer in computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, said: It’s clearly a wildcat bank. The cryptocurrency community seems intent on speed-running half a millennia of economic failure, and this is just simply one of the cases. So what about the rest of the reserves? As you can see in the pie charts, the rest of the “cash and cash equivalents” are broken down as follows: commercial paper (65.39 per cent); fiduciary deposits (24.20 per cent); reverse repo notes (3.60 per cent); and Treasury bills (2.94 per cent). Commercial paper, therefore, represents about half of Tether’s collateral. So which companies’ debt is it that Tether holds via this commercial paper, we hear you ask (we presume it is of the highest quality)? Well they don’t tell us! On this Coppola said: The reserve analysis also shows that Tether’s assets are made up mainly of various forms of long and short-term corporate debt. We do not know if this debt is secured or unsecured, nor what the assets backing it are (if there are any). And we have no idea who the borrowers are, except that long-term loans are not made to Tether’s “affiliates”. The reserves are thus exposed to unknown levels of credit and liquidity risk. I would have expected to see far higher levels of genuine cash equivalents such as T-bills and insured deposit accounts in a reserve report for a financial institution that claims to guarantee redemption at par. There is a very real possibility that in the event of a run on USDT, Tether would be unable to realise sufficient real USD to meet redemption requests. The 1:1 peg to the USD is therefore not remotely credible. If the numbers that Tether reports are accurate — which because they are unaudited we cannot be sure of — then it looks like just over 20 per cent of its reserves are made up of liquid, quality assets. That’s the 2.9 per cent of cash plus the fiduciary deposits, which make up about 18 per cent of the total reserves. And the rest? Well as Walker says: It’s extremely difficult to make judgments about the liquidity or credit worthiness of the other assets making up the reserves because they simply haven’t disclosed sufficient information. We would be somewhat surprised if the NYAG is satisfied by this level of disclosure. Tether have given us some numbers, yes, but they are not audited, and they do not give us nearly enough information to be able to judge what would happen if a large number of people tried to redeem their Tethers for dollars at the same time. Over the coming months, Tether might find itself facing tougher scrutiny. In December, members of the US Congress presented a legislative proposal for the so-called “STABLE Act”, which would require stablecoins like Tether to obtain full banking licenses. “The idea here is to build on the lessons that came out of the 2008 financial crisis, about how to regulate shadow banking and shadow finance,” Rohan Grey, assistant law professor at the Willamette University College of Law, who has been working on the new legislation with Congress, told us. Grey continued: The idea that (stablecoins are) part of the business of banking, and should be regulated as such, is something that is increasingly being acknowledged across the spectrum The growing world of stablecoins arguably underpins the entire crypto community right now. If that collapses, the whole space could collapse. Additional reporting by Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan.

https://www.ft.com/content/c9f5a75a-3e67-4a06-bc4c-182698c8a5df,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Law firms chase a piece of the crypto action,The legal grey areas in this field have opened up opportunities for lawyers to become trusted advisers,When Scott Thiel first tried to talk to colleagues and contacts about digital tokenisation almost three years ago, he says it was like “shouting into a hurricane”. The DLA Piper lawyer had spent days holed up in a Hong Kong attic writing a paper on the implications of digital proofs of ownership for virtual or physical assets. But many potential clients were still wary after the so-called crypto winter of 2018, when cryptocurrencies fell in value dramatically. Now, that audience has suddenly started listening. Cryptocurrencies have taken off — bitcoin’s value has jumped 400 per cent in the past year. And interest in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) — a digital token or digital collectible — exploded this year after an NFT representing a digital work by artist Beeple sold for $69.3m in an online auction at Christie’s in March. Lawyers are trialling new approaches and technology to make business faster and more transparent. Scroll down to read case studies in best practice It later emerged that the buyer owns an NFT fund and already owns Beeple’s work, so the figure may not ultimately represent the true value of NFTs. However, an NFT for the first ever tweet was sold for $2.9m by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, while an NFT for a gif of a flying cat sold for more than $500,000. Recommended In essence, non-fungible tokens are lines of code, letters and numbers saved on the blockchain: an immutable register on a network of computers and also the digital ledger underpinning cryptocurrencies. When artists sell an NFT, they do not sell the underlying artwork and they retain intellectual property rights to their work. NFTs are similar to certificates of ownership but, importantly, are not actually attached to an underlying physical asset, or legally binding. Still, the scope for digital tokenisation, more generally, is wide. Thiel — who studied law and computer science at the University of Melbourne and has spent most of his career as a technology lawyer — says it is also possible to issue a token that is backed by a physical asset, such as a painting, property or wine collection. This conveys ownership of the asset and turns that asset into something that can be digitised, traded and put on the blockchain. DLA Piper and its Aldersgate subsidiary, which sets up and runs new businesses outside traditional legal services, has built a blockchain-based tokenisation engine. Called Toko, it allows companies to create fractions of any asset and issue security tokens that can be traded. This type of token could help asset owners tap into new sources of funding and reach a wider group of potential investors, argues Thiel. It could also improve the liquidity of certain assets — such as a wine collection — that cannot easily be traded on an electronic exchange. Last November, Toko’s first project was tokenising a piece of fine art commissioned and purchased by a group of Thiel’s Hong Kong partners at DLA Piper, as an unregulated security offering. Recommended The painting by Chinese artist Wang Xiaobo, depicts a white horse grazing in a meadow with vivid orange flowers. The painting was divided into 16 squares, with one digital token created for each square. Each tokenholder has a one-sixteenth image of the painting on the token and also has paid for and owns the same fraction of the painting. “There was a bit of a market, with some partners wanting the sky and others wanting the flowers,” Thiel says. Toko can handle NFTs (backed by virtual assets such as a video clip) as well as digital tokens that represent fractions of a physical asset, such as a building or painting or intellectual property rights. “This is where it becomes exciting — we say to clients, what do you want to do?” Thiel says. It was easier for us to build a tokenisation engine than it is for technology firms to build a law firm In theory, investors will gain access to assets previously unavailable to them, and asset owners will be able to create unique product structures. A real estate owner, for example, could fractionalise an iconic building — usually an illiquid asset — into 100,000 digital tokens representing parts of the building, and the tokens could be sold and traded by investors. However, potential users, including clients, have to be aware of the many compliance risks around digital token issuance. Anyone dealing with digital tokens must understand their status under US securities law, for instance. The crypto world is so new that it is unclear whether an individual token or NFT would have the characteristics of an investment contract, meaning it would be regulated under US law. Recommended With so much hype surrounding NFTs and digital tokenisation, investors may be wary of a bubble and a clampdown by global regulators. Allen Huang, associate professor of accounting at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, warns that NFTs and digital tokens give rise to legal ambiguities. One question is which country taxes are payable in when an asset is held virtually on the internet. “There are also regulatory issues about how to stop people using NFTs for money laundering,” Huang says. “And there are issues around blockchain, especially some of the newer ones: what happens if you have an NFT held on one particular blockchain and that blockchain becomes defunct after a few years?” This is where law firms could have an advantage over tech company rivals, because they can ensure the tokens are legally compliant and give investors confidence. Indeed, Thiel says clients are reassured that a law firm is involved. “It’s a complex legal environment, but tech companies want to build something as quickly as they can,” he says. “It was easier for us to build a tokenisation engine than it is for technology firms to build a law firm,” he notes. “Technology firms don’t understand the complexities of securities law in 50-plus markets around the world.” Recommended Huang agrees that it gives investors a degree of reassurance when professional advisers move into this market: “Investors are definitely more comfortable with traditional players stepping in and with law firms or big accountants playing a clarifying role.” He notes that law firms have become more innovative in recent years in areas such as smart contracts and are hiring people with legal and programming knowledge. “[Law firms] also realise that these companies are now becoming big businesses — as well as potential clients — and they cannot simply ignore them and stay stuck in the 20th century.” That “trusted adviser” role may come under increasing scrutiny, as the rush for NFTs and digital tokens shows little sign of slowing. High valuations of tokens lead some to believe the market has become a bubble. In March, a work by UK street artist Banksy was burnt and destroyed in a video streamed on social media. An NFT representing the video was then sold for $380,000. The original work — titled, ironically, “Morons” — depicted an auction at Christie’s. “Does it mean NFTs are a bubble? I think it does, but it does not mean NFTs have no value,” Huang says. “In the future, I see artists or musicians using NFTs to . . . allow people who buy NFTs to attend special talks or get exclusive access to a music gig or videos. “Before this type of technology, it was difficult [for artists] to know who held their artwork or who were their biggest supporters.” Researched and compiled by RSG Consulting. “Winner” indicates the organisation won an FT Innovative Lawyers 2021 award; other organisations are listed alphabetically. Lawyers are trialling new approaches and technology to make business faster and more transparent. WINNER: DLA Piper Working with blockchain company Hedera Hashgraph, the firm’s lawyers designed the first asset-backed security token on a blockchain platform. Blockchain increases efficiency by automating processes so they can run outside trading hours and also require lower transaction fees. The automated nature of the platform limits ways in which the tokens can be misused. The firm has demonstrated proof of concept by tokenising a piece of fine art. Commended: Scott Thiel. Atsumi & Sakai The firm worked with Japan Post — the logistics, insurance and banking company — to centralise its whistleblowing procedures after the Japanese stalwart mis-sold insurance, causing a scandal in the country. Complaints, which used to be handled by 49 departments, can now be logged through a single platform. The firm’s approach is notable in Japan for prioritising the whistleblower. Hogan Lovells Partner Mark Parsons worked with the Hong Kong Association of Banks to create a new regulatory framework for the use of application programming interfaces (APIs) in the financial services sector in Hong Kong. The framework is designed to create a collaborative and flexible contract-based open banking regulatory system, allowing banks and API users to compete to introduce more services and products. Commended: Mark Parsons. King & Wood Mallesons The firm advised a consortium of three leading Australian banks alongside IBM, the US tech group, and Scentre Group, a Sydney-based shopping centre company, on the launch of Lygon, a platform that enables banks to issue guarantees digitally using blockchain technology. The law firm designed the legal framework, which allows for the guarantees to be issued digitally, and convinced the banks — Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and ANZ Bank — to agree to a standardised wording for the document. This is the first project globally to use live financial instruments on a blockchain, cutting the time taken to issue a guarantee from one month to one day. Kirkland & Ellis The firm has built a special purpose acquisition company (Spac) team for Asia-Pacific, drawing on its private equity, mergers and acquisitions and capital markets practices, which have experience in Wall Street’s fast-growing Spac market. The firm concluded seven deals in the first quarter of 2021. Nishimura & Asahi Using legal expertise, communications, diplomacy and corporate strategy, the firm successfully defended Japanese manufacturing company Toshiba Machine and amusement park operator Tokyo Dome from hostile takeovers in 2020. The rarity of corporate raiders and activist investors in Japan meant that the law firm had to call on suitably adapted defence strategies from other jurisdictions. Commended: Yo Ota. Singularity Legal The firm has helped expand India’s nascent litigation finance market over the past year. It has assisted businesses in funding cases that are collectively worth more than $1.4bn, and is advising funders and financial institutions on structuring transactions in India. Singularity Legal is a founder member of the Indian Association for Litigation Finance, launched in 2017, which brings together funders, lawyers, service providers and arbitral institutions to develop self-regulation for litigation finance.,,Jane Croft,2021-05-13T21:22:46.663Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/c982082b-c890-4880-b438-f8b3cae83a4b,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Billionaires Peter Thiel and Alan Howard back new $10bn crypto exchange,The venture, Bullish Global, is betting on decentralised finance disrupting traditional markets,Billionaires Peter Thiel, Louis Bacon and Alan Howard are among the backers of a new cryptocurrency asset exchange that will bet heavily on decentralised finance radically reshaping trading and investment in digital assets. The venture, run by blockchain software company Block.one, will be called Bullish Global and has been capitalised with more than $10bn in cash and digital assets ahead of its launch later this year. Hong Kong businessman Richard Li, German financier Christian Angermayer, Michael Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital and Nomura, the Japanese investment bank, have also backed the group. The decentralised finance, or DeFi, market has grown from about $15bn to $65bn since the start of the year, according to analysts at JPMorgan. Supporters say DeFi has the potential to disrupt traditional markets by building a system that bypasses the custodian, record keeping and trading roles that are typically reserved for banks, brokers or exchanges. Block.one has said it will offer automated market making on a decentralised exchange, a development that could potentially offer a radically different way for investors to trade on markets. Instead of using a traditional market maker to persuade buyers and sellers to trade on exchanges, investors will be able to deposit their own assets into a smart contract and let automated computer code handle buying and selling with interested parties. The smart contract will hold funds and take in data, as well as performing settlement and clearing. Owners of assets are incentivised by sharing in the pool of fees that are generated by trading activity. This would replace the so-called “spread” that market makers earn on the difference between the price they pay to purchase assets and the level they are sold at. The process has been compared to YouTube because investors can generate and upload their own content, bypassing established intermediaries. Because all information, including market data and transaction history, is publicly available but anonymous, some experts describe cryptocurrency as the world’s most difficult market to trade in. Trading volumes on decentralised exchanges such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap, which uses the cryptocurrency exchange Binance’s blockchain, have surged in recent months as traders experimented with the technology and leveraged their gains in other speculative cryptocurrencies. Monthly trading activity on Uniswap has repeatedly surpassed that of Coinbase, a listed cryptocurrency exchange. Dave Olsen, president of electronic market maker Jump Trading, said on his corporate webcast last month that DeFi was a potential “game changer” for markets over the next 10 years. Recommended “The intermediaries, the rent-seekers, in financial markets that exist today could very well be disrupted by parties being able to interact directly on [block]chain,” he said. “Bullish’s sheer size and scale combined with Block.one’s experience in high-performance blockchain engineering will make Bullish a formidable player from day one,” said Novogratz, a longtime investor in cryptocurrency technologies. Bullish will use $100m, 164,000 bitcoins, 20m of its own crypto token EOS and an additional $300m strategic investment round for the $10bn capitalisation. Block.one will use its own blockchain, EOS.IO, to handle the business.,,Philip Stafford Eva Szalay,2021-05-11T16:43:30.801Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/2c3dd96c-b1b1-42fd-ab46-8b4791bf1270,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Dogecoin gives away the crypto game,Success of the ‘joke’ currency shows that we shouldn’t take cryptocurrencies too seriously,It has often been hard to make sense of financial markets in 2021. First there was the 1,500 per cent rally in flailing video game retailer GameStop, then there was the $100m valuation of a New Jersey deli, and then there was a 15,000 per cent surge in dogecoin, a cryptocurrency designed as a joke. “Do you want Tesla to accept Doge?” the electric car company’s chief executive and self-styled “technoking” Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers on Tuesday. The tweet was just the latest of several Musk shout-outs to the digital coin, which is based on a meme showing the face of a Shiba Inu dog overlaid with an imaginary inner monologue: “Wow”; “so scare”; “keep ur hands away from me”. Dogecoin functions the same way as bitcoin — it’s a digital token underpinned by a decentralised network of computers that process and keep track of transactions via a digital ledger called a blockchain. But unlike the original cryptocurrency, whose backers use highbrow arguments to justify and shore up its value, dogecoin has been a joke from the outset. Yet while few people are claiming that dogecoin will “democratise finance”, or become “the global reserve currency”, or fundamentally change the world, since its creation in December 2013 it has hugely outperformed bitcoin. While the latter has climbed a remarkable 7,700 per cent during that period, dogecoin has rocketed by an almost unfathomable 200,000 per cent. In other words, if you wanted to make some money on crypto over the past seven-and-a-half years and chose to buy bitcoin rather than dogecoin, the joke’s sort of on you. Dogecoin gives the lie to the idea that we should take bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies terribly seriously. While crypto evangelists might want everyone to buy into the notion that bitcoin is going to take over from the dollar one day, and that we all need to hold some of it in order to protect ourselves from the evil central bankers who want to inflate away the value of our money, the reality is that their arguments are largely just a self-interested attempt to boost the price of cryptocurrencies. Much like a pyramid scheme, those who got in early on bitcoin have a huge financial incentive to draw in others by any means necessary. But while getting rich is clearly the main motivating factor — and some people have indeed managed to become incredibly rich from crypto — it is not the only one. Buying into crypto should be considered akin to gambling and, like gambling, people get into it not just because they might make money, but also because it’s entertaining. It’s no coincidence that cryptocurrencies and “meme-stocks” have surged in a year in which much of the world has been locked up indoors. It is the result of what Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine has called the “boredom markets hypothesis”. Crypto trading is often more accessible than gambling, particularly in places where betting is heavily regulated, such as in the US. It allows buyers to feel like they’re in some kind of tribe. And while the “LOL” factor might not be considered a traditional metric for working out the value of an asset, that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be: clearly, the extent to which it is fun to buy into something has an impact on how much it is bought, and nowhere can that be seen more clearly than in dogecoin. The joke-coin makes a mockery of the idea that crypto investing should be considered a serious pursuit. Its very existence undermines the notion that bitcoin derives value from its scarcity. While bitcoin’s total supply will eventually be capped at 21m, as written into its original source code, there is no limit to the number of copycat cryptocurrencies that compete with it — there are now almost 10,000, and dogecoin itself has no hard supply cap. Dogecoin’s success makes just as much sense as the rest of the crypto market — people buy into these coins because doing so is exciting, it gives them something to do and discuss with their friends, and of course because it can allow them to make a quick buck. But perhaps it can also allow us to stop taking the crypto project quite so seriously. While we’re at it, we might do the same with the stock market. jemima.kelly@ft.com,,Jemima Kelly,2021-05-11T16:28:32.349Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/a1f7a90d-68cc-4854-9896-c538e2be58ca,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Crypto start-up Dfinity set to launch blockchain rival to AWS,‘Internet computer’ project comes with a currency that starts trading on Monday,One of the most ambitious and long-delayed cryptocurrency projects is finally ready to see the light of day, amid signs that it could add a new twist to the speculative frenzy in digital assets when trading officially starts on Monday. Dfinity is set to release what it calls “the internet computer”, a group of technologies intended to support a new generation of decentralised applications and services that are being developed in the blockchain world. Even before its launch this week, futures trading in the digital tokens that will be used to grease the wheels of its internal digital economy suggested it could claim a place among the handful of most highly valued cryptocurrencies. The highly volatile and thin trading at one point put the aggregate value of its tokens at more than $100bn. “A lot of people are looking for the next, best thing — what is the newest, shiniest token on the market,” said Wilson Withiam, an analyst at Messari, a crypto research firm. “It seems absurd for a network that’s just launched. But on the other hand, it’s a high-profile project.” However, despite the frothy advanced trading, he and other crypto experts warned that Dfinity could struggle to differentiate itself in an increasingly crowded market of “smart contract” operators and distributed computing networks that have emerged in the blockchain world. Work on Dfinity began in 2017, just as the first cryptocurrency boom was taking off. It raised more than $120m from a wide group of venture capital firms and hedge funds, led by Andreessen Horowitz and Polychain Capital. Since then, the project’s core software code has been completely rewritten once as its engineering complexity multiplied and its goals shifted. Dfinity set out to build a faster, cheaper alternative to ethereum, the blockchain that introduced “smart contracts”, or software code that automatically executes when certain conditions are met — considered a key building block for the next generation of apps. In the years since, it has also evolved into an alternative to Amazon Web Services and other cloud computing companies, devising software that could replace their centralised networks with a set of distributed data centres run by independent operators. “It does not seem they are doing anything new,” said David Nage, a principal at Arca Funds, which invests in digital assets. “The market has already matured and produced real applications that have uses today.” Recommended These include other ethereum rivals such as Polkadot, Solana and Flow, which have carved out positions in distinct markets such as gaming and a class of digital assets known as NFTs, Nage said. There has also been a wave of new ventures designed to promote distributed computing resources, such as storage services Filecoin and Storj. Dfinity’s “internet computer” amounts to a full set of technologies that replicate what these and other crypto projects are doing. Dominic Williams, the project’s founder, cast it as the single platform for what has come to be known as Web 3.0 — a decentralised set of services that could challenge the power of companies such as Facebook and Google. But he also tried to depict it as a complement to other blockchain projects, for instance allowing other crypto participants to move their computing out of Amazon’s data centres and move it into the Dfinity network. Williams compared the craze in cryptocurrencies to the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s, when the vast majority of speculative ventures imploded, but a handful of survivors went on to become internet giants. “It’s very speculative, it’s very crazy,” he said. “We think in terms of five, ten, twenty-year milestones.”,,Richard Waters,2021-05-09T15:00:12.172Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/fce3785d-ad70-436f-b42e-c478f98941eb,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Bitcoin is making all Revolut’s dreams come true,The company is about to allow bitcoin withdrawals to anywhere in the world for UK Metal account users.,As we all know, Revolut has set out to become one of the Big Boys of Banking. Earlier this year the London-based fintech, which is gearing up for a fundraising that will reportedly value it at between $10bn and $15bn, applied for a full UK banking licence. It has also hired grandees from the world of banking and traditional finance such as the founder of the firm now known as Abrdn, Martin Gilbert, and former Goldman Sachs vice-chair Michael Sherwood. But somewhat paradoxically, Revolut is also setting out to become one of the Big Boys of Bitcoin. It is not hard to see why — the company has never been profitable on an annual basis, even if it has occasionally on a month-to-month basis. And the only months that this has ever been the case have tended to be moments of crypto mania. It was briefly profitable during the bitcoin boom of late-2017, and Revolut said recently that it had been profitable every month since November, during which time bitcoin increased in value by more than 300 per cent. With the company charging 1.5 per cent per transaction and opening 300,000 new crypto wallets per month in December and January — well, you do the math, as they say. But Revolut is planning to change up its bitcoin strategy. Until now there has been what the fintech called a “walled garden” system, whereby you didn’t actually have control of your own bitcoin; rather you had a claim on a certain amount of it and could only withdraw it by switching it back into fiat currency. As of next Thursday, however, customers using their “Revolut Metal” premium account will be allowed to withdraw bitcoin to another bitcoin wallet. This means it will be a real bitcoin transaction, recorded on the real bitcoin blockchain, which has not been the case until now. It will start small-scale, in “beta mode”, with withdrawals restricted to £500 a day or £1,000 a month. Revolut wasn’t actually meant to announce this till next Thursday, but it accidentally did so via a now-deleted blog post on Thursday morning, reported on by AltFi, which the company told us was “due to a scheduling error”. But Revolut did announce it to employees on Wednesday evening, in a company-wide communication. And we get the impression Revolut is quite excited about it all. Employees were told (emojis Revolut’s but emphasis ours): Huge Revolut milestone to announce. Our public beta for crypto withdrawals has now soft launched for all eligible users (UK metal customers). 🚀 And . . . our first user who is not a Rev employee has now successfully withdrawn Bitcoin to their own wallet and this transaction is recorded on the blockchain (wen NFT? 💰) There’s a fun bit at the end after various teams have been thanked: Exciting times 🚀🚀🚀 And also . . . thank to you Bitcoin, for making all our dreams come true — only up 📈 *not investment advice — Bitcoin is a high risk asset not covered by FCSC protection and extremely volatile. Investments may go down as well as up. Thank goodness they added that disclaimer at the end, eh? We were beginning to think they might be some kind of irresponsible crypto bro types, who only seemed interested in making a load of easy money from the huge fees they charge retail investors, and didn’t really seem like the type of people who you’d want to look after your actual hard-earned cash. A shame, though, that they got the name of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) wrong. But it’s an interesting development. Revolut is regulated by the FCA as an e-money institution, but does not have any kind of crypto licence because . . . no such thing exists in this country. The walled garden system meant that, in theory, Revolut wouldn’t lose track of where the money was going — you couldn’t just send your money to a bitcoin wallet in Iran or North Korea, for instance. We asked Revolut how they would prevent crypto withdrawals becoming an avenue for money launderers and they said that “all external crypto addresses that a user adds to their account and all user withdrawals will be screened by Revolut’s blockchain analytics partner”, and that “Revolut’s blockchain analytics tool analyses each address and provides a risk score based on the address’s connection with illicit activity (previous hacks, dark market activity, etc) as well as connections to sanctions list and terrorist financing sources.” All very well, but what about if this is a new address that hasn’t been connected with such activity? They added: In addition to blockchain analytics, Revolut has adapted its own anti-money laundering rules to apply to its cryptocurrency product, which are triggered when a users’ behaviour on the Revolut App suggests an increased risk of money laundering. If these addresses or withdrawals breach any of Revolut’s anti-money laundering rules Revolut will follow its financial crime procedures, depending on the severity of the breach. (As in other fincrime cases we don’t disclose the nature of the procedures for obvious reasons.) Unlike many other crypto companies, Revolut has the advantage of applying financial crime controls to a regulated business and has leveraged this experience in designing the systems and controls surrounding the cryptocurrency withdrawals product. All we’d say is thankfully Revolut hasn’t had too many issues with its anti-money laundering procedures in the world of real money. Revolut is going hard on crypto more generally it seems — it sent out an email to customers earlier this month in which it announced 11 new crypto tokens were now tradable: Unlock hot coins like Uniswap, Cardano and more We’ve levelled up from 10 to 21 tokens with this new drop. In addition familiar [sic] tokens like Bitcoin, you’ll now be able to trade Cardano, Uniswap, Synthetix, Yearn Finance, Uma, Bancor, Filecoin, Numeraire, Loopring, Orchid, and The Graph (We keep telling you, the thing that gives value to all these crypto coins — last count 9,486 of them — is scarcity.) The company also told customers: 2021 is the year of crypto at Revolut! A whole year to bring you new features, new tokens, and more surprises along the way. If you haven’t explored crypto in the app yet, this is a great opportunity to discover something new. With “hot coins” like “The Graph” now available, the opportunity really is all ours. Thank *you*, Revolut, for making all our dreams come true. We know you’re not a bank in the UK yet, but we feel like maybe our money is actually protected by your FCSC (For Crypto Spawns Crypto!) scheme after all. We trust that with you, our money really is only going up 📈 .

Recently emerged cheerleaders include Tesla chief Elon Musk and a number of billionaire hedge fund managers who are convinced that as the digital equivalent of gold, bitcoin’s exchange rate against conventional currencies has even further to soar. So is bitcoin just a big Ponzi scheme or a genuine investment opportunity? Should retail investors give in to the temptation to pile in? FT Money has spoken to finance professionals inside and outside the cryptomarket and found that opinion remains sharply divided. The recent stellar performance has turned some bears into bulls. But hardcore naysayers warn that a bubble that has grown bigger is still a bubble. Even ardent crypto fans are reluctant to wager their life savings on an asset associated with hair-raising levels of volatility. Even among these enthusiasts, many limit their investments to 1-2 per cent of their portfolio. Regardless of whether cryptocurrencies turn out to be the digital equivalent of gold in the long run, today they are providing fraudsters with a rich hunting ground. Since the start of January, bitcoin’s value has risen by 85 per cent and in mid-April it hit the latest in a series of record highs at $65,000. Companies that operate in the digital currency sector are attracting a flood of money. In a recent (conventional) stock market flotation, investors valued Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange launched less than 10 years ago, at $72bn, putting it equal with BNP Paribas, a French bank with roots stretching back to 1848. Young people are in the vanguard of investing. In the UK, millennial and Gen Z investors are more likely to buy cryptocurrencies than equities and more than half (51 per cent) of those surveyed had traded digital currencies, research from broker Charles Schwab shows. After a year of spiralling prices, bears warn of the growing risk of a 2018-style collapse. Bitcoin bulls argue that the current rally is different from the 2018 bubble burst, when the price collapsed from above $16,000 to just $3,000. Today, they say, it is driven by demand from professional trading firms and institutional investors whose presence brings stability. Not everyone agrees. “It’s not different this time. There are no new eras, despite what the promoters tell you,” says David Rosenberg, a Canadian economist and president of Rosenberg Research. “Asset price bubbles come, bubbles go, but none of them correct by going sideways.” In contrast with younger investors, those aged 55 or over remain resolutely on the margins with just 8 per cent of survey respondents in this age group trading digital currencies, the Charles Schwab study found. They may be right to do so. Investors globally have lost more than $16bn since 2012 in cryptocurrency-related scams and fraud, according to disclosure platform Xangle. The Financial Conduct Authority, the UK’s financial watchdog, warned this year that investors can lose 100 per cent of their money when punting on cryptocurrencies. It has not sought to block cryptocurrency dealings but has forbidden the sale of derivatives on crypto assets to UK retail customers. As crypto markets are unregulated, investors have no one to turn to for help if they fall victim to fraud. Exchanges can turn out to be bogus and their founders disappear. A new coin might turn out to be a tissue of lies. “There are a lot of scams and criminal operations that target individuals and it’s very important to recognise that in an unregulated market there is no recourse,” says Ian Taylor, the chief executive of lobby group CryptoUK. Another concern for investors is the environmental footprint of cryptocurrencies. The carbon emissions associated with bitcoin equal that of Greece, according to research by Bank of America, because the coins are created or “mined”, in vast computing centres, which burn electricity and generate heat. Crypto specialists say the most important rule for investors is to be prepared to lose all their money. On April 13, bitcoin began a sharp decline, its exchange rate shedding 23 per cent in less than two weeks. Marcus Swanepoel, chief executive of Luno, a retail-focused cryptocurrency exchange with 5m-plus customers, says that in some cases they were overstretching themselves. Luno surveyed its clients last year and found that 55 per cent had no other investments. “Never spend more money than you can afford to lose,” he says. “It’s very risky, there is no doubt about it.” Extreme swings in the exchange rate mean cryptocurrency exposure should be kept at a low proportion of a portfolio, say most mainstream investment analysts. “I understand if you want to buy it because you believe the price will go up but make sure it’s a very small portion of your portfolio, maybe 1 or 2 per cent,” says Thanos Papasavvas, founder of research group ABP Invest, who has a 20-year background in asset management. Borrowing money to pump up trades with leverage amplifies gains but inflates losses. As there are no official rules, trading platforms allow investors to wager multiples of the money they deposit, inflating the amount at stake by as much as a 100 times. “Leverage on a crazy asset class is a recipe for disaster,” says Abhishek Sachdev, a derivatives expert and head of Vedanta Hedging. Choosing the right coin is also important. There are hundreds of cryptocurrencies; most are worthless and some are plain scams. Bitcoin is the oldest, most liquid, coin and it is the one that enjoys support due to institutions investing due to its limited supply. According to its original computer-based design, only 21m bitcoins will ever exist and 99 per cent of these coins will be mined by 2030. Other cryptocurrencies are not limited in this way and the hundreds of available digital coins all have different characteristics. It is also the most expensive per unit but since it can be bought in small increments, there is no requirement to splash out $50,000 or so for a full coin. Ethereum is the second most traded cryptocurrency and has benefited from the tailwind of bitcoin’s rally. The technology behind ethereum is also used in a nascent market dubbed decentralised finance, making the coin a relatively safe choice. dogecoin and the likes occupy the riskiest and most illiquid end of the spectrum. In the UK the easiest way to access cryptocurrencies is to buy a portion of bitcoin on an established exchange such as Coinbase. Given that exchanges have suffered outages, been hacked or collapsed, this is the safest approach, though it is more expensive than other exchanges. Coinbase typically charges a spread of about 0.50 per cent plus a fee depending on the size of purchase and payment method. Fintech companies such as Revolut also offer a way in for bitcoin buyers, but there is no way to transfer bitcoins from the app elsewhere or into other types of coin. Since they may only sell it back within Revolut, investors only nominally own bitcoin via the app. In the US, investors are able to buy shares in diversified cryptocurrency funds such as Grayscale, which can then be bought and sold like other mutual holdings. Institutional investors can also buy into exchange traded products but these are inaccessible for retail investors in the UK. It is possible to buy into products that offer exposure to companies active around blockchain — the public, digital ledger than underlies bitcoin — such as Invesco Elwood Global Blockchain UCITS ETF. These are a bet on technology, however, rather than the cryptocurrency. Recommended Selling cryptocurrencies also has tax implications. Digital assets count as property for accounting purposes and profits may be subject to capital gains tax. Scammers are a growing problem. Some ask investors to send their private keys to their crypto holdings, promising to return with a profit. But once done, there is no way to undo a transfer. Lihan Lee, co-founder of Xangle, advises potential investors to check the past records of any crypto investment schemes, while CryptoUK’s Taylor warns of posting about cryptocurrency investment on social media or cold callers promising guaranteed returns. “If a stranger walks up to you on the street and says they’ll give you £150 if they can borrow £100, you probably wouldn’t give them the money,” he says. “It’s the same with crypto.” “If it’s on the side of a bus it’s time to buy,” screams an advertisement from Luno in London. Many seasoned investors say the ad should say the opposite. If everyone is talking about the same thing, it’s a sure-fire sign that prices have reached unsustainable heights and are about to collapse — as they did in 2018. But in the past 12 months companies and institutional investors have cautiously dipped their toes into digital assets. Since central banks around the world responded to the coronavirus pandemic with easy money policies, large asset managers and hedge funds have been looking for ways to protect themselves from a return of inflation and the erosion in value of of some currencies, including the dollar. “We’ve seen a step change in institutional interest last year,” says James Butterfill, an investment analyst at digital asset specialist Coinshares. He notes that around $54bn of money is invested across 120 cryptocurrency funds. A year ago, the total figure was $3.5bn across 89 funds. “Cryptocurrencies are here to stay,” wrote Christian Nolting, global chief investment officer at Deutsche Bank’s international private bank, in a report. Central banks are even exploring the idea of issuing digital alternatives for domestic currencies. To some analysts, central bank digital currencies lend legitimacy to the crypto space, while others believe it is an attempt by central banks to wrest back control of the market. “Central banks have always thought that they were key for payments,” says Randy Kroszner, professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. “And now they’ve realised they’re not.” But that does not mean that the risks of cryptocurrencies are likely to dissipate any time soon. As the unregulated market bounces through its latest price gyrations, it is a long way off from either stability or security. “Money and IT are my core things,” says Adrian, a financial services professional in his late 40s, who asked the FT not to use his full name to avoid “tax complications”. In many ways, he is the archetypal cryptocurrency investor in the current bitcoin rally. Following his divorce, a pub conversation in 2017 led him to look into cryptocurrencies. Since then, Adrian has gone deep. “I have property, wine, lots of different investments but crypto is by far the most profitable. I look at what I put in and there is no better return anywhere else,” he says. He says he owns about 50 different types of cryptocurrency but has kept as much as 70 per cent of his investment in bitcoin, which he regards as the safest and most liquid option. He is also actively trading — hence his concerns about HM Revenue & Customs — on various exchanges and in the fledgling derivatives market, using leverage to amplify the outcome of his bets. Venturing beyond buying and holding coins, Adrian has entered the rapidly growing area of decentralised finance, which uses the “digital ledger” technology of blockchain to replace intermediaries in trading, lending and borrowing. One crypto insider describes decentralised finance — also known as “DeFi trading” — as the world’s most adversarial market. “You can make anything between 100 and 1,000 per cent, but it’s probably not for beginner investors,” he says, adding that trading in this area requires a heavy commitment in time and research. Adrian says he will “never” sell his bitcoins but aspires to borrow against his holdings in DeFi markets to buy a home in a couple of years. Having gone from bitcoin novice to evangelist in three years, he believes blockchain has the potential to replace insurance companies, retail banks and central banks. “If you’re selling bitcoin you’re going long fiat. Why would you ever want to do that?” Sachdev has taken a much more moderate approach. The derivatives expert runs financial advisory firm Vedanta Hedging and takes a dim view of overly complex products. He nonetheless started “dabbling” in bitcoin in January this year. “I can give you 20 reasons why investing in bitcoin is a good idea and 20 reasons why it’s a crap idea,” he says, noting that he took the plunge after two people whose views he respects encouraged him to do so. “I did some research and downloaded CoinbasePro.” His initial investment of about £20,000 has so far yielded a profit of roughly 35 per cent. Still, given bitcoin’s volatility he is taking a cautious approach and says he would never use leverage. Sachdev still owns more gold than bitcoin but says this could soon change. “I don’t want to invest any more into crypto than 5 per cent of my equity investments,” he says. “Returns are bigger and quicker than in other alternative markets like art or wine, but it’s a lot more frothy and prone to bubbles because it’s very new.” He would “ride out” any collapse in price, he says, and has had no issues when converting some of his bitcoin into fiat currency. But he also believes bitcoin’s success might be too big for central banks to ignore. Bitcoin’s failure thus far to fulfil its promise of becoming a mundane, ubiquitous means of payment does not worry him, however. “I’m not too bothered about not being able to use it in Sainsbury’s. I see bitcoin as an uncorrelated asset. Just because it can’t do everything it doesn’t mean it doesn’t have a place.”,,Eva Szalay,2021-04-30T04:00:12.694Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/e16137dc-2cad-473c-a4d4-bfd6743bfeb1,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,If you believe, they put a Dogecoin on the moon,Doge on the mooooon.,Dogecoin — the crypto token that was started as a joke and that is the favourite of Elon Musk — is having a bit of a moment. And when we say a bit of a moment, we mean that it is on a lunar trajectory (in crypto talk: it is going to da moon). At the time of writing this, it is up over 200 per cent in the past 24 hours — more than tripling in value (for those of you who need help on percentages, it is Friday afternoon after all). Over the past week it’s up more than 550 per cent (almost seven times higher!). Here’s a chart to show you what that looks like (thanks to Jamie “Spreadsheet”/”Loves A Good Pun” Powell for drawing it up): So what’s going on? Well we did a quick inbox search — when bitcoin is mooning we are always inundated with “expert analysis” from shills. But it seems the usual suspects aren’t quite sure what to say — maybe they feel the big serious talk they usually do about crypto would look a bit silly given that this was designed solely for the LOLs? So there was literally nothing to be heard from the usually loud voices of bro-dom. And we know what they think of Doge already: Why do people have to be so cynical?? Instead we got this from David Kimberley, at Freetrade, who is very much on the money (we started bolding bits of this but there was too much to bold so just read all of it!): Dogecoin’s rise is a classic example of greater fool theory at play, Dogecoin investors are basically betting they’ll be able to cash out by selling to the next person wanting to invest. People are buying the cryptocurrency, not because they think it has any meaningful value, but because they hope others will pile in, push the price up and then they can sell off and make a quick buck. But when everyone is doing this, the bubble eventually has to burst and you’re going to be left short-changed if you don’t get out in time. And it’s almost impossible to say when that’s going to happen. This is doubly the case in the crypto markets where a small group of players often hold a huge chunk of the total number of ‘coins’ in circulation. That means it only takes one person to dump all their holdings for the entire market to tank. The latest uptick in Dogecoin’s price isn’t indicative of any meaningful value the cryptocurrency offers, it’s just a surge in interest from people looking to get rich quick. That can make for a fun bet, but it’s not good investing. And if you’re the one left holding on to the coins when the market tanks, you may regret taking a punt in the first place. The good thing about that commentary is that you can replace Dogecoin with bitcoin, or basically any other crypto token under the, er, moon. (And there are many of them — Coinmarketcap currently lists 9,262 individual coins.) There are just two other things that Kimberley misses really. One is the LOL factor. The entertainment element in all of this should not be dismissed, as the great former Alphavillain Kadhim Shubber wrote back in 2018. The second, very much related to the first, is the Musk factor. On Thursday the electric car king jester tweeted this: So there you have it. The explanation for these crazy price moves you’ve been looking for: greater fool theory + I’m gonna buy some Doge for the LOLs + OMG Elon tweeted about it again, wen lambo = number go up. If you’ve ever wondered how to say Dogecoin but were too afraid to ask — especially if you wondered how you might do that with a light French accent — well here you go: Our Dear Leader Kaminska called it “Doggycoin” on Clubhouse yesterday so we thought we’d better clear that up once and for all, particularly if you fancied bringing it up when you’re shivering outside the pub on a Hinge date tonight. But if you do bring it up, why not make the argument that LOL should be just as sound an investment strategy as, say, ESG? It’s certainly a lot more fun, and probably more consistent. After all, in the era of kayfabe, it makes perfect sense.

https://www.ft.com/content/42af0afc-370d-4dc6-ae04-569e2ec413b2,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Junior Isas or NFTs? Dangers lurking for the digital generation,£9bn in child trust funds are maturing so let’s make it easier for their newly adult owners to carry on saving,Remember child trust funds (CTFs), Gordon Brown’s attempt to make sure that all young people had something to their name when they turned 18? Well, their time has come. They started maturing in September. That’s nice for any of the young people who were eligible. Even if their parents did nothing about it, there will still be a useful pile of cash knocking around in a default fund for them to find. It will be very nice indeed for anyone with proactive parents with the spare cash to have turned them into junior Isas (Jisas) and kept them topped up, as has been possible since 2015. There’s a lot of money up for grabs here: £9bn in the CTFs alone. The question is just who gets their hands on it, and how. When the CTF or Jisa holders turn 18, their products mostly roll into being adult Isas. Exciting! Until they actually want access to them, that is. The problem is paperwork. A friend’s son tells me that — for today’s young, at least — this is complicated stuff. It isn’t online with everything verified with codes sent to phones and the like. Instead, it involves actual letters on real bits of paper and the production of bits of ID they mostly can’t lay their hands on. You need to verify your ID and address. Most will have a passport (if they don’t, there is a long search for their birth certificate ahead) so the ID part isn’t too hard but, for the address, the list of things most institutions will accept aren’t easy for the average 18-year-old to find, particularly as mobile phone bills aren’t acceptable. Not so exciting. So what do you do if you are said friend’s son; you are finding the access documentation difficult to deal with; and a kind relative deposits some birthday cash into your bank account to help you top up your new adult Isa? If you are over 40 the answer isn’t obvious: you will already be down a rabbit hole of stress about the low deposit rates on cash. But if you are under 20 the answer will be. With the money burning a hole in your bank account, a pile of admin faff ahead and YouTube offering you New-Age financial advice on a loop, you will start clicking. The next thing you know you won’t have what you should have: some nice sensible stakes in a diversified range of investment trusts biased to long term growth. No, you’ll have a portfolio of non-fungible tokens. NFTs are bits of code that attach to anything digital (sound, videos or art) certifying them as unique and hence collectable. You might go to nbatopshot.com, for example. There you might buy a video of your favourite basketball player doing something brilliant as an NFT. This doesn’t mean no one else can ever see it. It just means, for what it’s worth, that you own the moment. Recommended The top NFTs now for sale on the Top Shot site are $250,000. That is chicken feed compared to the £1m I am hoping to get if the FT allows me to turn this column into an NFT and auction it, the $2.9m Twitter founder Jack Dorsey got for the NFT of his first tweet (“just setting up my twttr”) or the £50m artist Mike Winkelmann, aka Beeple, got for selling a digital collage this month. These numbers make no sense. Think of an NFT, if you will, like a Scottish island (bear with me). There is currently a tiny one for sale in the middle of Loch Moidart on the west coast. It comes, says Future Auctions, with a “beautiful outlook and approach” and a “unique opportunity to purchase a space that can be enjoyed with zero chance of intrusion”. The first part of this is true. The second simply isn’t. Scotland has fabulous right to roam laws. You can go pretty much anywhere and do pretty much anything when you get there. Loch Moidart is “extremely popular”. I should think it will be something of a shock to the buyers when they find that they have bought, not a private haven, but a popular local picnic spot open to anyone with a paddle board. What is ownership without exclusivity? The same is true of NFTs. If everyone can watch your video clip, what is it that you have collected? You might say that owning an NFT video which can be copied is no different from owning a Picasso that everyone else can get prints of. But that’s to miss the point. A print is not the same as a painting. But a digital copy of a video of any one slam dunk is identical to the original. NFTs are lots of fun, partly in a speculative isn’t-the-tech-cool kind of a way and partly in a social-justice way. Note that the code can be written so that a payment is made to the artist every time the NFT is traded. NFTs might also be useful to some people — perhaps money launderers. And there are some interesting aspects to the craze: the thought that the whole thing is just another step towards the full digitalisation of life; and the way which the tokens disintermediate the art industry (we no longer need institutions to authenticate art). But that doesn’t mean their current ubiquity represents the beginning of the emergence of a new asset class, whatever the YouTubers might tell you. I suspect it represents yet another minor speculative mania driven by free money meeting free time, and one that will end along with the pandemic and within which danger lurks. We want to hear from readers aged between 16 and 35 on what life is like, and which problems need fixing most urgently. Housing? Education? Jobs? Pensions? The environment? Tell us about your experiences via a short survey. My young friend’s NFT trading account suggests he has made money buying and selling (hooray!). But he has not yet been able to get the money paid out of the platform and back into his bank account (no hooray). There is an important lesson here. There’s a new generation of investors out there. And they aren’t much good with, you know, like, letters. We have an amazing opportunity, right now, to bring these people, and the £9bn in their CTFs, into the long-term investing fold. If we want to have a chance of doing so, depositing money in your first Isa needs to be as straightforward as signing up for an NBA Top Shot account. Providers, adjust your processes accordingly. In the meantime, some advice for those who are newly 18. Do not put your CTF money or indeed your granny’s money into NFTs. This is not what Gordon Brown had in mind.

https://www.ft.com/content/7df21f05-1365-4e31-bac5-5987658f9f7e,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Now you can offset your NFT footprint too,Interested in owning an NFT art piece but stressed by the insatiable energy consumption of the blockchain? Artist Simon Denny possibly has the answer.,In recent weeks it’s become apparent that the serious end of the international art market has decided to go all in on non-fungible tokens that register digital art on a blockchain forever and ever. They’re going to be a thing. And that’s an end to it, alright? And really, what’s not to like for the pros servicing the market? This isn’t the first time they’ve had to contend with the question “but is it really art?” Or had to tackle “I just don’t get it”-type criticism. Not getting the art is kind of part of art these days. At the very least, it is not a reason to stay away. (Especially if there are countless would-be collectors happy to tell you the opposite.) The market provides what the market demands. And in this case there’s also another obvious draw: a huge pool of freshly enriched crypto fans with money to burn on anything that matches or supports the system that enriched them in the first place. Hell, yes! NFTs were obviously going to be the sort of low-hanging fruit the art market could not ignore. And yet, there is one not insubstantial niggle. The art market is not exactly devoid of hip-and-considerate-vegan types who want to save the planet. For them, crypto’s energy intensity is clearly going to be a problem. The irony hasn’t been lost on artist Simon Denny, who has been chronicling developments in blockchainland from its earliest years. Denny’s 2016 exhibition at the Petzel gallery, “Blockchain Future States”, was one of the first artistic projects to unpack the complex politics of the blockchain, and to critically address the major actors in cryptoland. He also joined FT Alphaville on stage in 2019 at our Vaudeville production, where he gifted self-proclaimed Satoshi Nakamoto, Craig Wright, with a cardboard copy of a CryptoKitty. We can now exclusively reveal that in his latest exhibition, “Mine”, Denny will not just be turning his attention to NFTs, but to a kind of NFT “offset”. Here’s the press release: Denny’s suite of NFTs will spotlight themes central to this new exhibition at Petzel Gallery, namely the energy demands and environmental impacts of running data networks such as Ethereum’s. The project recasts each minted NFT as an automated mining unit – a crypto miner – using five second-hand Ethereum “mining” computers purchased by the artist from the familiar online marketplace Ebay.com, where these machines currently fetch anywhere between $3000 - $20,000. Denny has worked with a gaming illustrator to produce detailed 3d portraits of these miners to create new digital artworks. Following their images’ release as NFTs, Denny will retire the mining computers represented from the Ethereum network altogether. Instead of the hardware using the energy typically required to host the intangible collectibles of the NFT wave, the processing power from these machines’ GPUs (Graphical Processing Units) will be donated to environmental research via climateprediction.net, a not-for-profit climate modelling project overseen by scientists at the University of Oxford, using volunteer computing to study and predict climate change. The artist sees this material and market swap as a kind of offset in the NFT world, mirroring “carbon offsets” that many companies today are leveraging to redress the negative impacts of their business practices. The artwork is a poetic transformation between states – moving energy, matter, likeness, and attention from one network of value to another. Now that’s what we call an NFT that can be banged into a 2021 ESG portfolio. The official release of the work is set for next Thursday, March 18. But the good news for those who aren’t exactly convinced by any of the above is that Simon has agreed to come and talk to Jemima and me just as the whole thing launches next Thursday (Jemima will be in a childcare bubble in deepest Cornwall so her appearance depends on strong connectivity). So prepare your quibbles, your cynicism or your love and come and join us on ClubHouse at 9pm London time (4pm EST). We will be sure to have a great discussion, and an important one at that. Because who knows, you could end up being tokenised one day too. Related links: You are a valuable asset. Tokenise yourself. - FT Alphaville,,Izabella Kaminska,2021-03-12T19:00:02.422Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/83a59275-9a85-464b-af45-aad0e8bd6311,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,You are a valuable asset. Tokenise yourself.,Be you, but make it blockchain.,You might have noticed that we are living through a time of total tokenisation. Digital art, tweets, music, sports memorabilia and even “crypto-flowers” are being minted into so-called non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are saved on to a blockchain (usually the Ethereum blockchain) and then sold for huge sums of money. Like, yuge. On Thursday, a new record was set for a sale of a digital asset: $69.3m for a digital collage by the contemporary artist Beeple. In case you were wondering but were too afraid to ask, the reason these digital “collectibles” are labelled “non-fungible” is to keep them distinct from the more common form of crypto tokens, like bitcoin or Ether, which were designed to be used as currencies (though they are used far more for speculation). Because these tokens were designed as currencies, they are meant to be fungible, meaning that their individual units are mutually interchangeable: the idea is that one bitcoin is always worth the same as any other bitcoin, in other words. In reality, that is in fact not really the case, because the blockchain allows you to trace the transaction history of any given coin, meaning that coins that have been found to have been involved in illicit transactions are “dirty”, and that any coin that has been spent at all is less desirable than freshly mined “virgin” coins, which are sometimes sold for a premium. But that is the reason for the name; NFTs are designed to be unique digital assets, so one NFT ≠ another NFT. But in a world of infinite possibility like cryptoland, the rise of the non-fungibles doesn’t of course negate the value of the fungibles. You can also tokenise something from the real world (not just the silly ephemeral digital one) and turn it into something fungible that you can also stick on the blockchain, by creating a “coin” from it rather than an NFT. One example of this is the plethora of gold-backed cryptocurrencies that exist; another is stablecoins supposedly backed by real money such as dollars. (Ahem.) So real-world assets can be tokenised too. And what could be real-er than, well, YOU? We hadn’t really considered this idea until we received this via direct message on Twitter: Now, “crypto influencers” we may or may not be, but crypto-writing journalists we certainly are, and so we didn’t take this person up on their offer as we felt like it might be kind of off to try to profit from a “space” that we write about. (Not that this principle is paid attention to by all “journalists”, for instance those covering certain electric car manufacturers, but we digress.) However we did have a look at this platform to see how it would work so we could give you the lowdown . . . It’s called MintMe.com, and it turns out that it’s in fact not just crypto influencers who can make their own coins so as to “fund (themselves) for free”. Anyone in fact, the website says, can turn themselves into a coin: Anyone can mint or create a token (coin) that represents themselves or a project that they have created for their fan base and supporters to support them. It helps content creators to realise their maximum potential through a new innovative way of crowdfunding. It's also a social platform where traders can interact with token creators and other traders. Tokens are created (minted) on top of our custom decentralised blockchain called MintMe Coin. When you create coin or create token [sic], you become an owner of your own financial future. Create a token, create a coin for your project or yourself or just trade other people coins. Who doesn’t want to become an owner of their own financial future!? Who doesn’t want to be represented in digital form by “people coins”? The site also has a useful FAQs section, featuring questions and answers such as: I've created a token. How can I give it a real value? Coins are as valuable as you make them, you give them the value because they are a tokenised representation of yourself or your project. As we said above, you see, cryptoland is a world of infinite possibility. Yes, you already exist in the real world and have a real-world value, but the important thing to remember is that crypto is not a zero-sum game. Your real-world value doesn’t take away from your tokenised value. You are a scarce asset, and yet you are infinite. Simples! Moving on with the FAQs: Why would I accept token instead of USD for my work? To get money when you need it. You might need tools to start earning, but you have no money to buy them, so how to start? By allowing potential customers to judge your offer and decide if you are worth their trust. If your offer will be credible, they could purchase tokens that will be worth your service, this way you first get tools needed for your work and customers get the service they needed. Honestly, we have tried to understand this as an answer to that question, but we really can’t. It is a nonsense. Moving on to our personal favourite: Why would anyone believe in me or my coin? Because you have developed a reputation for yourself that certainly has value. You are a valuable asset that can be tokenised as such on the MintMe platform. Your supporters might also feel more comfortable in being able to benefit later from supporting you now. You are a valuable asset that can be tokenised as such. Don’t you ever let anyone ever tell you otherwise! And when we say you, we mean each and every one of you — all 7.8bn-odd of you out there. You are many but you are scarce! Scarcity is value. Value is harnessed on the blockchain. The blockchain’s possibilities are infinite. Infinite scarcity for the win! Oh and can anyone think of other examples of people being traded as assets? Did it work out OK? Either way, honestly this seems like a truly excellent idea no honestly really truly we mean it.

The sale was the first of its kind by Christie’s, underscoring the eye-popping valuations for NFTs, which are unique files encrypted on blockchain to ensure authenticity. The collage by Beeple is titled “Everydays: The First 5000 Days”, a single jpeg file composite of digital sketches taken each day for more than 13 years. Bidding opened on February 25 at just $100. The artist, whose given name is Mike Winkelmann, summarised his reaction to the sale with a tweet: “holy fuck.” NFTs have exploded in popularity among collectors of sports memorabilia and in the cryptocurrency community in recent weeks. An encrypted 12-second clip of the basketball star LeBron James recently sold on a secondary market for $208,000, in a new venture between the National Basketball Association and the consumer blockchain company Dapper Labs. The Christie’s sale illustrates the stratospheric potential for NFTs. Noah Davis, specialist in postwar and contemporary art at Christie’s in New York, said the auction house has “never offered a new media artwork of this scale or importance before”. The price tag on the Beeple sale places him among the top three most valuable living artists, according to Christie’s. It also eclipses prices paid for works by other renowned visual artists, such as the impressionist painter Edvard Munch, whose “Girls on the Bridge” sold for $54m in 2016 by Sotheby’s. The sale also demonstrates efforts by auction houses to expand their offerings beyond Old Masters and pop artists in order to cultivate a new generation of collectors, particularly millennials. Last spring, Sotheby’s set a world record for sneakers at auction when a pair worn by basketball legend Michael Jordan sold for $560,000. In September, the New York-based house also presented its first collection of hip-hop memorabilia, including love letters penned by the late rapper Tupac Shakur. Recommended Christie’s said the emergence of NFTs was a breakthrough in digital artwork, a tradition established in the 1960s but whose ease of duplication “made it near-impossible to assign provenance and value to the medium”. According to a breakdown of the bidders for the Beeple piece provided by Christie’s, 91 per cent were new to the auction house, and 64 per cent were millennials and Gen Z. Within the sporting world, NFTs are considered a new form of digital collectible, similar to physical basketball cards, which can be acquired in packs at retail and then resold based on scarcity or emotional or historical value. NBA Top Shot, the licensed NFT platform for the US professional basketball league, launched in beta in October and has since logged more than $347m in transactions, according to NFT tracker cryptoslam.io. Mik Naayem, co-founder of Dapper Labs which developed the Top Shot and CryptoKitties platforms, told the Financial Times recently that “for a new generation of fans, a digital thing may actually be more ‘real’ to them than a physical object”.,,Sara Germano,2021-03-11T18:26:24.500Z,

In the US, the National Basketball Association is taking the industry to a new level: selling game highlights to fans as digital tokens on the blockchain. The enterprise is called NBA Top Shot, a venture between the league, its players’ association and a consumer blockchain company that says it is creating licensed sports memorabilia for the digital age. The popularity of Top Shot has skyrocketed in the past few weeks, to the point that a single, 12 seconds-long highlight of a November 2019 LeBron James dunk resold for more than $200,000. A similar clip can be viewed on YouTube for free. In plain terms, Top Shot takes actual NBA highlights, encrypts them into a digital asset known as a non-fungible token (NFT), and allows consumers to buy and sell them in an online marketplace licensed by the league itself. These transactions are saved on the blockchain, which serves as a record of ownership. Each token, known in Top Shot parlance as a “moment”, is given a serial number and sold in limited-edition “packs”, which range from $9 to $230 depending on the moments they contain — similar to packs of baseball or basketball cards. Collectors can buy and sell moments from each other on the secondary market, which has recorded over $300m in sales since Top Shot’s public launch in October, $250m in the last 30 days, according to NFT tracker cryptoslam.io. Players, team owners, and broadcast presenters have all contributed to the hype for Top Shot in recent weeks. Portland Trailblazers point guard CJ McCollum tweeted about getting in on the trade, inviting fans to direct-message him on social media to discuss. “I want to learn more about these moments,” he wrote. “Especially my moments lol.” The US sports memorabilia market is already worth as much as $5.4bn annually, according to a 2018 estimate by Forbes. Angela Ruggiero, chief executive of the Sports Innovation Lab, a research firm studying technology and fan behaviour in sports, said that digital tokens could expand the market to individuals who are not considered “traditional fans”, generally defined as those who watch games on television or buy tickets and jerseys. Case in point: Robyn Batnick, a high school guidance counsellor from Long Island, New York, said she became immediately enthralled with collecting Top Shot moments after her husband suggested it as an activity they could do together. “He was like, ‘I have a confession to make, I just spent $2,500 on a hologram’,” she said. Initially alarmed at the dollar value, she became intrigued once he demonstrated to her how the process works online. Collectors have to sign up on the Top Shot website at appointed times to await a “drop”, or release, of packs of moments. Demand is so high that more than 200,000 people joined the queue last Friday for a drop of just over 10,000 packs. “I am definitely not a sports fan”, said Batnick, 35. “The players and the moves? They mean nothing to me. I look at it as a game, and I’m like, I want to play!” The blockchain company Dapper Labs partnered with the NBA to develop Top Shot in 2019 after the success of its earlier venture in NFTs, CryptoKitties. Dapper Labs co-founder Mik Naayem said his goal was to develop a product whose popularity could extend beyond the insular cryptocurrency community. “We wondered, if we could create something cute and appropriate on blockchain, could we get regular people to engage?” he said. Revenues from the sale of Top Shot packs are split between Dapper Labs, the NBA and the players’ association. The three groups also split a 5 per cent cut of each sale on the secondary market, according to two people familiar with the arrangement. The league helps determine which highlights are made into moments, according to Adrienne O’Keeffe, associate vice-president of global partnerships at the NBA. Current moments are mostly limited to games from the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons, but the league could release historical highlights — such as those by Michael Jordan — sometime in the future. Meanwhile, Naayem said Dapper Labs plans to eventually enable collectors to use their moments as tokens in a digital game, similar to Pokémon.

Sign up here. Top Shot comes at a time when the market for traditional sports trading cards and collectible card games is booming. The “trading cards” category on eBay grew by 142 per cent last year, with 4m more sales in the US alone compared with 2019. Basketball card sales, eBay’s second most popular card category after Pokémon, grew by 373 per cent. To illustrate Top Shot’s meteoric rise, the Financial Times compared the price trajectories of a LeBron James trading card and a LeBron James Top Shot moment. Both the card, a 2003 Topps Chrome LeBron James #111 in mint condition (PSA 10), and the moment, a 13-second clip of James replicating a Kobe Bryant dunk from 2001 as a tribute to the late Lakers star, recently sold for around $34,000. For the card, that was more than twice the price it fetched in October; the value of the moment, meanwhile, grew by more than 700-fold over the same period, from its October resale price of $46. Robyn Batnick’s husband, Michael, who works as a financial adviser and co-hosts a podcast on finance and culture, said Top Shots are “about as speculative an asset you could possibly own” and hype has driven him to make financial decisions against his rational judgment. “I spent $400 for a Duncan Robinson moment. He isn’t even good. I want to punch myself in the head.” Nonetheless, he has earned returns of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent on resales thus far. Batnick said he became interested in Top Shot in late January as the online collecting community offered an antidote to pandemic boredom. “When the drop happens and you get in the line and you see your spot, there’s something about the community, it just erases the loneliness,” he said. “It’s not about the money, it’s about the chemicals in your brain.” Additional reporting by Eric Platt,,Christine Zhang Sara Germano,2021-03-06T10:18:03.797Z,

Never mind that the price of the digital currency has gyrated dramatically; or that Elon Musk, the flamboyant founder of Tesla, is reported to be on course to make more profits for the company from bitcoin investment than from the manufacture of electric vehicles last year. This week it was equally striking that Citibank told its clients that the digital currency has reached a “tipping point” and could one day “become the currency of choice for international trade”. Cue predictable levels of celebration from bitcoin-enthusiasts — and of bemusement or horror from almost everyone else. Yet detractors and fans of the cryptocurrency both seem to agree on one thing: bitcoin is taking finance into the realm of bold 21st-century tech experiments. Is it though? On a week such as this, it pays to take a wider historical lens — and peek at nuggets from the past, such as some research carried out in Micronesia by Scott Fitzpatrick, an archaeologist at the University of Oregon, and Oregon business school professor Stephen McKeon. The pair have been studying an ancient stone money system that once existed on the Micronesian island of Yap, where local communities would treat large limestone discs as a medium of exchange. Such stone discs, called rai, “were considered extremely valuable”, the pair noted in a 2019 paper in the Journal of Economic Anthropology. But the stones were so huge that “given their size, weight, and relative fragility, they were not typically moved after being placed in a specific location [and] if a rai were gifted or exchanged, the new owner(s) of a disk may not have lived in close proximity to it.” That might make them sound pretty useless as a form of money. But the local community maintained an oral ledger so effective in keeping track of who owned which hunks of immovable limestone that Fitzpatrick and McKeon concluded that rai were, as a record of value, “an exemplary ancient analogue to blockchain” (the technology that powers bitcoin). Recommended Parallels between the two are limited. Limestone hunks cannot be subdivided as easily as bitcoin. And, since blockchain ledgers are based on (seemingly) immutable computer code, they appear more durable than communal memory. The circle of participants in bitcoin and blockchain deals is obviously exponentially larger than it was with rai — and pseudonymous to boot. But there are other thought-provoking similarities between the two. First, rai — like bitcoin — commanded value because of perceived scarcity; just as it now requires vast amounts of effort to “mine” bitcoin (the technical term for the creation of new coins), so procuring rai was hard. The limestone discs were quarried from Palau, 400km away from Yap, then carried across the seas. This was the most impressive piece of maritime transport logistics seen in the region until the European explorers arrived in the 18th century and mind-bogglingly difficult for the time (although significantly less environmentally damaging than the filthy process of bitcoin mining, which requires using huge amounts of electricity). The second point of similarity is that rai only functioned like money because there was communal trust. Unlike in the conventional modern monetary system, the “trust” underpinning rai did not operate in a vertical, hierarchical manner — ie, due to faith in a leader or an institution; instead, it was “distributed” horizontally. Everyone in the crowd needed to trust that everyone else would respect the oral ledger. Recommended Bitcoin also rests on the distributed trust of a crowd. For while computer code might seem impersonal, free from capricious human intervention, the system only works if people trust in the sanctity of that computer code. If that ever breaks down — say because of a cyber hack or a shift in norms — bitcoin would command even less value than rai does today. There is no sign that trust in blockchain is breaking down. Indeed, the recent note from Citi claims the opposite. The key point is this: anyone betting on the currency is not just expressing faith in algorithms, but in a specific pattern of trust too (ie, that computer code means something). That does not render bitcoin invalid or the blockchain useless; after all, the mainstream currencies on which our lives depend rely on sometimes tenuous social norms as well. One way to frame the contest between bitcoin and fiat currency is thus as a battle of norms — and of distributed versus hierarchical trust. As the story of the rai shows, when it comes to human economies, nothing is entirely new. In fact, one rumour periodically buzzing round the crypto-world is that this is where the mysterious progenitors of bitcoin got their inspiration (which is why some bitcoin blogs have titles that include the word “Yap”). Perhaps Musk’s next trip should be to Micronesia, where those now-useless stone circles still litter the landscape as a sign of what happens when norms and patterns of trust change Hear Gillian and Mark Carney, UN special envoy on climate action and finance, former governor of the Bank of England and author, in discussion at the FT Weekend Digital Festival, March 18-20; ftweekendfestival.com; ftweekendfestival.com Follow Gillian on Twitter @gilliantett and email her at gillian.tett@ft.com Follow @FTMag on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first.

https://www.ft.com/content/499f5f48-59ca-43a9-8c3a-c6859a05c80c,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,The many chart crimes of *that* Citi bitcoin report,Those, and a risible correction.,Citi put out an all-time classic of a report on bitcoin yesterday, as you may have already read about here. And when we say classic, we mean one of the most execrable pieces of propaganda masquerading as “research” that we have ever come across. Not only was this “report” actually just a massive bitcoin-shilling exercise, it also contained some really quite embarrassing errors from what is meant to be one of the top banks in the world (and their “premier thought leadership” division at that). The error that was probably most shocking was the apparent failure of the six Citi analysts who authored the report to grasp the difference between basis points and percentage points. As a refresher, the report said the following about illicit transactions in bitcoin, and then proceeded to compare that with those done on regular credit and debit cards: The extent of such activity can often seem overblown based on news headlines alone. In total, just over 2% of the activity in the cryptocurrency space was linked to illicit activity in 2019 and that total was down to only 0.3% in 2020. To put that figure in context, a payments study commissioned by the Federal Reserve found that fraud represented 13.46% of aggregate credit and debit card network activity in the U.S. As it turned out, the Fed study they refer to actually said that fraud represented 13.46 basis points — just the 100-fold difference, then. So we pointed this out to Citi who told us they would correct the report, and they stayed true to their word. Here’s the new graphic putting things right: Funny, isn’t it? Why didn’t Citi write that “13.46bp” figure as “0.1346%” so as to make the comparison easier to see? It’s almost as if they want their readers to be confused with this crime against charts. Also do note the text at the top of the graphic, in particular this bit: Security issues with cryptocurrency do occur, but when compared to traditional payments, it performs better. Doesn’t quite work now, that, does it? They must have been pressed for time. This, meanwhile, is how that section of the main text now reads: In total, just over 2% of the activity in the cryptocurrency space was linked to illicit activity in 2019 and that total was down to only 0.3% in 2020. To put that figure in context, a payments study commissioned by the Federal Reserve found that fraud represented 13.46 basis points of aggregate credit and debit card network activity in the U.S. So the numerical mistake is fixed but not the implication. Absolute jokers. And now that we’ve got through the wordy stuff, feast your eyes on some of the other charts in the report. We’ll let the charts do the talking: Later we are given another version of that chart: They must have been quite pleased with the “North Star” idea. The term is used 18 times in the report. Then there’s: And: And: Oh and we should just leave you with Citi’s “acknowledgment” — they’re kind enough to not take all the praise for their steaming pile: In preparing to write this report, we completed a series interviews [sic] with CEO's [sic] and professionals of some of the leading custodians, prime brokers, exchanges, infrastructure, and asset management companies, in addition to select experts within Citi. We thank them for all of their sharing their [sic] knowledge and expertise. We would also like to thank these “CEO’s” and “professionals of some of the leading custodians” for “all of their sharing their knowledge and expertise”, and for making sure all viewpoints were covered, so we leave you with a picture of the really wide-ranging bunch Citi chose for their report: Related links: Hey Citi, your bitcoin report is embarrassingly bad — FT Alphaville Axes of evil — FT Alphaville,,Jemima Kelly,2021-03-02T18:21:14.008Z,

Blockchain and cryptocurrency-linked stocks are posting record returns around the world. But not in China. Blockchain-related shares — including companies that run digital currency trading platforms and cryptocurrency miners — are regarded as an alternative to straightforward cryptocurrency investments. New York-listed Marathon Patent Group and Riot Blockchain are investor favourites. Both have gained more than 4,000 per cent in the past year. Yet the fortunes of Chinese blockchain-related companies have been mixed. Shenzhen-listed Brilliance Technology recorded gains of more than 44 per cent over a two-week span in early October as the current bitcoin rally kicked off. Shares of local peer Shenzhen Forms Syntron Information climbed in May before losing a third of their value the following month. For the full year, the price is down 35 per cent. About half of the world’s bitcoin miners are Chinese. But investors looking for bitcoin exposure in local markets are constrained. Cryptocurrencies are not considered legal tender in the country. The People’s Bank of China has banned initial coin offerings — cryptocurrency-based fundraising. It shut trading platforms four years ago. Unfavourable local regulations mean local companies closely linked to the mining and trading of cryptocurrencies have looked overseas to list in markets such as Hong Kong and the US. Recommended Locally listed crypto companies are largely focused on the development of blockchain technology for banking and commercial use. Demand for those services should rise as Beijing pushes ahead with its plans to encourage take-up of digital renminbi amid the pandemic. China has long wanted to replace cash. It also seeks to curtail the power of local fintech giants. The PBoC has distributed more than 100m worth of digital renminbi so far. Local blockchain companies should spy opportunities in systems development and support as the digital currency becomes more mainstream. The spur will be nothing like the bitcoin boom during the past few months. But it could be both more sustainable and less volatile.

Your love just might.,All this time, we’ve been saying blockchain is a solution looking for a problem. But now, as it turns out, we might have been wrong . . .  On Tuesday we appeared on one of these trendy Zoom-panels that everyone seems to be doing these days, to take part in a discussion about blockchain and its implications for financial markets. It was hosted by His Excellency Alexander Fasel, the Swiss ambassador to the Court of St James’s (AKA the UK). As you can imagine, we were giving our usual spiel about how blockchain has yet to prove itself as a “solution” for anything outside of the world of cryptocurrencies; how you never seem to hear about how the literally thousands of blockchain projects that have been splashed across newspaper pages over the past six years or so are doing; how blockchain has a garbage-in, garbage-out problem . . . you get the drift. But then, out of nowhere, we were told about a new solution! Flowers! Not real ones, obvs, but you know, pixels! On a blockchain! CRYPTO-FLOWERS! Solving the problem of, erm, what to send someone with pollen allergies and an aversion to chocolate or basically anything tangible on Valentine’s Day! Have a watch here if you’re interested in hearing about it first-hand, from about 45.50: Or if you’re not, here’s what this guy, who is the head of the “world’s first digital assets bank”, Sygnum, told us: What if I told you that there is right now a very strongly growing so-called “NFT market”, where you have girls — 15-year-old girls — today getting a digital flower, of which there is only one? It’s also on the blockchain but it’s one, created for them. And when their boyfriends send them the flower, they have the same emotions as if your partner, your partner gives you roses. (Don’t let anyone ever tell you that tech bros don’t understand the fairer sex.) When we said we weren’t sure the emotions one would feel on receiving a digital flower would be quite as strong as what one might feel on receiving a real one, we were lightly admonished: We have to be careful to not be stuck in mindsets that have been established over many years. Ah yes, that old chestnut. It’s a nice line for anyone pushing basically any technology. It’s almost as good as the “blockchain is the new internet” one (which also came up on the panel, naturally). We then said that, frankly, we found the idea of receiving a digital flower a bit of a depressing thought, to which we were told: Jemima, for you it is an absurd example. But the point I’m making is that it’s clear that it’s absurd to you, but to hundreds of millions of younger generation people it is not. Now we can either accept that or not. So at this stage, you know, we thought we’d better have a look to see what all the fuss was about. After all, being of the millennial generation, it was true that we are a bit out of touch these days. And there was that cryptokitties craze a while back — remember that? (Just don’t mention it to the ‘star’ VCs.) And that is how we found ourselves on the CryptoFlowers website, wondering at beauties like this: We are not virologists so we can’t be sure but those things behind the flower do look remarkably like SARS-COV-2 don’t they? What are they doing there? If you’re wondering how much that one costs, it’s a snip at 0.4 ETH (ETH is short for Ether, the cryptocurrency that runs on Ethereum, the thinking bro’s blockchain). At current exchange rates, that’s just . . . $730. If you really like her though, you could splash out on something like this: You can’t accuse the blockchainers of not appreciating aesthetics can you? That one will only set you back 4 ETH, so about $7,300. And if you really want to impress her, there’s the “first Ethereum flower”, which can be yours/hers for 50 ETH (a snip at $91,000). The thing is they’re not just pixels. Well they are, but they change. In fact they are part of an exciting blockchain-based game. Here is how the CryptoFlowers website describes it: CryptoFlowers is a game about collecting and breeding digital flowers. Using the power of Smart Contracts and Ethereum network, the game allows you to collect, breed and exchange unique digital flowers. While CryptoFlowers are not digital currency, it provides the same level of security. Each Cryptoflower is genetically unique, it cannot be destroyed, taken away or replicated, and it will always bloom! We went back to our Sygnum CEO to check that this is really what he was talking about when he said that this is what “hundreds of millions of younger generation people” were getting into, and he directed us towards all sorts of different sites selling various different crypto flowers. Basically crypto flowers are part of what seems to be the latest craze in blockchainland: NFTs, or “non-fungible tokens”. Crypto site Decrypt (one of the better ones) defines them thus: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are crypto assets that are indivisible and unique, creating digital scarcity. NFTs initially launched on Ethereum, using the ERC-721 token standard, but are now available on a number of other blockchains. -They have many use cases, including digital collectibles, artwork and in-game assets. Pretty radical huh? Kind of like Pokemon Cards, but on the blockchain. Look, it’s true that we cannot speak for 15-year-old girls, but we can speak for grown women. Please, lads, if you’re going to spend $90,000 of your hard-earned money on something that runs on a blockchain this Valentine’s Day, well, we haven’t said this before but: just buy us some bitcoin or something? Doge’ll do too.,,Jemima Kelly,2021-02-12T17:57:02.761Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/9be5ad05-b17a-4449-807b-5dbcb5ef8170,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Nouriel Roubini: bitcoin is not a hedge against tail risk,Elon Musk may be buying it, but that doesn’t mean everyone else should follow suit,The writer is a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business, NYU, and host of NourielToday.com Claims that bitcoin is the new “digital gold” are feeding a new bubble in it and other cryptocurrencies. The last one in 2017-18 saw bitcoin go from $1,000 to $20,000 and then fall back to $3,000 by the end of 2018. Since the fundamental value of bitcoin is zero and would be negative if a proper carbon tax was applied to its massive polluting energy-hogging production, I predict that the current bubble will eventually end in another bust. Referring to bitcoin or other crypto as “currencies” is a misnomer. They are not a unit of account: virtually nothing is priced in them. They are not a scalable means of payment: with bitcoin you can do five transactions per second while the Visa network does 24,000. Bitcoins are barely used by legitimate companies as payment for goods and services, although Tesla said it planned to start accepting them. Crypto is not a stable store of value: even some crypto conferences refuse to accept them as payment for attendance fees. The volatile price moves can wipe out any profit margin of a merchant within a matter of hours. They aren’t even denominated in a consistent way that allows users to compare relative prices of goods. This reliance on different tokens is effectively a return to barter. The Flintstones had a more sophisticated monetary system based on a benchmark: the cartoon cavemen used shells. Even referring to crypto as assets is a misnomer. Most assets have a stream of income (stocks, bonds, commercial real estate) or a use (housing) or some other utility (fiat currency provides liquidity and can be used for payments). Gold has no income but it has industrial uses. It also has utility as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, currency debasement and tail risks. Crypto has no income, no utility, no payment or other services. It isn’t even anonymous because the underlying blockchain technology makes it easy to trace payments. It is only a play on a speculative asset bubble, worse than tulip-mania as flowers had and still have utility. Its store of value against tail risks is unproven. And worse: some cryptos, dubbed “shitcoins”, are financial scams in the first place or debased daily by their sponsor. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and claims of misbehaviour, including pump and dump, spoofing, wash trading and front-running by exchanges, are widespread. Stablecoins claim to be superior. But New York authorities are already investigating whether one, tether, is being used to manipulate the price of bitcoin. Vitalik Buterin, a co-founder of the cryptocurrency ethereum, argues that no crypto can be at the same time scalable, safe and decentralised. Traditional financial systems are scalable and safe: if your credit card or bank account is hacked or stolen, you are made whole. But they are centralised because participants and assets are verified by trusted institutions. Right now, crypto is neither scalable nor safe. If your private key is stolen or lost, the assets are gone for good. It isn’t even decentralised. Oligopolistic miners control most bitcoin mining. Many are out of reach of western law enforcement in places such as China, Russia and Belarus, creating a national security nightmare. About 99 per cent of bitcoin trading occurs on centralised exchanges, which may be hackable. Furthermore, the original programmers retain outsized control over their creations. In some cases they act as police, prosecutors and judges, and reverse transactions that are supposed to be immutable. Nor is crypto equitable: a small number of “whales” control much of bitcoin’s value. This undermines claims that crypto will decentralise finance, provide banking services to the unbanked, or make the poor rich. Blockchain claims to enable cheap money transfers to refugees, but crypto is much more likely to provide cover for scam artists, conmen, tax evaders, criminals, terrorists and human traffickers. Our world is beset by financial crises, geopolitical risks and very loose monetary policy. There is growing demand for safe haven assets that are a hedge against inflation, currency depreciation and debasement and tail risks. Gold, inflation-indexed bonds, commodities, real estate and even equities are all reasonable candidates. Risky, volatile bitcoin doesn’t belong in the portfolios of serious institutional investors. Many of its retail backers are suckers being manipulated by an army of self-serving insiders and snake oil salesmen. Tesla’s Elon Musk and MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor may be betting the house on bitcoin. That doesn’t mean you should.

https://www.ft.com/content/c1caca5b-01f7-41be-85a4-3ecb883f2417,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Get ready for self-driving banks,Lenders run by algorithms and blockchain technology will require 21st century regulation,The writer is the US acting comptroller of the currency In 1961, Popular Science magazine envisioned self-driving cars. The reality arrived sooner than anyone anticipated, and before safety regulators could adapt. Most automotive laws — on speed limits, giving signals, drink-driving — had been designed to protect against dangerous drivers, not dangerous cars. Autonomous vehicles brought new risks that legacy rules never considered. As one headline on the Wired website put it: “Who’s Regulating Self-Driving Cars? Often, No One”. Banking is headed down the same road. And it’s being driven by the technology behind decentralised finance, or DeFi. But just as the original rules of the road protected us from other drivers, so our current bank regulations exist mainly to prevent human failings. At the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, we require every bank to have officers responsible for its safety — such as a chief risk officer and a chief audit executive. We limit how much banks can lend to their directors. We even make some bank employees take a certain amount of vacation so others can sit at their desks and identify potential fraud. We call it bank regulation, but we’re really regulating bankers. DeFi turns all this on its head. It leverages blockchain technology to deliver services with no human intermediation. One example is creating money markets with algorithmically derived interest rates based on supply and demand — rates that traditional banks set by committee. Other DeFi projects include decentralised exchanges that allow users to trade without brokers, and protocols for lending that do not involve loan officers or credit committees. Although these “self-driving banks” are new, they are not small. They are likely to be mainstream before self-driving cars start to fly. However, self-driving banks present the same challenges and opportunities as autonomous vehicles. On the opportunity side, they can allow savers to stop shopping around for the best interest rates by having algorithms do this for them. They can also end discrimination against certain borrowers by having software make credit decisions. They could even eliminate the risk of fraud or corruption by no longer being run by humans at all. Self-driving banks also present new risks, though. If technology accelerates withdrawal of depositors’ funds, just as high-frequency trading can accelerate equity sell-offs, that could increase liquidity risk compared with traditional banks. Asset volatility could be a concern for similar reasons. And the management of loan collateral could be more difficult if humans are not involved in valuations. There is also a risk that, in the absence of federal regulatory clarity, US states rush to fill the void and create a patchwork of inconsistent rules that impede the orderly development of a national market. This is exactly what happened with self-driving cars. Federal regulators must therefore determine what a regulatory scheme for self-driving banks should look like. Could they ensure fair treatment of customers by such a bank? Sure. Most bias and compliance issues are failures of software. Not the software you code, but the kind hard-wired into human brains. Bias can creep also into the rules of algorithms, but it is easier to root out. Could regulators properly examine a bank that exists only as software? Yes, we can. It may be easier than supervising banks today. Our examiners could be retrained to read the algorithms that make deposit pricing or credit decisions and work out whether they comply with legal requirements. Could regulators ensure self-driving banks properly serve their communities? Absolutely. Their greater efficiency would free significant amounts of capital that is lost to operating costs today or slowed by decisions dependent on human grey matter. Of course, algorithmic banks would change the nature of employment in the financial sector — with far fewer bank tellers and more coders. But creating better compensated and value-added jobs may prove a societal benefit in the long run. Could the OCC even grant a national bank charter to open-source software that manages deposit-taking, lending, or payments, if it doesn’t have officers or directors? Not yet. Under current law, drawn up on the assumptions of the early 20th century, charters can only be issued to human beings. But those antiquated rules should be revisited, just as regulations that still mandate the use of fax machines should be. Could we usher in a future where we eliminate error, stop discrimination, and achieve universal access for all? Optimists like me think so. How different would banking in the US be today if regulators, bankers, and policymakers were as bold as carmakers 10 years ago?,,Brian Brooks,2021-01-12T12:00:01.329Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/625fbd5a-d90c-434f-998d-5e0eeb4c0f71,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Bitcoin has ambitions for gold’s role,After years of hostility to cryptocurrencies, central banks will permit them a limited role,The writer is chairman of Fulcrum Asset Management Investors in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have enjoyed a phenomenal run, but they are now worried that Janet Yellen’s arrival as US Treasury secretary may herald a new era of hostility from regulators and central banks towards what boosters call “libertarian” forms of digital money. In her last press conference as chair of the Federal Reserve in 2017, Ms Yellen said bitcoin was a “highly speculative asset” and “not a stable store of value”. These dismissive remarks were echoed by many other public officials at the time. Since then, however, the market value of bitcoin has roughly doubled. Digital currencies are here to stay. In the first crypto frenzy of 2017-18, comedian John Oliver described bitcoin as “everything you don’t understand about money combined with everything you don’t understand about computers”. The technology aspects, particularly the blockchain network of digital ledgers that are used to record transactions, have not really lived up to the initial hype, but they are beginning to make progress. The issuance of $20bn in “initial coin offerings” seemed to contain elements of a speculative bubble, but the funds raised are now being used to launch projects broadly similar to other IT ventures in Silicon Valley. Jay Clayton’s recent departure from the chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission may result in less hostile regulatory scrutiny of these activities, especially if Gary Gensler, who teaches about digital currencies, replaces him. However, resistance to digital currencies as payments and transfer vehicles is likely to remain. Partly because of high transaction costs, bitcoin is not widely used for payments, and its future role seems limited. The outgoing Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has been working on new regulations to increase transparency in bitcoin transfers and reduce the scope for money laundering. Ms Yellen, in conjunction with the Fed, is likely to adopt an even more orthodox approach, treating the payments system as a quintessential public good. The Fed is collaborating with foreign counterparts in investigating the development of central bank digital currencies. It is almost certain that CBDCs will eventually be issued in the major jurisdictions, following China’s lead. However, they will be denominated in national currencies, not crypto. Private competitors denominated in genuinely new currencies, such as bitcoin, will be heavily regulated or actively discouraged. Hybrid stablecoins, such as Facebook’s libra, that are pegged to a single currency or other real assets may be more welcomed by central banks, if they were directly transferable into traditional currencies. Furthermore, they may not be powered by blockchain. Each of the major central banks may develop its own distributed ledger technology. That still leaves a role for crypto as an investment vehicle and store of value. Can bitcoin seriously compete with gold as a safe asset for the largest investors? History, regulation and market volatility make that seem improbable, but it is beginning to develop a more important role. Many big hedge funds and some conventional asset managers have followed Paul Tudor Jones in adopting bitcoin as a core hedge against inflation. While this may have seemed attractive when central banks were in effect creating money by buying up government debt last year, there are few signs of inflation on the imminent horizon. Yet bitcoin prices have continued to rise, apparently driven by a narrative that holds that a privately created asset, which in theory has a finite supply, cannot be “printed” like the “legacy” fiat currencies. According to Gold Hub, gold stocks held above ground amounted to 198,000 tonnes at the end of 2019, with about 57,000 tonnes of proven reserves below ground. This total stock would be valued at about $17tn in today’s prices. The latest market value of bitcoin is about $0.6tn — bitcoin bulls see this as a gauge of how much further its price could rise. There seems little reason on monetary policy or financial stability grounds why regulators should be worried about cryptocurrencies competing with gold as a store of value. The crypto world is currently in a frenzy of short-term speculation. However, if investors continue to buy into the dubious narrative that these private currencies are “safer” than those controlled by the central banks, they could rise much further in market value in coming years. Stranger things have certainly happened in financial markets.

The digital token’s price has fallen to about 20 cents, down from $3 in late 2017. There is no reason to expect a rebound. XRP was created in 2012 by the founders of Ripple, the San Francisco-based payments company. It is described as a currency — crucial to facilitate blockchain payments. But XRP is not necessary for Ripple’s products and its use as a currency is limited. The SEC accuses Ripple, chief executive Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen of selling $1.38bn of XRP to retail investors as an unregistered security. What took the SEC so long? XRP is not the first token it has targeted. In 2017, it declared tokens offered by an organisation called The DAO were securities. But the SEC’s framework for such action comes from a 1946 Supreme Court decision that focuses on whether something is an investment with the expectation of profit through another’s work. Decentralised digital currencies are hard to categorise this way. The SEC’s tardiness in updating its own definition has ensured that the crypto industry remains a sideshow. Even so, the case against XRP is unlikely to weigh on cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which are not linked to one company. More than half of all XRP is owned by Ripple. The SEC’s case focuses on the lack of information given to investors compared with that held by the company. For true XRP believers there is always reason to hope. Ripple has vowed to fight. And incoming acting SEC chair Elad Roisman may prove more amenable than Jay Clayton, who once declared “every ICO [initial coin offering] I’ve seen is a security”. Ripple’s own business can survive, given its products do not require XRP. But its reputation has taken a hard hit. Its valuation, last set at $10bn, was tied to a digital token whose price was always hard to justify. Now it is impossible to do so.

https://www.ft.com/content/7d2c67f0-9e02-4d12-b647-1131127b3524,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,LVMH digital chief to join French fintech start-up,Ian Rogers trades Louis Vuitton glam for new frontier of digital currencies,Ian Rogers, LVMH’s chief digital officer, has left the luxury giant to join a French start-up called Ledger that is a world leader in making hardware-based digital wallets to hold cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. The California native has spent much of his career at the intersection of music and technology as a serial entrepreneur. LVMH recruited him in 2015 from Apple where he helped roll out its streaming service, and enlisted him to expand its ecommerce operations and inject brands such as Louis Vuitton and Dior with more digital knowhow. Now Mr Rogers, 48, is trading in LVMH’s glitzy offices on luxury shopping street Avenue Montaigne for Ledger’s more modest digs in a central Paris neighbourhood called Silicon Sentier that is home to many start-ups. His mission as Ledger’s chief experience officer will be to expand its consumer business and help bring cryptocurrency ownership to the masses as opposed to the relatively niche activity it remains today. “When I look at cryptocurrency, privacy and security, I have a similar feeling I did about music in the early 2000s at the beginning of the streaming era,” said Mr Rogers in an interview. “There is an inevitable change coming, but it’s the very beginning, so not everything will be easily predictable . . . but these are very fast-growing markets, so that’s where I like to be.” Mr Roger’s move to Ledger comes amid a rally in bitcoin this year — the price hit an intraday high last week of $19,510 before dropping back. Many new investors have flocked to the asset, helped by improvements to the tools and trading platforms that facilitate bitcoin trading. Some also see bitcoin as a potential inflation hedge. Ledger, which was founded in 2013, sells hardware security products to protect users of cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications to secure their digital assets. It has sold about 2m digital wallets across 165 countries, with its Nano series among the industry’s most popular hardware solutions. Ledger has raised $87m from venture investors including Draper Esprit and Samsung Ventures. The valuation implied in its last funding round in 2018 has not been disclosed. Pascal Gauthier, chief executive, said Ledger planned to hire more than 100 people next year to expand its existing workforce of 250. Most of the start-up’s sales come from consumers, but in 2018 it began marketing a product called Ledger Vault to institutional investors such as hedge funds that needed to secure their crypto assets. “We want to grow by bringing new features to the technology to make it more secure and easier to use,” said Mr Gauthier. “I need help to scale the business and take it to the next level, and Ian has the experience, leadership, vision and management skills to help.” While at LVMH, Mr Rogers helped refine the luxury conglomerate’s approach to how it sells and promotes its brands online, winning over some insiders who feared ecommerce and social media would dilute the exclusivity of the group’s products. Ecommerce has accelerated in luxury this year as the pandemic has forced months of store closures. Some analysts predict ecommerce will account for nearly half of luxury sales by 2025 when the industry is expected to have recovered from the impact of Covid-19. Mr Rogers said he would remain an adviser to LVMH on digital projects, as well as continuing to run its annual innovation awards, a competition for luxury, fashion and ecommerce start-ups.,,Leila Abboud,2020-11-30T05:00:24.121Z,

First, we published a piece on Her Majesty the Queen apparently expressing an interest in blockchain. She had been sent a copy of a “peer-reviewed blockchain journal” (!) and her private secretary had replied that our Liz “was interested to learn that the publication is the first open access blockchain publication research journal available both in print and online”. We must now inform you that it was meant to be a bit of a joke. We weren’t convinced that our 94-year-old monarch was really that interested in Byzantine Fault Tolerance and proof-of-work mechanisms. But some people got very excited about it nonetheless. The CEO of Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange, tweeted our story saying “I wonder how many #Bitcoin she has. The Express declared in a headline: Queen left delighted after learning about Bitcoin after receiving peculiar gift. Business Insider added vital context by noting in its write-up of the story: “It's unclear whether the monarch had any prior blockchain knowledge before receiving the journal.” (We have got to be honest: we are still not sure that the Queen is now in possession of such “blockchain knowledge”.) And then later on Tuesday Alphaville editor Izabella Kaminska, the Original Bitcoin Cynic, wrote an op-ed for the FT in which she appeared to undergo some kind of a Damascene conversion, arguing that “bitcoin finally finds a rationale in doomsday scenarios”. (She hadn’t really undergone any such conversion; she noted that all her reservations remained, but that in the “far-fetched” scenario of a future dystopian reality in which the world has slid into authoritarianism, bitcoin could act as a kind of hedge.) (There was also former Alphavillain Tracy Alloway’s apparent actual Damascene conversion a few days earlier.) We are afraid that collectively — and in particular, we suspect, HM the Queen — we may have sent bitcoin mooning. Bitcoin jumped by about $1,000 on Tuesday, climbing above $19,000 to its highest since the bitcoin-manic days of December 2017. On Wednesday it inched up a little further to top $19,500, just shy of its all-time-high of about $19,666 (depending on which exchange you go with). And now, number go down! At pixel time, bitcoin had slid about 10 per cent at around $17,200. Here’s a chart showing the past week’s price moves, courtesy of Coindesk: Last time we looked, Ethereum was also down 13 per cent on the day; XRP had lost 21 per cent. We are not going to — and nor will we ever — argue that bitcoin will never again rise to such heights. It might, but then again it might not. Without any fundamentals to judge the price on, it is purely based, as we have said many times before, on speculation. Sometimes it does well when risk appetite is low; sometimes it does badly. That all makes the price pretty much impossible to predict. But we feel that for now at least, we might have triggered The Top. And for all those bitcoin bros* who have been desperately telling their followers stuff like this: We can only apologise. We hope you enjoy your carnivorous Thanksgiving dinners despite today’s plunge. *NB: not all of those we who we deem bitcoin bros self-identify as bitcoin bros.,,Jemima Kelly,2020-11-26T14:06:20.702Z,

https://www.ft.com/content/ffc5ea03-cdbe-4d20-b61f-3a10f2b6b986,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,On guard for breakdowns and rule breakers,From goats to government, digital tools help businesses keep watch for faulty connections in supply chains,Mongolian goat herders can go days without seeing a car, a building or even a power line. Yet, despite their remoteness, they are a visible part of a global supply chain. Digital technology enables the cashmere wool they produce to be tracked from Mongolia to the point where it is sold in luxury markets across the world. A mobile phone app, developed by Convergence.tech of Toronto, Canada, uses blockchain to help herders achieve better prices for their cashmere by verifying that it is not sourced from areas that have been overgrazed, which turns grasslands into deserts, contributing to localised climate change and air pollution. The app is an example of how, in a complex, volatile and resource-stressed global economy, digital technology can link up parts of a supply chain and provide increasing detail. The goat herders are not the only beneficiaries. Data and digital technologies are also helping global companies keep their operations running at a time when, according to McKinsey, the consultancy, a supply chain disruption lasting a month or more will happen every 3.7 years when averaged across industries. To cope with such disruptions, Flex, which designs and makes electronics, has established worldwide Flex Pulse centres that use real-time data and visualisations to watch events in its supply chains. As the coronavirus spread from Asia to other continents, Flex created dedicated dashboards to track the effect of the outbreak on its operations. “I can look at a region, at a site, for a specific customer, down to a part number, at the touch of a button,” says Lynn Torrel, chief supply chain and procurement officer at Flex. In helping to manage supply chain disruption, one of technology’s most powerful functions is to collect and combine information from a variety of sources. Boston Scientific, the US medical device company, integrates various supply chain indicators, from sales data to insights gained by commercial teams from customers about medical procedures being scheduled, into what it calls a “control tower”. “We put that all together into algorithms that help drive our forecasting,” says Terrance Brick, vice-president of global supply chain. Buyers want a lot more data than before — and they want it to be verifiable As well as enabling companies to plan during political or economic turbulence, technology underpins transparency. Demand for information on everything from companies’ carbon footprints to their human rights records has increased. Investors seek to create portfolios of businesses that can verify their ESG (environmental, social and governance) credentials, while consumers are keener than ever to know how products are sourced and made. “Buyers, whether industrial or consumer, are asking for a lot more data than before — and they want it to be verifiable,” says Raj Rao, general manager of blockchain platforms at IBM Food Trust. The hunger for data extends to the food industry, where the IBM Food Trust enables foods to be traced for safety and efficiency, to minimise waste and confirm their sustainability. For Convergence.tech, a digital transformation company that works with government bodies, humanitarian agencies and corporations, blockchain allows two functions that are critical to sustainable sourcing: defining where products come from and who has handled them on the way. “We wanted to disrupt and add value to two very broken systems: identity and traceability,” says Chami Akmeemana, the company’s chief executive. Technology can also make it easy to pass information to customers who want to track their own environmental footprint. Ukraine has saved itself billions of dollars with its transparent procurement system Boston Scientific does this by giving customers such as hospitals access to parts of its global data synchronisation network. This uses a cloud database as a “single source of truth” for product information. Customers can find customised data such as the amount of carbon or plastic in the products they are about to buy, says Mr Brick. Work to increase supply chain transparency is also under way in the public sector. The technology is critical, for instance, when governments try to rid their procurement processes of corruption and cronyism. Recommended In Ukraine, a digital procurement system called ProZorro (“transparent”) enables government agencies to manage contracts electronically and transparently. “You can follow all the contracts throughout their lifecycle. They collect information about the planning, bidding and winning of those contracts — and they’ve saved themselves billions of dollars,” says Gavin Hayman, executive director of the Open Contracting Partnership, a not-for-profit organisation whose aim is to improve public-sector contracting. But digitally enabled transparency alone is not the solution, he says. It must be accompanied by changes in policy and practice. “It’s got to be linked to actions, otherwise you just get transparent corruption.” The case studies below are a shortlist of entries to the FT Intelligent Business awards event held online on November 19. All the entries showcase the combined use of data and tech in business operations. Source: RSG Consulting  Winner: DHL, Blue Yonder and Microsoft DHL, the German distributor responsible for logistics for some of the biggest household names globally, worked with software company Blue Yonder to deploy robotics to automate tasks in its warehouses, with Microsoft software providing data analytics and artificial intelligence to optimise resources. One example of how Microsoft and Blue Yonder are helping businesses is with Morrisons, the UK supermarket chain, where it has forecast demand fluctuation during the coronavirus lockdown and automated inventory orders. This has improved the on-shelf availability of products by 30 per cent and reduced the in-store inventory by two to three days. Boston Scientific Thanks to efforts over the past five years to digitise the operations of Boston Scientific, the medical device maker took eight weeks to redeploy its sales reps using predictive data analytics of where and when demand would fluctuate, speeding up a process that would normally take six to eight months. The IT team has developed a data analytics tool that integrates sales data from the enterprise resource planning system with public data on Covid-19 rates and regional responses. Insights are presented via a dashboard that helps the business make decisions about deploying sales reps and managing inventory. Flex The electronics manufacturing company used Flex Pulse, its supply chain visualisation software, to respond quickly as Covid-19 spread. The database was reconfigured during the pandemic to provide more detailed information about supplier locations, allowing Flex to manage up to 8,000 daily shortages across its 16,000 suppliers. The data provided intelligence on how long the shortages were expected to last, enabling the business to look for alternative suppliers where needed. The company estimates that before Covid-19 it would usually manage between 1,600 and 1,800 shortages daily. State of New Hampshire and Dun & Bradstreet At the start of the pandemic, business intelligence company Dun & Bradstreet launched its Covid-19 Business Impact Research platform, with free access for government agencies. The platform has been used to verify suppliers and measure economic recovery from the crisis. The US state of New Hampshire used the platform to review suppliers 75 per cent faster than before and exclude 10 per cent of potential suppliers, allowing the state to scale up its personal protective equipment (PPE) supply chain while minimising the risk of scams or fulfilment issues. Currently, 35 of 50 states use the platform. Verizon The introduction of 5G presented the telecommunications company with the opportunity to abandon its legacy systems and move to SAP, a single enterprise resource planning platform. This has given Verizon greater visibility into its equipment stocks, and allowed the company to consolidate its 30 wireless equipment warehouses, which were managed regionally, into three nationally managed centres, reducing working capital on inventory by 20 per cent. Increased access to data has enabled the business to identify problems in the supply chain faster and use algorithms to predict other areas that may be affected.  ,,Sarah Murray,2020-11-20T04:30:06.715Z,

The deal, which aims to raise up to $3bn in total, will allow investors to buy digital tokens that are backed by deposits at the bank’s branch in Labuan, an island tax haven in Malaysia. The tokens will be available for purchase by ordinary investors on an exchange in the territory that specialises in digital assets and can be traded using either dollars or bitcoin. The move comes amid a wider push towards new technologies in China’s rapidly evolving financial industry, with the central bank working on a digital version of the renminbi after a period in which online payments systems have taken off. “China is big on blockchain and all of the big Chinese banks are majorly engaged in this area,” said Henry Chong, chief executive of Fusang Exchange, where the tokens will be traded and which uses blockchain technology to record ownership. He said the deal would allow global investors to “benefit from access to an investment previously reserved for only the largest institutions, together with low and transparent fees”. The deal works as a securitisation, in which investors purchase notes issued by a vehicle that deposits the proceeds at China Construction Bank Labuan (CCB Labuan). The notes, which are available as digital tokens, can be bought for as little as $100 and are backed by the underlying deposits at the bank. Recommended The investment provides a return of 50 basis points over Libor, an interbank benchmark commonly used to price loans and contracts, or about 0.75 per cent, which CCB Labuan and Fusang said in a joint release was “considerably higher than market interest rates for typical fixed deposits”. They added that the bond was “the first digital security to be listed on a public stock exchange that is directly accessible by retail investors”. Felix Feng Qi, principal officer at CCB Labuan, said the issuance “serves to narrow the divide between fintech and the wider financial markets”. At the end of last year, Fitch Ratings said that the application of blockchain technology in Chinese securitisations “seems to have proceeded at a faster pace than in other parts of the world”. The rating agency added that the technology “has the potential to promote data transparency and transactional efficiency”. China Construction Bank is the sponsor and lead arranger for the deal. The tokens will begin trading on Friday. ,,Thomas Hale,2020-11-11T10:03:05.973Z,

TRUMP DEFEATS COVID WITH ICONS OF HIS ENTIRE FIRST TERM!” The coins’ artistic merits are described thusly on the gift shop’s website: . . . a new commemorative that vividly shows President Trump's historic presidential candidacy win, itself, from his descent on the elevator in Trump Tower, against a veritable army of superb Republican presidential candidates confluent with taunts, jeers, sneers by Media naysayers—to present day with design motifs of President Trump's ascendance over and personal defeat of the deadly COVID pandemic virus. The series creator and designer is one Anthony Gianni, who happens to be both the CEO of the gift shop but also (according to his LinkedIn) someone who “guides a unique team in the research and development of supercomputer systems for neural network mapping, simulation and AI models for use in neuroscience research as well as synergistic intelligence and defence systems modelling.” Intriguing. Yes? We then found the following tweet bearing some gratuitous imagery of Donald J. Trump fighting off coronavirus that began circulating on Nov 2, which may or may not be related: While we cannot confirm that the depiction is definitely related to the giftshop series, we couldn’t help but clock its stylistic similarity to some of the artistic visualisation often found in the cryptocurrency realm, especially the HODL coins. Could there be more to Donald Trump and crypto than first meets the eye? What we do know is that the Donald famously disappointed crypto lovers when he disparaged bitcoin back in July 2019, noting: But thanks to Emily Dreyfuss, a journalist at the Harvard Shorenstein Center’s Technology and Social Change project, who was published in the New York Times on Thursday, we now know that Trump’s iconoclastic tweeting and/or use and abuse of typos may be part of an elaborate strategy to backchannel secret messages to his most loyal fans. Of course, the idea Trump is possibly working in tandem with the mysterious “Q”, who drops esoteric messages on message boards such as 8kun in a bid to reveal the reach and scale of the deep state, has long been at the heart of the Qanon conspiracy theory. That theory states that Trump’s tweets are being used as proofs that the messages being put out by Q are really linked to insiders with special or advanced knowledge of things to come. That the system links to the seediest ends of the “free speech” internet, however, has done little for Qanon’s credibility with the mainstream press. Qanon followers have, instead, been labelled as deluded and potentially dangerous extremists who can’t help seeing connections where there are none, and who may also be preparing for a coup. The retort from the Qanon followers is that the presence of Q on such sites is not an endorsement of the extremist content. Rather, the backchannel system was established there precisely because it was the only way to guarantee resilience in the face of censorship by major platforms like Twitter and Facebook. Either way, there is no escaping the fact that The New York Times, by seeing fit to publish an opinion piece pandering to the delusional idea that DJT is smart enough to use secret codes in his Tweetstorms, has inadvertently also confirmed the worst of the Qanon fears. DoNALd TrUMp really is speaking in Code. So is it conceivable that Donald might secretly be a crypto blockchain bro too? Well, there’s a cute but desperate theory also doing the rounds that the current election capitulation is actually all just Kayfabe -- a sort of Sun-Tzu “art of war” diversion. In “reality” the STOP THE COUNT mess was entirely pre-engineered and Donald outwitted everyone by secretly watermarking ballot papers and tying them to the immutable power of the blockchain. So every illegal ballot is fully traceable and detectable. Yes really. Here’s the vid where Steve Pieczenik, a former state department guy, explains how the elaborate sting operation was set up and how it will prove the true scale of the rigging at hand. What can we say? Clearly the Donald has not been reading Alphaville. Even if the theory wasn’t bunkum, which of course it is, there’s the longstanding problem that blockchain can’t and never has been able to control for the garbage-in and garbage-out problem. Pieczenik also neglects to mention that if blockchain was indeed used to trace every single ballot, it would be a major breach of voter secrecy rules. In the best-case scenario, Trump would just be replacing one illegal act with another illegal one. What’s more, there’s no one in the official coinspace that gives the theory credence. Adding fuel to the conspiracy fire, however, was an interesting side development that got buried as a result of the election debacle. The US attorney’s office in San Francisco has now revealed it was behind the $1bn in bitcoin that was transferred unexpectedly on Nov 4. The sum -- linked to the 2013 Silk Road bust -- had previously sat unmoved in a mysterious wallet since 2015. How and to what degree that will be linked to the debacle is still unknown. What we can be sure of is that until waters settle and power is properly transferred, the consensus-reality of conspiracyland will be ablaze with all sorts of bonkers possibilities.

The open-ledger technology launched a million management consultancy reports. It was supposed to authenticate diamonds, underpin a cache of cryptocurrencies, prove the provenance of pork and replace signatures on contracts. Bullish management consultants were chief flag bearers, insisting blockchain would prove as game changing as the internet. Distributed ledger technology was supposed to collapse costs, eliminating duplicative record-keeping along transaction chains, and bolster trust. As early as 2016, Bain & Co was chiding banks for being slow on the uptake and risking their incumbent position. The ensuing four years have hardly seen a rush: a few piecemeal applications have emerged, such as HSBC in trade finance and Walmart in food provenance. Google searches for the term are running at roughly a tenth of peak popularity levels in late 2017. Bulls, leery of writing off the technology they championed, pin the delay on complexity and “scalability”, reinforcing the sense that the main product of blockchain has been more jargon. Integrating blockchain into the financial industry was never going to be as straightforward as migrating data from in-house servers to the cloud. Intense collaboration is required: between regulators, clients, infrastructure providers and, in many cases, competitors. In the absence of set standards, players have to take a punt and risk ending up with blockchain’s version of Betamax. As apps like WhatsApp or Uber show, broad take-up and a deep ecosystem is needed. Coronavirus and geopolitics have diverted executive attention. Financial services was once viewed as the most fertile ground, inspiring projects at the likes of JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. But the technology has suffered from its associations with bitcoin. The cryptocurrency has made some people very rich, but its reputation was tarnished by its use for illegal transactions. Other digital currencies have floundered: see Facebook’s heavily watered-down Libra plans. All this suggests the lead will not be taken by the private sector, after all. Fittingly, some of the biggest advances have come from China, led by the central bank. Millions of digital yuan transactions took place during a recent pilot programme. More tentatively, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has signalled plans to look into regulation while noting “we should not run before we can walk”. PwC predicts blockchain could add $1.76tn — or 1.4 per cent of global gross domestic product — to economic output over the next decade. More than a decade after its birth, that still looks a stretch.

https://www.ft.com/content/a2a43f84-1b9c-4aae-b5c5-6786aff81654,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,PwC: blockchain potentially has LOADS of potential,So let us all “seize the opportunity to explore blockchain solutions”!,Some people think there’s potentially a lot of potential in the blockchain. But it can be hard to visualise potential, can’t it? Because it’s so vague, so amorphous, so indeterminate. That’s why we need numbers. And charts. Because even if those numbers and charts are just potential numbers and charts with absolutely no connection to reality, they give us something that we can actually see with our own eyes. So here is what blockchain’s potential potential looks like, fresh from PwC’s new “Economic impact of Blockchain” report: Isn’t that a beautiful chart? So simple. So exponential. As you can see there, PwC’s economists have decided that blockchain has the potential to boost global gross domestic product by $1.76tn over the next decade! Potentially accounting for 2.3 per cent of GDP in 2030! (The word “potential” is used 15 times in the report.) And if that feels too far away for you then no worries because it’s going to boost GDP by $66bn even in 2021! PwC’s experts also expect “the majority of businesses to be using the technology in some form by 2025”. Which is quite surprising given that the blockchain has been around for more than ten years and it’s very difficult to find a single major company that has gone beyond the experimentation stage with it. But sure, give everyone four years and two-and-a-half months longer and why not! The report was bulked out by some compelling quotes, like this from PwC’s “global Blockchain leader” Steve Davies: Serious activity around blockchain is cutting through every industry across the globe right now. It’s driven by an acute need to win trust in the digital world. We’re not sure about your industry, but we can confirm that serious activity around blockchain is certainly cutting through the media . . . never to be seen again. (Remember Civil? Yeah.) Also we thought blockchain was the new internet but apparently it’s the new barcode! Barcode pioneer Brian Marcel, chairman of IBCS Group is quoted in the report thus: There’s a competitive advantage to be gained in adopting blockchain technology early because it’s going to change the world like barcodes did in the 70s and 80s — creating even greater trust in all of your business transactions. Actually wait — it’s also the new internet!! Guenther Dobrauz, a PwC global leader in financial services, tells us (emphasis ours): Blockchain is going to become an infrastructure technology — like the internet. No one really cares how the internet works, but it has become integral to our daily lives. The same will be true of blockchain. We haven’t reached that tipping point yet because there are no dominant players. At some point soon, this will change. Can’t argue with that. Aside from the hype, there’s quite a lot in PwC’s report that strikes us as not quite correct. Like this: The technology, as we’ll see in this report, creates digital records — such as certificates, public registers or agreements — which are stored, shared and amended online. Blockchain does not create certificates or public registers or agreements. In the bitcoin version of blockchain, it does automatically generate a record of a transaction (literally a transfer of strings of 1s and 0s from one person to another). But it does not create a digital record aside from a string of 1s and 0s. That record has to be put into the blockchain, either manually or by some other means, but the blockchain in and of itself does not create the record. And this one of our major issues with the tech. Because you know, GIGO. It’s no good having an immutable record of the provenance of your venti salted caramel mocha coffee frappuccino with extra cream if you can’t be sure that the supply chain of each of the 923 ingredients has been recorded accurately on the ledger in the first place. PwC concludes: As organisations look to reconfigure and embrace new technology, they should seize the opportunity to explore blockchain solutions. It’s quite comforting really. The world might be turning upside down but at least we can count on blockchain hype to keep on filling up our inboxes unabatedly, unashamedly, uninvitedly. Thank you Satoshi.

But you’ve probably heard less (if anything) about AntChain, formerly Ant Blockchain, “a new technology brand for Ant Group’s blockchain-based solutions that also aggregates other digital technologies including AI, Internet of Things (IoT) and secure computation”. Sounds good though, doesn’t it? In a kind of chucking-random-buzzwords-onto-a-wall-and-seeing-what-sticks kind of way. You probably want a bit more information, though. In this “space”, one tends to find that hype is heavy and detail is light, and “blockchain-based solutions” doesn’t get us that far really. Well, look no further, because we of course have you covered. Or to be more specific, the “Elderly University of Alipay Choir” has you covered. What’s that, we hear you ask? Well, it’s a Chinese university for senior citizens, which is sponsored by Alipay as part of their philanthropic projects. Ant, the parent company of Alipay, says the song was not created by them (Ant is the parent company of Alipay). So this was, apparently, a voluntary thing. Don’t you just love philanthropy? The “seniors” dressed up as ants (geddit?) and created a rather proselytising yet wondrous video to explain all of the things that AntChain will be able to make better in this world (h/t Chris Skinner for drawing our attention to this one via his blog a few days ago; the video was originally posted on Twitter in July). Someone on the internet then translated the video into English, which Ant has confirmed is pretty much a correct translation, apart from some typos. The video doesn’t seem to be on YouTube so we can’t embed it, but you can watch the whole thing here. And yes, that is the melody of The Lonely Goatherd from Sound of Music. Do watch the whole thing — it’s quite magical. To give you a taste, here is a little excerpt: Dear young friends do you know You got left by us bommer [sic] We are using blockchain to track the supplychain of Tanshan pears Trace it from farm to table, do you know? Us boomer, we all know Your young fellas already got left behind Get on blockchain, get on blockchain, get on antchain And here’s another still: Blockchain is a serious matter for Ant, though. The company has been working on blockchain projects for several years, and boasts that it holds “the greatest number of published blockchain-related patent applications from 2017 to the six months ended June 30, 2020”. Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, from which Ant was spun out, and who owns almost 10 per cent of Ant’s shares and half of the voting power, is very bullish on the technology. Very bullish. According to the South China Morning Post, Ma said back in 2018 that: We have to turn to blockchain, otherwise it would be fatal. Get on blockchain get on blockchain get on Antchain! P.S. Izzy says if there was ever evidence that blockchain is the pathway to a Borg hive existence for all humanity, it’s this.

As in so many other areas, technology is transforming trust-based transactions, but it has also created new problems of its own. When we were all muddy-faced peasants living in villages, we relied on gossip to know whom to trust. When life became more sophisticated, we created expert institutions to build societal trust. Now, thanks to technology, we outsource much of our judgment to total strangers, who rate products, drivers, apps, employers and people’s spare rooms online. This third trust revolution has underpinned the emergence of huge new digital businesses, such as Alibaba, Uber and Airbnb. Connecting everybody online creates a powerful “hive mind” that can capture the wisdom of crowds. But one of the troubles with these models of distributed trust is that they are themselves too trusting — they do not pay enough attention to original sin. They also open up digital platforms to criminals and propagandists. Trust may be the currency of the sharing economy; sadly, it has already been debased. Two Financial Times investigations this month have highlighted how trust can be manipulated on even the best-resourced tech platforms. The first showed how Amazon’s online marketplace in the UK had been infested with fake reviewers giving five-star recommendations to little-known Chinese products. Following the investigation, Amazon deleted 20,000 product reviews. The second revealed how highly organised “ratings farms” have manipulated rankings on Apple’s App Store. Boosting the rating of an app above four stars can have a big impact on usage on a platform that facilitates more than $500bn of commerce. “The problem is that the truth gets rained on,” one industry expert said. Similar trust problems have plagued other platforms. Uber has had rogue drivers, Facebook political propagandists and Airbnb fake customers exploiting loopholes in automated systems. Rachel Botsman, the author and academic who was one of the earliest enthusiasts about the power of distributed trust, acknowledges that the revolution has so far failed to deliver on its potential. “The promise is still there, but the mechanisms are wrong and clunky,” she said. Recommended It is undoubtedly hard to deliver trust on an industrial scale involving many millions of online interactions. But Ms Botsman highlights the positive examples of distributed trust that have emerged among small groups of local users on WhatsApp or Nextdoor helping out neighbours during the coronavirus crisis. “Where distributed trust works best is not in a global marketplace but where it is hyper-localised,” she said. That suggests that our village mentality remains strong. Personal connections, word-of-mouth recommendations and societal sanction for the untrustworthy can all play a vital role in building online trust, too. The answer may be to try to integrate all three of the models, combining individual recommendations with institutional trustworthiness and collective wisdom. This combination can create powerful knots of trust. One business that is attempting to do just that is UrbanSitter, a San Francisco-based start-up focusing on the babysitting market. Sitters register with the service and are checked out by company staff, who scour personal submissions, criminal records and social media posts. In return, families are scrutinised to ensure the safety of sitters. Both parties are subject to two-way appraisals and performance measures. The company, founded in 2011, has facilitated more than 1m bookings across the US, creating a nationwide web of referrals. “All this builds up a much more trusted ecosystem,” says Lynn Perkins, UrbanSitter’s founder and chief executive. “We are trying to give you word-of-mouth trust in an easy-to-use service.” It may be a similar story with blockchain — or distributed ledger technology — perhaps the ultimate distributed trust model. There are perhaps some workable, if limited, examples of trusted institutions creating “permissioned” blockchains between themselves to expedite share transfers, for example. But wholly “permissionless” decentralised blockchains, championed by the technology’s purists, can generate considerable risks. Trust cannot, and should not, be purely automated. Humans have to remain in the loop. john.thornhill@ft.com ,,John Thornhill,2020-09-14T13:57:23.161Z,

That’s because outside of cryptoland, where blockchain does actually have a purpose insofar as it allows people to pay each other in strings of 1s and 0s without an intermediary, we have never seen any evidence that it actually does anything, or makes anything better. Often, it seems to make things a whole lot worse. But step forward the Centre for Evidence Based Blockchain, a non-profit set up last year by the British Blockchain Association, whose very purpose is to promote “evidence-based adoption of Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) across the public and private sectors”, to give us some sorely needed evidence. Last week, it published a very serious-looking “peer-reviewed” paper in its very own Journal of British Blockchain Association, presenting its findings from a “Global Study of Blockchain Projects and Start-up Companies”. Given that the peers in question are crypto peers, we weren’t sure how much credibility that would add to proceedings. But we were quite pleasantly surprised with the level of honesty that the paper exhibited: Our study concluded that almost half of the blockchain firms show no explicit evidence of the problem to be solved. Approximately one-third fail to cite a comparison and intervention analysis, and less than 2 per cent demonstrate evidence of outcomes backed by filtered (critically appraised, peer reviewed) information. They separate any evidence that does appear to exist into “filtered” (ie, supposedly peer-reviewed) and “unfiltered” (which includes any random blog post or article on a crypto site) and then ask questions like: “Have the results shown an objective improvement in outcomes?”, to which the answer is: No evidence: 304 Unfiltered evidence: 206 Filtered evidence: 7 Or, to put that in visual form: The paper also makes several recommendations. This one is pretty great, we think: For every £100 spent on blockchain and distributed ledgers, we propose that at least £2 should be dedicated to making sure the other £98 actually works. There’s also this one that’s quite good: We make a case for a ‘Chief Evidence Officer’ for all organisations where blockchain is being deployed, to ensure that blockchain products, services and solutions are built on best available scientific evidence; this will ensure efficacy, efficiency, impact and effectiveness. One might have thought that you’d seek evidence something worked before setting up a company. It could save you the £2, or plunging the C-suite into an existential crisis, but that idea doesn’t crop up. We do also wonder whether the Centre for Evidence-Based Blockchain should itself appoint a Chief Evidence Officer to make sure there really is some evidence for blockchain somewhere. FT Alphaville would nominate Martin Walker for the job, who is a director at the actual Centre for Evidence-Based Management, and who grabbed headlines in 2018 when he appeared alongside our very own Izabella Kaminska at a Treasury select committee. He told them blockchain was a “'pixie dust' fad” and that its benefits in finance were “little to nothing”. As we’ve written before, blockchain is a belief system that requires faith rather than thinking. As Walker put it to us: All that it takes to make a credible idea, sometimes a good idea, into a fad is that people just switch off their brains, stop thinking, stop asking questions and start believing.

https://www.ft.com/content/773d0eac-8d75-43ea-b62e-ba8ef39e51f2,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,How programmable digital assets may change monetary policy,The authors argue that once assets become traceable through blockchain systems, collateral reuse will mobilise money velocity again.,This is a guest post by Manmohan Singh, author of “Collateral and Financial Plumbing” and a senior economist at the IMF, and Caitlin Long, an appointee to Wyoming’s Select Committee on Blockchain and CEO of Avanti Financial Group. The views expressed herein are those of the authors and should not be attributed to the IMF, its Executive Board, or its management; or of Avanti. Monetary policy in the United States, until the early 1980s, was simple and conducted exclusively within the traditional banking system. Then, slowly, it began to seep into securities markets via rehypothecation and other uses of collateral. These methods gradually surpassed in importance the fractional reserving of dollar deposits in the traditional banking system. Now, as the growing connection between large bank funding desks and digital assets is becoming more notable, that pendulum might be swinging back. This is because high-velocity digital assets, secured via a blockchain, could become more prominently used in collateral markets. This development could be significant for monetary policy, where collateral re-use has declined since the 2008 financial crisis. (Table 1 updates the latest collateral velocity data that were primarily led by prime-brokerage funding and leverage to hedge funds.) How might digital assets function in collateral markets? Title transfer-based collateral agreements could, in theory, utilise these assets as eligible collateral — assuming they are securities — which would settle with finality, just as happens with US. Treasuries under title transfer. Security interest-based collateral agreements take a charge over a digital asset. Such digital assets as securities could be re-used — but, importantly, while the length of collateral chains involving traditional securities cannot be accurately tracked, the length of collateral chains involving digital assets can be measured in near-real-time. Transparency is a key benefit of open blockchain technology because these assets can be tracked in a manner that does not give up privacy or reveal proprietary trading strategies. The ability to monitor collateral-chain leverage should appeal to risk managers and regulators alike. Collateral re-use has been a difficult metric to integrate within a monetary policy framework. Disclosures about pledged collateral are generally made only once a year, in the footnotes of banks’ financial statements. Auditing standards do not reflect whether collateral reported on a bank’s balance sheet is reflected on more than one institution’s balance sheet simultaneously. But what if collateral re-use were no longer so critical to monetary policy because money could naturally start exhibiting higher velocity? A recent Federal Reserve paper by Wong and Maniff contains a discussion of the “programmability” of money — a feature of smart contracts, which are self-executing pieces of code that can automate business processes, and which are associated with a subset of digital assets issued on blockchains. (These are either privately-issued, such as stablecoins designed to track the value of fiat currency, or a central bank digital currency; of critical importance to collateral markets, IOSCO notes that stablecoins can resemble regulated securities.) The digital asset world has been talking about programmability for years, and mainstream financial players are now connecting the dots about its importance. Why? Because programmable digital assets exhibit high velocity (see Table 2), potentially exceeding that of traditional money in some jurisdictions. Amid the collapse in recent years of the velocity of traditional money, as QE and similar programs have expanded reserves on central banks’ balance sheets that remain mostly dormant, the rise of high-velocity, programmable money could pose important implications for monetary policy. Programmable instruments, such as cryptocurrency stablecoins, already exist (see Table 2), and since they are issued by non-banks they are not money and cannot offer settlement finality in money. At more than US$1.1tn of on-chain velocity annually (which is verifiable) and over US$12tn of exchange-reported velocity (off-chain crosses not independently verifiable), the volumes are no longer small. Mainstream institutions are taking notice. Why do these particular digital assets demonstrate significantly higher velocity than traditional bank money? These assets free up capital that would otherwise be trapped in unsettled payments, thereby improving the velocity of users’ capital (and returns on capital) — from traders to investors to corporate treasurers alike. They settle much faster than traditional payment systems — in minutes, not hours or even days — plus they settle on shared infrastructure (a blockchain), thereby eliminating the slow sequential settlement from one institution to the next and reducing counterparty credit risk. They also offer settlement finality, including protections from chargebacks and reversals that traditional payment systems may not provide. Most importantly, they are issued on API-based, smart contract platforms that enable users to build software applications to improve, for example, the payment reconciliation processes. However, digital assets issued by non-banks, including Facebook’s Libra, pose a problem for monetary policy. They squirrel away collateral — siloed and no longer available to be re-used in collateral markets, thereby adversely impacting global liquidity. A macroprudential-bulletin by ECB staff (Adachi et al, May 2020), noted that Libra could become a US$3tn collateral silo. Another alternative exists. If banks were to issue commercial bank money on blockchains in digital asset form, central banks would gain a new policy tool that enables them to deploy existing central bank reserves that are currently dormant. Commercial bank-issued dollar tokens backed by reserves on deposit at central banks would complement, not compete with, existing real-time gross settlement efforts of central banks, such as FedNow. Moreover, the valid concerns voiced by the Fed’s Lael Brainard about the legal, regulatory, financial system stability and private money implications of stablecoins issued by non-banks would not apply to bank-issued versions. Banks are following non-banks into the market. Swiss bank Sygnum, which was granted a bank charter a year ago by FINMA, in March began issuing a Swiss franc stablecoin 100 per cent backed by central bank reserves. Japan’s interbank dealer, Tokyo Tanshi, is a partner in a venture with software companies Digital Garage and Blockstream, which in June graduated from the innovation hub of Japan’s FSA and is issuing a yen stablecoin. The high velocity of digital assets as programmable money, and/ or as a security that can be pledged as collateral, offer a way for central banks to rely less on traditional money metrics as a monetary policy tool; if this holds true when applied to traditional finance, then what’s old in monetary policy may become new again.,,,2020-09-04T09:24:34.003Z,

How wrong we were. INX Trading Solutions is a “fully-regulated digital asset trading ecosystem for listing and trading cryptocurrencies and security tokens for both institutional and retail investors.” In just under a day it’s launching an ICO with the aim of raising $109m, net of commissions, from the sale of 130m tokens. On its website, it claims to have the “world’s first F-1 prospectus for a fully-registered security token IPO aimed at establishing an evolutionary financial trading market and to become a prime trading and listing arena for blockchain digital asset”. That prospectus, which has been filed with the SEC, can be read here. Yet for all INX’s speak of its “strong adherence to laws and regulations from inception”, that doesn’t seem to have extended to its graphic design department which, delightfully, has conjured up this in an attempt to demonstrate just how much of a quantum leap in financial innovation this token offering is (h/t to Joe Weisenthal for flagging on Twitter): There’s almost too much to unpick here. Why are the blue circles sized as such? Where is the advent of insurance and central banking in the 17th century? Why are these tokens, which pay a set distribution of cash flows, that different from other exotic forms of equity? And, most importantly, where, or what, is the Y axis? We mean, we could go on.

Its cutting-edge technology is supposed to allow financial institutions “to send money across borders, instantly, reliably and for fractions of a penny”, by the power of its immutable digital dream-ledger (aka blockchain, but for banker bros). In all honestly, it isn’t making much progress on that front. Spanish bank Santander, a Ripple investor and what the company calls “one of our largest and most important customers”, recently chose not to use Ripple’s XRP currency for its new international payment network. But you might at least think Ripple’s CEO would know a thing or two about technology. And also immutability. It turns out, though, that blockchain is not the only game in town when it comes to immutable ledgers. On Wikipedia anyone can edit a page, but the site keeps a record of these changes for all to see. It’s a bit like, um, a shared digital ledger. The difference with the Wikipedia ledger is that all these entries and edits are stored on a regular database, rather than a distributed one like a blockchain. As founder Jimmy Wales has pointed out, it turns out that’s perfectly sufficient! What is like the original bitcoin blockchain, however, is that the Wikipedia ledger is pseudonymous, meaning that you can’t see the full details of the person who has made changes to any given entry. If they’re not using a pseudonym, you can see their IP address. With that in mind, it’s come to FT Alphaville’s attention recently that some Wikipedia users — two in particular — have been repeatedly editing Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s Wikipedia page to remove some less positive aspects of the entry. Specifically, these two users have been removing text under the “Controversies” section of the page, and one of them in fact removed the whole section entirely, before it was reinstated by a different Wikipedia editor. The Controversies section includes the fact that Garlinghouse had claimed multiple times that the published error rate for SWIFT messaging was at least six per cent (a claim that has been proven to be false in a great piece by Martin Walker published by the London School of Economics Business Review); the fact that he’d been personally named in a group of class actions against Ripple that claim the company has breached various securities laws; and the fact he’d admitted that, without sales of the XRP cryptocurrency, Ripple would be lossmaking (which was revealed by none other than, um, FT Alphaville.) So there’s been something of an “edit war” on the page, with multiple removals and reinstatements of text since May. And we know this because via the magic of Wikipedia’s non-blockchain-flavoured digital ledger, we can see all the edits that have been made to the page by either a user or an IP address. (You can see the full edit history here if you’re interested, as you can do on any Wikipedia entry by clicking “View history”.) One of the users, who can only be identified by their IP address, appears to have edited another Wikipedia page before editing Garlinghouse’s one. It was the page of a woman named Cheryl Helmer, a Republican politician and a member of the Kansas House of Representatives. Funnily enough, this user actually added a “Controversy” section to Helmer’s entry, under which it was written that she’d “attracted national attention during the COVID-19 pandemic when she requested that Kansas Governor (of the opposing party) produce information on the Governor's hairstyling”. It turned out that the Democratic senator’s husband had been cutting her hair, hence Helmer’s demands being pretty controversial! We tried to find evidence of the “national attention” this controversy had provoked, but even the citation in the Wikipedia entry itself referenced an article in the Leavenworth Times, a local Kansas paper, and the only other place we found it was in the Kansas City Star. But is there any connection to Garlinghouse? While we don’t want to speculate, we would point out that he’s from Kansas and is a repeat donor to the Democrats. We’d also highlight that the IP address shows the editing user was based in Menlo Park, which is a small city in the Bay Area (where many start-ups, such as Robinhood, are located). Some of Garlinghouse’s political donations are sent from a Menlo Park address. Ahem. What about the other user? They were signed in as “Pizzamyheart” and, before touching up the Garlinghouse page, had edited Wesleyan University’s entry, alongside a few other pages. Ripple’s executive communications manager, it turns out, is a recent graduate of Wesleyan. Crypto journalist Mitchell Moos tweeted the company last week to ask them about this link, but doesn’t seem to have got a response: We haven’t had a response back from Ripple on this either. But since asking the company about the edits on Friday, and then again over the weekend, “Pizzamyheart” disappeared as a user on Wikipedia. Strange. We called up David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50 Foot Blockchain and a Wikipedia editor and administrator, who was one of the people who had been reinstating the removed Garlinghouse text. He told us: It’s not clear precisely who did this but, if it looks like corporate whitewashing and quacks like corporate whitewashing, then we’ll treat it as such.

https://www.ft.com/content/7d9c934f-3840-4285-96a7-4bdf7fee9286,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,With $16bn in cryptocurrency, Ripple attempts a reset,The start-up is still trying to find compelling uses for the blockchain technology underpinning its XRP currency,San Francisco start-up Ripple can lay claim to having created one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies. Its digital tokens, known as XRP, have a total value of almost $30bn, behind only bitcoin and Ether. But, eight years after launch, Ripple is still trying to find compelling uses for the blockchain technology underpinning its currency that would justify such a high figure. Now, in an effort to draw more users, it has struck out in a new direction: to try to become the Amazon of the cryptocurrency world, using its platform to support activities far beyond the original cross-border payments system it hoped to build. The popularity of XRP has already made Ripple — and its leaders — far richer than most start-up software companies. The company has cashed in more than $1.2bn of its own holdings of the cryptocurrency since early 2017. It is also still sitting on about 55 per cent of the total supply, worth around $16bn at current prices — far overshadowing its underlying technology business. As a result, the value of the company is tied “mainly to the XRP, with an option on a small software business”, said one former executive. Brad Garlinghouse, chief executive, admitted that Ripple is swayed heavily by the value of its crypto hoard. “We are a capitalist, we own a lot of XRP,” he said. “So do I care about the overall XRP market? 100 per cent.” But he added that the company’s aim was to “deliver a lot of utility through XRP”, something that is likely to take “years” as it develops applications that use its blockchain technology — and, by extension, justify the high price of the currency. Ripple’s original aim, to build a more efficient, wholesale cross-border payment system, has made slow headway with the banks that were the original target for the technology. Santander, the Spanish lender that invested in Ripple in 2015, recently chose not to use XRP at the heart of an ambitious new international payment network — a sign that even some of Ripple’s strongest backers do not yet see a use for its core technology. Cedric Menager, the network’s chief executive, suggested that Ripple was not active in enough markets yet to support Santander's needs.* The bank wanted to “give the best [user experience] as quickly as possible and also operate in as many currencies and corridors as possible from the beginning,” he said. Ripple said that Santander was still using some of its software in the payments service and was “one of our largest and most important customers”. The company also claims a high growth rate for the XRP facility at the heart of its system, though it does not provide absolute figures, and also says many banks are using some elements of its software. Many observers say Ripple was always facing an uphill battle in trying to win over the banks, which have already invested heavily in current technology and benefit from the current system. “It’s like Uber trying to disrupt the taxi industry by working with the taxis,” said Michael Arrington, the founder of the TechCrunch news site and now at a $100m cryptocurrency hedge fund. Mr Garlinghouse blames uncertainty in the US over whether XRP tokens should be regulated as securities for discouraging more companies from using Ripple’s blockchain. He and the company also face a lawsuit over claims they sold unregistered securities. Ripple has subsequently drawn on its main asset — its cryptocurrency reserves — to try to draw more users to its technology as it looks beyond the banks. In cross-border payments, the company’s focus has turned to remittances, where customers face high fees to send relatively small amounts through money transfer companies. Last year, Ripple used some of its cash to buy a stake in MoneyGram, as well as Bitso, a Latin American cryptocurrency exchange. The investments helped to put its technology at the centre of about 7 per cent of all remittances from the US to Mexico in June, the company said. But the success only represents one market, and has come at a cost. Moneygram’s filings show that Ripple handed it $31m in “market development fees” to encourage use of XRP in the first half of this year — payments that accounted for 60 per cent of Moneygram’s operating profit. Mr Garlinghouse defended the subsidies and said it was common practice for payment companies to use financial incentives to generate activity on their networks. He also said the need for payments such as this had fallen as activity had picked up: “If you look at more recent customers, it's a different dynamic now than when we first got started.” Ripple has also handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to stimulate wider uses of blockchain technology. A year ago, it said it had distributed the equivalent of more than $500m — much of it in the form of XRP — through its Xpring fund, as a way to seed more new applications that use blockchain technology and might, indirectly, benefit Ripple in the long run. That included handing $260m worth of cryptocurrency to Coil, a start-up building a decentralised online media marketplace where creators can sell directly to consumers. Most of the money was earmarked as grants to attract developers and creators to join Coil’s market, said Stefan Thomas, the company’s chief executive and a former Ripple chief technology officer. A year after launching a blogging platform, however, Coil seems to be generating little in return for the handouts. A German blogger identifying himself only as Benny has publicly disclosed his earnings on the service since the start of this year: the micropayments received for attracting readers add up to only about $15. However, over the same period, Coil has given him $2,250 worth of XRP as an incentive to keep writing. Ripple has since cut back on the Xpring handouts and instead is now trying to produce the tools that developers need to create their own applications to run directly on its blockchain. Ethan Beard, who runs Ripple’s developer efforts after once holding the same position at Facebook, said the company had moved from “writing cheques to writing code”. According to Mr Garlinghouse, this latest effort — which he described as an extension of the company’s strategy, rather than a full shift in direction, will turn Ripple into a broader blockchain platform in much the way Amazon has become a platform for a wide range of ecommerce. “Amazon started as a bookseller and just sold books. We happen to have started with payments,” he said. “Two years from now, you’re going to find that Ripple is to payments as Amazon was to books.” The gamble is a reversal from the position Mr Garlinghouse took when he joined Ripple as chief executive five years ago and narrowed its focus to payments. Unlike Amazon, however, Ripple has not yet produced a hit with its first application, leaving it without a big base of active users to sell other services to. Also, it has a controversial reputation in many parts of the cryptocurrency world, where its attempts to build bridges with the existing financial system clash with the radically anti-establishment motivations of many developers. “It gets a lot of hate in the crypto world, because it’s trying to be close to the banks,” said Mr Arrington. In one sign that some of the most potentially disruptive new applications are not being attracted to its platform, a wave of experimentation in decentralised financial applications — known as DeFi — has been drawn instead to the Ethereum blockchain. Despite Ripple’s struggles to find more uses for XPR, meanwhile, the speculators who have made it a fixture of the cryptocurrency markets are not giving up. Prices were subdued for much of this year, missing out on the jump for bitcoin and Ether, but then soared almost 50 per cent in the final week of July, putting them at their highest level since the coronavirus crisis hit. Even the prospect of a long search for a purpose does not shake the confidence of the cryptocurrency’s biggest supporters. “It can take centuries for currencies to catch on,” said Mr Thomas at Coil.

Lay-offs everywhere from The Atlantic to Vice have been really sad to see, and also somewhat anxiety-inducing for those of us who have until now been lucky enough to be employed to do this journalism malarkey. But there is finding ways to make money via means other than via dwindling advertising revenues, and then there is taking the biscuit. Axel Springer-owned digital news site Business Insider, which so far has not announced any cuts, has an offshoot called BI Intelligence. It describes itself as a “premium research service specializing in business intelligence and data-driven research”, providing “deep analytical insight into the latest global trends and developments that every business needs to know to be competitive”. That’s all very well. But just how deep is this analytical insight into the latest global trends that every business needs to know? Well we’re not sure, because frankly we don’t really feel like paying for it. But we recently stumbled across an article promoting its “Blockchain in Banking” report (via Mike Dudas, who is founder and CEO of The Block, another online media site that focuses on blockchain and crypto) and, well, it was . . . not good. Above is a screenshot of the report in question, which you can now purchase for a snip at £300 if you use the discount code! (The full price is $495 in the US.) Dudas had come across an article published last week on the main Business Insider site where they were pushing the report, described as “an inside look at four banks’ early blockchain successes and failures”, under the somewhat unrelated-sounding headline “How to Invest in Cryptocurrency & Blockchain Technology”. Since Dudas’s tweet, the article has been deleted, but it is still available via the Wayback Machine. The article tells us that “the following is a preview of one Banking report, the Blockchain in Banking Report”, before providing a link for where you can purchase said report, and then — kind of bizarrely given that it doesn’t seem to have anything to do with blockchain in banking — a list of the “top cryptocurrencies to invest in” (happily telling us that these “have risen to the top as the most popular options for investment”): The first problem here is that this is utter nonsense. What they have listed there is not the “most popular options for investment”, but instead the five biggest cryptocurrencies by “market cap” (a quite meaningless and misleading metric when used in cryptoland, as we have said many times before). The most traded cryptocurrencies, according to CoinMarketCap, are actually currently (in order) Tether, bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash. So four of the ones they list are correct, even if in the wrong order, you might say. Well, no. Because investing is different to trading. Trading volume is about how many times a cryptocurrency is bought or sold in any given time period. It’s not about buying something with an expectation of a future return. Trading is not, in other words, the same as the HODL. Tether might be the most traded cryptocurrency but it is not something that you would “invest” in. It is in fact a “stablecoin” that is meant to be tied to the dollar (and was also meant to be backed one for one by real dollars, lol) so the idea that you would “invest” in it, when you could just buy the dollar, makes no sense. The reason why it is traded so much is that many crypto exchanges only allow for crypto-to-crypto trading. In other words, if you want to buy bitcoin, for example, you first of all have to exchange your real-world money into Tether, and then you can buy the bitcoin. (We would also like to point out here that “investing” in crypto should actually be thought of as more akin to gambling. But we have made this point many times before and we are not ones to harp on about things we have already harped on about here at FT Alphaville. Don’t @ us.) Also, what’s all this about “Investors are paying a 220% premium to buy Ether” (another word for Ethereum, or the technical word for it)? The only reference we could find to such a premium was a Coin Telegraph article from February discussing the premium investors were paying to buy Ether via the Grayscale Trust, so that they didn’t have to have the risk of actually holding any real crypto. (Gotta love crypto!) It’s not just some “premium” that you pay to buy Ether. Did the person just copy and paste this from the Coin Telegraph article? We asked BI Intelligence why the article had been deleted and they told us that “We are making edits to the article which is why it’s down.” When we asked why they were editing it, they said: “We’re just updating it.” They also said they “stand by” their $495 blockchain report. It turns out that this article was not in fact a “preview” of the report, as stated, but just a way of selling it (not particularly well if you ask us). To be fair, telling people to “invest” in Tether is the kind of advice you can’t really put a price on. And we’re sure the actual blockchain report, which “provides actionable recommendations on how banks can successfully pursue a blockchain project”, is worth every cent.,,Jemima Kelly,2020-07-01T18:35:03.755Z,

Computershare, one of the main share registry companies in Australia, told the Financial Times it was seeking a two-year delay in implementation because the project to overhaul critical systems lacked clarity. The company said it had not been given the necessary technical, operational and regulatory information on how the new system would operate or the fees that would be charged by the ASX for existing and new services. Computershare — which maintains a register of legal ownership of shares and distributes corporate dividends for investors — said a delay until April 2023 was required to address the risks of the project, particularly in light of complications introduced by the Covid-19 pandemic. A delay of this order would be a blow to the ASX, which became the first big stock exchange around the world to commit to using so-called distributed ledger technology — which underpins bitcoin and other digital currencies — for clearing and settlement in 2017. The new system would enable customers “to develop new services and reduce their costs”, and would “put Australia at the forefront of innovation in financial markets”, the ASX said at the time. But users rely on the ASX for clearing and settling up to 2.5bn shares a day, making the replacement of its existing “Chess” system a critical flashpoint. The ASX should focus on its core systems rather than prioritise the development of new commercial services, said Ann Bowering, Computershare’s chief executive of issuer services in Australia and New Zealand. Blockchain technology promises to deliver an instant electronic database of transactions shared among many parties, threatening the revenues of share registrars. “In order to get this project back on track we really need a robust governance framework which isn’t there today and at the end of the day, we need to take a look at the timeline,” she said. Several ASX clients expressed concerns to the FT that the exchange could use the tech overhaul to extend its dominance in clearing and settlement into other markets, including share registry services. Tony Cunningham, founder of CPS Capital, a Perth-based stockbroker, said there was a lack of clarity on how the distributed ledger system would operate and how it would affect broking, share registry and other market activities. “This [new platform] is owned by ASX and the ASX is a monopoly, it’s not ideal. I don’t believe they should own it,” he said. “If ASX have a distributed ledger, then why do you have a share registry?” Australia’s Stockbrokers and Financial Advisers Association told the FT it also wants a six- to 12-month delay to the project. Australia’s competition regulator said it was working with the Council of Financial Regulators, and advising the ASX to consider the implications to market competition when developing the Chess replacement. “In particular, the ACCC advocates for transparent and non-discriminatory pricing and access to clearing and settlement services,” said an ACCC spokeswoman. Recommended ASX said the blockchain initiative would not harm competition, adding that it had kept the market briefed on the project’s objectives from the outset. “The market has been engaged and consulted extensively since the commencement of the project,” the company said. “The solution has been designed with the market’s input to capture the features that the industry wants. The project’s scope was defined through a lengthy and comprehensive market consultation process where the industry prioritised the requirements they wanted to see in the new system. The scope has not been expanded.” ASX had aimed to roll out the blockchain-based system in April 2021 but agreed to a short delay in March. A consultation paper setting out new plans for the project’s scope and timing is due as early as next week. “We know there are stakeholders who want a small change to the go-live date as well as those who are seeking for more time,” the company said. “We will listen carefully to the consultation feedback prior to finalising the revised implementation timeline.”,,Jamie Smyth Philip Stafford,2020-06-25T13:56:39.674Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/2a300955-2ba7-4d9c-8d69-14a2ccea1503,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Is our money about to spout memories?,We could be on the cusp of the biggest revolution in the way money is accounted for since the 17th century.,At its root, money is an IOU – a promise to give the bearer the option to own something they want at some point in the future in return for services rendered in the present. Yet when we pay for something, we have little idea of the journey our money has been on, nor of the tasks performed – previous to our own – to acquire it. Could that be about to change? According to Hyun Shin, of the Bank for International Settlements, it might. He told us this week: The beauty of money is that you don’t need to know the whole history – that I am holding it, is enough for it to be worth something to the next person, even though they don’t know how hard I had to work to acquire it. But money is also a social convention – there is a whole record that’s somehow captured in that paper. In theory, if you can have a complete ledger, you can have a complete institutional memory. That theory has long existed, but it has been a twinkle in people’s eye. What technology has done is enable an abstract idea to become concrete. You can construct that ledger and you can do it electronically and use the best of data. Shin first raised the possibility of a mass ledger of our money’s memories back in the summer of 2018. As central banks move closer to making state-backed digital money a reality*, in the form of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), we could be about to see vision become reality. But what are the consequences of money suddenly having a universal memory? And are they necessarily all good? To explain why the dawn of monetary memory matters, we need to understand what happens right now. Most money comes not in the form of publicly issued banknotes, but rather exists as a mix of competing private and public-sector liabilities. Indeed, our current monetary landscape is more akin to a hierarchy of money types, with state-issued money sitting atop of the pyramid, and with various privately issued alternatives falling underneath it based on their trustworthiness. Many of these privately issued monies look and feel like public monies only because of the promises that their units can always be redeemed against public money at par. According to the Bank of England, central bank money, also known as the monetary base – either notes or coins, or reserves held by private lenders at the central bank – is but a fraction (specifically a fifth) of the total monetary liabilities that circulate through the system mimicking the values of public money. The rest is private money created by banks that is only constrained in its potential by regulatory frameworks. The two main constraints right now are the proportion of reserves lenders must have parked at the central bank and the proportion of capital regulators require them to set aside. A far more restrictive constraint on private money creation would be a full-reserve banking system – where all money must be backed by the state. CBDCs are a big step in that direction, potentially forcing all private lenders to pre-fund, and so leaving little scope for private money creation. In that sense a CBDC could operate as the final check on the double-entry accounting system that has persisted for centuries – and stop unchecked shadow money creation destabilising the system. Here’s Shin again: Money has undergone tremendous changes throughout history. And CBDCs could potentially be as far reaching a change as double-entry bookkeeping. Account-based money is still the same as when the Bank of Amsterdam started it in the 17th century – whether you do it with pen and paper or you do it with technology, the underlying architecture has been the same. Will it be as far reaching? I think you can make both cases. It is a step change in the architecture in the sense that central banks are thinking about for the first time having a ledger and assigning ownership based on that ledger. Under double-entry bookkeeping there is no collective memory because there is no universal substance that perfectly synchronises the snapshots of all the various financial balance sheets across the system. So monetary shadows go unseen until distress forces them into the light of the formal system intermittently (and sometimes with great surprise). These shadows are facilitated by the existence of jurisdictions that wilfully obscure, delay or misreport balances. While International Financial Reporting Standards have helped to reduce the scale of those shadows, by helping to synchronise and standardise financial reporting rules, the system is not infallible. The current method of bookkeeping also fails to track private money created for loans once it is repaid, meaning the story behind the money vanishes with it. The creation of a central bank digital currency, on the other hand, would potentially mean a far greater volume of the money supply comes from the same source, is accounted for on one ledger, and would last as long as the currency did, floating around the economy from bearer to bearer. There would no longer be any capacity for lookalike money to fill the gaps, the power of memory driving everything into the light by linking it all together and making escaping into the shadows an impossibility. It’s often said that money is as money does. But the reason we’re talking about this right now is more a case of when money doesn’t. Back in 2018 Benoît Cœuré, then of the European Central Bank and now of the BIS, dubbed bitcoin the “evil spawn” of the financial crisis. Yet bitcoin took off in no small degree because of the lack of trust in global financial officialdom following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. That threat to central banks’ monopoly of the monetary base has forced central bankers to move with the times and embrace innovation. Via Shin: What the Libra announcement and the energising of the debate did was to focus minds. There was a job to do in terms of central banks explaining some of the benefits of the payments system as a public good, it showed the importance of putting information on money out clearly. It also impressed upon central banks how far technology had come. For a sense of the impact that bitcoin and Libra have had on what central banks say, see this chart, taken from a BIS paper out yesterday: (Mostly negative) mentions shoot up first during the bitcoin boom, before rising again (and becoming more positive) after the unveiling of the original Libra white paper in June 2019 (there is now a Libra White Paper v2.0 which is . . . rather different). The upside of an all-encompassing monetary framework that links every transaction, replete with its history, to all others, is undoubtedly that it helps to keep the system stable. The downside is that it comes both with a loss of privacy and the fragility of brittle totalitarian systems. In that context, bitcoin’s brilliance becomes more evident; it was able to have its cake and eat it. Transactions remained fully private, thanks to the use of public key encryption, while its open blockchain ledger allowed for the formation of a collective monetary memory system which could be tracked, traced and monitored from the outside. Within its own ecosystem, there were no shadows – everything squared up. (We should point out here that a CBDC would not require a blockchain – there are ways other than distributed ledger technology (DLT) that are under discussion and are likely to prove more appropriate for a retail CBDC.) Yet users’ privacy came at a price – in the form of higher fees charged by miners, especially during times such as the bitcoin boom: While bitcoin users might view those fees as acceptable, the party line within the central banks would be that currencies and the payments systems that back them work best as public goods that can be accessed universally. That in turn implies a role for the official sector to keep costs at a minimum to make the memory of money as collective as possible. Money developing more of a memory also undermines one of its most important properties: fungibility. In the eyes of the Uniform Commercial Code, the most important act of contract law in the US – and therefore, as far as money is concerned, the world – cash never takes its claim history with it upon transfer. What this means in practice is that – in contrast to other facets of property law – anyone who acquires cash starts off with a clean slate as far as previous claims are concerned. It is assumed, then, that previous claims on cash are untraceable throughout the system. But once money has a provable public memory, history becomes much harder to ignore. Even if contract law demands that all past sins in the money chain must be forgiven, there’s a good chance some chains – especially those involved in disputed transactions – begin to be discriminated against cleaner chains. At this point, a whole new plethora of risks and frictions are likely to be introduced. There is a lot of debate right now about the various forms a public digital money could take (more on which, including a discussion of the pros and cons of DLT and other forms of infrastructure, here). The perfect fix would have bitcoin’s privacy, while also being scalable and less easy to replicate and sub-divide into competing systems, and less costly. Creating a collective memory for a jurisdiction’s money would probably require a retail CBDC, that could be used for payments by normal citizens. The reason being that these retail payments make up the bulk of the volume of transactions. On that front, the People’s Bank of China is well ahead of the curve. It has already forced the country’s main digital payment providers (such as WeChat and Alipay) to hold all deposits as reserves at the central bank on a fully collateralised basis. They are thus already the dispensaries of a CBDC in everything but name. Yet China is a case that highlights the pros and cons of the leap perfectly. On the one hand, there’s a clear benefit in terms of financial inclusion – especially in developing and emerging markets where significant proportions of populations remain unbanked. Via Shin: If the government were to do direct fiscal transfers, then you can guard against duplication and fraud, you can guard against people opening different bank accounts. During the acute phase of Covid we saw governments rolling out very aggressive fiscal packages. It’s those countries that have very fast systems that have done best, to get money in the pockets of people to buy essentials, financial inclusion is really underlined by the recent episode. On the other hand, there are clearly concerns about privacy. Do we really want states to have a ledger that gives them unlimited access to our money’s memories? This chart on privacy fears over digital payments, taken from yesterday’s report, indicates that many people do not: CBDC enthusiasts claim there may be ways in which data can be anonymised and some schemes are being trialled. Yet that jars with wider anti money-laundering and know-your-customer regulations. It appears an unsolvable paradox for now. Via Shin: What we still don’t know is whether it can be rolled out in a robust way into the whole economy and in a way where you can use the architecture as well - if we can keep track of who has spent it, while at the same time as ensuring privacy. It is uppermost in everyone’s mind, anyone who has looked into this matter knows that some sort of ledger has to be there – centralised or decentralised – while at the same time bearing in mind privacy concerns. A possible solution here is that, rather than requiring people to open accounts, central banks could instead use an “I know, therefore I own” system of digital tokens, with transfers taking place through digitally encrypted keys – the trade-off being that central banks would then fall foul of the very AML rules they’ve been pushing upon banks. Fears over privacy, then, are a massive obstacle to switching to CBDCs. The problem is only amplified by suspicions that central banks will, despite claims to the contrary, use the switch to CBDCs to abandon what is by far the most reliable and private form of money available to the public right now – cash. After all, we all have memories we would rather were forgotten. *State-backed digital money, of course, already exists. It comes in the shape of central bank reserves, which can only be exclusively held by commercially licensed banks. When people talk about central banks issuing their own digital money, what they usually mean is central bank money that consumers would hold directly, without the need of an intermediating bank. Thus far, the only state money the public can hold is cash.

If there is a time for new “privacy-first” models, it may be now. Many of today’s dominant disrupters, such as Airbnb, Alibaba and Uber, use a platform model, acting as a powerful intermediary between users. So do seven of the 10 most valuable companies in the world, including Amazon and Apple. While these big companies appear invincible, the history of business and technology is replete with evidence that such businesses almost inevitably fall prey to newer, more efficient models, in line with the process of creative destruction described by the economist Joseph Schumpeter. Now a new breed of businesses known as DAOs (decentralised autonomous organisations) is paving the way for an alternative “trust-based” business model that has the potential to disrupt some of today’s dominant disrupters. DAOs are at the heart of the recent movement to create the next-generation internet, the internet of people (IoP), which calls for individuals to be able to control their personal data and for a drastic reduction in the role of intermediaries. The IoP movement argues that cyber space has been colonised by a few platform companies, which have turned the internet into a hostile environment through their exploitation of data and high fees in the range of 20-30 per cent. The DAOs are built on the principles of the IoP movement. First, they are based on the belief that parties directly involved in an exchange can operate without having to rely on third-party networks such as those used by Uber or Facebook. The likes of Swarm City, a ride-sharing app, are able to do this by exploiting technologies such as blockchain. Recommended Imagine a traveller using Swarm City. A DAO can create a hashtag “#needaride from point A to point B”, which serves as a marketplace and a smart contract. Drivers who are interested in providing the ride can send a bid directly to the prospective customer, eliminating the need for intermediaries such as Uber. Second, DAOs are based on the belief that users should control their personal data, and they do not capture user and interaction data centrally. This contrasts with platform businesses such as Uber and Facebook, which maintain centralised data sets and use them for commercial purposes. DAOs use blockchain technology, with advanced cryptography for security, to store relevant trust-forming information like consumer reviews in a distributed ledger. Third, DAOs take ultra-low commissions — typically less than 3 per cent. They pass on the savings to those parties involved in a transaction. As a result, they lay the foundation for new trust-based business models that return data control to users and share profits more equitably. The DAOs enable payments using cryptocurrencies. Arcade City, a ride-sharing service, issues “Arcade Tokens”, which eliminate expensive credit card fees. Users can use a preferred currency for buying and converting the tokens. Many DAOs, such as LockTrip, a blockchain-based travel marketplace, even accept credit cards for a low fee. Platforms such as Uber, Airbnb and Booking.com would be primary targets for disruption Our analysis suggests that all commercial platforms perform three key functions: matching supply and demand (such as rider with driver), verification of supplier reputation through reviews, and payment. DAOs are particularly suited to accomplishing these using technologies like blockchain. Platforms such as Uber, Airbnb and Booking.com perform precisely these three functions, so they would be primary targets for disruption. However, some big platforms are relatively safe for the time being, such as Amazon, which also provides extensive customer support and mediation, and a variety of products from different categories; and Netflix, which creates content. The DAOs will have to build scale to disrupt any of these dominant platforms. It is becoming increasingly clear many large suppliers whose profits have been hit by dominant platforms are partnering with the new arrivals. LockTrip lists more than 500,000 hotels and properties. Winding Tree, a business-to-business travel marketplace, has received an investment from Lufthansa and has partnered with Air Canada, Air France-KLM and Air New Zealand. DAOs will be able to build on large companies’ capital and brand strength to legitimise their business models. Even if the DAOs fail, their fundamental principles give them a good chance of capturing a fair share of the market. They are likely to mirror low-cost airlines and financial services businesses in the way those have wrestled market share from high-margin incumbents. The newcomers may initially appear inferior, but that is how Clayton Christensen, the late management writer and author of The Innovator’s Dilemma, predicted disruption would occur.

Frankly, there are more important and concerning things to write about at the moment. But sometimes, when a spot of writer’s block just happens to coincide with the delivery of the most perfect exemplar of a techno-solutionist press release, well one’s appetite for blockchain-bashing is re-whetted. Shimmying on into our inbox on Wednesday came the news that “Tech rivals collaborate on blockchain to combat COVID-19”! This of course wasn’t the first release we’d been sent on how the distributed technicolour dream-ledger could help combat this deadly pandemic. And nor, we concede with some regret, will it be the last. But what it was, by a country mile, was the best (emphasis ours): In response to COVID-19, technology companies have ramped up collaborations on innovative technologies such as blockchain, says GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company. Charlotte Dunlap, Principal Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The industry can no longer afford to wait several years for new market segments such as blockchain to take off.” Why is that, we hear you ask? Well it’s simple. And reader, please do take your time to really savour this paragraph, because honestly even if we were trying to write parody we couldn’t have come up with this: The dire nature of COVID-19 demands the ability to fast-track solutions at a Netflix-like pace. With the forthcoming enabling technologies, reducing complexity and the need for technical expertise in order to usher in a broader set of stakeholders, ‘citizen solver’ could become the newest catchphrase. There’s then some fluff about a “potentially mega-blockchain initiative” to “integrate COVID-19 data” from relentless blockchain-pushers IBM and Oracle (who were actually already working together on blockchain projects, so coronavirus does not appear to be, contrary to what the release is claiming, the impetus for this). We’re never told what on earth this integrated data will do, of course. We’re also given a couple of examples of “blockchain-based monitoring systems springing up”. Again, no explanation for why in Ford’s name the blockchain could possibly be of any benefit. And then the conclusion: Dunlap concludes: “The effects of unprecedented cooperation among technology rivals coming together to solve a global crisis will continue to linger long after the coronavirus is under control. Enterprises should become accustomed to new levels of industry collaboration. This expectation will be based on a critical need for industry giants to rally together to focus attention in 2021 and beyond on helping to get the economy back on track and ensuring customers are successful.” (Please God, please, can the customers be successful.)

That quite silly made-up word that was meant to send bitcoin to the moon and beyond this year because of, like, the basic rules of supply-and-demand economics (ahem)? Well it wasn’t due until May, but it turns out the halvening has come early. Or a halvening of sorts, anyway. Not the halvening that’s set to cut the supply of newly minted bitcoins into two (a bit like tapering in a QE scenario), but a halvening that has cut the price of bitcoin into two. Bitcoin plunged to a 10-month low of around $3,850 overnight on some exchanges -- a more than 50 per cent drop in the space of 48 hours -- before edging up to around $5,500 at pixel time. That still marks an almost 50 per cent fall from levels close to $10,500 a month ago. Here’s a chart showing the move, from crypto site Coindesk: And it wasn’t just bitcoin. The whole of the cryptoverse slid painfully into the red on Friday, with thinking-man’s crypto Ethereum having touched $95 overnight, a 66 per cent plunge from a month earlier, and unthinking-man’s crypto Ripple (or XRP) touching 15 cents, down from 33 cents a month ago (it’s lost about 96 per cent since its all-time high). In an echo of the crypto frenzy of late 2017, two of the biggest crypto platforms, BitMEX and Gemini, went down for about 45 minutes late on Thursday night, according to The Block. Somehow, despite crypto’s ongoing claim that its tokens are not just speculative magical digital beans, but are in fact safe havens (and uncorrelated ones, at that), the same affliction that has gripped regular ole markets, with investors frantically dumping anything that they perceive as risky, appears to be feeding through into crypto. Mind. Blown. Far far away, in the disconnected Brodom of Cryptoland, there are signs of desperation. Coindesk put out a piece under the headline “6 Good Reasons for Bitcoin HODLers to Stay Calm”, which actually provided seven reasons to HODL and stay calm (maybe they didn’t think the seventh was any good): Pretty compelling stuff, we’re sure you’ll agree. Non-self-identifying bitcoin bro Antony “Pomp” Pompliano, meanwhile reckons “the alternate financial system is just getting started”: Barry Shill-bert, of course, is telling his disciples he’s going to BTFD. No surprises there from the CEO of the Digital Currency Group, a huge crypto VC firm that owns Coindesk and has stakes in Ripple, Z-cash, and BitPay, among others. While John McAfee, as per, seems to be living in a completely different universe: Gotta love the crypto.

https://www.ft.com/content/a76fba24-afbe-4b4d-84b8-629fedd961c1,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Canaan you believe this crypto stock got listed on the Nasdaq?,Canaan Creative, the Chinese firm with a... creative approach to securities laws.,In November, Chinese bitcoin mining-machine manufacturer Canaan Creative became the first crypto company to be listed on the Nasdaq, at a valuation of $1.35bn. After the IPO-that-never-was of Bitmain, another Chinese bitcoin mining firm that has been trying to go public since 2018, the successful listing of Canaan on a major US stock exchange was heralded by the crypto industry as something of a coup. This despite the fact that the $90m the company raised was a fraction of its original $400m target. See for instance this tweet by Justin Sun (the dude who Warren Buffett was recently made to dine with after he bid just over $4.5m for the privilege): The party appears to have been a little premature, however. In the three months or so since listing, the Cayman Island-registered company -- which is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of the ASIC devices that are used to “mine” cryptocurrency -- has seen its share price collapse by almost half, from $9 to around $4.70 at pixel time (despite a rather unusual 80 per cent one-day surge in the middle of last month). And that’s in a period during which bitcoin has climbed about 15 per cent. But the collapsing share price is just the start of the company’s woes. Bear with us as we tell you a strange tale of how it came to be that this little-known Chinese crypto firm came to be listed on the second-biggest stock exchange in the world, despite three unsuccessful listing attempts in Asia, and is now being sued by unhappy investors. On Wednesday an investor in Canaan named Phillippe Lemieux filed a class-action lawsuit against the company, alleging that it had released false and misleading statements to make its financial health appear better than it was, and had failed to disclose information that might have been pertinent to investors. And a host of law firms have announced investigations into similar claims of securities laws violations by Canaan over the past couple of weeks. This all comes on the back of a February 20 note from short-seller Marcus Aurelius Value (MAV), entitled “Canaan Fodder”, which goes into some rather disturbing details about the company’s antics in the run up to the Nasdaq listing, and also its three previous unsuccessful listing attempts. Canaan told us they were unable to provide any comment for this article as it was too close to their fourth-quarter earnings release. Instead, they directed us to an article on Chinese blockchain-focused site huiyep.com, which constitutes of a series of rebuttals to the MAV short report. It’s in Mandarin, but we’ve used Google to give us a clunky translation, and will include some of this in order to try to put across Canaan’s point of view in this post. From the MAV note (with our emphasis): We view CAN as the latest US-listed Chinese company to have deceived investors about its business. After failing three times to list itself on Asian exchanges since 2016, CAN took advantage of these frothy markets to complete a NASDAQ IPO in November 2019. Shares surged by more than 80% in a single trading day last week, pushing the company’s market cap above $1 Billion, in a move that appears to have enticed thousands of unsuspecting retail investors into the speculative fervour. But our investigation of this bitcoin mining machine maker reveals undisclosed related party transactions, irregularities involving many customers and distributors, as well as a business model that we view as broken. Regardless of your outlook on the future of Bitcoin, we believe that CAN’s business is simply far worse than promoted. We therefore see significant downside potential and believe the stock is uninvestible. So let’s look into some of these allegations. The first concerns alleged undisclosed related party transactions. In late October, around three weeks before the Nasdaq listing, Canaan announced a “strategic partnership” with a small Cayman Island-incorporated, Hong Kong-listed company called Grandshores, with the latter agreeing to spend up to $150m on buying and distributing Canaan equipment on behalf of the company by the end of 2020. That $150m is nearly equal to Canaan’s 12-month trailing revenue of around $177m, as MAV points out, so this would seem like kind of a big deal for the company. But it’s also more than three times greater than Grandshores’ market capitalisation, four times Grandshores’ reported 2019 revenues, and almost ten times the amount of cash the Hong Kong company says it has on hand. So how could Granshores afford to spend this $150m? What was going on? It turns out that Grandshores’ chairman and executive director, Yao Yongjie, is a shareholder in Canaan, owning 9.7 per cent of the company’s outstanding shares, according to an SEC filing. But this transaction isn’t listed in the SEC filings, so the relationship is not acknowledged. MAV says it views the Grandshores announcement as “largely bogus”, and that it “was used by CAN as a device to hype its financial prospects to investors”. We got no reply to our request for comment on this from Grandshores, but the Huiyep article says the relationship did not need to be disclosed as it “did not meet the related party standards required by the US financial accounting standards”. It also says the $150m deal “was only an intent, not an ongoing or completed transaction, and had no impact on the operating results during the reporting period” and there was therefore no need to disclose it. (Grandshores did, however, feel the need to disclose it as a related party dealing, in its filings in Hong Kong.) Similar apparent related party transactions appear to have been used to boost investor interest in the run-up to Canaan’s attempts to list on Chinese exchanges. You also have the fact that some of the companies listed as major customers of Canaan in its Chinese listing documents seem to be operating in industries that are entirely unrelated to crypto mining. According to MAV, one of among the top-five accounts receivable listed by Canaan in 2015 to 2017 was a firm called Tianjin Garments Import & Export Co. The clue is in the name: the company says on its website that it specialises in “clothing, fabrics, blankets, carpets and stone carvings”. The Huiyep article says on this (excuse the clunky translation) that Canaan “borrowed (Tianjin’s) import and export qualifications to export a mining machine to a Swedish customer. The initial payment was still the advance payment of Tianjin Clothing”. Hmm. Then there are the disappearing distributors. Shortly before its IPO, Canaan deleted 8 of the 11 official distributors it had previously listed on its website (MAV links to the a May 2019 version of the website as archived by the waybackmachine). One of these was a company called Nova Bit Mining Solutions, which at least sounds like it might be into crypto mining. The intriguing thing here, though, is that the CEO of Nova Bit, according to his LinkedIn profile, is Andres Romero, and he is... one of Canaan’s sales reps. He happily lists both companies on his LinkedIn profile: We contacted Romero on this, and he told us that he no longer worked for Nova Bit and that he just hadn’t got round to updating his LinkedIn profile. He also said he had “no idea” who the new Nova Bit CEO was or whether the company was still operational. Like MAV, we made several calls to the number listed on the Nova Bit website and didn’t get through. There appears to have been some further issues regarding the distributors, too. MAV say their review of the other seven deleted distributors reveals that “most appear to be small, defunct, or otherwise incapable of buying material amounts of product from CAN”. The other company you can see Romero currently works for, on his LinkedIn is Northern Data, which last week announced a “close cooperation” with Canaan “in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) development, Blockchain Technology and Datacenter operations”. Canaan’s other listed sales agent, Matthew Carson, works for the same company, according to his LinkedIn profile. Cryptoland: it’s all so cosy. Another slightly odd matter, given the fees associated with such transactions, is that shortly before Canaan’s November 20 listing on the Nasdaq, its lead underwriters Credit Suisse pulled out of the IPO. We asked Credit Suisse to tell us the reason for the sudden change of heart but the bank declined to comment. There’s much more to dig into here, and the full short report -- which has not provoked any direct response from the company -- is worth a read. We will certainly continue to keep a close eye on this firm. With this much smoke, there has to be some Canaan fire.,,Jemima Kelly,2020-03-06T17:47:49.428Z,

Does one use one of those quite frankly terrible stock images that show crypto tokens as actual coins and thereby feed the fallacy that these are in fact currencies? Does one use a picture of a crypto mine, which essentially just looks like any other data centre — ie, a room full of computers — and can therefore be a little dull? Or does one try to somehow illustrate the magic of blockchain with some kind of graphic, and if so, how does one come up with a graphic of something that is used in such an inconsistent way to mean so many things? Luckily for us, our perpetual quandary appears to have been answered. Because we now have a personification of the marvel that is the distributed dream-ledger. And what’s especially lucky is that personification of the blockchain has given unto us a literal blockhead. (In case you don’t know, a blockhead is a word that dates back to the 1540s and means “a very stupid person”. Look, they did this, not us.) Enter Figure, a Silicon Valley-based start-up headed up by Mike Cagney, former CEO of Social Finance Inc (SoFi) that says it provides lending on the blockchain. On Tuesday it launched a video ad campaign that hopes to “educate consumers” on the technology (h/t to Reuters’ Anna Irrera for drawing our attention to this one). Here’s the main ad, in which we get introduced to this fun and disruptive dude. As you will see, Figure’s cartoon character is imaginatively just called “Blockchain”, but we’re sure you’ll agree that he suits Mr Blockhead much better. Mr Blockhead tells us: I’m not bitcoin, cryptocurrency, or anything scary. In fact I make things less scary. I improve financial transactions like loans, behind the scenes, to make them more efficient, secure, and less costly. Which, if I work my magic right, can save you money. Before me, this was all done manually — aka by people. And people can make mistakes. And then other people have to find those mistakes and correct them, which all takes time and money. Ah yes. Because as we all know by now, blockchains can’t make mistakes. Why not? Well to be honest, it’s not because it’s impossible for there to be a mistake on a blockchain. It’s because they’re immutable. So the idea of finding those mistakes and correcting them? Not possible. So you see you really can’t make a mistake. Can’t meaning shouldn’t, of course. Don’t you just love this technology? The best bit is probably when Mr Blockhead starts explaining the trustless nature of the blockchain (emphasis ours): Whenever you use Figure to get a loan, I make a block. That block is a super-secure digital record of the transaction. In fact it’s so secure that in order for me to create or append a block, I have to share my block with a network of unbiased computers, called nodes . . . from trusted financial institutions all over the country. And they all have to sign off on it to give me the go-ahead to make it. Which means I can always maintain the security and legitimacy, OR TRUTH STAAAATE. You know, those unbiased computers at all those unbiased banks! What’s that you say — you don’t trust those banks? That’s OK! Um hello, we have a blockchain!

Do you see caution, restraint and austerity? Or is it more excess, profligacy, and greed? For the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC)’s Hester Peirce, a commissioner at the US financial regulator with libertarian leanings, it appears to be the former. Ms. Peirce — whom blockchainers have nicknamed “CryptoMom” because of her ongoing support for cryptocurrencies — gave a speech to the International Blockchain Congress in Chicago on Thursday, where she announced that she was proposing a new rule. Crypto start-ups, she said, should get a “safe harbour period” for three years after they issue their tokens, during which time they shouldn’t be subject to the normal regulations. In a speech entitled “A Proposal to Fill the Gap Between Regulation and Decentralization”, Peirce told revellers: When we see people struggling to find a way both to comply with the law and accomplish their laudable objectives, we need to ask ourselves whether the law should change to enable them to pursue their efforts in confidence that they are doing so legally. Entrepreneurs across the crypto landscape are facing just such a scenario in their attempts to develop worthwhile and beneficial products. Whether it is issuing tokens to be used in a network, launching an exchange-traded product based on bitcoin, providing custody for crypto assets, operating a broker-dealer that handles crypto transactions, or setting up an alternative trading system where people can trade crypto assets, our securities laws stand in the way of innovation. Yeah, because after all, why can’t setting up a trading system for crypto assets (essentially, in our view, facilitating gambling) be laudable and beneficial and worthwhile? And why shouldn’t i n n o v a t i o n come first for once? What’s that you say? Innovation has come first in the past and things haven’t necessarily turned out that well? Oh well things are different now so let’s not look back at previous mistakes. All eyes on the decentralised future! One of the main regulatory hurdles getting in the way of crypto-innovation in the US concerns the Howey test, which determines whether or not a transaction should be considered an investment contract, and therefore whether it should be subject to securities laws. This has been used to determine that several initial coin offerings (ICOs) were in fact unregistered securities offerings, with significant fines for the targeted token issuers. But Ms. Peirce thinks that this test is often used unfairly. You see she really, really sees the best in the cryptofolk (emphasis ours): There are circumstances in which the security label fits, but, in other cases, promises made about tokens increasing in value are nothing more than expressions of the hope that a network will succeed and be used by lots of people. Absolutely. Because when you’re trying to shift a few million strings of 1s and 0s to retail investors for a couple of hundred million quid, sharpish, what you’re really focusing on is your hope that your network will succeed and be used by lots of people. Yes, you might be telling potential buyers that your token is going “to the moon”, but again it’s just an innocent expression of hope. Ms Peirce does think there should be some conditions for token issuers under her proposed “safe harbour” rule: First, the team must intend for the network on which the token functions to reach network maturity—defined as either decentralization or token functionality —within three years of the date of the first sale of tokens and undertake good faith and reasonable efforts to achieve that goal. Second, the team would have to disclose key information on a freely accessible public website. Third, the token must be offered and sold for the purpose of facilitating access to, participation on, or the development of the network. Fourth, the team would have to undertake good faith and reasonable efforts to create liquidity for users. Finally, the team would have to file a notice of reliance. But overall, it seems like CryptoMom just wants to give the cryptokids a break. Enthusiastic commentary on the development has of course been spewing into our already sagging inbox. Like this from Catherine Coley, CEO of the US division of Binance, a crypto exchange that is estimated to have made over $1bn in cumulative profit: If adopted, the proposed safe harbor could be the most groundbreaking development for the U.S. cryptocurrency market to date.... By putting development first and giving projects runway to build robust networks, the proposed safe harbor puts an important stake in the ground towards supporting American access and acceptance of digital asset markets. In the long run, it will help bring more Americans into digital asset trading and foster greater network participation. (Bringing more Americans into digital asset trading; what more could you ask of a regulator?) And this from Andy Bromberg, co-founder and president of CoinList, a crypto token sales management platform: This is a great day for the blockchain industry and the United States. Today we both congratulate and thank SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce. In her announcement of proposed Rule 195, she set a course for compliant blockchain projects to innovate and grow here in the United States, resolving more than two years of ongoing discussions about the applicability of securities laws to crypto. A great day for the United States indeed! What could possibly go wrong? For an idea, we recommend that Ms Peirce (and any readers who aren’t familiar with ICOs) have a look here.

https://www.ft.com/content/349cfee2-06ad-4b2d-ada0-10a23a8e73da,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Bitcoin’s “halvening” won’t boost its price,And the word shouldn’t be halvening (nor even halving, though that would be preferable). It should be tapering.,Halvening is not a word. As I type it, my spell-checker helpfully underlines the offending (nay, offensive) gibberish with a red dotted line, to make sure that I don’t in fact mean “halving”. That would be a perfectly good word, but it’s not the one I mean. No — because I’m using a word born of a land where bunk and baloney thrive and reality, less so. That land is cryptoland. There, “halvening” has become a part of the vernacular, along with “HODL”, “rekt”, and “mooning” (not showing off one’s posterior, but instead the state of a cryptocurrency whose trajectory is skyward). And according to the internet, it’s this halvening that is guaranteed to see bitcoin mooning in 2020. The cryptonet, mainly, but increasingly other places too. Like Vanity Fair, for example, who on Wednesday published a piece under the boosterish headline “WE ARE GOING TO SEE HIGHER HIGHS IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE”: IS BITCOIN GOLD RUSH 2.0 JUST AROUND THE CORNER? (H/t Reuters’ Anna Irrera for drawing our attention to the piece.) The subhead tells us: Predicting where the volatile cryptocurrency will net out is like predicting which way the wind will blow next week—but experts have one surefire way to do it. (You guessed it: the halvening.) Sounds intriguing, but actually no. No, they don’t. Before we get onto why not though, what is the halvening, and when is it going to happen? The halvening is the gobbledygook term used to describe the point at which the new supply of bitcoins being pumped into the system every ten minutes halves. This will happen, per bitcoin’s original design, approximately every four years until around 2140, when the total supply of close to 21 million bitcoins is reached (we’re currently at just over 18 million). The last time we had a halvening was on July 16 2016, when the number of new bitcoins that become available for crypto miners every ten minutes — the so-called “block reward” — dropped to 12.5, from 25 previously. Around May 12th of this year, that number will halve again. Vanity Fair explains: Sometime in May this year, the number of coins available will be cut in half, from 12.5 to 6.25, in an event known as the “halvening.” (Yes, it’s “halvening,” not halving.) That means that the age-old phenomenon of supply and demand will kick in. As Rose explained, every time a halvening has occurred in the past, the price of Bitcoin has risen, then eventually, fallen. This time around, he said, the climb has barely begun. So let’s start with that age-old phenomenon of supply and demand. What that principle says, as we all know, is that if the availability of a certain good or service falls, while demand remains steady, the price of that good should go up (and vice versa), all else remaining equal. But the thing is, bitcoin’s supply is not actually about to halven (nor to halve, for that matter). Its supply is increasing, and will continue to do so until 2140, so there’s no reason to believe that, by the laws of supply and demand, there should be a price increase. There are more bitcoins to buy and sell today than there were yesterday, and there will be more bitcoins to buy and sell on May 13 than there were on May 12; it’s just that the rate at which new bitcoins are being pumped out will slow. You see although crypto fans love to argue that one of bitcoin’s main selling points is that it provides a hedge against the relentless monetary easing inflicted upon the public by evil central bankers, bitcoin has actually been in a state of perpetual money printing since its very inception. So when the rate at which new supply halves, that won’t constitute any kind of removal of money from the system, or monetary tightening. How we should understand the halvening is, rather, as a form of tapering. But unlike central bank tapering, we don’t need forward guidance or dot plots to work out when this tapering will occur, and at what pace; it’s all pre-determined. There are no surprises. And what that means is that, if we are to believe that the bitcoin market is in any way free and efficient (and not just subject to Tether-fuelled pump-and-dump activity), as its advocates like to say it is, this tapering should already be priced in, as it is already known about by market participants. Of course we don’t actually think that the bitcoin market is efficient, so it could be that, even if not by the laws of supply and demand, the price of bitcoin rises on the back of shill-ticles like this one, which could increase demand even if not managing to magically reduce supply. But there’s no great reason to think that will happen, given the plethora of other factors and unknowns that affect bitcoin’s price. People like to claim that the last time there was a “halvening”, that boosted bitcoin’s price, but that’s not quite true either. Vanity Fair, again: The price [later] crashed to the $200 range, where it remained for the next few years until the next Bitcoin halvening, which occurred July 9, 2016.” That halvening, of course, led to the “Bitcoin boom” that went viral and saw the price of a Bitcoin ascend into the stratosphere. Bitcoin actually fell slightly in price on July 9 2016, and didn’t recover until October that year. At that point, it did indeed start to climb more rapidly, but not as rapidly as over the course of 2017; and the reason for that was largely the ICO boom and general cryptomania, during which time the supply of cryptocurrencies was, ironically, expanding massively. We’re not saying bitcoin won’t rise in price this year — trying to predict price movements in a market with no fundamentals and in which pump-and-dump trading is rife is a fool’s game. It might rise, but it might fall. And the idea that a slowing down of the number of new coins being added to the system is somehow going to pump bitcoin to $50,000 or higher, as some are claiming, makes about as much sense as the word halvening.,,Jemima Kelly,2020-01-31T07:18:19.073Z,

You might recall that Mone and Barrowman had tried to raise money via an initial coin offering (ICO) for their “EQUI” token — which would apparently allow buyers to invest in early-stage businesses — but that that’d failed, in quite awkward fashion. After the ICO flop, EQUI was then rebranded to “EQUI Global”, which would focus on the company’s “Token Blockchain technology” and would only involve “sophisticated investors”. It was at that point that Woz — who is co-founder of Apple — mysteriously got involved. Last June, in its Telegram group, EQUI said a tokenised “security exchange” would be “ready in September”, and that it would be “the 1st security exchange if not one of the 1st”. There has been no such launch. But in September, the company rebranded again. The website states that EQUI Global is now EQUI Capital Partners, whose sole director, according to Companies House records, is Andrew Barrowman, Doug Barrowman’s 28-year-old son. EQUI has promised since September that further details and an updated website would be “coming soon”, but the site is still just a landing page. So there doesn’t seem to be much action on that front. That wasn’t the the baroness’s only venture into cryptoland, however; she also tried to launch a £250m luxury development in Dubai that was to be sold in bitcoin, and which was due to be completed last summer. But The Times reported last year that project had stalled, with government inspectors finding that construction had stopped on the site. And so now, Lady Mone of Mayfair wants to share her pro business tips with the rest of us. For a mere £15,000, you can attend a two-day business retreat that includes one whole night at a 5* hotel, along with other exclusive benefits including: • Business Doctors, what would you like to achieve? • Personalised wellbeing assessment • Style tips on how to dress to empower the boardroom • Goody bag There’s also “media and public speaking training”, which seems sensible — you need to be able to know how to handle definition lawyers and the like. And after all, according to the press release, Mone “was recently voted as the UK’s Number 1 Female speaker*, recognised both as an entrepreneur and as an advocate for equality for women in business”. (The asterisk was never followed up by any explanation, and we were given no further details from the PR agency when we asked them about that.) This retreat, surely, pays for itself.

Murphy & McGonigle has an “innovation lab”, which the firm says allows it to serve its clients “as technology fundamentally transforms the way they do business”, and in which it explores “new ways to deliver services”, such as “proprietary databases”. And in 2018, Murphy & McGonigle decided that one of these innovative databases should be a “proprietary, data-based tool to monitor U.S. litigation in the blockchain industry”. It would be called the Murphy & McGonigle Blockchain Litigation Database, and it would be very good. Last week, we were allowed a glimpse into some of the unique insights that can be gleaned from this propriety non-distributed database on distributed database litigation, as Murphy & McGonigle released The Blockchain Litigation Year in Review Report for 2019 (h/t David Gerard for drawing our attention to it). Among the report’s headlines was: “Regulatory Enforcement Actions Drop Off”. Here’s Murphy & McGonigle’s chart showing the spike in blockchain litigation in 2018 (somehow the spike is illustrated by showing the difference in the number of cases between 2018 and 2019, rather than 2017 and 2018): But then there’s a better chart. You see because you can’t really get any true insights from a line chart without a trend line and a line explaining what’s going on. What you really need is some t e c h n i c a l a n a l y s i s. We quote: Following the 2018 enforcement wave, blockchain litigation returned to its previous upward trajectory in 2019. Which seems odd to us, given the number of cases halved in 2019. Before you call up the chart crime police, you’d better call Murphy & McGonigle.

https://www.ft.com/content/16db565a-25a1-11ea-9305-4234e74b0ef3,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,‘DeFi’ movement promises high interest but high risk,Investors back projects aiming to ‘decentralise finance’ and offer direct loans and derivatives,Earlier this year, San Francisco start-up Compound promised yield-hungry investors something rarely seen in the US: interest rates that exceeded 10 per cent at times, just for moving money on to its app’s lending platform. Compound is not a bank, in the familiar sense. Rather, it is one of dozens of new Silicon Valley groups developing so-called decentralised finance — or “DeFi” — projects aiming to disintermediate traditional financial institutions. To date, digital currencies and their underlying blockchain technologies have largely been used for speculative trading. But DeFi start-ups are trying to build an interlocking financial system denominated in cryptocurrencies, offering a wide array of lending and derivatives products available globally, peer-to-peer and without any middlemen. The movement has gathered steam in 2019, with investment from mainstream investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Bain Capital Ventures. Even former UK chancellor George Osborne has shown support as a partner at his brother Theo Osborne’s venture capital group 9Yards Capital, which backs several DeFi start-ups. “2019 will be known as the year of DeFi for crypto,” said Monica Desai, an investor at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. “Some of the best talent in the space right now is in DeFi. And because they’re seeing usage, more people are building there.” But DeFi is still nascent, freewheeling and largely unregulated. Most companies have only debuted their initial products in the past year, and total assets have yet to exceed $1bn. Meanwhile, critics warn that the sector’s technological limitations and untested economics may not work when handling larger transaction volumes. “[DeFi] is a sign of things to come and a super interesting sandbox,” said Simon Taylor, a former Barclays vice-president and co-founder at financial technology consultancy 11:FS. “[But] it’s both very dangerous and the Wild West.” DeFi first gained traction in late 2018 as an umbrella term for a loose collection of blockchain projects focused on eradicating any human involvement from financial services. For proponents, this promises a faster, more inclusive and transparent financial system. The movement encompasses “decentralised” exchanges and lending platforms, for example. Here there is no reliance on a central intermediary to hold funds — instead, trades and loans occur directly between participants through automated processes. “Over time you have the ability for anyone to be able to access savings accounts, to be able to access loans and to earn income in a steady currency that is not tied to wherever they live,” said Ms Desai. The applications operate on blockchains, the immutable public ledgers that record transactions in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. Most are built on the Ethereum blockchain because it can be used to create smart contracts — essentially computer code that is automatically triggered when certain conditions are met. Ether, the related currency, is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation behind bitcoin, trading at about $130. But several other protocols, such as Tezos, Algorand and Dfinity, are also developing with a view to support DeFi applications. While the amount of money locked in DeFi products is relatively small — about $700m, according to data compiled by DeFi Pulse — it has nearly tripled this year, with outsize yields and a wave of new initiatives helping to propel growth. DeFi Prime, a website tracking the sector, counts more than 200 related projects offering everything from prediction markets to margin trading. The most popular applications have focused on peer-to-peer lending markets underpinned by stablecoins, cryptocurrencies that are largely pegged to fiat currencies such as the US dollar. In the case of Compound, the largest of the lending platforms, stablecoin holders supply their assets to a “liquidity pool” from which borrowers can pull. Compound’s algorithm, or “protocol”, automatically sets interest rates based on supply and demand. The transactions occur continuously, so lenders earn frequent but fluctuating interest. For their part, borrowers must pledge more collateral, in the form of other cryptoassets, than the value of their loan, providing extra protection to the system in case of default. Compound says it has more than $120m earning interest on its app. “When demand to borrow an asset is super high, the interest rate is high, and when demand to borrow an asset is low, the interest rate is low,” said Robert Leshner, founder of Compound, which raised more than $24m in a fundraising round led by Andreessen Horowitz in September. Maker DAO, which is responsible for the Dai stablecoin, is another well-known project. Billed as “the world’s first unbiased currency”, users obtain Dai by opening a so-called collateralised debt position with Maker, which provides the tokens as a form of debt backed by Ether and a growing list of other cryptocurrencies. Dai holders have locked nearly $350m in Maker’s protocol, according to DeFi Pulse, more than any other similar application, although the project has been plagued by infighting. Like other speculative ventures, DeFi start-ups have focused on building their technologies and user bases rather than profitability. This means low fees, together with chunky yields, have proven a draw to the space for users. “What is happening more and more in DeFi is not wild speculation but saving dollars with handsome return and relatively limited risk,” said Brendan Forster, chief operating officer of Dharma, which acts as a digital bank depositing user assets on the Compound protocol. But this could change in future. Dharma does not charge anything to users, though Mr Forster said the company would probably introduce fees next year. Compound collects upward of 10 per cent of the interest charged to borrowers on its application, which it sets aside as reserves. Some worry that diminishing interest rates — as more users flood the space — may not sufficiently compensate investors for the risks of the platform. “One of the big questions that hangs over DeFi is the sustainability of the economic returns for participants lending your crypto,” said Garrick Hileman, an academic and head of research at Blockchain.com, a cryptocurrency wallet company. It is too early to tell, though early adopters are predictably bullish on DeFi’s long-term prospects. “In 50 years, I can’t see us still relying on trusted intermediaries to do settlement of [foreign exchange] transactions,” Mr Forster said. “It doesn’t make sense . . . Why use humans when we have code that can do it perfectly?” But even some advocates acknowledge DeFi is highly experimental and exists in a regulatory grey zone. “It’s not ready for mainstream use and it’s not ready for human consumption . . . This early phase is really for researchers, professionals, very sophisticated speculators,” said Mr Leshner, adding that he believed DeFi would become a mainstream technology over the next decade. There are also practical barriers to widespread adoption. Ms Desai noted that users must first purchase existing cryptocurrencies such as Ether to access DeFi products, adding that the “tax regimes are confusing”. And as with elsewhere in the cryptocurrency sphere, there are risks of scams. “This in some ways has echoes of the peer-to-peer lending space [and] there’s some challenges in that space that might be instructive,” said Mr Hileman, pointing to the Chinese P2P lending industry crisis, where a spate of fraud and negligence cases has shocked investors in recent years. “In 2020, it will still be ill-defined and overhyped,” said Tim Swanson, director of research at Post Oak Labs. “Regulators will increasingly learn about how in many case DeFi is often basically non-compliant . . . with anti-money laundering and know your customer rules.” Some have also pointed to systemic risks. The initiatives all rely on the protocol that they are built on, such as Ethereum, which has faced early stumbles as it begins to handle larger transaction volumes. They are also tied to the cryptocurrencies that fuel those protocols — which remain vulnerable to price swings. “You need to solve the underlying technology problems that protocols have so that people can safely deploy those decentralised applications,” said Steve Kokinos, chief executive of smart contract protocol Algorand. Meanwhile, DeFi’s economics have not been tested at scale. And without human intermediaries overseeing transaction settlement, users must fully trust the software, meaning any glitches could fully upend the system. “What excites me is where we could be if most products could be built without requiring the paper [and] expensive legacy tech banks do,” said Mr Taylor at 11:FS. “Anyone could build financial products. It doesn’t mean anyone should.”,,Miles Kruppa Hannah Murphy,2019-12-30T05:00:44.000Z,

https://www.ft.com/content/c49e1089-43f1-42f1-b5ff-a4274aba2dd1,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,When is a blockchain startup not a blockchain startup?,(Clue: it’s something about the blocks. And the chains.),It’s awkward when you set up a business around a technology that you reckon is going to disrupt global finance so you name your business after said technology, send your CEO on speaking tours to evangelise about said technology, but then decide that said technology isn’t going to do anything useful for you, isn’t it? Digital Asset was one of the pioneers of blockchain-in-finance, with the idea that it could make clearing and trade settlement sexy again (well OK maybe not but at least make it faster and more efficient). Its erstwhile CEO Blythe Masters, a glamorous former JP Executive who was credited with/blamed for pioneering credit-default swaps, trotted around the globe telling people that blockchain was “email for money”. So significant a role did DA play in the early blockchain mythos that artist Simon Denny immortalised Masters and the firm in a special edition of the board game Risk, as part of a 2016 art exhibition in New York. And even though Masters stepped down as CEO a year ago, Digital Asset is still seen as a big player -- crypto news site Coindesk last week called the firm a “seminal enterprise blockchain startup”. But one might have thought if the company was so seminal, it might still be actively involved in blockchain. Not so much. As Izzy and the FT’s Phil Stafford wrote back in the summer, the firm has been steadily shifting away from the distributed technicolour dream-ledger that is blockchain, and towards DAML, its programming language for creating smart contracts (i.e. contracts that self-execute when certain pre-determined criteria are met). But until now, the idea seemed to be that the smart contracts would run on top of some sort of a blockchain platform. As DAML is just a programming language, and therefore cannot be used on its own, the idea would be that you would use it to run your own DAML-based applications, on a blockchain or distributed ledger-based system (the difference between the two is slightly unclear but the latter is kind of just a watered-down version of the former). Last week, Digital Asset announced that it had raised another $35m in a Series C fundraising round. The money would be used, it said, to “accelerate the adoption of DAML across multiple industries, expand the number and variety of DAML-enabled partner products and fund new products designed to enhance the DAML developer experience, specifically project:DABL, a cloud-based prototyping and production environment for DAML applications”. Despite calling itself a “the NY-based blockchain start-up” in the press release, there wasn’t very much else (i.e. nothing) in it about blockchain, or even distributed ledger technology (DLT), except in reference to some other companies that do blockchainy things. So we asked Digital Asset to confirm whether DAML needed to be used with a blockchain or DLT platform, and they told us (emphasis ours): DAML is a smart contract language that is designed to work with blockchain platforms. DAML cannot be used on its own – it needs a platform underneath it. What’s unique about DAML, however, is that we’re enabling it to work on more than just blockchain platforms. For example, we announced in June that we will enable DAML for Amazon’s cloud-based Aurora database. Our vision is for developers to use DAML to build applications that can run on blockchains or traditional databases. The point is that (eventually) DAML-based applications should be able to run on any kind of database. Did you catch that? What is unique about this “blockchain start-up” is that although it is designed to work with blockchain platforms, it can actually work with any old database. (Also is it just us or is this a tacit admission that blockchain is, after all, just a kind of database?) So how did DA manage to raise another $35m from new and existing investors (who include Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan)? Could it be what one Alphaville friend likes to call the “Embarrassment Phase” of the technology hype cycle (ie, the bit where investors have to keep ploughing money into a project that they’ve already put money into, so as to save face in front of their own investors)? One thing seems clear: if Digital Asset is really a seminal blockchain company, then it’s likely that many other blockchain companies will stop being blockchain companies in the near future.

But elements of Deutsche Bank’s boldly titled “Imagine 2030” report, the latest edition of its “Konzept” periodical, already belong in the past. Chiefly what they have to say about the rise of “crypto”. From the report, published last week: They had been around for a while, but it was not until 2017 that cryptocurrencies really gained global attention as the price of a Bitcoin surged to almost $20,000. When Facebook announced Libra, its new cryptocurrency payment system, earlier this year, the conversation hit all levels of society and politics. And no wonder. Facebook, with its potential user base of over 2bn, has the potential to disrupt the payment industry send the use of cryptocurrencies in to the mainstream. But cryptocurrencies have always been additions, rather than substitutes, to the global inventory of money. They have not managed to take off as a means of payment despite their well-known benefits, such as security, speed, minimal transaction fees, ease of storage and relevance in the digital era. Looking ahead, this situation may be different. Looking ahead? It appears no-one told Deutsche Bank that, as Jemima wrote last week, the blockchain hype has been on the wane throughout 2019. Instead, they try to imply the growth in blockchain wallet-holders during the second decade of bitcoin’s existence will mirror that of internet users over the same time frame, with this handy chart (note the two rather different y-axes, always a warning sign in our view): Bold. Still, could all this recent gloom merely be a blip on the path to crypto-dominance? Well we haven’t got a crystal ball, so who knows if fiat money -- money backed by trust in an institution that acts as a vessel of the state -- will survive? The point we want to make here though is that Deutsche’s argument rests on a pretty shaky definition of what crypto actually is. Take their view, central to their argument, that India and China -- two countries that have banned crypto -- will decide to do a volte-face and embrace bitcoin brodom. Deutsche offer the two emerging market superpowers’ attempt to create state-backed digital money as evidence that that “cryptocurrency” will supersede fiat money by 2030 -- a claim that provoked many excitable headlines in the crypto-press. But we this is a completely back-to-front way of looking at things. Here is what they say: Details are to be confirmed but it seemed that the digital currency may have the following characteristics: i) commercial banks and the PBOC will be the only issuers; ii) the PBoC will design all wallets, possibly without using the blockchain. With government support, it is likely the Chinese people will move quickly to adopt the digital currency. “Crypto” without the blockchain? One of the defining characteristics of a cryptocurrency is that it runs on a blockchain. If it doesn’t, then it is just a digital currency. That’s why, as we argued earlier this year, Facebook’s Libra is also not a cryptocurrency. And on India: In India, change is also coming. The government declared in 2016 that 1,000 and 500 rupee notes would no longer be valid despite strong resistance to change and temporary cash shortage. And recently, a government economic panel pitched for the introduction of an official digital currency with the status of legal tender and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India. We thought the whole point of crypto and the blockchain was to bypass government involvement in financial transactions and free the money supply from state control. In trying to create their own digital forms of fiat money, what China and India are doing here is the opposite of what we imagine crypto’s originators had in mind. These governments (and indeed other central banks) are looking to strengthen the state’s role in controlling money by providing their own substitutes to crypto. Substitutes that, Deutsche admits, only they and existing commercial banks will be able to supply and may or may not use the blockchain. The jury is still out on whether the public sector will succeed here. But if it does, it would sound the knell for cryptocurrencies -- and not, as Deutsche claim, fiat money.,,Claire Jones,2019-12-09T12:09:30.341Z,

It all started around Christmas time last year, when Blythe Masters, the posterchild for mainstream blockchain adoption, stood down from her role as CEO of Digital Asset Holdings. It continued when hitherto blockchain hype-meisters McKinsey declared that “evidence for a practical scalable use for blockchain is thin on the ground”. And it persisted even as Facebook attempted to roll out a version of blockchain that would feature no blocks or chains. A quick search of Google Trends shows you interest in the technology peaking at the end of 2017, and falling off ever since.

Crypto has discovered netting,Why Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is just another pathway back to version 1.0 of the financial system.,Yes. The technical geeks will quibble with what we’re about to say. But conceptually and practically it amounts to this. End of. To get around its epic scaling limitations the numero uno cryptocurrency system (bitcoin, duh) is finally deploying the Lightning Network (LN) to major players such as the exchange Bitfinex. And what that basically means is that bitcoin is moving firmly away from real time gross settlements and push payments and into the world of deferred net settlement and pull payments. An ironic state of affairs given its raison d'être was to rid the world of intermediaries and reduce settlement risks and exposures. For a full account of how the Lightning Network really works, it’s worth revisiting these essential Frances Coppola pieces (though be mindful that at the time they were written they upset many LN enthusiasts who couldn’t grasp the entirely accurate comparisons with conventional systems Coppola was making). The basic premise of LN is that regular transactions between two parties can be taken off the blockchain via the formation of a payment channel, thus freeing up capacity on the main network. These are supposedly bonded structures to ensure the uncleared settlements are insured to some degree. Thus if two counterparts have an active two-way flow relationship between each other, they need only ever settle the net differentials between them via the core chain on an infrequent basis. Obviously, it’s not convenient in life to only transact with preapproved counterparties. But setting up a new channel with a new counterpart isn’t optimal either. Not only does it involve a transaction on the core chain (undermining the traffic decongestion objective of LN in the first place), it’s simply not practical. Thus the big idea in LN is that payments can be routed through preapproved channels until a pathway from you and your preapproved counterpart is found to your potential irregular recipient and their preapproved counterpart. But for that to work, crypto payments undergo a major change in their dynamics. As Frances noted back in January 2018: Lightning is a “pull” system. Every participant makes a payment, then “pulls” reimbursement from the previous participant. So each participant has to have sufficient “own funds” in their channel to make the payment. If they don't, they can't participate in the route, and their predecessor must find a different participant. Using “own funds” to make a payment on behalf of someone else meets the normal definition of “lending”. It may be settled within milliseconds (or not, as we shall see), but that doesn't change what it is. For Peter to pay Paul, via a network of other consciously coupled counterparts, all respective counterparts need some base amount of liquidity at all times for the whole thing to square. Sound familiar? It does to us. We think what has inadvertently been reinvented is an intraday-liquidity dependent payment system, within which liquid funds must not only be continuously present and unencumbered but extremely well distributed. A.k.a. the standing system of today, complete with its massive dependence on intraday liquidity and bilateral bonded “channel” relationships (also known as repo). The difference, the crypto community might argue, is that their system is cleared bilaterally rather than centrally — and thus remains decentralised. But that would be wrong. In reality, when you look at payments systems like that for Fed funds, they too came to be organised in bilateral and later trilateral wholesale funding structures. The aim, as with LN, was always to do as much clearing via deferred netted settlements “offFed”, settling only the very minimum via the core Fed system. This rings true for many other central banks operating real-time-gross settlement systems as well. As Daniela Gabor explained in her Alphaville piece about the evolution of the Tri-Party repo market: Banks rely on central bank money to manage the complex webs of settlement obligations resulting from their daily interactions with each other on behalf of retail and institutional clients. These obligations can be settled periodically on a net basis, or immediately, in ‘real time’ on a gross basis. Banks prefer netting because it allows them to economise on central bank reserves, an asset with significant opportunity costs (at least before the world of Basel III liquidity requirements). As banks increasingly lost intraday deposits due to funding obligations that hadn’t quite round-tripped back to square things off for them, they became increasingly dependent on access to Fed intraday overdrafts to bridge the temporary imbalances. To put that in crypto LN terms, the common pathway between all the respective institutions making payments in the system became the Fed, and it was de facto charged with plugging the gap when funding shortfalls emerged because in reality (due to the nature of life and trade) “pathways” never squared up in time. By the late 1980s four clearing banks emerged as the most common “pathway” counterparties, who in turn had bilateral “trusted” relationships with a plethora of other market players and so on. Like bitcoin enthusiasts, the Fed also began to worry about its excessive “intermediary” exposure to the system. To limit that exposure, it started to charge fees for overdrafts. The market responded creatively. Salomon Brothers realised that if it normalised a tri-party repo structure — essentially, the use of a third common counterpart to intermediate settlements — it could save fees by avoiding the Fed system entirely while reducing the risk of a funding shortfall. The problem is, all the structure did was move the risk from the Fed to the tri-party clearing banks instead. The rest as they say (the global financial crisis, ahem) is history. But this is history that has been lost on those reinventing the financial system, one recurring mistake at a time. For fun, here — from Investopedia — is the crypto explainer of how deferred netting, sorry we mean the Lightning Network clearing, occurs: Here’s a practical example of how a lightning network transaction functions. Alice opens a channel with her favourite coffee shop and deposits $100 worth of bitcoin in it. Her transactions with the coffee shop are instant because she has a direct channel with it. Bob, who has a channel open with the grocery store he visits most frequently, also buys coffee from Alice’s shop. The connection between Alice, the coffee shop, and Bob ensures that Alice can use funds from her balance with the coffee shop to buy groceries from Bob’s store. Similarly, Bob can use his grocery store balance to conduct transactions with businesses in Alice’s network. If Bob closes his channel with the grocery store (and there are no other customers in common between the coffee shop and grocery store), then Alice will have to open another channel with the grocery store to make purchases there. In this way, a web of transactions is created and routed between multiple lightning nodes in a decentralised fashion. The problems with this set up are clearly obvious to any core banking practitioner. 1) The system is massively credit dependent. 2) The system is extremely liquidity draining. 3) The system’s dependency on pre-funding is likely to be a huge deterrent to most users (do consumers really want a system that requires them to tie up funds with retailers they may or may not use?) 4) The system is hugely exposed to the coincidence of wants problem, especially when it comes to getting funds out of the system and back into convertible bitcoin. This is because there is no mutual counterpart everyone has in common or has channels with, but also because there is no compulsory clearing cycle. 5) To overcome the coincidence of wants problem the system will have to rely on an expansive pathway of pull-payments arrangement. This opens the system up to many as yet unknowable credit related risks. 6) Those funding the system and taking all that risk — unlike in the conventional depositor-dependent banking sector — get no return or reward for funding or providing liquidity to the system, or for having their funding locked up. The reality of the structure is that it is entirely dependent on intraday credit relationships. When Alice wants to pay for goods at the grocery store, she needs to find a counterpart who already transacts with one of her preapproved counterparts, and who has sufficient funds locked into the store to facilitate her payment. Failing that, she has to find a common counterpart of a common counterpart. And on and on. The further away the steps go, the more intraday-loan like the arrangement becomes and the more exposed it becomes to infrequent settlement cycles. Which means for the system to work, some sort of common counterpart with an approved capacity to lend other people’s money temporarily (or provide funds from elsewhere) has to be established. As Frances put it: The coins in the channel are effectively lent to the Lightning network, which can do whatever it likes with them. The payment channels have become deposits - and even though the risk of not getting the money back is small, it is not zero. In trying to solve Lightning's pathfinding problem, the devs have turned it into a bank. No doubt the architects of the Lightning Network will figure this out over time. It’s just that when that moment comes they will have reinvented banking.

On average, a cross-border transaction requires the exchange of 36 documents and 240 copies, says Kerstin Braun, president of Stenn Group, which provides trade finance. By 2050, experts suggest blockchain could provide a digital record of transactions. This would streamline the paper trail and improve transparency between parties, allowing the introduction of practices such as “dynamic factoring”, where interest rates change as goods approach their final destination. Trade finance bridges the gap between when an exporter ships a consignment of goods and the time an importer pays for it. Banks shoulder the interim risk, such as if the importer does not or cannot pay, and finance the transaction for a fee. A letter of credit — a promise to pay for the goods if certain conditions are met — is sent to the exporter by the importer’s bank. This gives the exporter the green light to ship the goods. The exporter then presents proof of shipping to get financing from its own bank, which recoups the money directly from the importer’s bank. At the moment, information is limited: the companies doing business are often in different parts of the world and may have little credit history. Information is also slow to reach the relevant parties as paper documents have to be physically exchanged. ‘Blockchain can provide detailed data on previous transactions, and thus provide some history to facilitate risk assessment by the financier’ Blockchain, a digital ledger, could give every party in a trade finance deal access to a single record of the transaction. This would allow them to see instantly what is happening, what changes have been made to documents and by whom, which could have far-reaching consequences for the cost and availability of trade finance. The riskiness of trade finance, in theory, reduces as the goods get closer to the importer, although this is currently hard for all parties to ascertain. Aided by satellite or radio-frequency identification technology, blockchain could allow interested parties — from exporters to banks — to see immediately when, for instance, the goods are put on to a ship or the logistics firm picks them up. Professor Hau Lee of the Stanford Graduate School of Business foresees a process of “dynamic factoring”, where at each stage of the journey, as risk falls, so too does the rate of interest charged to the exporter or importer. “Blockchain lets you track every step along the way. Therefore it lowers the interest rate, because less collateral is needed,” says Prof Lee, who expects the technology to be widespread in trade finance by 2050. Another benefit of organisations using a common digital platform to track trade finance deals is that it creates a data pool about potential clients and their transaction histories. This could make it easier for new entrants, such as large institutional investors or tech firms, to offer financing or refinancing options. “At a time when institutional investors struggle to find yield in the public bond universe, the availability of this alternative source of income would be greatly welcomed,” says Francesco Filia, whose hedge fund Fasanara Capital invests in trade finance. The opening up of the sector could even mean that by 2050 the cost of basic trade financing may fall to zero, says Cécile André Leruste, managing director for the consultancy Accenture Banking in Europe. Banks would instead earn money from selling data about, or providing ratings of, exporters or importers. Blockchain could also help to expand the pool of companies that can access trade finance. This could reduce the trade finance gap — the difference between demand for the credit, particularly among small and medium-sized enterprises, and creditors’ willingness to supply it. Recommended The trade finance gap currently stands at $1.5tn, according to the Asian Development Bank. It cites “know your customer” issues as a key reason why trade finance is refused. Many SMEs and firms in the developing world, for instance, cannot show a long history of transactions. This makes it harder for creditors to assess their risk, and therefore less likely to lend to them. “Blockchain can provide detailed data on previous transactions, and thus provide some history to facilitate risk assessment by the financier,” says Prof Hau. Banks could look at data — that would be more readily available, more comprehensive and, in theory, more trusted (because all participants can see who made changes to a document) — on the parties related to current and previous transactions, and possibly even the wider supply network. Making financing more accessible would also give importers more choice of goods and help the economic development of poorer countries. Many of the documentary contracts currently used in trade finance could eventually be replaced by self-executing smart contracts that run on blockchain, according to Tim Cummins, president of the International Association for Contract and Commercial Management. This would mean contracts could be executed quicker and more simply, for instance when someone speaks into their phone to confirm shipment. Smart contracts could also open up markets to more people, for instance using pictures to help suppliers who are illiterate to understand the terms. Mr Cummins says many contracts in the developed world require PhD-level study to be understood. “It is all about a world where we are seeking to reduce the inequalities created by the misuse of power and by ‘bullying’ — which is arguably what traditional contracts are all about,” he says, adding that by 2050 documentary contracts will be unusual. For all the eventual benefits of blockchain, some parts of this archaic world may remain untouched, however. “You’re probably never going to get to the situation where it’s paperless,” says Alisa DiCaprio, head of trade and supply chain at blockchain software firm R3. “You’re always going to have countries or regions that require paper.” Blockchain has a role in movement of goods, too / From Charles Le Gallais, Taunton, Somerset, UK,,Laurence Fletcher,2019-12-03T04:30:46.000Z,

UK start-up World Chess is mulling a novel gambit of its own: a stock market flotation powered by blockchain. The business, which runs an online chess playing platform, would sell investors electronic tokens registered via trendy distributed ledger technology. World Chess would then float on London’s junior Aim market. Afterwards, the tokens could be swapped into shares, or traded as proxies for the underlying equity. The idea appeals in the wake of recent flotation flops, notably WeWork’s abortive attempt to join the US stock market. An initial public offering is nerve wracking, even on low-cost Aim. An informal sale of tokens would test the appetite of sophisticated investors with less hassle and expense to the business. The cartelised IPO industry could certainly do with the shaking up. As with chess, the rules of the game have stayed largely the same for decades, but with far less justification. Sadly, World Chess does not seem like the business to pull off a grand masterly coup. The company started out running traditional tournaments, including the prestigious World Chess Championship, as a licensee of the International Chess Federation. But relations with this governing body have been fractious. World Chess now only runs the Grand Prix, a lower tier of the World Championship series. More usefully, the company has rights to organise online chess matches under the banner of the federation. Turning these into an e-sport will take bags of investment and marketing flair. Video games lend themselves more readily to arena spectacle than two self-absorbed people slowly moving counters around a chequered square. Charismatic players in the mould of Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky would help overcome this. Current World Champion Magnus Carlsen is just a bit boring. Market innovators need the same steadiness, reflected in stable cashflows and a solid franchise. World Chess must raise that part of its game before it tries to float, with or without a token offering.

Shares in scores of tech companies with their sights on blockchain and even those of groups only tangentially related hit the 10 per cent upside limit that halts trading in Shenzhen and Shanghai. On the Shenzhen exchange, an index of blockchain-related equities compiled by data provider Wind climbed 8.9 per cent to its highest level since April, with every one of its 52 component stocks advancing. Shenzhen’s tech-focused ChiNext index rose 2.2 per cent. “It’s all because of Xi,” said Pan Shaochang, an equity analyst at Dongwu Securities, “but the talk around blockchain is all conceptual. There’s still a long way to go to actually bring it to fruition at an individual and enterprise level.” Still, “the growth potential is huge”, Mr Pan said. Government support of preferred industries in China can confer billions of dollars in cheap financing and other subsidies, and investors are always on alert for any sign of a new favoured sector. In this case Beijing laid out its intention to foster the development of blockchain. Mr Xi called it a “core technology” requiring China-led innovation, and called for more support and investment, the official Xinhua news agency reported late on Friday. Analysts say blockchain could help China overcome endemic trust issues by providing an unfalsifiable log of records for the supply chains of everything from vaccines to rice. The 10 per cent surge included shares in the internet arms of state-run news agency Xinhua and the Chinese Communist party mouthpiece People’s Daily, among other non-traditional tech stocks. The enthusiasm also reached Hong Kong, where investors sent shares in Meitu, best known for its photo beautifying selfie app, up as much as 29 per cent while Pantronics Holdings, which was acquired by Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Technology last year, soared as much as 62 per cent. Recommended The price of bitcoin rose by more than 30 per cent on Friday after the Xinhua report and held most of those gains on Monday. Nevertheless, Beijing has not indicated any relaxation of its strict ban on cryptocurrencies beyond its control, which has included shutting down exchanges and trading platforms and moving to halt cryptocurrency mining within China. The government has instead focused on rolling out its own state-backed cryptocurrency, with one central bank official indicating that the launch would be soon.,,Ryan McMorrow Nian Liu Hudson Lockett,2019-10-28T09:19:07.000Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/1a80e38c-d89f-4b34-92aa-9a98c39a6981,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,The average lifespan of a fiat currency isn’t 27 years,If that seems obvious to you, you are clearly not a bitcoiner.,A crypto news site ran an intriguing story last week, under the headline “Bitcoin Has Already Reached 40% of Average Fiat Currency Lifespan”. We could hear the tiny sound of your eyeballs rolling to the skies before you even got to the headline. The article had a video to accompany it and everything, and was pretty widely picked up by bitcoin bros (who may or may not self-identify as bitcoin bros) on Twitter, like by this guy: The Coin Telegraph article cites “a 2018 study by Dollar Daze” as the source for the story. But what is Dollar Daze, we hear you ask? Well, it appears to be an Anglo-Spanish blog that offers cutting-edge commentary on the dollar and sometimes crypto, like: Currently the general market has been changing and cryptocurrency calls have been changing the economy to be a new type of currency in which to bet. The dollar, as always has been the strongest currency in the world, and is being overshadowed by what cryptocurrencies are. But the “the average lifespan of a fiat currency is 27 years” idea has been showing up around the sillier corners of the internet for several years now. Economist and blogger JP Koning has done a brilliant job of finding exactly where this meme originally came from, and debunking it, in a comprehensive blog post last month. As Koning points out, the meme has been shared by a number of high-profile bitcoiners over the years, including bitcoin developer Adam Back earlier this year, and Barry Silbert, one of the biggest crypto investors. Indeed, as Koning pointed out on Twitter, Silbert’s Grayscale investment group even uses it in its promotional material: Koning worked out that the meme had first appeared ten years ago (so just after bitcoin appeared on the scene), from a post by a guy called Matt Hewitt on Dollar Daze that has since been removed (you can still read it, via the magic of the Wayback Machine, here). The 27 Club But is there any truth in it? Or did the author just decide that it would be kind of neat for “fiat currency” to join the 27 Club? First of all, it’s important to get clear on exactly what a fiat currency is, as there seems to be some confusion on this point. Bitcoiners tend to just use it as shorthand for central-bank-issued currency, but actually it’s a little more nuanced than that. Here’s Koning: Fiat currency is generally considered to be inconvertible money. It can't be redeemed for gold or silver. The world really only shifted onto a fiat standard between 1968-71 as the dollar ceased to be redeemed in gold. But Hewitt's list is replete with many metallic currencies (i.e. the riksdaler riksmynt). Are people using his data to make a claim about currencies in general, or just fiat ones? The meme isn't clear on this. But it does seem that Hewitt, the originator of the meme, did do some actual calculations to come up with the 27-year thing (albeit using some very selective methods). Hewitt claims to have counted 176 currencies that are still in circulation, and 599 that aren’t. Koning downloaded the full list to check Hewitt’s calculations. It turns out that you can indeed arrive at an average “lifespan” (more on that in a bit) of 27 years, but that’s only if you make one fairly significant omission. Yup, that’s right, it only is true if you leave out all 176 currencies still in circulation. So... just a little misleading, it seems fair to say. The other thing is that these 599 currencies that are no longer in circulation didn’t all just spontaneously combust, as the meme implies. Rather, they were actually deliberately replaced or ended for economic, political or social reasons. So the idea of counting up these currencies’ “lifespans” just doesn’t really make much sense. From Koning again: The list contains all of the pre-euro currencies (Dutch gulder, French franc, Italian lira, etc). These currencies had good reasons for disappearing: they were swapped for a new monetary unit. Existing currency holders weren't robbed. They were fairly compensated for this switch. Another example of monetary reorganization occurred in East Africa. From 1919 to the 1960s, Britain's former east African colonies relied on the East African shilling, produced by the East African Currency Board. When these countries gained their independence, the currency board was dismantled. In its place Kenya began issuing its own shillings at par with the old ones, as did Tanzania and Uganda. In each case, existing owners of East African shillings could convert their holdings into new currency. No wealth was being destroyed during any of these switches. But people who throw around the phrase the average life expectancy for a fiat currency is 27 years as a criticism of the very institution of currency are using the data in a way that implicitly assumes that the East African experience--and others like it--were negative. They weren't. There are also some other factual errors that Koning points out -- the whole post is worth a read. So by this stage, the 27-year life expectancy has been pretty comprehensively debunked. But what about the idea that bitcoin has now reached 40 per cent of that, because it’s “survived” ten or so years? That bit it also questionable. Has bitcoin actually successfully survived for ten years as a currency? One measure of success might reasonably be whether it has remained as one currency or whether it’s splintered off into different ones (because after all one of the things that gives currencies their value is some sort of scarcity). But bitcoin has “forked” into different versions of itself twice already -- into bitcoin gold and bitcoin cash, with the latter then splitting again to form bitcoin SV. So the people who originally backed bitcoin no longer agree on what the real bitcoin actually is. Adam Back might say it’s the thing most of us call “bitcoin” (ticker: BTC); Roger Ver would tell you it’s bitcoin cash (BCH); while Craig Wright would tell you it’s bitcoin SV (BSV). Another measure of success of a currency might be its continued use as a medium of exchange, and yet outside the dark net, the acceptance of bitcoin in commerce has dried up (and that was from an already low base). Furthermore, as we have said time and time again, bitcoin is not a currency. It fulfils none of the three key criteria for being a currency (serving as a unit of account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value). So comparing it to currencies makes no sense. As we have also said before, the fact that the battle cry of bitcoiners is HODL! is precisely why it makes no sense as a currency.,,Jemima Kelly,2019-10-24T05:30:10.102Z,

As a result, the cost of insurance is higher for all new drivers, even the cautious ones. This is changing, thanks to telematics. Companies such as Amodo, an insurance technology company, for example, facilitate recording driving behaviour via a black-box or smartphone app. Insurers can then offer motorists bespoke cover as well as advice on better driving. Data is sometimes dubbed “the new oil” for its economic value, and it is having a profound effect on business models and social behaviour. In a series of articles, the FT’s Intelligent Business report looks at the people and ideas behind the convergence of data and technology in business. We showcase the most interesting in case studies alongside the articles, and select a winner in each category. (A note on the methodology appears at the end of this introduction). The insurance industry is one of the first to feel the force of this revolution with the emergence of “insurtech”. The Intelligent Business report highlights the people and ideas behind the convergence of data and technology in business An example is the advisory firm Aon, which can now collect and analyse information on a business’s intangible assets, such as its intellectual property, allowing underwriters to offer cover based on facts rather than guesswork. Aon is also pioneering a registry for trade secrets in which information is not publicly patented but is kept strictly confidential. By having a value for their most private work, companies will be able to insure it. The public sector is also benefiting. Local government is rarely associated with technological prowess but on both sides of the Atlantic records and services are being digitised. Sonoma County, California, is in the process of delivering “whole patient” healthcare for vulnerable people by making records more accessible to the people who need to see them. In Britain, the city of Leeds is doing likewise. Legal sector disruption Convergence makes basic business operations more productive too. From managing legal expenditure to supply chains to commercial contracting, companies are gaining time and resources. Accenture, the consultancy, reckons it has saved 70 per cent on legal expenditure and slashed the cost of commercial contract drafting. Automating the contracting process is having surprising results: it is becoming more “human”. Companies, including Shell, have created visual contracts to make them less legalistic and easier to use. Professional bodies such as the International Association for Contract and Commercial Management, led by Tim Cummins, have analysed the data in thousands of contracts to create universal principles that are being used as modules to build documents that also improve commercial relationships. Mr Cummins is an example of how people working outside a sector, in this case legal, can disrupt it. Through the association, he defined the role of the commercial contract manager and so created a new profession. The legal sector is ripe for further disruption. Many young companies are poised to make commercial law more efficient. Some use artificial intelligence to do the first read of a mass of documents while others speed up and simplify the signing stage of transactions. Along comes blockchain One technology with big potential is blockchain. From tackling supply-chain inefficiencies to regulating city transport, companies and consumers are beginning to see the effect for themselves. The changes are blurring the lines between professional services: the Big Four, law firms and consultancies are entering new industries with new offerings. EY estimates that it has 160 blockchain-based proof-of-concept projects under way. In one case, the firm has worked with a software security company to set up Insurwave, a platform that captures real-time data to allow insurers to deliver flexible cover to shipowners. What makes the system so efficient and secure is blockchain. A professional services goliath such as EY can now act more like a nimble insurtech business. Expect to see other similarly fleet-footed partnerships in the years ahead. The Intelligent Business report highlights how the convergence of legal and professional services with data and technology is streamlining back office operations and transforming business models. Research to select the case studies and organisations featured in the report included a submissions and nominations process, market surveys and additional research and interviews. RSG Consulting conducted more than 300 interviews to assess case studies and organisations between June and October. The criteria used to select case studies were: peer, client and market commendations; impact on the business or market; and the degree to which companies demonstrated the convergence of legal services, professional services, technology and data.

It will be used to ensure that doctors have complete information about a patient to prevent misdiagnosis or patient abuse of prescriptions. Medicalchain has also joined with Mayo Clinic, the US medical research group, to use patients’ anonymised health records for medical research and to update historical studies. In June, DXC Technology acquired Luxoft, a digital transformation consultancy, to help it create blockchain solutions for common business challenges in industries such as healthcare, mobility and banking. One idea developed for a South African bank offers digital banking services to underbanked customers — people who otherwise rely heavily on cash. It had to be compliant with a “know your customer” regulatory requirement, which insists on extensive verification to reduce fraud. Using blockchain technology allows customers to complete verification checks at bank kiosks. This approach has been rolled out in other locations, including Vietnam, Bangalore, Chennai, Manila and Sydney. Law company Elevate has introduced an esignature capability — powered by Integra Ledger, the legal enterprise blockchain company — into its contract management process. The system, called Cael Contracts, provides a central, secure repository in which contracts can be sent for an esignature and returned, acting as a single source of truth for all parties. Using blockchain for this process creates an indelible record of the time, signatory and recipient at a fraction of the cost of other esignature service providers, it says. EY’s blockchain platform for the mobility sector, called Tesseract, was launched as a proof-of-concept project in 2017 to allow parties to manage and share ownership of autonomous vehicles. The system is scheduled to go live on November 1. The platform is designed for use by city and infrastructure providers, mobility companies and equipment manufacturers. Each party has equal access to use autonomous car-sharing services or commercial vehicles via the Ethereum-enabled platform, which allows users to share maintenance information and costs, based on individual usage. Banco Santander is a founding member of Alastria, a Spanish blockchain consortium with more than 500 members in business, education and the public sector.

The network has defined the role of contract managers as well as the process of contracting within leading corporations. Leyla Boulton Chair, judging panel Profiles compiled by RSG and FT editors WINNER: Tim Cummins President International Association for Contract and Commercial Management (IACCM) Tim Cummins is a self-taught commercial contract manager who has negotiated deals in the automotive and aerospace industries. He is a professor at Leeds University School of Law — even though he has never trained or practised as a lawyer. In the 1980s and 1990s, Mr Cummins led the development of business offerings and negotiations at IBM. He soon realised that an overhaul was required and set about creating market-friendly commercial contracting practices. However, as a comparatively junior employee he had little access to decision makers, so he collected data to make his case and set up a cross-industry, customer-focused benchmarking group. Mr Cummins went on to co-found Global Executive Business Services, and in 1999 he set up the IACCM, a not-for-profit network. Today the association has 60,000 members, representing 20,000 organisations. It sets standards for contract management and provides training and certification in best practice. Before the IACCM began, few people recognised commercial contracting as a profession but it has defined the role of contract managers and raised the profile of the process of contracting within major corporations. Akber Datoo Chief executive and founder D2 Legal Technology Akber Datoo founded D2 Legal Technology in 2011 after realising the importance of data-driven digitisation for in-house legal teams at major financial institutions.

Poppy Gustafsson Co-chief executive & co-founder Darktrace A mathematician and accountant, Poppy Gustafsson discovered her passion for start-up businesses while working in venture capital. When she co-founded Darktrace, she brought together Cambridge university mathematicians and professionals from GCHQ, the British government communications headquarters, to turn their ideas into a business. Six years later, Darktrace has an annual turnover of $1bn. One of the game-changing moves made by Ms Gustafsson and the Darktrace team was to understand, and persuade society to accept, that cyber security breaches are inevitable. Unlike other cyber security businesses, which defend the perimeter of organisations, Darktrace acts as a security camera looking at the inside of the business. Ms Gustafsson says the company owes its rapid growth to its willingness to challenge the status quo. For instance, she suggested that Darktrace recruit talent from social sciences and arts backgrounds — unusual for a technology company — and the move has resulted in a workforce that is 40 per cent women. Paul Hirner Executive chairman SimpliGov Born in South Africa, Paul Hirner worked as a dentist in Britain before moving to California to found his first technology company. In 2013, he used his experience in software development and building start-ups to found ThinkSmart, a no-code, automation platform to manage business processes. That company was bought by Mitratech last year, and Mr Hirner launched SimpliGov to enable the public sector to share the benefits of the digital transformation that is under way in business. SimpliGov has been used on a range of projects, from automating the trademark applications for the secretary of state in California to unifying social and healthcare provision in Sonoma County, California, It has also worked on the automation of forms that enable public servants to declare their financial records and so avoid conflicts of interest. SimpliGov has been used across numerous projects to improve efficiency in the public sector and the all-round quality of public services. Leanne Kemp Chief executive and founder Everledger Leanne Kemp is founder of Everledger, a start-up using blockchain, artificial intelligence, near-field communication and the internet of things to create more ethical supply chains for products such as diamonds and wine. Founded in 2015, Everledger seeks to improve transparency and confidence in the global markets for high-value products. A serial entrepreneur, Ms Kemp founded software provider Absoft Queensland, co-founded Fastcards — which became the national issuer of RFID (radio-frequency ID) cards — and founded the Great Australian Survey, supplying data for market research in Australia and New Zealand. Ms Kemp is in her second term as Queensland’s chief entrepreneur, supporting the development of the state’s start-ups. In addition she co-chairs the World Economic Forum’s global future council for accelerating sustainable production and is a member of the Global Future Council on blockchain. Ms Kemp works to understand the social and environmental effect of what is being called the fourth industrial revolution, and how to create healthy economic growth. Andrew Mellett Chief executive and founder Plexus Andrew Mellett is neither a lawyer nor a software engineer but through his career in corporate advisory he developed an understanding of the value of legal services in business — and realised that the relationship was not designed to optimise value. In 2011, Mr Mellett founded Plexus Legal in Australia as one of the earliest virtual law firms, with a combined offering of lawyers, technologists and engineers. He was a leader in what was to become known as “new law”. With Plexus Legal he created a model that came to disrupt the Australian legal sector by offering services that were fast, cheap and high quality — a combination that others found hard to beat. In 2019, Plexus launched a strategic global partnership with KPMG. The multinational accounting firm was one of the major investors in a series-A funding round of $4.65m, and the partnership will see KPMG offering legal services in conjunction with Plexus’s technology offering. Ajay Patel Chief executive and founder HighQ Solutions As a non-lawyer, Mr Patel was an unlikely founder of one of the very first successful legal technology companies but his time as a dealmaker made him realise the inefficiencies in the way that documents were handled in big transactions. In 2001, he set up HighQ, believing that the legal profession needed to become better at handling mass documentation and data. It took six years for Mr Patel to win his first client. Now, HighQ serves more than 400 customers, including over half the global 100 largest law firms. The company was recently sold to Thomson Reuters for £365m. HighQ was one of the first legal technology companies to offer software as a service and insist on delivering the product through a secure cloud-based platform. Mr Patel expanded HighQ’s suite of software and it became a leader in collaboration technology for the legal and regulatory market. For Thomson Reuters, HighQ is a key part of its drive to become a platform business, through which it can connect customers and suppliers with its other tech products. Andrew Sieja Founder and executive chairman Relativity Andrew Sieja, a college dropout from Detroit, founded KCura in 2001 after working as a computer programmer for multinational companies and consulting firms. Initially a consulting firm, KCura soon began to design technology solutions to improve collaboration and knowledge management in law firms. In 2007, the company introduced a legal discovery product called Relativity to help the industry handle the ever-increasing volume of legal data. The demand for the product led Mr Sieja’s team to shift its focus solely to Relativity, and the company changed its name to reflect this. Relativity is now valued at more than $1bn and it serves most of the top 200 US law firms. Now based in Chicago, the company is a global technology brand as well as being a key player in the city’s technology ecosystem. As executive chairman of Relativity, Mr Sieja is a leader in the field of ediscovery. His platform prizes collaboration, integrates with other software and provides a one-stop shop for ediscovery. Ram Vasudevan Chief executive QuisLex Ram Vasudevan first used a computer in the mid-1990s when he took at job to make money while studying for his MBA at Cornell University, New York. A willingness to try new things has helped shape his career. After a decade working in private-practice law firms on corporate transactions and mergers, he decided the process could be more efficient. In 2004, Mr Vasudevan founded QuisLex, one of the first legal process outsourcing companies, to tap into demand from corporate legal teams for cost-effective legal services. He quickly realised that to win over the sector, he had to offer services that would match the highest industry standards. Initially framed as a low-cost alternative to law firms, QuisLex now offers end-to-end business solutions, working with partners and in-house counsel as an extension of their teams. The business has helped clients automate non-disclosure agreements and other simple contracts, and recently developed a data strategy for large-scale AI-powered document review. ,,,2019-10-23T03:30:32.000Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/58642d44-d41c-11e9-8d46-8def889b4137,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Transformations in the supply chain,Precise technological records will benefit anyone who needs to keep track, from small farmers in Africa to buyers of diamond rings,In highlighting the barriers facing farmers in developing countries, especially women, Ashish Gadnis, a US entrepreneur, points to a flaw in the supply chain: the inability of smallholders to hold a record of transactions. Mr Gadnis says: “[No record] means she will never get good access to credit and she will be exposed to predatory lending; if she’s able to sell the barley, her husband or son may steal the cash.” This is where technology comes in, and BanQu, Mr Gadnis’s software company, is using blockchain to tackle the problems faced by people working in countries that suffer from a high level of poverty. One example is Zambia, where BanQu has joined drinks company Anheuser-Busch InBev to give smallholder farmers a record — accessible by mobile phone — of all their sales to the company. This enables them to build a business history, which in turn lets them secure loans and win contracts. With commodities paid for in the form of mobile money, their earnings are also safe from ill-meaning relatives. There are questions to be asked about who was involved in the making or the extraction of those minerals and gemstones The incentive to adopt new technology is often the efficiencies it supports. Shell uses Vakt, a blockchain platform backed by leading oil companies, to manage invoicing and scheduling. The system has saved users up to half their time and cut costs by 40 per cent compared with manual methods. BanQu increases efficiency, too, particularly with procurement. “Our team [can see] inventory throughout the supply chain in real time,” says Katie Hoard, global director of agricultural innovation at AB InBev. “It makes it easier to manage.” Digital technology also allows corporate buyers and consumers to discover more about the sustainability and ethics of their purchases. It can trace anything from carbon emissions to labour standards. At AB InBev, for example, BanQu’s platform means the company can be sure that farmers are paid properly for their commodities and that its training and agricultural products for use in farming reach the right communities. “This is a huge step forward,” says Ms Hoard. “It’s being able to understand where the resources are going and making sure they are getting to the people you intend to impact.” Blockchain is just one of several technologies being used to transform the supply chain. Another is satellite imaging, which makes it possible, for example, to track deforestation — where land is being cleared for agriculture. “We can build up a clear picture that makes it increasingly difficult to cover up illegal or poor practices,” says Renat Heuberger, founding partner and chief executive of South Pole. Mr Heuberger’s company taps into a range of data to create tools that help make supply chains more transparent, reducing both the risks they pose and their effect on the environment. It allows companies, governments and others to understand and tackle climate change-related risks. Leanne Kemp is founder and chief executive of Everledger, which uses “a symphony of technologies” to track and authenticate the origin of products such as diamonds, minerals, wines and high-value art. Ms Kemp says blockchain enables different parts of the supply chain to be linked. “Blockchain is the tissue that connects to sensors and scanning technologies to identify the object,” she says. “In the case of a diamond, it’s unique like a snowflake, so we can identify every single stone.” For Everledger’s jewellery industry clients, this means they can meet the demand for transparency from consumers. “Sustainability goes beyond carbon emissions,” says Ms Kemp. “There are questions to be asked about who was involved in the making or the extraction of those minerals and gemstones.” IBM’s Food Trust initiative uses the internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence and blockchain to capture and share information among growers, processors, wholesalers, manufacturers and retailers. “IoT is one additional source of data to be captured for sharing,” says Ramesh Gopinath, vice-president of blockchain solutions at IBM. “With all the data that’s captured, artificial intelligence makes sense of it. And blockchain is where you keep track of the information.” IBM’s technology makes it possible to reduce food waste and to identify the source of any contamination, meaning recalls are easier. Mr Gopinath argues, however, that technology alone cannot transform supply chains. “It is one enabler to get us to the nirvana of transparency,” he says. “But it is people and their willingness to share information that [will]play a big part.” The case studies below showcase combining data and technology in business operations. They were compiled by RSG Consulting. WINNER Golden State Foods & IBM Food Trust In October 2018, IT company IBM launched its Food Trust network, which uses blockchain technology to share information along food supply chains. Golden State Foods put the network to the test last summer by placing sensors in boxes of meat to monitor temperature and humidity as they were transported. Some boxes were also tagged with locator IDs and permitted users could monitor the shipment in real time. IBM Food Trust has completed 500,000 traces on food supply chains, according to the company, and users have seen 30 per cent less product loss and lower costs. AB In-Bev & BanQu Drinks company AB InBev joined BanQu, a blockchain platform provider, in May 2018 to improve transparency in its supply chain. Distributed ledger technology is used to trace how raw materials are sourced, focusing on individual farmers. AB InBev originally opened the blockchain to 2,000 Zambian farmers and 1,200 Ugandan farmers who supply cassava and barley. Since then, the scheme has added 10 more countries, including Brazil and India. BanQu reports that companies that adopt blockchain technology have seen average supply chain savings of 15 per cent and have halved their exposure to risk. Everledger London-based Everledger uses blockchain technology to track and authenticate the origin of seven types of valuable assets, including diamonds, wines and works of art. Founded in 2015, the company uses a digital ledger to see the asset at every stage of the supply chain. Everledger works with certification houses to give assets such as diamonds a digital thumbprint for authentication. The company works with global jewellery groups, including Taylor & Hart and Brilliant Earth, and has provided provenance for more than 2m diamonds since 2015. Shell and Vakt Vakt’s blockchain-powered platform for the crude oil industry went live in February. Oil company Shell has put all its North Sea trading transactions on to the platform to cover invoicing, contract and deal recaps and scheduling. The company reports that blockchain has saved users 30-50 per cent in time and 40 per cent in costs compared with traditional, manual methods. It ensures frictionless and accurate invoicing between suppliers. South Pole South Pole is a sustainability consultancy that advises multinational companies on how to reduce their carbon footprint in supply chains. Its BigChain tool uses cloud-sourced big data and satellite mapping to assess climate risk and how a company’s activity is affecting the world’s forests. South Pole says it has screened and advised corporate and individual investors for more than $2tn worth of investments.,,Sarah Murray,2019-10-23T03:30:31.000Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/e9f22342-d926-11e9-9c26-419d783e10e8,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,How smart tech could put a stop to wine fraud,Chainvine is partnering with winemakers and merchants to put an IoT device and a QR code on each new bottle,My wine collection runs to half a case of sub-£10 claret — if I don’t count bottles of the undrinkable and unthinkable left in the kitchen at parties — but even I could tell it apart from vin de table. So how is it that billionaire wine collector Bill Koch managed to spend $2.1m on 219 bottles of what turned out to be vin de kitchen table? Partly, it is because his priceless bordeaux and burgundy vintages had been expertly faked in the kitchen of fraudster Rudy Kurniawan, using genuine empty bottles, original corks and meticulously reprinted labels. And partly, it is because establishing the provenance, let alone price, of an asset that lies unseen for decades remains difficult, if all you have is a few uncorked bottles and reference books of old labels. Until now, that is. A company called Chainvine is using 21st-century blockchain and “internet of things” (IoT) technology to address a problem that is hundreds of years old — and seems to be getting worse. Since 2005, Koch alone has had to bring three major wine fraud lawsuits, one relating to four bottles that purportedly belonged to Thomas Jefferson, US president from 1801 to 1809, but proved rather younger. “Transparency and authentication of the supply chain has long been an issue in the wine industry, particularly the fine wine market,” says Chainvine co-founder Oliver Oram, “so the community has naturally been very supportive of our initiative.” That initiative, as he puts it, is twofold. First, Chainvine is partnering with winemakers and merchants to put an IoT device and a QR code on each new bottle. These codes are scanned by the vineyard, which adds the bottles to Chainvine’s blockchain database. When the bottles are first sold, the winemaker marks them as in transit. They are scanned by customs agents and government departments as they move along the supply chain. Then sensors in the IoT devices monitor the bottles’ subsequent locations and the conditions in which they are kept, including temperature and humidity. Once in the hands of a merchant, the bottles are scanned again and logged as part of the merchant’s inventory. Second, Chainvine can access data on older bottles in existing blockchain-enabled wine databases, as its system will work with any ledger. According to Paul Hammond, chief executive of merchant IG Wines, which trialled the Chainvine system, that means “the same information can also be collated from wines stored in clients’ cellars”. Importantly, the system allows wines to be marked as drunk, preventing the reuse of bottles or labels to fraudulently “recreate” and resell a rare vintage. “Thanks to the nature of blockchain technology, the provenance trail created is immutable,” says Oram. Recommended Investors as well as drinkers should benefit, thinks Ryan Hanley, managing director of blockchain-powered investment platform TokenMarket. He believes technology could make valuations more accurate. “Investment in wine can be depressed due to concerns around provenance; there are horror stories of fake bottles filled with cheap plonk being sold as grand wines. If potential investors can see where the wine was made, when it was sold, for how much, they are in a much better position to make a decision on the true value.” However, just like a bottle of Domaine Ponsot Clos Saint-Denis Grand Cru 1945 — the non-existent vintage that proved Kurniawan’s undoing — Chainvine’s database might seem to have the right contents, but it still needs a market in which to operate. “Widespread adoption of such a platform will require participation from multiple players,” admits Oram. Rival technologies could also limit take-up of the Chainvine system. Hanley points out there is already a similar system called WiV that uses a blockchain ledger to record each time a wine is sold and for how much; investors receive tokens that represent the wine digitally. A whisky equivalent is offered by a company called Oak Group One. More traditional wine investors than the flamboyant Koch — who has had chandeliers and Roman mosaics added to his Florida cellar — might not even see a need for high-tech reassurance. Philip Moulin, fine wine quality and authentication manager at London-based merchant Berry Bros & Rudd (founded 1698), suggests a ledger of provenance could help when buying rare wines at auction. “Blockchain-based traceability will come into its own with secondary market stock,” he says. But drinkers and collectors who buy directly from merchants probably wouldn’t see any incentive to sign up, he concludes: “If dealing with established merchants, buying directly from source, it is largely irrelevant.” Still, Chainvine thinks its tracking technology should appeal to anyone seeking “frictionless trade”. English winemakers worrying about their post-Brexit exports should be among those raising a glass to that. bad news for the sellers of private jets, yachts, watches, holiday homes and all else advertised within the pages of the FT Wealth magazine: the net worth of the world’s 265,490 “ultra” rich people fell for the first time in three years in 2018, according to data provider Wealth-X.

https://www.ft.com/content/3018c2e2-f4af-4077-a9bd-0f33f2ecf7ca,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,YouGov’s “blockchain-based” sell-your-own data platform makes no sense (*update),,*We have updated this article after a response from YouGov CEO Stephan Shakespeare. YouGov, the London-listed polling and market research company, has diversified its offering in recent months, in a (successful) effort to generate more revenues. It is now focusing less on traditional market research activities, and more on “real-time data analytics” — ie data that is served up in some kind of intelligible and useful format as soon as it is generated. Over at FT sister publication Investors Chronicle earlier this month, Alex Hamer spoke to YouGov chief executive Stephan Shakespeare about this strategy shift, and specifically about the company’s new “YouGov Direct” division. This, the company says, “empowers consumers with greater control of their data and creates the opportunity for them to obtain fair value from its use”. Or, to put it another way, here’s Shakespeare (from Alex’s piece): It lets you do things that would be creepy, if it wasn't for the fact that actually the person selling it is wanting to do that. Sounds great, doesn’t it? Well as you’d expect, like all great new things, YouGov Direct also happens to be blockchain-flavoured. “But Y tho?” we hear you ask, in exasperated unison. From the company’s website: We used blockchain technology to support YouGov Direct because it helps to tackle many of the challenges we see in the audience data market. It turns permission (or consent) into a verifiable audit trail of transactions that can be referenced by businesses to provide GDPR assurance and creates complete transparency of data use from data subject (consumer) to data user (advertiser). But, we’re confused. We thought the whole point of a blockchain was that it is tamper-proof? How could data held in perpetuity on a decentralised blockchain possibly be GDPR-compliant, given that one of the key elements of the new(ish) EU regulation is the right to be forgotten? (Indeed, we have written about this precise problem before.) Shakespeare got in touch with us to explain how the information held on YouGov Direct is GDPR-compliant, because personal data is not in fact held on their “blockchain”; instead, he says the record shows only an encrypted ID, value, and the type of data used, adding: All users have the right to be forgotten, which can be done by request or using the delete button within the app. All personal data is then deleted. The block that remains records only that a transaction happened between a user and an organisation, its value and the type of data used. YouGov Direct does not store personal data on the blockchain. So unlike in a regular blockchain environment -- where nothing can be deleted because i m m u t a b i l i t y -- with the YouGov Direct platform, deleting your personal information is as simple as, um, pressing delete. But that’s not meant to happen. Blockchain is meant to be an append-only system -- once data is in, it’s in (whether or not that data is to be trusted, which is one of our main criticisms of the distributed dream-ledger). The reason this can happen in this case is that the YouGov Direct blockchain doesn’t appear to really be a blockchain. Alex put this to Shakespeare, saying that what he was in fact describing was an internal company system rather than a distributed ledger, at which point he was told (emphasis ours): It is a blockchain; it's not a public blockchain. As we expand this, we're going to do something some of us have done, which is to have three or five hosts that are like academic institutions or whatever that are trusted. If you actually distribute it to hundreds or thousands, it becomes highly inefficient. As you know there are still unsolved problems with bitcoin and so on. How you make it efficient as a system, it's got a lot of friction in it, this is frictionless pretty much, and you get all the advantages, after all we're not dealing with money, this isn't a money system. What you want to do is know that this can't be tampered with, and if you have five hosts for the data, and they're all trusted institutions you're going to trust it. Shakespeare said a similar thing to us directly, adding that the “semi-private blockchain model” they were moving towards (at the moment their blockchain is totally private) “is the same model that many of the world’s biggest financial institutions and companies (e.g. IBM) have chosen to use”. But just because other companies are are doing the same thing, that doesn’t make it a good idea. We don’t think private blockchains -- or semi-private ones, for that matter -- make sense. The whole point of a blockchain is the idea that by having a distributed network of computers processing and recording data, it can’t be tampered with. The point is to “disintermediate trust”, to use the jargon. But YouGov isn’t doing that; in fact users need to put their trust in the company itself to maintain the records, or, in the future, in “three or five hosts that are like academic institutions or whatever that are trusted”. Academic institutions (“or whatever”) aren’t inherently more trustworthy than any other establishment (in fact sometimes, quite the opposite). Also, if you’re just going to use a few academic institutions to provide the “trust” element for your empowerment-via-selling-yourself platform, why do you need to do so via a blockchain? If these institutions can be trusted, there’s no need for a blockchain — the blockchain bit is meant to obviate the need for trust. If they can’t be trusted, then having them in control of the whole database seems like a bad idea.

https://www.ft.com/content/eb5cf045-1ea1-3b54-80cd-e9f8c8287f08,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Tether slammed as “part-fraud, part-pump-and-dump, and part-money laundering”,,We knew there was a shitstorm coming Tether’s way because over the weekend, we were sent a press release by the company telling us that “Tether Anticipates Meritless and Mercenary Lawsuit Based on Bogus Study”. And, as expected, that faecal vortex arrived Monday, when a class-action lawsuit was filed against Tether, Bitfinex (a sister crypto exchange), and a handful of others. The suit was made public on Monday, having been filed on Saturday in Court of the Southern District of New York by Vel Freedman and Kyle Roche. Notably, they are the same lawyers who recently (and successfully) sued Craig Wright on behalf of Ira Kleiman. For those who don’t know, Tether is a “stablecoin” — ie a digital-only currency whose value is pegged to the dollar — that is used by crypto traders to get in and out of positions quickly on exchanges. It has long been alleged, by critics such as blogger Bitfinex’ed, that Tether is used to manipulate the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. And that’s precisely what this lawsuit is alleging. The plaintiffs don’t pull any punches (emphasis ours): This action concerns a sophisticated scheme that co-opted a disruptive innovation — cryptocurrency — and used it to defraud investors, manipulate markets, and conceal illicit proceeds. Part-fraud, part-pump-and-dump, and part-money laundering, the scheme was primarily accomplished through two enterprises — Bitfinex and Tether — that commingled their corporate identities and customer funds while concealing their extensive co-operation in a way that enabled them to manipulate the cryptocurrency market with unprecedented effectiveness. They also present a pretty eye-popping estimation of the scale of the damages: Calculating damages at this stage is premature, but there is little doubt that the scale of harm wrought by the Defendants is unprecedented. Their liability to the putative class likely surpasses $1.4 trillion US dollars. !! The plaintiffs’ central allegations have been made by many others before them: that Bitfinex and Tether have printed billions of dollars’ worth of Tether tokens to artificially inflate prices, in turn convincing the market there was rapidly growing demand for cryptocurrencies: Tether issued extraordinary amounts of unbacked USDT to manipulate cryptocurrency prices. Because the market believed the lie that one USDT equalled one US dollar, Bitfinex and Tether had the power to, and did, manipulate the market on an unprecedented scale to profit from boom-and-bust cycles they created. This, they argue, “created the largest bubble in human history”. Tether, of course, “vigorously disputes the findings and conclusions claimed by that source, which rely on flawed assumptions, incomplete and cherry-picked data, and faulty methodology”. The company also insists that “all Tether tokens are fully backed by reserves and are issued pursuant to market demand, and not for the purpose of controlling the pricing of crypto assets”. However, as the class action suit points out, until February this year the company’s website continued to say that every USDT (Tether) token in circulation was “backed 1-1 by traditional currency held in our reserves”. Then suddenly in March, when under criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice, the CFTC, and the New York Attorney General, Tether changed it to say that every USDT token was “1-1 pegged to the dollar” and “100% backed” by reserves that “from time to time may include other assets”. And then in April, Tether’s own lawyer was forced to admit in court that the stablecoin is only 74 per cent backed by cash and cash equivalents. The plaintiffs write: If there was any doubt before, it’s now absolutely clear that Tether no longer has cash reserves to back USDT at a 1:1 ratio. The Bitfinex and Tether Defendants engaged in unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading acts by omitting, or failing to disclose the material fact that USDT was not backed 1:1 and that the market demand created by the Bitfinex and Tether Defendants was fraudulent. The Bitfinex and Tether Defendants’ deceptive practices were consumer-oriented aimed at manipulating the cryptocurrency market and thereby transfer wealth from consumers to themselves. This should be an interesting one to watch.

https://www.ft.com/content/1ac5ebc3-b3a9-308d-b85e-2f1d7d11811e,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,A radical plan to slash cross-border payment costs... with subscription fees,,We live in a world in which we’re constantly being told that payments should be “frictionless” and free, and should move around the world as seamlessly as information moves around on the internet. So it comes as something of a surprise when, in 2019, you’re sent a press release about a company that actually wants to do the opposite of making cross-border payments frictionless and free, and instead wants to charge a monthly subscription fee for the privilege of being able to partake in them. In other words, a company that wants to make payments sticky. Introducing Sokin, a “global cross-border payments firm” that wants to disrupt the $689bn global remittances market when it launches in early 2020. But Sokin also plans to charge users £9.99 a month (or a roughly equivalent rate in other markets, Netflix style) to send an unlimited number of payments abroad, which it says will be settled instantly. From the press release: On average the cost of transferring money across international borders is 7%, according to studies by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Koncept Analytics*. Sokin will significantly reduce this cost for all users. For example, using Sokin, the fee for sending four £200 international transfers a month from the UK to Argentina would be 53% less than current ‘best in market’ providers claim they can offer. As Sokin is a subscription-based service with no mark-up or hidden transaction fees, transferring more money, or increasing the number of transfers, will not increase costs for consumers. So if, as in the example above, you’re spending £18.85 a month on remittance fees alone, Sokin might be able to help (if you’re spending £9.99 or less on fees, it’s obviously useless). But that’s if the company can get the same rates as this “best in market” provider it’s comparing itself against. Sokin says that it offers “better FX rates than the market”, but that sounds a bit unspecific. They don’t say they will be able to offer interbank rates for all these currencies the way Revolut and Transferwise do (during currency trading hours, ie 24 hours a day from Monday to Friday). And Sokin will be accessing the 30 currencies it offers via 15 global exchange partners, some of which they say are banks but not all, and so will have to depend on these partners for their rates. Even if there are no “hidden fees” no mark-ups from the rates set by those exchanges, there might well be large bid-offer spreads involved, and the customers will bear the brunt of those. There’s also the issue of how customers who don’t have bank accounts will be able to pay the monthly subscription fee -- remittances, after all, are often sent by migrant workers who don’t have bank accounts in the countries they are working in. There are an estimated 8.4 million unbanked adults in the US, for example, which is responsible for the vast majority of the $36bn that gets sent annually to Mexico. Also, a monthly commitment of £9.99 seems like quite a lot for many people in some of the countries Sokin want to operate in. The company says its pricing will vary a little according to each country, and that their “pricing model is modelled on established subscription models across the globe such as Netflix or Spotify”. They gave the example of South Africa, where Sokin will be charging ZAR 129.99, or £6.94. But in a country where the average annual salary is £13,500, or £1,125 a month, before tax, that still sounds pretty expensive. But does it really blockchain? As with any nice new payments solution, all of this is served with a little sprinkle of blockchain fairy dust for good measure. From the press release (emphasis ours): Sokin will be available via an app or online. It will allow users to be verified and checked quickly and rigorously, and then enable them to move funds between over 150 countries instantly via blockchain, distributed ledger technology. This also provides a high degree of transparency, and a very simple and secure process for clients. Regular readers will know that we’re not the biggest fans of the distributed technicolour dream-ledger, so we asked Sokin’s CEO, Vroon Modgill (who was previously CEO at crypto card firm Wirex) how the blockchain will enable the instant transfer of fiat money, given that fiat money doesn’t run on a blockchain, and he said that bit of the press release was actually wrong. Ahem. It looks like the enabling-instant-transfers-via-a-blockchain bit was just an attempt at getting some good PR then (they’re not the first). Modgill does say they are using blockchain technology, however, in the “back end”, by using R3’s Corda platform for “transaction monitoring” and also, perplexingly, “data privacy”. (Corda has actually said it is not a blockchain, but anyway.) So all in all, we’re not convinced. Sokin reckons it is “revolutionising the archaic world of international remittances” but the thing is, other companies are trying to do that too, but without extracting a monthly charge. That’s not to say offering zero-fee cross-border payments will prove a sustainable business model for companies, like Revolut, currently offering such services. So we understand where Sokin is coming from. It is prudent to try to find some way of making customers stick around. But a subscription model is unlikely the way to go. Unlike Netflix, Spotify, or Amazon Prime, remittances aren’t a luxury, but a lifeline. The reason they’re often paid in several monthly instalments rather than in one go is because of the way the people sending the money abroad get paid. If they’re not sending through one monthly remittance payment every month, they’re unlikely to be the kind of people for whom one monthly subscription fee is going to work -- i.e. people with a stable monthly salary. And if they are only making one monthly payment, the £9.99 (or local equivalent) fee is probably not going to be worth it.,,,2019-10-07T05:00:01.546Z,

Yes, that’s billion with a capital B. The Cayman Islands start-up had no live product at the time, which reminded Alphaville of a company that raised money during the South Sea Bubble “for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is”. The money was raised in the form ether, according to CNBC. The price of which has come down significantly since last year. Which brings us to news from the SEC overnight: The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced settled charges against blockchain technology company Block.one for conducting an unregistered initial coin offering of digital tokens (ICO) that raised the equivalent of several billion dollars over approximately one year. The company agreed to settle the charges by paying a $24 million civil penalty... ...Block.one did not register its ICO as a securities offering pursuant to the federal securities laws, nor did it qualify for or seek an exemption from the registration requirements. Block.one consented to the order without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings. We’re not sure about you, but a civil fine of $24m for raising billions of dollars outside of security law strikes us as pretty damn pathetic. It does beg the question; what’s the incentive for a company to conform to securities law if a slap on the wrist is all that’s going to come of it? We’d venture: there isn’t much of one at the moment. But whatever, we’re sure the public will go on believing in the integrity of financial markets regardless. It’s not as if, a decade or so after the financial crisis, it still has a reputation problem. We asked the SEC about the fine, and we’ll update the article if we hear back from them.

https://www.ft.com/content/93140eac-9cbb-11e9-9c06-a4640c9feebb,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Blockchain: disillusionment descends on financial services,Too many projects started with the technology rather than the solution,Blockchain was going to make banks irrelevant and allow the world to “be [its] own bank”. Then, it was going to help those very same banks save tens of billions of dollars a year in infrastructure costs, transform the way they process transactions, and create new revenue streams. Some even claimed it would be bigger than the internet. But despite a great deal of excitement — and an even greater number of press releases — the technology has not lived up to its promise and there are signs the hype is fading. Blockchain is the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. It is, in effect, a database system that records and processes transactions via a distributed network of computers, with no need for a centralised entity to verify them. At various points since its inception more than a decade ago, enthusiasts have claimed that blockchain could replace central banks, wipe out post-trade intermediaries like clearing houses, and become the backbone of cross-border payments. (And that is just in banking — outside the financial sector the claims become even more grandiose, with the technology purportedly having potential to cure cancer and bring about world peace.) The financial services sector has ploughed huge amounts of money into blockchain, totalling some $1.7bn a year, according to research firm Greenwich Associates. And yet, so far, beyond the wild and volatile world of cryptocurrencies, blockchain has had little to no discernible impact. Would you try to open a can of beans with a sledge hammer, or a machine gun? You could do it, but would you want to? Germany’s Bundesbank spent two years working with Deutsche Börse building prototypes for blockchain-based securities settlement. Yet earlier this year, the president of the central bank Jens Weidmann said “a real breakthrough in application is missing so far”. Outside of blockchain, the broader world of fintech has started to have a real impact on the financial sector, forcing banks and other firms to bring their technology — and their user experience, in particular — into the twenty-first century. One of blockchain’s biggest problems is that it was approached badly. Rather than beginning with the challenges banks were trying to solve and then seeing whether blockchain could be applied to them, too many projects started with the technology, tried to discern how to make money from it, and worked from there. “Blockchain’s failed promises could be a mandatory class in business school for how not to build a sustainable organisation,” says Tim Swanson, head of market intelligence at blockchain company Clearmatics. He adds that, in most cases, entrepreneurs have just recast the same market, but with their technology the centre. Now, a degree of disillusionment has set in. A couple of years ago, when cryptocurrencies were booming, blockchain panels at fintech summits and other financial conferences were packed to the rafters, but these days they attract smaller crowds. “The hype of the last few years, followed by the disappointment that many people are feeling now, is evidence that you need to understand the problems that need to be solved and then look for an answer, rather than throwing a technology at business problems before you’ve understood them,” says Martin Walker, director for banking and finance at the Center for Evidence-Based Management. Now, what Mr Walker calls “blockchain fatigue” has also chipped away at the PR value that the word once bestowed on any company that attached itself to the technology. Digital Asset Holdings, for example, was once considered a leading player — with its former chief executive Blythe Masters seen as a flag-bearer for the technology. It had planned to transform the world of securities settlement, but has since pivoted away from blockchain. Instead, it is focusing on “smart contracts”, a kind of computer programming function that does not require blockchain to work. Digital Asset Holdings now talks about “distributed ledger technology”, or DLT, rather than blockchain. The terms are often used interchangeably, but Colin Platt, an independent cryptocurrency and DLT consultant who previously worked on blockchain projects at French banking group BNP Paribas, says there is a key difference: in a blockchain, everyone on the network can see all the transactions, whereas with DLT that is not necessarily the case. For the latest news and views on fintech from the FT’s network of correspondents around the world, sign up to our weekly newsletter #fintechFT Sign up here with one click For Mr Platt, while there is not much use for blockchain in the world of finance — even a so-called “permissioned blockchain”, where the number or parties who are allowed on to the network is limited — there could be some uses for DLT, such as for interest rate swaps and other derivatives, because they do not have one obvious trading centre. But, he adds, these new tools will not come quickly and are unlikely to be earth-shattering. “I don’t believe that I’ve ever seen a case where a blockchain — that shares everything with everyone — in a permissioned sense was justified,” he says. “But I’d argue [that] for the things that may need a DLT, we haven’t given it enough time.” For now, DLT has yet to prove itself and blockchain’s graduation into the mainstream remains a pipe dream. Even if you could use blockchain to run some banking processes, there is usually a better, quicker, cheaper and more efficient way to do so. “It’s not so much what’s wrong with the technology, it’s just that the tool has to fit the problem,” Mr Walker says. “Would you try to open a can of beans with a sledge hammer, or a machine gun? You could do it, but would you want to?” The intermediary is still providing genuine value / From Robert Shooter, London, UK,,Jemima Kelly,2019-09-24T03:34:09.000Z,

https://www.ft.com/content/80a985cd-a16b-37db-bcd3-dfcb83eadef9,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,When bitcoin bros talk digitisation,,Arch-bitcoin bro Anthony* “Pomp🌪️” Pompliano is known for espousing the merits of bitcoin and berating the failings of the traditional financial system to his more than quarter of a million Twitter followers. He teaches them about the difference between dollars moving electronically and digitally (?); he tells them that “if you don’t believe in bitcoin, you’re essentially saying you don’t believe in cryptography” (!); he even goes so far as to provide them with dictionary-style definitions for words and phrases they might need in their everyday lives (/ˈevriˌdeɪ laɪvz/): On Wednesday, it was time for him to tackle a big one: financial assets. You know, those bits of physical paper you pass around between each other that represent shares in companies, or tradable IOUs, that you’re always a bit concerned about losing in a fire. Or those barrels of oil you keep beneath your desk that you’re always worried might exacerbate that very same fire. Well fear not, because Pomp has a solution for you: That’s right. In the future, asset allocators will no longer have to lug those barrels of oil and bars of gold around. And that can only be good for bitcoin, right? The only thing is, as John Paul Koning pointed out to Pomp (or worse, pointed out to his followers via the dreaded quote-tweet), the digitisation of assets is already upon us, and has been for quite some time: When bitcoin bros evangelise about “digitisation” or “tokenisation” of assets (basically the same thing as digitisation except you turn them into tokens that are native to a particular blockchain), they seem to have forgotten that we are already living in a world “where the internet gradually consumes everything”, as Tom put it earlier. But still. Maybe we can at least trust Pomp to tell us when some “bitcoin rocket fuel” has hit the market, like yesterday, when he broke the news that the Fed had cut interest rates. Here’s the price move since the rate cut: (If you are extra-curious and wondering why there’s a sudden drop in the price right around 4am UTC, we would encourage you to stop wondering.

https://www.ft.com/content/a381d0ae-9b6e-3540-97bb-9d733677f05f,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Blockchain goes extra-terrestrial,,An other-worldly blockchain press release crash-landed into the our inbox this week. It contained some somewhat sigh-enducing sentences such as: SpaceChain’s vision is to remove barriers and allow a global community to access and collaborate in space. And: Ultimately, it will mean that there will be more opportunities for businesses/start-ups in the UK/EU to participate in the space economy, thanks to blockchain. And: SpaceChain is a community-based space platform that combines space and blockchain technologies to build the world’s first open-source blockchain-based satellite network, allowing users to develop and run decentralized applications in space. (Not, apparently, for all those times you’re hanging out in space trying to develop and run decentralised applications, but rather for those times you’re hanging out on Earth thinking: “I’d like to run a decentralised application in space”.) But this doesn’t look like just another rip-off crypto project that’s about to rush off into outer space with all your money. SpaceChain has just announced that it has received funding from the European Space Agency, no less, under the agency’s “Kick-start Activity” funding scheme. Just 60,000 euros, but still, this is Europe’s answer to NASA. Also the company’s CTO is the well-respected Jeff Garzik, one of the early bitcoin developers. So we thought it would be worth trying to find out what this is all about. The Singapore-based company says that its purpose is “to bring more security to the transmission of digital currencies and smart contracts by using a distributed satellite network and multi-signature transactions”. Ie, it’s about making those famously “unhackable” blockchains even more unhackable, by putting some of the nodes (ie the connection points sitting inside computers that do the processing and maintaining of the transaction records) into space. SpaceChain says it has “launched and flight-tested two blockchain nodes into space in the past 12 months”, which are still orbiting Earth (!) and has even got what it says is a geospatial tracking feature that lets you watch the node orbit the earth in real time. We thought launching a satellite was quite expensive, and probably outside the budget of a project like this. But according to Garzik, there has been “an exponential drop in the cost of access to space”, with “nanosatellites” like theirs being launched via “ride-sharing arrangements” (that’s rocket-ride arrangements, FYI). The cost of doing this launching these 10cm cuboid nodes into space is therefore (rather perplexingly): Under $1M per launch, trending towards under $300k. As for the reason for propelling these objects into Earth’s orbit, Garzik explained: Having the node in space makes physical access to the node highly improbable which reduces possible attack vectors, and independent space-base power supply and connectivity makes the blockchain infrastructure more robust. So maybe this all seems legit, after all? Gives “when moon?” a whole new meaning? It’s worth pointing out here that even though SpaceChain didn’t do a regular ICO, it did run a “private sale” of its tokens for institutional and accredited investors (which is what many in cryptoland now do because it gets you round pesky regulators’ complaints about selling to unwitting retail investors). The token is now worth about a quarter of a cent on crypto markets, having crashed by a, er, astronomical 99.5 per cent from a peak of almost 50 cents back in the crypto-manic days of early 2018. So moon might have to wait another day. But even if the project is legit and didn’t rip off retail investors, that doesn’t mean it’s not silly, and indeed we can’t help feeling it’s all a little gimmicky. We thought the whole point of a decentralised distributed ledger -- and the geographical diversity inherent in that -- was to make attack vectors highly improbable. Also, the idea is to create a multi-signature cryptocurrency wallet -- ie a crypto wallet that requires the signature of multiple private keys before funds can be transferred -- and for some of those of those private keys to be held in a satellite in outer space. But what happens if the satellites get damaged? Or if there’s some technical problem? Or if some bad actor attacks or takes possession of the satellites? They have a solution for that. Per the release: The funds in the wallet remain safe even in the event of a connectivity failure due to the fact that the two ground-based signatures can still complete the transaction. Ah yes. So you don’t actually need the extra-terrestrial satellite, but it’s nice to have it. SpaceChain isn’t the first blockchain project seeking to go extra-terrestrial -- far from it. There have been a whole host of projects competing to advance blockchain in space, like Nexus, BitSpace, Spacebit, to name but a few. It’s also not the first company to think of putting a satellite into space to safeguard against earthly attacks -- a company called Cloud Constellation raised $100m at the end of last year to launch a network of data centres built on satellites in orbit, saying it was “eliminating the risk [of data breaches] associated with terrestrial infrastructure”. But we can’t help wondering why the biggest cloud providers in the world, like AWS or Mircrosoft Azure, whose very business models depend on not having data breaches, reckon that having a geographically diverse network of data centres on boring old Earth is secure enough. Attack of the 50-foot Blockchain author David Gerard sounds about as convinced by SpaceChain as us, anyway: The idea is a dumb ICO idea of the sort that sounds like it was composed by sticking pins into a dictionary. The amazing bit is that they seem to be serious about it. I mean, good luck to them, but still nothing about this makes any sense. We’ve updated this story since being told how much it does actually cost to launch blockchain nodes into outer space.,,,2019-09-18T14:37:00.987Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/6363036a-d597-11e9-a0bd-ab8ec6435630,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Deutsche Bank joins JPMorgan-led blockchain network,IIN aims to speed up cross-border payments by using technology behind cryptocurrencies,Deutsche Bank has signed up to the financial services industry’s biggest blockchain project, in a move that will lower costs at the German bank and give global heft to a system created to speed up cross-border payments. The JPMorgan Chase-led Interbank Information Network (IIN) will this week announce Deutsche as a new recruit to a network of 320 banks which have agreed to swap information on global payments over blockchain, the mutually distributed ledger technology behind cryptocurrencies. Their goal is to free payments from the lengthy and costly delays that affect around 1.5 per cent of cross-border payments by making information about the transfers instantly accessible to every bank in the payments chain. Most of IIN’s existing members are banks who use JPMorgan as a correspondent bank to process dollar payments on behalf of their clients. Deutsche is the world’s biggest clearer of euro denominated payments. “A network that only has JPMorgan’s clients will have very big natural limitations,” said Takis Georgakopoulos, head of payments at JPMorgan. “It would mean that all of these other smaller banks would still need to have bifurcated procedures, what they do with JPMorgan and what they do with other banks would still have to be different.” Recommended “Having Deutsche join — and hopefully Deutsche will be the first of several other large banks — is going to help us drive towards ubiquity and ubiquity is a pre-requisite for the success of the network.” Transaction banking, including cash management, is one of the only remaining sources of global strength for Deutsche after a July restructuring signalled swingeing cuts to its investment bank. Ole Matthiessen, who has headed Deutsche’s cash management division since March, said the IIN would allow his bank to offer better services to their clients, and would lower the cost of processing difficult payments. “Our competitors are not just the other banks, it’s also new players in the market, we need to become efficient enough to provide seamless real time and digital process,” Mr Matthiessen said. “It [joining IIN] is definitely directionally a very important step for us because it will help drive [customer] satisfaction” Recommended Mr Georgakopoulos said IIN was saving JPMorgan both time and money, by allowing them to resolve within hours issues that would previously have taken two to 16 days. The efficiencies come because IIN puts all the information about a given payment on a mutually accessible ledger, allowing anomalies to be resolved quickly with less manual effort. Mr Matthiessen said Deutsche could also benefit from other potential uses of IIN, like using it as a platform for banks to share know-your-customer checks. So far, more than 65 banks have gone live on the system and another 255 have signed letters of intent, well up on the 75-plus banks who were signed up to IIN a year ago. Mr Georgakopoulos said IIN was on track to reach its target of 400 agreements by the end of the year and expects to announce other large banks “imminently”. The IIN is one of a number of initiatives aimed at speeding up the global payments system, including Mastercard and R3’s blockchain-based cross-border platform and the admission of blockchain firms to the traditional global interbank messaging system Swift. “If there was a global new payment system that included all of the banks and was all digital then yes probably [IIN] would be redundant,” said Mr Georgakopoulos.” It’s just we are very, very far away from that.”,,Laura Noonan,2019-09-15T10:40:08.000Z,

They know a thing or two about cryptography; they know how money is moved electronically across the world; and they know more than most about multiple interlocking positive feedback loops. But more than anything else, they know how to spin a “this is good for crypto” story when they see one. In our inbox this week, for example, an email with the subject line: “BoJo helps Bitcoin rediscover its mojo”, in which we’re presented with some incisive commentary from Nicholas Gregory, CEO of crypto outfit CommerceBlock, in the form of a list of short, punchy, copy-and-pastable, already-quotation-marked remarks. We prefer using quotations that we’ve got from actual conversations, so we imagine that we are in conversation with Mr Gregory. “It’s no coincidence that Bitcoin has risen as the Pound has gone south.” Umm, OK, but surely it is the very definition of a coincidence, sir? The UK only makes up a small fraction of the global bitcoin trade and FX is a zero-sum game: when the pound goes south, other currencies go north on a comparative basis. And the pound has rebounded by almost 3 per cent since you sent that email on Tuesday, while bitcoin has also risen. The correlation you allude to appears to have broken down remarkably quickly. Could you explain?  “BoJo has helped Bitcoin rediscover its mojo.” Ah, well you didn’t answer my first question but I’ll let it go. Could you elaborate on this one perhaps? The punchy quotes are nice but I don’t seem to be able to understand what on earth you are are talking about? What has BoJo got to do with bitcoin? “A no-deal Brexit, which is looking increasingly likely, could trigger a major breakout for the world’s leading cryptocurrency.” Oof, OK you’ve got me on this one -- the thought of any kind of major breakout gets me feeling all excited! But could you explain how this series of events could come about? What’s the logic here because I’m not seeing it? “If the UK leaves the EU on Halloween, Bitcoin could not just surge but gain a longer term, more sustainable momentum.” Ah right. So is this a Halloween thing? A surge AND sustainable momentum, you say? Wow. What would sustain it? “The prospect of no-deal is already wreaking havoc across major fiat currencies, but if it happens we could see an unprecedented rally in Bitcoin with a surge past $20,000 a real possibility.” I don’t meant to repeat myself, but I must make sure you realise that fiat currencies are a zero-sum game. If the prospect of a no-deal Brexit is wreaking havoc across some major fiat currencies, it will be doing the exact opposite to other major fiat currencies. So what you’re saying doesn’t actually make sense. And whence, pray tell, did the $20,000 figure come from? “An increasingly populist and politically unstable world is cementing the safe haven status of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more generally.” Ah, we’re back to the old idea that cryptocurrencies, those famously stable and un-hackable strings of 1s and 0s, are a safe haven. OK fine I give up now bye. By Thursday, it was time for the crypto bros to have another stab at making some news waves. It came on the back of this tweet from Bloomberg cybersecurity reporter William Turton. It’s a tweet about the US’s National Security Agency (NSA), which Turton reports is working on building quantum resistant cryptography — i.e., code containing algorithms that are resistant to attacks from quantum computers. But within a matter of hours, the tweet had turned into a quite different story in Forbes. The article has unfortunately since been deleted, but Turton did manage to get a screenshot of the story: “NASA to develop a quantum resistant cryptocurrency”. Yes, NASA. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Because sending humans to Mars and defending the planet from asteroids is kind of cool and all, but crypto! To be fair to the bros, crypto is these days more often used as an abbreviation for cryptoliabilitiesassets than for cryptography, to the chagrin of cryptographers worldwide. The second-most common use of the abbreviation is probably the faecal parasite known as cryptosporidium. So you can’t blame them for getting confused. But it does seem a little hasty to have written a whole news article, which was then followed by other crypto outlets, on the basis of a sentence of fewer than 260 characters that someone had somehow managed to misinterpret in two different ways. You could try to make this stuff up. But if you did, it wouldn’t be nearly as good.

FT Alphaville is here to assist you with your media coverage.,Axios has a story out today entitled “Andrew Yang gets media cold shoulder”, in which the US news site points out that despite the presidential hopeful polling in the top six ahead of the Democratic primary, the media isn’t giving him any love. Take a look at this graphic, which stacks the Democratic candidates up against one another: This comes after a Twitter campaign last week under the hashtag #YangMediaBlackout, in which Yang’s supporters -- the #YangGang, obvs -- complained about the low level of coverage being given to Yang, after both CNN and MSNBC appeared to forget that he existed. Or, worse, deliberately sidelined him because of his lack of experience in politics. Honestly, we at Alphaville can’t see what could possibly go wrong with putting a New York entrepreneur who’s never held political office before into the White House. So as always, we’d like to offer a helping hand. You see Yang hasn’t wasted his life schmoozing with political donors or climbing up the greasy pole of Washington power. Instead, he’s a former tech executive who is taking what Reuters has described as a “technocratic approach” to politics. And as part of that, naturally, Yang wants to harness the power of, you guessed it, the blockchain -- or, as we like to call it, the distributed technicolour dream-ledger. Just like our own Spreadsheet Phil before him, who last year said blockchain was “the most obvious technology” for solving the Irish Border problem, the techophantic Dem reckons blockchain can make voting “fraud-proof”. From his website: It’s ridiculous that in 2020 we are still standing in line for hours to vote in antiquated voting booths. It is 100% technically possible to have fraud-proof voting on our mobile phones today using the blockchain. This would revolutionize true democracy and increase participation to include all Americans - those without smartphones could use the legacy system and lines would be very short. Yang’s idea is that Americans, rather than queueing up for hours outside voting booths, should be able to vote via their smartphones, with the verification of their personal identities somehow magically carried out via the power of the blockchain. The only problem with that idea is that blockchains don’t verify people’s identities (thank God). You need some kind of centralised authority to do that, which is exactly what blockchain is meant to get rid of. And how would one make voting “fraud-proof” by using a blockchain? A blockchain might do an OK job of keeping data secure once it’s been put into a database (although that depends on whether it’s a permissioned or permissionless blockchain, and whether the entities that are verifying the data are motivated not to interfere with it), but as we’ve said many times before, it can’t magically ensure that the data being put onto it is accurate in the first place. And traditional centralised databases can also keep data secure. Also, people have already tried throwing blockchain at voting systems, and it hasn’t gone too well so far. One month before the Moscow City Duma election (coming up this Sunday), the blockchain voting system that had been designed for the event was broken in the space of 20 minutes by a French security researcher. Yang also has a whole section of his website devoted to cryptocurrencies, in which he says the government should be “support(ing) innovation and development”, because “the blockchain has vast potential” (sigh). He also bemoans regulations in the US that “make it difficult for the US cryptocurrency markets to compete with those in other jurisdictions”. (Meanwhile renowned regulators like Malta's seem to be doing an exceptional job of competing with other jurisdictions.) Ah well. At least Yang’s only jumping on a tired old bandwagon, rather than doing anything truly absurd like rolling out a line of marijuana-themed merchandise. What’s that you say -- he’s selling a T-shirt emblazoned with “Math. Money. Marijuana.”!??!?! Well, we’re happy to have done our bit, anyway.

And yet, just as Digital Asset is also finding out, it turns out that attracting funding for blockchain-based development is far easier than delivering an actual viable and usable product to market. The rollout of the company’s flagship “Corda Enterprise” system has allegedly been plagued by delays, frustrating insiders. But, according to The Block's Isabel Woodford on Wednesday, the discontent might be much more far reaching than just that: Sources close to blockchain giant R3 say its engineers and senior management fundamentally disagree over the future of Corda; its flagship enterprise product Among the concerns are Corda’s design and development approach, which are reportedly creating a cultural gulf Others say these tensions speak to a human problem seen across the enterprise-blockchain space and blame the so-called “three-year itch” endemic among engineers for R3’s recent exodus As well as complaints about company culture and concerns about Corda’s viability, The Block notes that an internal group chat reveals engineers have lost faith in the tech, saying it lacks scalability and “doesn’t perform well”. Engineers have also complained about the five-figure monthly bills R3 has to pay for cloud services, undermining viability even further. Confirming Alphaville’s longstanding suspicion that most blockchain enterprises have massively overhyped their ability to revolutionise banking clearing and settlement infrastructure, The Block goes on to note the key riff underlying much of the discontent applies potentially to the entire sector. This, they note, is a cultural conflict between those bringing blockchain enterprises to market and the engineers working on delivering the products being promised. From Woodford, with our emphasis: The first issue is design; what Corda is and the ultimate vision. Sources suggest R3 is struggling to decide its identity, spreading itself “too thin” from being a financial software firm to a broad tech consortium. They also note frustration at the lack of ambition and clarity over what sort of blockchain Corda is trying to be – if indeed, it is intent on DLT. Specifically, there are reportedly divisions between those seeking interoperability and those within management who they call Corda “maximalists,” which has alienated some groups. As a result, there are also concerns that the product will not offer viable efficiency gains for the wide array of businesses being targeted. Engineer sources told The Block that R3 is finding it hard to manage or support its growing client base, insinuating the company is flogging software that isn’t fully baked yet. A former employee at R3 client ING*, meanwhile, told The Block that the bank was not seeing the value creation for the money it had spent to engage in a five-year revenues agreement for an unlimited number of Corda Enterprise licenses. That the factional dispute seems split between stuffy banker types focused on delivering returns and efficiencies, versus engineers who are more interested in playing around with innovative disruption than delivering financial returns, speaks volumes about the clash of cultures in the sector. It also speaks volumes about the impractical nature of a lot of the innovation in the crypto space at large. Sources FT Alphaville reached out to confirmed much of the above, citing that for a lot of in-house engineers Corda still feels like an engine without a car -- powerful but not very useful. Other informed sources implied R3 may well have run out of money by now had it not been for the sizeable settlement it received from rival Ripple over its claim that the latter had not honoured an option agreement to allow R3 to buy Ripple’s cryptocurrency tokens at a massively reduced price. *Update: 15:47: ING has got in touch to say the following: “We do not recognize the statement made in this article and it does not reflect ING's opinion. R3 and ING have a strong partnership and we are involved in the development and deployment of multiple CorDapps. Technology development continues and we regard Corda one of the leading enterprise DLT platforms.” Related links: Digital Asset Holdings’ pivot raises doubt over blockchain future - FT Blockchain officially confirmed as slower and more expensive - FT Alphaville,,Izabella Kaminska,2019-08-22T03:30:35.964Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/12a9dfaa-a0f3-3369-a9c5-72263e4633a2,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,When bitcoin bros talk cryptography,“If you don’t believe in bitcoin, you’re essentially saying you don’t believe in cryptography.”,You might remember that last month, chief bitcoin bro Anthony Pompliano — better known as “Pomp” — had a go at talking global finance (it didn’t go terribly well). This time round, the crypto fund manager talked cryptography. You know, that old practice of using codes (where words and numbers are converted into different words and numbers) and ciphers (where a message is converted on a letter-by-letter basis) in order to protect, or “encrypt” secrets. A practice that dates back to roughly 1900BC, when some unusual hieroglyphs were carved into the wall of a tomb in the Old Kingdom of Egypt. Modern cryptography is, of course, a little different, as it uses computers to generate and crack the codes and ciphers. It dates back 100 years or less, depending on how you want to measure it, with great advances made during World War II. It wasn’t until 2008, however, that some elements of cryptography — public-key cryptography, specifically, which was invented in the 1970s — were combined to create bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto (whoever he or she or they is or are or was or were) wasn’t creating any new cryptography, but was simply combining a number of existing bits of it. Such as a “hashing” function called SHA-256, designed by the US National Security Agency around the turn of the millennium. And the “Hashcash” proof-of-work system, designed in the late 1990s as an anti-spam measure. Fast-forward to 2019 (h/t Ed Salazar for drawing our attention to this) and earlier this week Pomp — who has over half his net worth in bitcoin — talked to CNBC about bitcoin as a “safe haven”. He argued that it was “irresponsible for institutions to not have exposure to this asset”. (Ahem.) When one of the CNBC journalists put it to Pomp that just because bitcoin is scarce that doesn’t necessarily make it valuable, as “there are a lot of things that are scarce that nobody cares about”, Pomp said: Of course. Look, if you don’t believe in bitcoin, you’re essentially saying you don’t believe in cryptography. Have a watch for yourself here (and count the seconds it takes for the others to recover from his comment, around the 4.33 mark): There is absolutely no connection between “believing” in cryptography and believing bitcoin is a good place to put your money. Maybe Pomp should go back and read some pieces from our archive to see why it might not be all that responsible to put your life savings into bitcoin. Because if you don’t believe in FT Alphaville, you’re essentially saying you don’t believe in words.

Lucky Warren Buffett.,A sudden bout of the kidney stones attacks young Justin Sun.,On Thursday, the famously crypto-sceptical Warren Buffett was due to lunch with a bunch of crypto bros. That’s because, as you may remember, 29-year-old Justin Sun, founder of the TRON crypto-token (which raised $70m in an ICO in 2017) and CEO of BitTorrent, won the annual charity auction to have a lunch with the Oracle of Omaha. His winning bid was over $4.5m. Sun had been hoping he was going to school the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on crypto. He’d even invited Donald Trump to join the party, after the president tweeted that he was “not a fan” of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But as of Monday, it seems the party is off — for the time being at least. Mr Sun can no longer make it, because he’s apparently suddenly come down with a spot of the old kidney stones. Ouch. From the official TRON Twitter feed late on Monday: It appears the TRON bros weren’t that convinced about the kidney stones. Or if they were, took them as a bearish signal. At pixel time, TRON is down 16 per cent since the announcement (screenshot from Coinbase; red circle helpfully showing the time of the tweet from us): Sun invited a number of industry heavyweights to the lunch but not everyone was so keen to come to the party. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, for example, didn’t make any kind of public response to Sun’s invitation, while Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said he couldn’t make it because the lunch — which was set to take place in Silicon Valley, in a change from the normal New York steakhouse — was “too far”. That had invited criticism from cryptoland that Sun’s promise to bring "#blockchain industry leaders” hadn’t come to fruition, with crypto podcast host Peter McCormack calling the number of people who’d declined the invitation “quite impressive”, according to Cryptoslate. So maybe the kidney stones were brought on by worries about the quality of the guest list? Or, perhaps, they were brought on by worries about getting out of the country. According to various people on Twitter, Weibo reported that Sun had been issued an exit ban by Chinese authorities just before the kidney stones announcement: We have contacted TRON for confirmation of these rumours and will update the story if and when we get it.

That wonderfully terrible idea that seems to get trotted out every couple of months or so, almost as if it were designed simply to bait us block-pained folk here at FT Alphaville? The first person to make the idea famous, of course, was none other than Chancellor of the Exchequer Phillip “Spreadsheet Phil” Hammond himself, who said the magical distributed spreadsheet was the “most obvious” solution to the tiny issue of the Irish Border. This time, it’s the turn of the nation’s (least?) favourite provocateur Rod Liddle, whose new book on Brexit, The Great Betrayal, suggests blockchain could solve “almost all” the problems of the Irish Border. (H/T Ben Munster over at Decrypt Media for drawing our attention to this, via a Guardian review of the book, which calls Liddle’s blockchain-solutionism “childish”) So we headed on over to Google Books for a quick preview. We counted eight instances of the word blockchain. Take a look at this excerpt from the book: Borders today are not so much geographical as rooted in time. The movement of goods and people does not need to be physically checked at the point of entry: there are a multitude of ways around the problem. But the government seemed either uninterested in them or utterly ignorant of them. Blockchain technology, for example, is used to keep a record of transactions in various cryptocurrencies, but is increasingly deployed by big companies to keep track of goods travelling to and fro. Ah yes that old “big companies are increasingly using blockchain” trope. But at least the good people of the island of Ireland now know that the border that divides them is these days not really geographical at all, but rather rooted in time. Blockchain should help that. He continues: What did the government know about blockchain?... Asked about the problem of border relations with Ireland, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, said: “There is a technology becoming available… I don’t claim to be an expert on it but the most obvious is blockchain.” The insouciance and the ineptitude amaze. Why aren’t you an expert on it, Phil? Is there nobody in your department who it an expert on blockchain? Yeah Phil. Why didn’t you bother becoming an expert in cryptography and distributed database systems when you decided to become a politician? And why isn’t someone at the Treasury a crypto coder? The ineptitude of it all! (To be fair, the former chairman of Phil’s party, Michael Green Grant Shapps, was chairing an all-party-parliamentary committee on blockchain, but he stepped down after Alphaville found out he had a secret pay deal with a... blockchain company.) Then we get to the bit where Rod implies blockchain can solve “almost all” the problems surrounding the Irish backstop (parentheses his; emphasis ours): Both Leo Varadkar and the EU negotiating team stuck fast to the notion that technology would not solve the Irish question, it could only be solved by the UK ceding ground and agreeing, in effect, to a customs union with the EU. This was, of course, a convenient line for them to hold as it places the pressure on the UK -- and held it was until the spring of 2019, when Varadkar suddenly admitted that technology (basically blockchain) could solve almost all of the problems surrounding this “backstop” business, except for maybe the transportation of livestock. Brussels agreed — but the UK was still miles behind the curve. Yeah, Leo. Why didn’t you just admit that this intensely sensitive political, social, cultural, religious, economic and historical issue could be solved with blockchain? Coz technology IS blockchain after all. For anyone curious about the Irish border actually looks like, here’s a picture of a part of it, taken by our FT colleague Philip “Blockchain Phil” Stafford himself, on a recent visit: See? Just stick a blockchain on the other side of that stone wall there. Job done.

Now blockchain wants to financialise, fractionalise and dematerialise art. Put another way: data are getting artisanal. To explore how art, finance and data are becoming inextricably connected, Vaudeville will feature artist Simon Denny, one of the art world’s most fascinating cultural commentators on data, tech and systems. Denny, in case you do not know, is the man who brought blockchain to the Serpentine (including installations on Blythe Masters, Vitalik Buterin and 21). He’s also the man who put Peter Thiel into a Lord of the Rings board game and an offline cryptokitty replica into a physical bubble, with the help of an art collective-turned-blockchain-map/urban-development company called FOAM. His latest (subterranean) exhibition is called Mine and is being shown at the unique Museum of Old and New Art in Berriedale, Tasmania. It explores the relationship between human agency, data and exploitation; you can read about it here. For more about Denny and his work see this beautiful film produced by Artsy: Now consider what the imitable feedback loop that links Adam Curtis, Alphaville and Simon Denny might deliver... Limited tickets for Vaudeville, which takes place on July 26, 7pm at Wilton’s Music Hall, are still available.

https://www.ft.com/content/7d6b5bfe-9323-3a6a-b7f4-0fd1b63f9dc8,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Facebook fights back against Libra criticism,(And against Alphaville specifically, it would seem.),Facebook's David Marcus, co-creator of the data-harvesting site's new stablecoin, Libra, put up a post on Wednesday. In the post, soberly titled “Libra, 2 weeks in”, Marcus responds to some of the questions and “misunderstandings” the Zuckerbuck has elicited from various quarters since its launch half a month ago. But we couldn't help but take it a little... personally. As most of you will know, Alphaville is currently running a series on Libra called Breaking the Zuck Buck. It's fair to say that so far, we have found Libra wanting. And it seems Facebook has noticed. Marcus starts off with a big one for us, given that we made our position on the blockchainless nature of Libra clear as soon as Facebook's embargo was lifted, and have since added to that: Under which he provides the following “answer” (emphasis ours): (And if you thought that last bit sounded a bit like something Nick Clegg would have come up with in his “look I'm going to come clean about this” tone, you could be on to something. He does now work at Facebook.) Marcus asked the question himself but doesn't seem to have really answered it: is this really a blockchain? We've argued the fact that the Libra Blockchain doesn't feature a chain of blocks — which you'd think would be important — but is rather a “single data structure” means it's not a blockchain. But it seems Marcus has a different idea of what blockchain means. If his definition is that it is “open” and “decentralised”, as he in some ways implies in the question, then he does kind of answer it, but as you can see above, the answer would be... no? Unless, if we really want to give him the benefit of the doubt, Marcus's definition of blockchain is that it is quite decentralised and quite open. (Although even then, the idea that 100 “industry-diverse organisations” running nodes is “quite decentralised” is all very well and good, but there have been only 28 organisations announced so far, including Facebook.) If that's his definition, however, then the world of blockchain suddenly gets a lot bigger. Isn't Uber quite decentralised and quite open? Is Uber a blockchain? Isn't a bank whose API can be plugged into also quite decentralised and its ownership structure also quite decentralised because anyone can buy its stock? Is a bank a blockchain? And you can't answer the question of “is this a blockchain?” by saying “there are more decentralised blockchains available” but Libra will “gradually decentralise” further over time. To go back to an analogy from our last Libra blockchain post, you don't answer the question of “is this a loaf of bread?” by saying “there are other more baked loaves of bread available but this loaf of bread will strive to gradually become more baked”. The question wasn't “are you as baked as other loaves of bread?” The question was “are you a loaf of bread?” Moving on. After a small paragraph on why there isn't already a charter in place for the Libra Association, Marcus answers “You talk about financial inclusion a lot, but can Libra really address this critical issue?” (emphasis ours): At this point it is worth giving you a little refresher from an excellent post from Brendan on why Libra will not help the unbanked: So yes. Someone did indeed write that a key reason for people to be unbanked is that they feel they don't have enough money to make it worthwhile for them to be banked. But that someone wasn't just writing an “opinion”. That someone was citing a survey from a federal US agency, in which the unbanked themselves said the main reason they didn't have banking was because of not having enough money. And that someone also pointed out that the “unbanked” is too vague a term to be useful, as the unbanked in the US and the unbanked in the developing world are likely to be unbanked for completely different reasons. In rural Rwanda, you might be unbanked because you live nowhere near a bank and nobody around you uses anything other than cash. In inner-city America, you might be unbanked because you don't want the system to know about you — you might work in the grey or black market and don't want to have to start paying taxes or be tracked. Or, as Brendan pointed out, because you don't feel you have enough money to make having a bank account feel worthwhile. (Also: have you ever been forced to pay an “exorbitant fee” just to transfer money to someone in a different country? It's worth remembering here that Marcus was formerly the president of PayPal.) Marcus continues with his answer: Again, we've spoken about this idea that Libra can lower costs before. It is extremely unlikely to do so. As we've already seen, Marcus tells us that literally anyone can “build services like wallets, or merchant acceptance”. Why would those third parties suddenly start providing services for free — what would the motivation for them providing services if they are not charging for it? That whole paragraph carries a whole load of assumptions that suggest that Libra cannot “address this critical issue”. Marcus's final paragraph attempts to answer: “What’s in it for Facebook? Why are you doing this now?": Hitler, Stalin and Mao, of course, were also mission-aligned around the concept of economic empowerment. And while, David, we hope you will continue to engage with us — and we're glad you have been reading our stories — we have to disagree with your assessment. In fact we wonder, David, if you have considered that free market forces impose frictions in the transfer of value between jurisdictions for a reason? Notably because the varying standards and values of nation states — especially in terms of law, regulation and trading rules and standards — organically impose such frictions. As the original white paper by Pierre Werner that brought us the euro noted as far back as 1970: Which is to say, even the architects of the euro — for all the flaws that have since been recognised in the euro system — understood at the point of planning that a frictionless (and thus cheap) monetary system could not manifest itself in a system of heterogeneous nation states with differing policy approaches to law, trade and immigration. They, unlike Facebook, understood that the harmonisation of states and standards had to come first if the transfer of value between regions was to become easier (even if they under-appreciated how difficult that would be due to the reluctance of some peoples to subsidise even in a largely harmonised system). Which is why we still think this seems to be mostly all about Facebook, and making financial services work better for.... Facebook. Thank you!

https://www.ft.com/content/bf32dadc-a0b9-35e4-9d41-0798fb5caa8a,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Wha-Tether could be going on with the bitcoin price?,Clues are everywhere (even in the title).,Two-and-a-bit weeks ago, Alphaville moderated a panel at a crypto conference on crypto exchange "market integrity and consumer protection" (which, as we were quick to point out, felt a bit like a contradiction in terms. We're still not sure that was a good way to warm up the crypto crowd). Two of the panelists had the audacity to wear bitcoin socks. They hadn't even co-ordinated their outfits. They were just wearing bitcoin socks. In 2019. This felt bullish. The conference itself was also quite buzzy (albeit in the typically slightly unhinged crypto way). One of the offensive-sock-wearing panelists, from crypto exchange Kraken (who was also wearing a #reckless cap) decided to tell the audience, after we'd said a few times that we didn't think exchanges were doing enough to protect consumers, that "bitcoin IS consumer protection". This, unlike our comments about the paradox inherent in the panel's title, seemed to go down very well with the crowd, who broke out into rapturous applause, and then continued to do so at every word the young offensive-sock-and-cap-wearing panelist uttered. When the panel was finished, the "chief growth officer" at Binance, generally thought of these days as the world's biggest crypto exchange (although it's hard to know for sure because the entire economy is Fyre Festival and exchanges make up report their own volumes), was mobbed by fans wanting selfies with him. It was almost like bitcoin was... cool again? But yet, outside of this surreal crypto conference and the even more surreal #cryptotwitter-sphere, nobody seemed to be talking about it. We know it's a bit of a basic -- in the modern sense of the word basic -- move to paste Google search trend charts into articles (particularly because TEEIFF) but here's a Google search trend chart pasted into an article (for worldwide searches for bitcoin over the past five years): As you can see from the chart, interest in bitcoin has crept up a little in the past month or so, but not that much. Nothing like it did in 2017. But if you look at a chart of the bitcoin price, things do look a bit like 2017 (screenshot from CoinMarketCap, which aggregates the prices across several exchanges): Bitcoin hit as high as $13,850 last Wednesday, having surged about 75 per cent in the space of two weeks. It's now fallen sharply again-- it's trading around the $11,000 mark at pixel. But that still represents an almost quadrupling in the price since the start of the year. So what gives? Could it be, as some have claimed, because of the great invention that is Libra? Well that might be helping a bit on the margins, just because it's helped to get "crypto" back in the headlines, but it's not the main thing going on here. As we have pointed out many times now, Libra is neither a cryptocurrency nor decentralised and neither does it run on a blockchain. Also, bros at crypto conferences might be getting excited at numbers going up, but the retail interest -- from the kind of people who might have got drawn in by "crypto" headlines in 2017/18 -- just isn't there this time. Or could it be that old chestnut about bitcoin being a "safe haven", as Chinese media declared it to be towards the end of last week? Er, no. Bitcoin shows basically no correlation with "risk-off" market episodes and is also neither safe nor havenish. Ben Munster of crypto site Decrypt wrote an article last week that offers some clues as to what in the name of Satoshi is going on. Because the other thing that has happened over the past month or so is that almost $1bn worth of Tether, the original "stablecoin", has been printed. Its total "market cap" now at about $3.6bn, having almost doubled since the start of April. This, of course, is the same Tether that is being sued by the New York Attorney General's office for allegedly using its reserves to cover up $850m of funds on sister exchange Bitfinex. Munster's piece explains in detail how huge orders of new Tethers are made by "whales" (AKA a small group of big-money traders) just before the price starts to go up, and then dumped onto exchanges. But the particularly noteworthy thing about the piece is that the person innocently doing the explaining is Will Harborne, founder of Ethfinex, a subsidiary of Bitfinex, which is being sued alongside Tether by the NYAG. (Coincidentally Harbone was also one of the people on our panel, though obviously as an ETH bro he was one of the two not wearing bitcoin socks.) From the piece: With that in mind, here's another chart that looks a little different to 18 months ago -- one from Blockchain.info, showing bitcoin trading volumes in dollars (the big spike is in late 2017/early 2018): According to Blockchain.info, about $417m worth of bitcoin was traded on Friday on the main dollar-based exchanges. Which sounds decent until you notice that about $37bn worth of Tether was traded on Friday, according to CoinMarketCap. A post published on Medium late Friday, by Sussex University Professor Carol Alexander and PhD student Michael Dakos goes into some more detail, and features a nice chart showing the supply of Tether versus the bitcoin price over the past few months: Bitcoin blogger and Attack of the 50-foot Blockchain author David Gerard indicated to us the manipulation of bitcoin via Tether is so obvious that it's an insult to tulips to compare bitcoin to such phenomena: We have contacted Tether and Bitfinex for comment and will update this story if and when they respond. In the past, Bitfinex representatives have insisted to Alphaville that the expansion of tether supply is entirely linked to authentic buying interest. In some cases, however, tethers are also originated into reserves in anticipation of demand as well.

https://www.ft.com/content/7414d28a-7d52-11e9-8b5c-33d0560f039c,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Blockchain is no silver bullet against the black market,More technology is needed to link the product purchased with the record on the ledger,LVMH is set to launch a blockchain-based system to authenticate goods and satisfy the trend for conscious consumerism by giving customers the “life story” of their products. The French multinational said it would soon launch its Aura initiative, which it calls “the first global luxury blockchain”, although no specific dates were shared. LVMH will start using Aura with the Louis Vuitton and Parfums Christian Dior brands, it said, before rolling it out to its other houses and offering it to rivals. During manufacturing, each product will be given a unique digital code that is recorded on the Aura ledger. When a customer makes a purchase, they will in theory be able to access an online certificate that provides an entire history of their product including its origin, components, environmental and ethical information, and care instructions. The idea is that it will replace clunky and slow paper-based documentation. Many industries are looking at the possibility of using blockchain, the distributed ledger system that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The idea is that because blockchains are immutable and decentralised, the data stored on them is trustworthy and secure. In theory, the technology should help conscientious customers understand the provenance of their purchase and know it is genuine. But blockchain cannot detect whether a set of data is false: rather, it makes sure that once data has been recorded, it cannot be tampered with. Moreover, additional technology is needed to link the product purchased to the record of it on the blockchain. So while it might be an opportunity for jewellers to promote responsible supply chains, blockchain is no silver bullet. You can falsify whatever you want and put it in there — just because it is on a blockchain doesn’t make it right . . . blockchain is not able to filter for nonsense “Louis Vuitton offers a new service to its clients by unveiling the story behind their products,” said LVMH when it announced the project at the Paris VivaTech conference in May. “Every step of the item’s lifecycle is registered, enabling a new and transparent storytelling.” The company declined to comment for this article. The hope in the jewellery sector is that blockchain will give increasingly scrupulous customers a full product history quickly and efficiently. “Conscious consumerism is a mass movement under way across a number of different . . . markets, not just luxury goods,” says Leanne Kemp, founder and chief executive of Everledger, a London-based company that uses blockchain to track and authenticate the origins of diamonds and other valuable products. The company works with certification houses to create unique digital thumbprints of diamonds, which are then written on to the Everledger blockchain. It is particularly important for luxury companies and their customers to prove the provenance of their products. This is not just because they cost so much, but also due to the fact that some products, such as diamonds and gold, have been associated with unethical practices. “Tracking the supply chain generally is a hot topic,” says Rosie Burbidge, an intellectual property partner who specialises in blockchain at law firm Gunnercooke. “For LVMH in their jewellery that uses diamonds, being able to prove that those diamonds are conflict-free and haven’t been used in some sort of terrorist funding is really important.” But apart from helping to provide conscientious customers with a “life story” of their purchases — and, for the more sceptical observer, providing brands with good PR — blockchain is also seen by some as a way to combat counterfeiting that is rife in the luxury goods industry. The EU Intellectual Property Office estimates that the jewellery and watches sector loses €1.9bn in revenue each year thanks to counterfeit products. This year it launched the Anti-Counterfeiting Blockathon Forum to test and develop blockchain-based solutions for what it called the “global plague” of counterfeiting. “The problem LVMH will be trying to solve is a problem for their customers — how to prove that a specific object originated in their factory and providing a chain of title which, in the event of a dispute or suspicion of fraud, a user or investigators can straightforwardly audit,” says Preston Byrne, a specialist in cryptography and an attorney at Connecticut-based Byrne & Storm law firm. Aura, which was developed alongside blockchain design firm Consensys and Microsoft, is not the only blockchain system developed specifically for the luxury goods industry. IBM is leading a consortium of diamond and jewellery companies with a blockchain project called TrustChain, while watch company Vacheron Constantin, De Beers Group and Tiffany & Co have all launched their own blockchain initiatives to prove the provenance of their goods. While blockchain technology allows you to check information has not been altered, it cannot ensure the integrity of the information recorded in the first place. Furthermore, because it is immutable, if false information is put on to a blockchain, it will remain there in perpetuity. In other words, the technology has a “garbage in, garbage out” problem. “You can falsify whatever you want and put it in there — just because it is on a blockchain that doesn’t make it right,” says Tim Swanson, founder of US-based tech advisory firm Post Oak Labs. “The blockchain has no ability to filter for nonsense.” Recommended It is unclear why luxury houses need blockchain technology. They could give customers a product “life story” using a more straightforward tracking system that includes measures to keep the information safe, for example through standard encryption. Blockchain also cannot link the physical product to the one recorded on the ledger. Ms Kemp says other technology, such as artificial intelligence, is needed to achieve a fully digitised supply chain and to create “digital twins” of the physical products. These would then act as a reference point against which to check the blockchain information. Perhaps, by encouraging a focus on the provenance of items and looking at the best ways to tackle counterfeiting, blockchain will help in the search for solutions to these challenges in the luxury goods sector. But it might be that the technology is just another chance for brands to boast, as LVMH does, that “innovation is our obsession”.,,Jemima Kelly,2019-07-01T03:30:37.000Z,

https://www.ft.com/content/acb17ed4-a66a-317e-bf20-60c2c5facb39,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Why closed-loop systems like Libra won't change the world,SWIFT gets right to the point.,It's T+4 since Facebook revealed details of its audacious plan to take over the global monetary system with a cross between a weirdo multi-currency-board type thing and a global digital reserve. Facebook is insisting the system is decentralised because “blockchain”. And that it's fully universal and democratic because, erm, “blockchain”. Alphaville, if you hadn't noticed, isn't so sure. Questions not yet answered include: 1) Would people banned from Facebook be able to use Calibra (the Facebook subsidiary that plans to offer payment services using Libra to users)? 2) Would people banned by Facebook — in the envisioned fully permissionless future of Libra — be able to acquire limitless nodes and thus potentially influence the network? 3) Would Facebook be free to rehypothecate assets acquired with customer deposits? And if so what risks does this pose? 4) Does anything stop Facebook from one day changing the rules about redeemability and/or the degree of collateralisation? But another central point being missed by many commentators is that as it stands Libra (and other cryptocurrency global currency replacement aspirants), are merely closed-loop systems. For a bit of background about the difference between closed and open-loop payments systems, and the reason why credit is usually preferable in the latter, see here. On that note, we'd like to highlight the following points recently raised by Swift in an outline of their vision about how payments of the future should work (H/T Frances Coppola for bring this to our attention). With our emphasis: You can think of closed-loops as mini sovereign zones. Yes, payments can be quickly and easily facilitated within those zones because everyone in them is subject to the same autocratic overseer and thus theoretically the same trust base. They're great if the overseer has large reach. But the problem which eventually emerges is that, ultimately, nobody wants a market dominated by just one payments overseer who can dictate what value gets to be transferred and to whom, and what can't. Furthermore, in a free market nothing stops another entity from launching a competing closed-loop system anyway. While we can agree that competition is a good thing in that context, the problem with multiple closed-loops running side by side is that due to their intrinsic competitive nature (and different approaches to whom they let into their zones and how they manage risk within them) they don't interoperate easily. The inherent frictions between closed-loop systems (multiple sovereign states) is what brought about the need for open-looped solutions. Sticking with the sovereign metaphor, opened-loop systems engineer the illusion of frictionless transfer with effective multilateral “trade agreements” between all participant closed-loops systems in their network (which in the past included banks). The sovereignty clue was always in the name Visa. Once standard-based agreements have been forged between closed-loop “states”, all the respective members of those states can easily passport in and out of each other's zones. It's the equivalent of the free movement of people, but in money terms, based on the notion that everyone in the open-looped system is signed up to some basic common principles with respect to how they manage risk and who they are, and are not, prepared to bank. Hence why it's often difficult for challenger closed-loops systems to gain access to such multilateral transfer zones, especially if they're coming to market on the basis they've found a way to bank people other closed-loop systems might avoid. The closed-loop/open-loop barrier exists on a national level, but it's obviously even more pronounced on a cross-border basis. That's because on an international level it's not just a varying business model that undermines the uniformity of the respective interoperating closed-looped systems. It's also law, the manner in which the law is enforced, culture, governance, tax, attitude to protectionism — to name a few. In other words, it's exactly the same sort of stuff posing cross-border costs and frictions that poses costs and frictions when it comes to free and interoperable trade. Bear that in mind with the following points raised by SWIFT (with our emphasis): SWIFT understands the political reality of why cross-border payment frictions exist. They're not technical problems, they're political problems. Facebook's Libra initiative in that context implies two very concerning things. The first is that Facebook — despite all its access to capital and talent — possibly doesn't understand the basic problem it is trying to solve. If that's the case, that suggests it's not a business worth investing in. The second — possibly more alarming thing — is that Facebook does understand this, but it doesn't care. And that's because it's objective isn't building an open-loop decentralised system, but quite plainly, getting the world at large to onboard, politically and financially, into its holistic and autocratic system. James Bond movies were made about far less audacious global domination plans.,,Izabella Kaminska,2019-06-21T14:31:14.043Z,

https://www.ft.com/content/fb3d7c68-910b-11e9-aea1-2b1d33ac3271,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Facebook’s Libra coin is a symptom of banks’ flaws,Social media group hopes to target obvious goal of costly transfers,Between data breaches, hate speech and smear campaigns, Facebook has set a standard of sorts in Silicon Valley scandals. A new blockchain-based currency, Libra, is an odd choice to change that image. Such digital assets are known for volatility and criminality. Yet the meeting of Big Tech and fintech represents a challenge to traditional banks. Facebook hopes to exploit their flaws, most notably slow and expensive transactions. There are good reasons to remain wary of Facebook, but a digital shake-up of banking is long overdue. Under regulatory pressure, Facebook is trying to reinvent itself as a private, encrypted network. Building a dedicated financial system is integral to the company’s pivot away from an open platform. Instead, it aims to offer an experience akin to what Tencent’s WeChat provides in China, combining features including messaging, photos and purchases on a single platform — but on a global basis. Facebook has billed Libra as a “stablecoin”, backed by a reserve of low-risk assets to avoid volatility. The company says it has created a new blockchain, which it hopes will support rapid transactions at a global level. A Facebook subsidiary, Calibra, will produce a “digital wallet” to store Libra coins, with the goal of the currency gaining traction in offline retail as well. A digital challenger with the clout of Big Tech is the stuff of nightmares for the old guard of finance. Facebook says that money transfers with Libra will be fast and cheap. That would undercut banks’ transaction fees, especially internationally. There may be scope here for central banks to ensure that commercial banks lower their exorbitant prices if they wish to compete with digital challengers. Libra also shows the increasing influence of blockchains in the banking industry. In February, JPMorgan Chase announced JPM Coin, a stablecoin pegged to the dollar. Yet experiments have not always yielded encouraging results. Last month, the Bundesbank said its blockchain trial had been slower and more expensive than traditional methods. It remains to be seen whether the proposed blockchain can scale up to deal with billions of daily transactions without slowing. Moreover, the system would offer Facebook access to an almost unrivalled treasure trove of financial information. Despite the company’s claims to have developed more of a conscience over how it uses data, executives have suffered negligible consequences. While Calibra has pledged customers’ account information will not be used to target advertising, Facebook’s record on this front gives cause for doubt. Recommended If the system is successful, there are other reasons to be worried. The question of whether Libra is a security or not must be answered: if it is, it will have to be formally registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Facebook will have to demonstrate, too, how it intends to combat money laundering. Without robust checks, it could become an attractive platform for criminals to move “dirty” money. Its ambition for frictionless cross-border transfers may also threaten governments, if payments increasingly take place not in national currencies but in Libra. It is difficult to accord full trust to Libra, as a project of a company whose commitment to users has been ancillary at best. Its unveiling is significant, however. Smaller players have shown they can inflict disruption on an ossified banking system. A company with Facebook’s size and social media infrastructure could be many times more potent. Traditional banks must move into the 21st century or risk an exodus to more attractive alternatives.

https://www.ft.com/content/a053d6d4-323a-3247-9cad-8c7229f287c9,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Facebook’s Libra: blockchain, but without the blocks or chain,Y NO BLOCKCHAIN? (But also: Y BLOCKCHAIN?),This is just one of a series of Alphaville posts on Libra coin, which we are calling Breaking the Zuck Buck, in which we will seek to show how nonsensical, pointless, stupid, risky, badly thought-out and blockchainless the whole thing is. We’ve been told that Facebook’s shiny new Libra coin is “a low-volatility cryptocurrency”, supported by the Libra Blockchain, a “decentralised, programmable database”. And at first look, Libra coin is just what it says on the tin: a cryptocurrency — or more specifically, a stablecoin — like any other. It has the characteristic “white paper”, the characteristic promises to empower people across the world, and even the characteristic handy charts to show the likely direction of the project. From the white paper: But look a little closer and you soon realise that Libra coin isn’t really a cryptocurrency at all, and that the “Libra Blockchain” — which is, notably, always written with a capital “B” — isn’t really a blockchain. What's more, it isn't at all clear why you would possibly need a blockchain, or anything calling itself a “cryptocurrency”. Given that Facebook simply appears to be trying to build a global pseudo-banking and payments network, there doesn't appear to be any good reason why you would want to do this using blockchain tokens, which as the authors point out themselves in the documents, have so far proven volatile and difficult to scale. China's social media-turned-payments giant WeChat Pay — who Facebook is surely trying to compete with on a global level — doesn't use the blockchain. Nor does PayPal. Or Venmo. Internet money doesn't need to be blockchain money. Which is maybe why Libra coin isn't really blockchain money in any meaningful sense of the word. Could it be the blockchain stuff is mainly PR . . .? Confusingly, sometimes it sounds like the white paper is almost explicitly telling us that the Libra Blockchain is not a blockchain (or not one that would fulfil the usual criteria for a blockchain). Like here (with our emphasis): To say something is something, but unlike the previous version of that something because its defining characteristics are different, is a bit like saying: “Unlike previous loaves of bread, which view the loaf of bread as a collectively baked set of ingredients, the Libra Loaf of Bread is a single ingredient structure that bakes the components sequentially over time.” Meanwhile, in the rather grand-sounding “State Machine Replication in the Libra Blockchain” document detailing the Libra Blockchain consensus, we’re given this explanation of the way the Libra Blockchain works, which seems almost contradictory to the last description (emphasis ours, again): It almost feels like several dozen people wrote these documents and (ironically) failed to reach consensus on what they were actually trying to communicate. Oh wait: Talk of decentralised structures is everywhere in the frustratingly wordy but detail-light introductory material. But one thing which can be unpicked immediately is that the system only aspires to achieve decentralisation at some point in the future. For now the unique benefits of blockchain’s “distributed governance” are only theoretical because in the first instance the Libra Blockchain will be coming to market in fully “permissioned” form, effectively centrally controlled by the founder Libra coin holders. To save costs and to introduce efficiencies even further, the Libra administrators even float the idea of archiving off data (possibly for a fee) in order to save space — something that would be considered anathema to most self-respecting fans of immutable blockchain technology. In short, most of the features that make a blockchain a blockchain don't seem to be there. But the problem with arguing that the Libra Blockchain does not actually constitute a blockchain is that — as we have pointed out before — outside of the world of the public blockchains that underpin cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, the word doesn’t have much meaning anyway. So maybe a “single data structure” can be a blockchain after all. And maybe Libra coin, a bit like Ripple (XRP) before it, can be considered a cryptocurrency even though, per the standard definition via Investopedia: Moving things along . . . with the power of Jedi mind-tricks. Another important aspect of the Libra Blockchain is Move, its new programming language. This programming language will, says Facebook, allow users to define their own smart contracts in the future. Smart contracts are agreements written in code whose clauses are automatically enforced when a set of pre-determined criteria is met. So far, at least in the decentralised cryptocurrency context, they've proved highly unreliable. This is partly because they are written in code and not human language, which means even when they’re written by the world’s top programmers, errors can easily be introduced. But Facebook has pre-empted the human error problem by creating programming language that, somewhat incredibly, can . . . read your mind. From the white paper: What Facebook possibly failed to pre-empt, however, is that by calling its system Libra Reserve it brings to mind the Liberty Reserve, a Costa Rican-based attempt to create something similar. We’re sure this one will end much better though.,,Jemima Kelly,2019-06-18T09:10:57.199Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/c3746b5c-90de-11e9-aea1-2b1d33ac3271,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,What is Libra, Facebook’s new digital coin?,Project aims to bring stable currency and fee-free money transfers to billions of users,Facebook has revealed plans for an ambitious new digital currency, Libra, ending months of speculation about the project. The work is in its early stages but Facebook has published documents revealing ideas for the currency and some heavyweight partners. Many of the details will be hashed out in the coming months. Here is what we know so far. Libra is a new global digital currency based on technology created by Facebook. The plan is for a new Swiss-based non-profit foundation, comprised of 100 private sector and civil society members with equal voting rights, to launch Libra in the first half of 2020. Facebook said the design of Libra would allow individuals to store, spend and transfer money with close to zero transaction fees. Libra is partly targeted at the $613bn annual market for cross-border remittances. “Just as people can use their phones to message friends anywhere in the world today, with Libra, the same can be done with money — instantly, securely and at low cost,” Facebook said. The digital coin will be backed by a reserve of low-risk assets including bank deposits in various currencies and US Treasuries, which will prevent its value from fluctuating too wildly. Members of the foundation will initially validate transactions and the reserve will be held by a “geographically distributed network of custodians”. In the white paper, the Libra Association’s members said it was “important to note” that the structure meant “one Libra will not always be able to convert into the same amount of a given local currency”. Individuals and merchants with Libra accounts will be shown the current value of their holding in traditional money on their screen. Facebook said any company could build a “wallet” to hold Libra. Its own service will be a subsidiary called Calibra, which will be integrated into Facebook’s family of apps and will also be available as a standalone app. Calibra will partner with “authorised resellers” of Libra, cryptocurrency exchanges and liquidity providers to help people change money into Libra seamlessly within the apps. The company would “try to negotiate the most advantageous” exchange fees for customers when they are transferring fiat currency from their bank account into Libra online, it said. Facebook said it hoped the service would also appeal to 1.7bn “unbanked” people around the world. Kevin Weil, head of product at Calibra, said the company hoped to partner with local businesses such as convenience stores where people could hand over cash and load Libra directly on to a mobile phone and vice versa. “They have a scanner and you have a QR code on your phone. That’s the way you physically would do it in a store,” he said. In the longer run, Calibra said it hoped to offer users additional services, such as “paying bills with the push of a button [or] buying a cup of coffee with the scan of a code”. Other initiatives targeting the unbanked include the many mobile money platforms such as M-Pesa, which lets users transfer money by mobile phone in Africa; Aadhaar, a government ID system that brought hundreds of millions into the banking sector in India; and Mastercard’s digital identity scheme, which hopes to repeat that success globally. Yes. Facebook hopes that some of the consumer-facing companies that have been involved in funding the project — such as Spotify and Uber — will integrate the cryptocurrency into their systems. What this will look like exactly is unclear. But David Marcus, the former PayPal president who will now head up Calibra, said the blockchain technology would allow for microtransactions — tiny online purchases. In the case of Spotify, this might mean users are able to pay a couple of cents to listen to a song, for example. “Now you can start doing microtransactions . . . I think a whole range of new models can emerge when that is possible,” said Mr Marcus. Alex Norstrom, chief premium business officer at Spotify, said: “One challenge for Spotify and its users around the world has been the lack of easily accessible payment systems — especially for those in financially underserved markets.” Payments Mastercard, PayPal, PayU, Stripe, Visa Tech and consumer Booking Holdings, eBay, Facebook, Farfetch, Lyft, Mercado Pago, Spotify, Uber Telecoms Iliad, Vodafone Blockchain Anchorage, Bison Trails, Coinbase, Xapo Holdings Venture Capital Andreessen Horowitz, Breakthrough Initiatives, Ribbit Capital, Thrive Capital, Union Square Ventures NGOs Creative Destruction Lab, Kiva, Mercy Corps, Women’s World Banking Mr Weil said Libra had to be a cryptocurrency or you “inherit the fees and the existing structures that today keep billions of people unbanked”. Until today, however, digital currencies have only appealed to niche enthusiasts. But the heft of the partners involved, and Facebook’s belief that its new technology can scale to accommodate billions of daily transactions, give Libra a chance of becoming widely adopted. Facebook said it would not require the huge energy needed to “mine” bitcoin and that transactions would be far faster. But its success will also depend on how it is used by the crypto and wider business community. The Libra blockchain is open source, meaning any developer or company can build applications on it, whether or not they are founding members. The network will be governed by a Geneva-based independent non-profit association called the Libra Association. This will initially be made up of 28 groups, including Uber, Lyft, Spotify, Mastercard, Visa, eBay and PayPal, to name a few. While Facebook has led the project so far, it hopes that 100 “diverse” members with equal rights will run the foundation. Potential candidates must meet two of three criteria including having a market value of $1bn or holding more than $500m in customer balances, having a global reach of more than 20m a year, or being recognised as a top 100 industry leader for example in the Fortune 500 or similar ranking tables. Recommended There are exceptions for smaller crypto-focused investors and blockchain companies who will be committed to driving mainstream adoption, as well as social impact and academic groups. In the longer term, Facebook plans to shift the model away from being a so-called “permissioned” blockchain run by several players, to being “permissionless” and a fully decentralised one run by anyone with the technical capabilities, as was the original vision of bitcoin. It wants to begin this transition within five years of the public launch. While Facebook will be firming up its exact charter for governance over the next two months, it is proposed that there be a simple majority for most decisions by the council, and a super majority — two-thirds of the votes — for big policy decisions. Members must commit to paying $10m, at least, to operate a “node” of the blockchain, although they can invest more. They must also agree to help promote the ecosystem and push for mainstream adoption. This money will go towards covering the operating costs of the association and creating a pool of incentives for adoption that merchants, developers and wallet providers will receive. Facebook said it would also conduct a private placement of securities, “available only for a select group of accredited investors” to jump-start the project, but would not give further details. In the longer term, interest yielded from the reserve, invested in low-risk assets, will go towards covering operating costs, as well as paying out dividends to members. Cryptocurrencies are a loosely regulated space, where rules vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and are still evolving. Facebook has already started talks with regulators such as the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission to discuss the impact of its project and whether it will fall within the scope of its remit. In the US, securities laws regulators are also paying heightened attention to blockchain projects. It is unclear whether Libra would fall into the category of a security, which would require formal registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, payments processors need licensing in most jurisdictions in which they operate and this can sometimes take years. Mr Weil said Calibra would be a regulated entity and was “in the process” of applying for money transmitter licenses. Facebook will also need to reassure watchdogs, including central banks, that it can undergo stringent anti-money laundering checks and prevent fraud. Mr Weil said Calibra users would need to submit government identification to sign up to use the wallet and that automated systems would be in place to detect fraud. Facebook has said that given the sophisticated technology behind the coin and the diverse members running separate nodes, a big hack is unlikely. Still, the Libra Association will “work to prepare responses” to potential attacks from hackers, including temporarily halting the processing of transactions in the case of a big breach. Recommended Users may be also wary of handing over personal financial information in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Calibra has said it will not share account information or financial data with Facebook or any third party “without customer consent”, and that user data will not be used for targeting adverts. While WhatsApp and Messenger would know that an individual was using Calibra, they would not be able to see transaction information, said Mr Weil. In the longer term, users’ financial data could be used to help Calibra sell other financial products to users, he said.,,Hannah Murphy,2019-06-18T09:00:24.000Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/c8c42e6a-605c-11e9-9300-0becfc937c37,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,The Rich Column: using blockchain to help value art,For centuries, galleries and auction houses have been able to say pretty much what they like about an artist’s work, without buyers having an easy way of checking its authenticity,Most of the problems in today’s art market can be understood by visiting two websites: artybollocks.com and arteia.com. The first site, you may have deduced, is satirical. You can download a “personal artist certificate” or create “your own artist statement” built using an algorithm that generates random pretentious nonsense. Here’s one I made earlier: “My work explores the relationship between Jungian archetypes and skateboard ethics. With influences as diverse as Derrida and Roy Lichtenstein, new synergies are synthesised from both mundane and transcendant discourse.” Good, eh? There’s an even better algorithm at 500letters.org/form_15, which incorporates your preferred media and themes. What this shows is that for centuries, artists, galleries and auction houses have been able to say pretty much what they like about an artist’s work and its value, without buyers having an easy way of checking its authenticity. But the second site is much more serious. It offers a chance to try out a new digital catalogue of artworks, with certificates of authenticity, built using blockchain technology that can keep it secure and updated. Here is what co-founder Philippe Gellman told me: “With our platform . . . we are putting official information in the blockchain to have a universal ledger of artists. It gives more transparency . . . the starting point of provenance is the cataloguing system.” What this shows is that, in the 21st century, buyers might at last have an easy way to check an artwork’s authenticity. Gellman set up the Arteïa platform two years ago, having been a pioneer of online stockbroking in the 1990s with Bourse Direct. Backed by the Taittinger champagne family and Belgium’s Marian art-collecting dynasty, he aims to fix the three inefficiencies of the art market, as he sees them: lack of provenance (is my painting a fake?), lack of transparency (am I paying the right price?) and lack of liquidity (why is it so difficult and expensive to buy or sell?). The platform uses blockchain technology to record all the important events in an artwork’s lifetime: such as changes of ownership, participation in exhibitions or mentions in articles. Arteïa gets artists, or their estates or foundations, to upload the information, which can then be verified by selected validators. Once on the blockchain ledger, works can be traded securely and changes in ownership recorded. This fixes the provenance problem by creating an ongoing and unalterable ownership register. It fixes the liquidity problem by providing a trading platform that lets collectors avoid the 30 per cent buyer’s commission and up to 10 per cent seller’s commission charged by auction houses. It also fixes the transparency problem, by storing the price of all of those transactions. But this disintermediation cannot happen until enough data is amassed. So far, only 70,000 works have been uploaded to Arteïa and, although increasing numbers of artists and collectors are using the platform to catalogue their works, it is up to them to decide if they will share this data. Gellman argues it will be in all users’ interest if they did. Advisers to wealthy collectors, however, suggest they may wish to be more discreet. Steven Kettle, head of client management at Stonehage Fleming, the multi-family office, argues — as a fee-based adviser would — that discretion and behind-the-scenes advice are how intermediaries add value. “Acting as gatekeepers for art collectors we, by definition, slow down the transaction process where appropriate to make space to ask the necessary questions and do the required research.” Caroline Garnham, who runs a law firm that specialises in advising wealthy families, says this is a service wealthy clients are happy to pay for. “These collectors tend to build strong relations with their broker or art adviser, and fees on the whole are not an issue.” Her own preferred specialist, Guy Jennings of The Fine Art Group, suggests a blockchain art ledger can only go so far. “New technologies in development, intended to solve complications of provenance in a future art market, will only be as good as the information received from the real world,” he says. A new ledger can only go in one temporal direction, too. “It won’t be able to fill in existing and persistent gaps in old provenances, so it’s not a panacea for art of the past.” Indeed, it may never be able to establish the provenance of rare 1980s works by an artist recently mentioned at 500letters.org/form_15: “M Vincent creates performances, paintings, films and conceptual artwork. Using written and drawn symbols, a world where light-heartedness rules and where rules are undermined is created. Associations and meanings collide. Space becomes time and language becomes image.” But at least you can own one of these works for just £50. Cash preferred, no bitcoin.

https://www.ft.com/content/5ec32986-1872-3828-9f67-465019d97044,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,How blockchain takes us back to medieval times,History teaches us that when credit systems are replaced with payment systems, economies are starved of liquidity.,The marketing spiel about blockchain distributed ledger technology (DLT) often promises to liberate financial institutions from the costly burden of having to pledge billions of dollars in margin to clearing houses on the basis that trades complete instantaneously, meaning counterparty risks are eliminated. But this, according to a new report by Greenwich Associates' Ken Monahan, is a wrong-headed way to think about things. Monahan, who in other respects is quite complimentary of DLT, notes that in most cases those savings arguments are moot. This is because what real-time gross settlement of securities offers with one hand it simultaneously takes away many times over with the other hand in terms of pre-funding costs. This, incidentally, is a point the FT's Philip Stafford has made to FT Alphaville in conversations around the hypothetical FT water cooler ever since the industry started going mad about the potential of DLT. Or as Monahan puts it: Using DTCC as an example, real-time clearing could theoretically save $8bn in reserve funds. But what that also means is that all participants would have to pre-fund (or even over-fund in a volatile market) all prospective trades fully before being able to execute them. There are two issues in play here. One: in a DLT real-time framework all trades become bilateral rather than multilateral, which makes the savings from margining impossible. Two: in a DLT real-time framework there is no netting. As a result the system requires all transactions to be fully funded on a transaction by transaction basis. According to Monahan that takes the system back to the era before the New York Stock Exchange Clearing House enabled marketwide net settlement in 1892. But that's not even how far back in time DLT takes us. Even in 1891 an investor could secure a call loan against shares during the day it took to settle them, says Monahan. This is impossible to do with instantaneous settlement. You simply cannot use shares you have yet to transact as collateral for a loan. Thus trades not only have to be pre-funded, they need to be pre-funded on an unsecured basis. Consider the relevant mechanics thusly (from the report, with our emphasis): All of which takes us not just back to 1891 but to 1584, when the Venetian Senate decided to require pre-funding of all trading done via the Banco di Rialto following the collapse of the Venetian banking system due to the bankruptcy of a number of merchant houses which had used aggressive and high-risk ledger accounting techniques. Problem is, the Senate's solution soon began to choke the entire economy. Here's the story via Monahan (our emphasis): Which is another way of saying: be careful what you wish for. DLT is in effect, an extremely narrow banking model. It's not clear at all if that is desirable for an expanded and globalised economy that depends on credit extension at every commercial interaction point.

Nothing typified the madness better than the craze for initial coin offerings meant to fund software projects that promised to revolutionise everything from online gaming to file storage. Maybe you invested. More likely, you intuited something was awry when your Uber driver started asking for crypto recommendations and a friend began touting a blockchain-based ledger designed to track marijuana supply chains. ICOs birthed a thousand millionaires before asset prices plummeted in late 2018. Now as bigger players such as Facebook start to enter cryptocurrencies, regulators at the US Securities and Exchange Commission are having to grapple with the problems caused by these investments. So far, the watchdog has focused on bringing ICOs under its traditional regime of disclosure-based investor protection rules. But my research with David Wishnick into the ICO market reveals some disquieting facts. The central innovation in ICOs rests on the possibility of using computer code to deliver on contractual promises. So we surveyed the 50 offerings that raised the most capital in 2017 and asked a simple question: did the promoters deliver on their promises to protect investors through computer code? We specifically compared the promises promoters made in their offering documents with the actual function of the cryptoassets they delivered. We audited each coin’s smart contract, the automated “if this, then that” rules coders design to govern cryptoassets. We found that most of the offerings promised forms of investor protection that the code did not deliver. Take the issue of supply. An investor in a given cryptoasset needs to know that a promoter cannot simply print more, inflating away its value. In more than 20 per cent of ICOs in our sample where cryptoasset supply restrictions were promised, we could not observe restrictions hard-coded into smart contracts. More starkly, in 25 of the 36 ICOs where promoters promised to impose restrictions on insiders selling assets and walking away, we could not find those restrictions in the code. Finally, we found 12 offerings where the code allowed a central party to modify the way the smart contract worked, but only four of them disclosed that ability in their promotional materials. Even if the SEC does expand its regulatory umbrella over ICOs, its ability to police against fraud will be limited by resource constraints; and it is not clear that private class-action lawsuits can pick up the slack. Moreover, these offerings are truly global, allowing promoters to switch jurisdictions, seeking lighter regulation. That means the market will be largely left to police itself. But our analysis found no evidence that investors punished firms for failing to put investor protections into code. Even today, crypto rating agencies look at code only to check that it is protected against hackers. We found no sign that they tried to match code with investor protections. That task is left to individual investors, who are expected to read, and understand, smart contracts. This is a hopeless enterprise. It is well documented that few people read the “click I agree” user contracts they encounter online, and the same is true for smart ones. Regulators need to step in. Here are two simple suggestions. We should require ICOs to guarantee a match between the key promises made in marketing and code. Or we should demand that promoters provide plain-English translations of principal code elements. Such market integrity measures won’t just protect investors, they will also build trust in the asset class itself and enable it to move from a curiosity to something of real economic worth.

https://www.ft.com/content/abd7ba0b-40ef-3876-857c-cd5d49ec557e,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,SegWit and the bitcoin transaction fee conspiracy theory,Nearly two years after the introduction of a coding fix called SegWit intended to help scale bitcoin, transaction fees collected by miners are on the rise again...,Bitcoin was supposed to make finance cheap and accessible. But then in 2015 the network got jammed (mostly with spam, not real-world transactions) and transaction fees began to spike. The mystery of who was spamming the network was never really solved. But the whole thing seemed calculated. Some believed it was initiated by powers who wanted to push bitcoin's scaling limitations to the forefront of developer agendas. But nobody could be sure. Either way, fees kept soaring, peaking in 2017 at impractically high levels (who can justify paying for a coffee with bitcoin if the transaction fee is more than $10?). It was about this time the technology's champions began to change the rhetoric surrounding bitcoin's key selling point from that of a cheaper and more efficient payments system to dependable (albeit ironically erratic) store of value and unbeatable record-keeping system. But then something changed. Fees began to fall: Some attributed the 2018's dramatic decline in transaction fees to the growing adoption of the segregated witness (SegWit) fix, which was rolled out in mid-2017. As the Wiki notes, as of February 2018, over 30 per cent of bitcoin transactions were using the SegWit fix. But the rollout didn't come without drama. The proposed fix ignited deep divisions in the developer and mining community between those who believed bitcoin's scaling issue should be resolved by increasing the permissible amount of transactions in bitcoin blocks, and those who believed alternative fixes like SegWit and the secondary layer solution it enables, the Lightning network (LN), were more efficient. The spat eventually spawned an offshoot of bitcoin called bitcoin Cash. This differentiated itself from the core coin by remaining committed to bitcoin's role as a cheap and accessible medium of exchange. But fees are creeping higher again . . . Looking at historical data, it's hard not to conclude bitcoin transaction fees are just as much influenced by bitcoin prices as network traffic. Which makes sense. The two influence each other. But many wallet services also offer default fee settings in terms of satoshis (ie the micro units of bitcoin). As the price of bitcoin rises so too does the fee, unless it's adapted to a percentage rate of the transaction price by the user, creating a self-enforcing feedback loop. In that context, it's fair for us lay people to ask, what did SegWit really achieve aside from buying time before transaction fees began to explode further? What is SegWit really? One prominent critic of the SegWit and the associated Lightning network fix is Satoshi Nakamoto identity-claimant Craig Wright. He is currently chief scientist at nChain, a group which supports yet another version of a medium of exchange focused bitcoin, called bitcoin SV (for Satoshi Vision), which launched in November 2018. He made some worthwhile points to Alphaville. First, the real purpose of SegWit wasn't really to free-up block space to lower transaction fees but to enable the rollout of the Lightning Network. The impact SegWit had on freeing up capacity was simply a convenient byproduct. What's Ligntning? It's the system that attempts to solve the scaling limitation by diverting as many transactions off-chain as possible. It does this by establishing trusted bilateral channels of repeat custom, which are policed privately through bonded arrangements in code. In conventional finance terms, it's akin to a private bilateral netting system that only squares when it has to (notably, when imbalances or risks get too extended). It does this with underlying bitcoin collateral transfers. Traditional financial practitioners would probably describe it as another form of shadow money banking and shadow money creation: precisely the sort of thing bitcoin was supposed to put to an end. If you think that sounds awfully like the conventional financial system before many of its worst practices were regulated out of existence post 2008, you'd be right. As it stands, acting outside of new AML, KYC, risk and capital rules is becoming increasingly hard in the bitcoin ecosystem because key service providers — in a bid to popularise bitcoin for the masses in properly regulated jurisdictions — have had to align themselves with legacy regulations to avoid being shut down or penalised. Lightning in effect introduces a regulatory workaround by reducing the amount of bitcoin entities need to process within these monitored systems. Under Lightning, the vast majority of transactions occur in private bilateral channels and are likely to be scrutinised by no one other than the parties concerned. A key issue preventing Lightning's mass roll out, however, was the costly way it would have to deal with a well known bitcoin bug called malleability. SegWit was predominantly introduced to resolve this. As stated before, the fact it became associated with a block-size constraint solution was incidental. But there's another dimension to the tale. According to Wright, the Lightning system appeals to those who want to keep extracting value out of bitcoin without creating onchain logs, a practice which helps to obscure transactions and keep the system out of the regulatory net. In so doing one of bitcoin's key attributes — its ability to deliver a permanent record of signatures which can't be tampered with — is compromised. “Bitcoin is not anonymous and cannot be anonymous. There are people in Core who want to create a system that does not maintain logs. Hence SegWit,” Wright told Alphaville. He added: Put this way, he has a point. Any dependence on a separate external system is tantamount to a trusted relationship, which defies the whole logic of arguing the world needs to turn to bitcoin because third parties are untrustworthy. It's no coincidence Wright adds that Lightning started to be developed just after the Silk Road dark market arrests happened. It was then, possibly, that nefarious entities realised bitcoin — being an immutable evidence trail — could actually be used not just to facilitate criminality but to prevent it, upping the urgency for a workaround to be developed. The mysterious network spamming that allowed such ethos-compromising proposals to be linked to scaling solutions, meanwhile, started about six months before the official Lightning white paper was released. Bitcoin and Lightning technical communities would argue Lightning is just a more scalable protocol for instant retail payment, which would support more bitcoin use cases and adoption. Nonetheless, isn't that a fun conspiracy theory?

It can be watched here. Written by crypto-enthusiast Graeme Moore, the book is, in his words, “for kids, and not for kids”. The kids he refers to are presumably children, and the not for kids those grown adults who still dwell in their mom's basement, ranting about how fiat is a several-thousand year old fad. The book, as many children's books do, has an alphabetical format. For instance, “L”, stands for “distributed ledger”. So without further ado, here is Alphaville's own crypto ABC: A is for accountability — an unknown term in the crypto-verse. B is for blown — as in, “I've blown all my money”. C is for centralisation — which is always going to be quicker and cheaper than blockchain. D is for divorce — for when your better half finds out what your savings are invested in. E is for Excel Spreadsheet — which is just as good as a blockchain. F is for Federal Reserve — the overseer of the true stablecoin. G is for guru — a Twitter crypto trader whose financial experience equates to a week's work experience as a teller two decades ago. H is for HODL — what you say when you've lost your wallet password. I is for illiquid — when there are no more Tethers being printed that day. J is for joke — as in, “the joke's on you”. K is for KYC — see “accountability”. L is for Luke Wilson — a humble man using a luxury exit coin to supply fresh water in Africa. M is for money printing — which is exactly what crypto is doing. N is for net present value — see “accountability”. O is for oligarchy — the new bankster mafia. P is for pump and dump — crypto's raison d'être. Q is for queue — the laborious wait to shift $0.42 between accounts. R is for robbed — the eventual status of every crypto-exchange. S is for the SEC — regulators who don't understand crypto assets are a new currency for raising capital for unrealised commercial ventures, and not securities. T is for terrorism — an often willing counterparty on crypto trades. U is for UX — of which there is none. V is for V-shaped recovery — predicted after every fall. W is for wallet — the easy to remember sequence of 34 alphanumeric characters. X is for ex — what you'll call your better half in six months. Y is for yurt — what you may end up living in. Z is for zero — Bitcoin's technical support. Of course, if Moore wanted to be true to the concept, a Bitcoin ABC book should involve showing the baby the letter and getting them to make random noises, only moving on to the next page when they get the right one.

DAH, previously fronted by Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan Chase executive credited with pioneering the market for credit-default swaps, had promised to revolutionise finance by applying the distributed ledger technology backing cryptocurrencies to activities such as trade clearing and settlement. Instead, DAH is ramping up its focus on smart contracts, which use similar code to that used in automated transactions such as direct debits and standing orders. Any blockchain-enabled financial settlement system is likely to be highly dependent on smart contract technology. The shift comes as Germany’s central bank expressed doubts about blockchain’s potential, relative to existing technologies. “The market is evolving to a place where we see the ledger platform becoming a place that is going to be very difficult for us to compete in,” a spokesperson for DAH said, adding the group had also recognised that customers were fearful of being locked into any specific platform. Ms Masters had told bankers in 2015 that blockchain was analogous to “email for money” and that the world should be “taking this technology as seriously as you should have been taking the development of the internet in the early 1990s”. She stepped down from her position as chief in December 2018 for personal reasons, stirring concerns that blockchain’s promise may struggle to live up to expectations. She remains a board member, adviser and investor in the company. Other notable departures from the company over the past six months include Stewart Cowan, brought in last April to oversee DAH’s development of a blockchain-based clearing and settlement system for the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and Gavin Wells, the former LCH executive who was its head of Europe. A hint that DAH was edging away from blockchain came in April when the company announced it would be making its smart contract language, known as DAML, easier to integrate with rival blockchain platforms such as Hyperledger. DAH’s chief Yuval Rooz stressed the company remained committed to blockchain but confirmed that increasing standardisation across the industry had started to commoditise the business, challenging the potential to generate revenue from blockchain alone. “We are focusing on where the value is for us, as well as where we think we have an immediate advantage with DAML,” he said. In a surprise move, policymakers recently poured cold water on the capacity for blockchain technology to revolutionise trade processing. Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann told a symposium in May that tests run with Deutsche Börse, Germany’s largest exchange, had shown the technology was sometimes slower and more expensive to use. “A real breakthrough in application is missing so far,” he added. The ASX, which has invested more than A$20m in DAH, said its project to upgrade its domestic settlement system using Digital Asset Holdings’ technology remained on track.,,Izabella Kaminska Philip Stafford,2019-06-07T10:00:41.000Z,

But are they alert to the associated risk?,The FSB is out with a report this Thursday on the financial stability, and regulatory and governance implications, of decentralised financial technologies. It provides a thoroughly balanced picture of the associated pros and cons of what is becoming one of the widest spread trends in the financial sector. On one hand, it notes, more decentralisation could improve stability by leading to greater competition and diversity, while reducing the systemic importance and risk of some existing entities. On the other hand, it also notes, more decentralisation could heighten the degree of procyclicality in decentralised risk-taking while introducing all sorts of new uncertainties concerning the determination of legal liability and consumer protection. It might also make recovery and resolution of decentralised structures more difficult. Which is all very fair and logical. But there's one additional risk identified by the FSB that probably deserves closer attention. It pertains to the perception that tokenisation -- the act of representing physical or intangible assets in digital form on blockchains -- can magically liquefy illiquid hard-to-value assets. Tokenisation, if you haven't heard, is gearing up as a standardised mechanism for providing access to the ownership of traditional assets by representing them in digital and programmable form on public or private blockchains. It is particularly being applied to illiquid assets in the belief that the collective digitisation and unitisation of the underlying asset can make it more tradeable. But as the FSB warns, (our emphasis): In other words, we've been here with financial engineering and securitisation before. From the sound of it, the FSB isn't entirely convinced that just because something is tokenised and tradeable on the blockchain, its liquidity can't be dangerously overestimated by the market. Two other notable extracts being: And more interestingly still: All of which suggests the idea tokenisation can magically engineer frictionless liquidity for all sorts of assets and in so doing reduce risks, ignores the degree to which new risks may be introduced as a consequence. New risks include the complexity of key management, which exposes the system both to new frictions and capital loss risks, as well as the dependence of tokenised systems on the very human limitations of software developers, which exposes the entire system to coding mistakes, bugs and hacks, as well as uncertainties about who is ultimately accountable when things go wrong.

Venkata Meenavalli, 49, was accused of falsely reporting $66m of “phony revenue” using fraudulent documents and third-party entities he controlled. The sales amounted to almost 90 per cent of the company’s 2017 revenue. “Longfin reported as revenue millions of dollars of commodities ‘transactions’ which were actually sham, round-trip events,” the US attorney’s office for the district of New Jersey alleged in an indictment. Mr Meenavalli called himself a “global techno entrepreneur” and a “financial wizard” when Longfin went public in December 2017. The company’s shares jumped more than 1,000 per cent just days after it floated when Longfin announced it was buying a blockchain company. Prosecutors on Wednesday claimed the company’s filings after its float included false revenue. They claimed Longfin “did not engage in any revenue-producing cryptocurrency transactions, and did not use the blockchain to empower any solutions”. The Securities and Exchange Commission suspended trading in the stock in April 2018 and the company said the following month it was delisting. The SEC also filed civil fraud charges against Mr Meenavalli on Wednesday. It accused him of conducting a “fraudulent public offering” by falsely stating Longfin was operated in the US and alleged he committed accounting fraud. The SEC previously accused Mr Meenavalli and several others with a scheme involving the illegal distribution of company shares. The US securities regulator said Longfin and Mr Meenavalli were not represented by defence counsel. Mr Meenavalli could not be immediately reached.

The UBS-led research on a “utility settlement coin” (USC) has been in the ether since 2015, when banks decided to investigate whether wholesale banking could be made more efficient by deploying distributed ledger technology (DLT). DLT, which is used in blockchain networks, enables participants to instantly share information on an open-access ledger which can never be altered or erased. The technology could theoretically replace reams of paperwork and processing, but banks must first confront legal and regulatory hurdles on everything from risk management to privacy before deploying it widely. “When we started out . . . this project has basically been about R&D, we didn’t know if the characteristics [we wanted to achieve] were possible,” said Rhom Ram, head of Fnality, the new venture into which the banks and exchange Nasdaq have just invested £50m to create a market infrastructure to transfer value digitally. “The funding signals that it is possible,” he added. “The investors believe it is possible based on the evidence they have seen.” Recommended Hyder Jaffrey, head of strategic investments at UBS’s investment bank, said the research showed the USC would soon be used for clearing and settling trades and could ultimately prove “transformational” for trading. “We see a way of actually reducing the risk significantly in the post trade world,” he said, referring to the settlement, credit and counterparty risks banks take on between the time that trades are instructed and when the money and assets actually change hands. “All of these things play into costs, operational efficiency and the balance sheet.” Lee Braine, an executive at Barclays’ chief technology office, said his bank’s confidence in the project’s viability had “meaningfully” increased since it joined the effort a year-and-a-half ago. Other big banks involved in the project include Santander, BNY Mellon, MUFG, Credit Suisse, KBC, ING and Canada’s CIBC. The USC will begin life with 14 owners and members, and will be denominated in major global currencies including the US dollar, yen, euro and sterling. Every unit of a dollar-denominated USC will be backed by a traditional dollar at the Federal Reserve, and the same model will be used with other currencies, ensuring the value of the coin is stable. Its initial applications will be in relatively niche areas, such as creating a market infrastructure that allows the coins to be used to meet margin requirements in derivatives trades. Mr Ram said while at present it took at least a day for such requirements to be satisfied, using the USC the process could become almost instantaneous. Mr Braine said that while the size of the founding banks meant their efforts would have “traction” from launch, the impact would not be a “big bang”. “This ultimately is a market transformation over time,” he said. Japanese banks are also working on a digital coin — the J Coin — but they are focusing on retail banking, as is social media giant Facebook, which is developing a coin pegged to the dollar which could be used to instantly transfer value between Facebook users.,,Laura Noonan,2019-06-03T13:16:28.000Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/0e437c17-f3c5-3d7e-a3bd-8ece4f788ebe,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Another Satoshi is in the building and Craig Wright is... thrilled,“This is what we'd hoped would happen.”,On May 21, Craig Wright and his team announced to the world that he had been officially endorsed as bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. This was because Wright had been “granted” a copyright registration for the bitcoin white paper and the bitcoin source code by the US Copyright Office. According to them, this was the “first government agency recognition” of Wright as Satoshi. He hadn't been endorsed at all, in fact. But fact doesn't matter when "number go up". And number did go up. A lot. Bitcoin SV — the version of bitcoin that Craig and his pals are pushing and have a big financial stake in — more than doubled in the space of about 75 minutes after the announcement, and has almost doubled again since then. Take a look at this three-month price chart (screenshot from coingecko.com): As we explained at the time, the copyright registration was in fact nothing to do with US government recognition. There is no special “granting” of such a registration; you are merely given it once your application has been processed. Furthermore, the US Copyright Office does not investigate the identities of people applying for copyright — it doesn't have time to: about 600,000 official endorsements copyright registrations are recorded every year (which works out as about 2.300 every working day). If there is more than one claim on a given work, multiple registrations will be recorded. And whaddya know? Another claim of copyright for the bitcoin white paper was indeed registered at the US Copyright Office on May 24, by a Chinese citizen going by the name of Wei Liu: Given that Wright and his men had spun the “granting” of a copyright registration for the bitcoin white paper as official endorsement, you might have thought they might like to backtrack a little at this point, or at least try to say they had in fact misunderstood the way in which US copyright registrations work. Not so much. Without addressing the question of whether this rather undermined his claims of official government recognition, Craig Wright told Alphaville, via email: When we responded to the email, asking whether Wright now recognised that a US copyright registration did not constitute endorsement, we simply got this response: It wasn't immediately clear who “this Wei Liu” was. There was some online speculation that Wei Liu was a former employee of crypto exchange Bibox, who has reportedly been sued by the company for alleged embezzlement and extortion. Which would have been fun, not just because of the embezzlement and extortion, but because that Wei Liu is a woman (highly unusual in the brodom of cryptoland). But crypto news site Coindesk quickly put a stop to that story, revealing that Wei Liu was in fact the CEO of Coinsummer, a crypto market research firm (we checked with Coindesk that they are sure about their sourcing on this. They said they are.) From Coindesk: Liu is right that anyone can register a copyright, but Wright is, er, right that submitting false information to the US Copyright Office — which is part of the US Library of Congress, a federal agency — constitutes a crime under the US Copyright Act. Prosecutions, however, as Wright and Liu are probably aware, are almost unheard of. Violations are normally punished with a $2,500 fine -- hardly a very big deterrent for wannabe Satoshi Nakamotos. Wright's team — specifically Jimmy Nguyen, the CEO of the company Wright works for and a close “amigo” — had also claimed that Wright had been given some kind of special treatment in terms of processing times for this copyright registration, telling us at the time (emphasis ours): Given that Wright made his big announcement on May 21, and Liu managed to get his copyright claim registered three days later, it seems that three business days is not so extremely unusual and extremely fast after all. It turns out, in fact, that Wright had paid the US Copyright Office $800 for “special handling” of his claim (which means the office expedites the request). The US Copyright Office (which very rarely interacts with or responds directly to the press) said in a statement: That came from the office's “press updates” page, under the excellently titled: Regarding Further Questions About Certain bitcoin Registrations. As David Gerard has pointed out, the press updates page is new: it was created on May 22, 2019. Dusty bureaucratic institutions getting sassy. We like.

It's quite possible he never read a prospectus.” And now Alphaville says: “If George Orwell had ever read an ICO white paper or blockchain press release, he may have lost the will to live.” Blockchain may not (yet) be political. But the scale of language abuse across the sector is already off the scale. A fantastic recent example comes by way of Jaguar Land Rover's April 29 press release announcing that Jaguar drivers will soon be able to earn cryptocurrency as they drive. As an exercise in the black arts of media persuasion and the utilisation of language for the purpose of misdirection — giving the impression that an entity is doing something innovative and valuable, when really it's not — it was genius. The impact of the release across the media space was decidedly one presenting the service as a fait accompli. Jaguar, in other words, will be or is already integrating crypto payments into its services, as far as the press is concerned. See here: But sources close to Jaguar tell us nothing could be further from the truth. To the contrary, the press release was allegedly motivated by a last-ditch effort to draw some sort of value (a.k.a. temporary buzz) out of an otherwise failed investment. The source added, if one was to go through the press release carefully one would soon discover it was phrased very cleverly to give the impression that Jaguar was committing to a crypto service when it actually wasn't. This is exactly what we did here. (See our observations on the right). The lack of any sort of commitment is evident throughout. Armed with these findings we contacted Jaguar for more information about the details of the extremely vaguely presented “Smart Wallet” initiative. Here are some of their replies: When we put it to them that vehicles equipped with smart wallet functionality can't really be properly tested without being part of a wider system of tolls, shops and data services also testing the exact same smart contract system, their reply was: When we asked Jaguar if it was true that the press release was motivated by anotherwise failed blockchain investment, possibly an ICO, they noted: Which seems a weirdly specific way to word a sentence. One piece of relevant context is that in October 2017, Coindesk reported that a blockchain startup called DOVU, funded by the venture arm of Jaguar Land Rover, had raised roughly $6m in an initial coin offering (ICO). This project was aiming to build a platform through which users would be paid with "DOV" tokens for the submission of their data. Jaguar tells us that investment, despite its similarities with the current smart wallet announcement, was entirely separate. Make of that what you will. Our interpretation either way is that it's very unlikely Jaguar will be bringing a smart-wallet-enabled earn-cryptocurrency-as-you-drive offering to the marketplace any time soon. *References to George Orwell, who also famously said you should "never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print", should be used sparingly. But we have an excuse: Alphaville has just relocated (along with the rest of the FT editorial team) to Bracken House, named after our highly esteemed founder Brendan Bracken, who just happened to be the BB that George Orwell based the character of Big Brother on. The two worked together at the Ministry of Information during the war. Related links: FUD, inglorious FUD — FT Alphaville Deffcoin. Minted by ASICs. Powered by Dynamos. Attached to Teslas.

On Tuesday, it was time for Craig Wright to prove he was bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto again. This time, it was via the “granting” of a copyright registration by the US Copyright Office — for the Bitcoin White Paper and the bitcoin source code. According to Wright's people, this is a big deal. From a spokesman (emphasis ours): Thing is though, it's nothing of the sort. The US Copyright Office, a unit of the Library of Congress (a federal agency) does not “recognise” authors of given pieces of work. The “granting” of a copyright registration is standard procedure; the office does not investigate the identities of people registering for copyright. The claimant, however, in making the application is certifying to the US government that the information he or she is submitting is truthful. From a Copyright Office statement sent to us on Wednesday afternoon (emphasis ours): In fact, more than one person can make a claim to have copyright of the exact same work, and the Copyright Office will happily register those multiple claims. From the office's statement, again: It doesn't cost much to register either: a piece of writing like the Bitcoin White Paper would normally cost the applicant $55. If it's extremely obvious that this is a false claim, the Copyright Office can refuse a registration application. But that requires the Copyright Office to be certain that the person claiming to be an author of a given work is not in fact who they say they are. If, for example, Alphaville wanted to register ourselves as the musical geniuses (or not) behind The Beatles' Yesterday, we might get a refusal. Proving a negative, however, is more difficult. Given that there is no consensus on the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the Copyright Office cannot be certain that Craig Wright is not Satoshi. But they are certainly not saying that he is. From the Copyright Office, again: These copyright claims, in other words, have been registered like any other claim. The Copyright Office double-checked with Craig Wright that he was indeed saying he was the author of the works, but did not attempt to verify these claims (as that is not its job). Wright's people aren't backing down though. In a statement to us late on Wednesday, Jimmy Nguyen, CEO of the Craig Wright-founded nChain, told us (emphasis ours): Exceptionally notable stuff. Also, the registering copyright of the source code doesn't protect the intellectual property of bitcoin as an invention (you would need a patent for that). Copyright protects only the expression of a creative work. From the US Copyright Office's website: But ultimately, none of the above really matters. Whatever you think about Craig Wright's claims to be Satoshi, the “official recognition” line had a big impact on the price of the version of bitcoin that he is pushing, Bitcoin SV (“Satoshi's Vision”). And we all know that price is really all that matters in cryptoland (however much the bros will try to tell you it's about the technology). In the space of 75 minutes on Tuesday, the cryptocurrency mooned from $61.76 to as high as $139.31 — a more than 125 per cent price jump. It was trading just above $101 on Thursday. Here it is over the past seven days (via CoinMarketCap): You pump, you dump. Simples.

The group will focus on developing modern electronic ledgers for financial markets, and settles, records and verifies payments in central bank money rather than cryptocurrencies. While some blockchains use ledgers available to all users, Setl uses a so-called “permissioned ledger”, which allows a small network of trusted parties to see the details of trades and payments. It entered administration in early March after it was unable to maintain the regulatory capital that was needed to sustain two businesses it had been developing — ID2S, a central securities depository, and Iznes, a record-keeping platform for European funds. Quantuma were appointed administrators. The newly formed Setl Ltd has bought the operating assets, the staff and intellectual property rights of Setl Development, the previous company that is being wound down. It has also sold its stakes in ID2S and Iznes, but did not identify the buyers. Sir David Walker, author of the Walker Report, a review of corporate governance in UK banks, has been named as chairman while Christian Noyer, the former governor of the Bank of France, will be the lead independent director. Both served on the board of the previous company. Talking about the old Setl, Sir David admitted: “We thought the case would be seen as compelling but users weren’t ready to put their hands in their pockets to contribute to regulatory capital.” “Now we will provide the tools to the infrastructure companies,” he added. The new company has reached agreement with all its major clients to continue their support and it expects to push ahead now with a number of core initiatives, Sir David said. The sale of the stakes would be part of the funding for the new company, he added. Many of Setl existing management will be shareholders and founders of the new company.

https://www.ft.com/content/6411aaff-dd80-382f-ab1c-80cae225673d,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,SEC must solve its cryptocurrency custody conundrum,Too much regulation may stifle innovation but too little will put Main Street investors at risk,As blockchain technology grows in popularity, the US Securities and Exchange Commission faces a conundrum: how should it regulate the safekeeping or custody of a digital asset owned by an investment fund or managed account? To solve this puzzle, the regulator has to reconcile decades-old laws with new and inherently risky technology. Too much regulation may stifle innovation but too little will put Main Street investors at risk. Doing nothing is not an option. Current law requires mutual funds to deposit securities and similar assets in a vault or other depository belonging to a bank or trust company. Registered investment advisers must also maintain client assets with a qualified custodian. The law stops short of specifying how a custodian bank must safeguard, or maintain custody of, a client’s assets. Distributed ledger technology such as blockchain presents a novel challenge: how can a custodian, or an auditor, be certain that the custodian actually has possession of a digital asset? In theory, the answer is simple. To prove ownership of a digital asset, such as bitcoin, you must have both a public key and a corresponding private key. The public key appears as a string of digits representing a unique transaction that is added on as a block in a chain of other transactions. The private key, however, is a string of digits that is intended to be kept secret, a sort of electronic bearer instrument. Whoever has the private key can transfer a digital asset immutably and potentially anonymously to anyone. The SEC’s challenge is to ensure that such digital assets cannot be stolen or misappropriated. The answer may involve a combination of physical and electronic solutions, and some creative legal thinking. Some banks assert that they have developed platforms and procedures to keep digital assets safe. These may include holding digital assets in an offline wallet rather than on an exchange, requiring multiple electronic signatures to obtain access to the private key and keeping the private key on a computer in a physical vault — without an internet connection — to prevent criminals hacking in. As there is no single answer to what kind of security is sufficient, the SEC should take a balanced, practical approach. It should not try to prescribe specific technological standards because what is appropriate for one custodian may not work for another and today's state-of-the art requirements may become rapidly outdated. Regulations should require custodians to embrace technology that is sufficient to provide adequate security, coupled with robust and ongoing testing, similar to how financial intermediaries test for the adequacy of cyber security protections. The SEC could also treat all — or certain categories of — digital assets as securities solely for purposes of the custody rules, without determining whether they are securities that must be registered for sale. This approach would provide some certainty on the application of the custody rules. This would be welcome as some senior SEC staff have suggested that some digital assets that are securities may morph into non-securities and vice versa. Bitcoin, for example, is generally thought not to be a security, but certain non-fungible tokens, such as CryptoKitties, may morph into securities depending on how their functions change over time. The SEC could also establish robust standards for safekeeping programmes. These could include internal control reports and compliance testing. It could also consider a backstop that would involve special capital requirements or a form of third-party insurance to protect digital assets. But the SEC will never be able to eliminate digital asset fraud, just as it cannot eliminate other forms of theft. No matter how many protections are required, the first time that a bad actor empties the digital wallet of an investment account, everyone — including the press and Congress — will point fingers at the SEC for failing to require sufficient safeguards. Yet, by considering novel regulatory approaches adapted to the risks inherent in digital assets, educating investors, holding market participants to high standards and vigorously prosecuting bad actors, the SEC has the power to nurture technological innovation while still protecting Main Street investors.

Bots and the bitcoin debate,For sceptics, bot activity will be further evidence of cryptocurrencies’ failings,Last year, I took part in a noisy public debate about whether bitcoin is a beneficial innovation — or the opposite. It was an eye-opening experience: almost as soon as the event was posted online, I was trolled by furious cryptocurrency fans and critics alike. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, I concluded, arouse a level of passion rarely found within finance. Their detractors are convinced that the entire concept is a fraud; their evangelists are equally certain that cryptocurrencies are the future. Both sides may be right, depending on timing. Presently, cryptocurrencies seem to be marred by intellectual contradictions. Why does anyone think, for example, that crypto is a good payment mechanism or store of value when transactions are clunky and the value of a bitcoin has swung from $20,000 to $5,000 in the past 18 months? But I also recognise that the underlying blockchain technology is potentially very useful. It is entirely possible that future historians might see bitcoin as the MySpace of cryptocurrency — a pioneering product that was flawed but eventually replaced by better versions of the technology. However, if you want to get a less emotional view of these issues, consider a fascinating study of crypto trading that has just been conducted by an eight-strong team of computer scientists based at institutions including Cornell Tech, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Illinois in Urbana Champaign and ETH in Zurich. Their research set out to determine whether trading in cryptocurrencies is fair when it takes place on decentralised exchanges (DEXes), where individual traders cut deals directly with each other in a relatively transparent way, without a central authority. Before the study, it might have been expected — or hoped — that these venues were indeed pretty fair. After all, the whole point of cryptocurrencies is that they enable “miners” to create “money” and for it to be priced in a peer-to-peer manner with a permanent digital record. Central banks, governments and other institutions are not involved: call it digital people power. It is true that shady things have occurred when cryptocurrencies have gone on to exchanges: just last month, for example, a computer analytics group called The Tie calculated that “87 per cent of exchanges reported trading volume was potentially suspicious, and that 75 per cent of exchanges had some form of suspicious activity occurring on them”. But cryptocurrency advocates argue that the gains from democratising money outweigh such apparent abuses. However, when the researchers started tracking the DEXes (six of them, over 18 months) they had a nasty surprise: they found that the networks have become infested by computer bots, operating alongside the libertarian humans who are meant to populate them. More specifically, some unscrupulous miners and traders have apparently created these bots to anticipate and gain from others’ everyday trades by gaining advantages in the platforms’ information flows, enabling them to siphon off millions — or even billions — of dollars a year in profits. “Like high-frequency traders on Wall Street, these bots exploit inefficiencies in [DEXes], paying high transaction fees and optimizing network latency to front-run trades,” the research paper declares. “We observe bots competitively bidding up transaction fees in order to obtain priority ordering.” Translated for the lay reader, what this means is that some ruthlessly aggressive traders are finding ways to grab data on the deals that other investors are trying to cut — and then jumping ahead of them to take advantage of the prices. To be fair, crypto is not alone in this respect. As Michael Lewis’s book Flash Boysexplained a few years ago, high-frequency traders have been using bots to front-run other investors in the equity world for several years. Moreover, the scale of this bot activity is probably still small when viewed against the wider financial system. Nevertheless, there are two reasons why this tale is striking. First, it shows the difficulty of ever trying to build a truly democratic marketplace — with bitcoin or anything else — in a world of accelerating (and unequal) computing power. Second, it also shows the challenges of cleaning up this corner of finance. Thus far, regulators have shown little sign of being heavy-handed in their crypto regulation, preferring to rely instead on the principle of caveat emptor. Besides, very few crypto enthusiasts are asking for regulation (partly because they tend to dislike government intervention in any form). But can a fledgling product such as bitcoin truly flourish if there is no external oversight? Can investors find a way to clean up their marketsthemselves? Right now it is unclear. However, the next time you meet a crypto evangelist, point out the odd story of the blockchain bots — or direct them to the webpage that the researchers have provided, which tracks the bots in real time. If nothing else, it should spark more debate — and possibly another bitcoin row.

The expansion of the Interbank Information Network (IIN), which enables banks to share information on a mutually accessible ledger, comes after 75 of the world’s biggest banks joined the venture last year. The platform already allows banks to quickly resolve compliance issues that can delay payments by weeks. They also hope that by making the global payments rails run more easily they will be able to better defend their cross-border-payments business from the rise of digital payments providers such as TransferWise, Revolut and Ripple. The banking industry generally has cooled on the potential of blockchain technology to revolutionise the industry, but JPMorgan’s head of global clearing, John Hunter, said development of the IIN continued apace with plans to expand its functions. More than 220 banks have now signed up to the original service of allowing data sharing on payments over network so that errors can be resolved quickly. “The initial use case was around sanctions screening,” he said. “Now we’re looking at the ability to do more at the point of settlement.” Mr Hunter said JPMorgan has developed a function that would verify in real time that a payment was going into a valid account, removing the potential of it being rejected days later because of an error in an account number, sort code, address or other aspect of the transaction. “Banks straight through processing rates are in the mid-80s to the mid-90s. It’s that gap — the 5 to 20 per cent of payments — that have to be assessed by operations where we’re trying to alleviate some of that pain,” he said. The system will be live in by the third quarter, for both domestic and international payments, though JPMorgan expects it to be more useful for international payments, where error rates are higher. The IIN is also setting up a sandbox for fintechs to use the network to “develop and put out applications”. The testing environment, which JPMorgan expects to launch in the third quarter, will offer developers building blocks such as secure messaging, document file transfer and data modelling. “This removes many challenges and hurdles — tooling, ecosystem, data, environment, etc,” said Mr Hunter. “Developers only need to bring their intellect.” Recommended The IIN’s services are currently free, but it may eventually offer both paid for and commercial applications, with banks picking and choosing what they use. “Banks replicate a lot of the same infrastructure over and over again,” said Hunter. “There’s no reason banks wouldn’t deploy a utility type service with the network.” Emma Loftus, head of global payments and receivables at JPMorgan Treasury Services, said the network’s long term ownership also “depends on how it rolls out”. “It needs to be an ecosystem that’s supportive of the industry,” she said.,,Laura Noonan,2019-04-21T14:34:16.000Z,

A lot. So much so that Wright and fellow backers of the BSV version of bitcoin (which stands for Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision, obv -- a bitcoin fork), have started sending out letters threatening anyone who calls Wright a fraud with legal action. So much so that Binance, one of the world's biggest crypto exchanges, said on Monday that it was delisting it, and that it would no longer be tradeable as of April 22nd: Fellow Binancians, At Binance, we periodically review each digital asset we list to ensure that it continues to meet the high level of standard we expect. When a coin or token no longer meets this standard, or the industry changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it. We believe this best protects all of our users. When we conduct these reviews, we consider a variety of factors. Here are some that drive whether we decide to delist a digital asset: - Commitment of team to project - Level and quality of development activity - Network / smart contract stability - Level of public communication - Responsiveness to our periodic due diligence requests - Evidence of unethical / fraudulent conduct - Contribution to a healthy and sustainable crypto ecosystem Binance didn's specify which of these conditions had, in its opinion, been breached in the case of Bitcoin SV. But in a tweet on Friday, its CEO Changpeng Zhao said the following: Bitcoin SV was down 9 per cent at pixel, on a day when most other cryptos were up. Holy macaroni! Update: Bitcoin SV's supporters include founder and owner of CoinGeek.com, Calvin Ayre. He provided the following comment regarding the delisting: This decision will certainly be reported to the Maltese regulators as this is surely a case of people in trusted positions abusing that trust and playing God with which token gets the most volume and market access. In essence, market manipulation. The decision to delist Bitcoin SV seems to be based on the fact that they don’t like one scientist that works on the platform. Craig doesn’t own BSV, not does anybody, so this appears to be very unprofessional. An exchange should just want volume of trading not picking which horses it wants to win the race and, as a result, smells of fear and manipulation.

Especially when it comes to chart crime. Last April, $2m was raised in an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for a crypto token called Thor, which promised to "fix the gig economy". But as of last week, the project is no longer. Thor CEO David Chin announced its closure in a post last week, citing "many regulatory challenges...that prevented us from achieving what we set out to in our white paper". The idea of Thor, according to the aforementioned white paper, was to give temporary workers access to the kinds of benefits normally reserved for permanent employees, like pension plans, healthcare, and parental leave. All via the unique magic of the blockchain and "tokenomics". By April, the crypto market had taken a big dive from the dizzy heights of late 2017 and early 2018, and the idea that you could put your money into literally any ICO and the token would automatically go up in price had run out of steam. About a third as much money was raised in April as had been raised in January, according to tracker site icodata.io. So raising $2m in this market wasn't bad. You might think that some time was taken in producing the white paper -- the document ICOs use to flog their mystical ledger-beans. Not so much. Here's the first graph in it (shout out to Eric Turner, research director at industry site Messari Crypto, for drawing our attention to this chartological crime): The white paper also contained other stuff that it clearly took a considerable amount of time to come up with, like this, in the table of contents (Why is G for Gig?) The $2m the company says it raised has been reported as $21m across other media sites, but the company insists that's wrong, adding that the money "turned into $1M during the crypto bear market". The crypto market actually had a surge in April, in the weeks after the ICO, so the company would have had to keep most of the money in crypto to support the claim that the money they raised halved in value. But that would seems a little odd, given that presumably they would have actually had to spend some of it (most of it was raised in NEO tokens, so highly un-spendable). And it sounds like they indeed did spend it, given that there is now no money left.,,Jemima Kelly,2019-04-15T12:00:50.933Z,

The Washington-based multinational agencies stressed that “Learning Coin” will be inaccessible outside the World Bank and the IMF and have no monetary value whatsoever, and is therefore not a real cryptocurrency, like bitcoin. However, its development has helped its staff become more familiar with principles like the distributed ledgers that underlie crypto assets, possible use cases like smart contracts and enhanced transparency, and challenges like facilitating money laundering. In a statement the IMF said: “The development of crypto-assets and distributed ledger technology is evolving rapidly, as is the amount of information (both neutral and vested) surrounding it. This is forcing central banks, regulators and financial institutions to recognize a growing knowledge gap between the legislators, policymakers, economists and the technology. This project begins to bridge that gap and form a strong knowledge base of the technology among IMF and World Bank staff.” The Fund said the Learning Coin app would serve as a “hub for knowledge” helping host their content like blogs, research, videos and presentations. Achieving certain educational milestones will allow World Bank and IMF staff to “earn” Learning Coins. They will have no real value, but the developers are testing how staff can redeem the coins for some kind of rewards, the statement said. This process will allow the Fund/Bank to better understand how crypto assets could potentially be used in real life. The goal of this project is to promote knowledge — not bias. The app is a prototype that aims to show the good, the bad and the ugly of the technology, without hype or uninformed criticism.,,Robin Wigglesworth,2019-04-12T19:49:23.000Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/dc404d90-ad0a-34f1-be61-87478d8a10a5,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Blockchain for Brexit: a wonderfully terrible idea,But also an opportunity to show how nonsensical the technology is.,We've been here before. Blockchain, the antidote to all the world's greatest ills, is once again being trotted out as a solution to Brexit. The last time, you might remember, it was our dear Chancellor of the Exchequer, Spreadsheet Phil himself, who decided that the distributed and supposedly immutable version of the humble spreadsheet was “the most obvious technology” to tackle... oh just the incredibly complex and sensitive Irish border question. And amazingly (although also somewhat predictably), our Phil wasn't the first to suggest such a thing. There have been whole papers written about a blockchain for Brexit; countless column inches dedicated to the fanciful idea. This time, it's the turn of an “internet pioneer” and CoinDesk advisory board member Pindar Wong, who penned an op-ed entitled “Is it time for a blockchain Brexit?” (cc Betteridge, Ian) that was published on CoinDesk, a crypto news site, on Monday. But where our Phil lacked detail (admitting that he was no “expert” on the matter), Wong has us covered. He starts powerfully; passionately; provocatively: Wow, yeah. He totally caught us out there. Clever. He carries on: With less than four days to go until we (maybe) leave the European Union, the idea that we might be able to break the current deadlock by having a quick rethink of the very things that separate each of the world's polities from one another seems a bit of a stretch, but maybe the cryptographic certainty thing can help? No. Really very much no. Cryptographic certainty is the idea that by hashing down a set of data (like, for example, bitcoin transactions) and sticking that on to a block that is part of a chain of other blocks (blockchain!), thereby encrypting it, we get mathematical certainty that this hash represents that particular set of data and the order the blocks are in is the correct one. So it gives us a kind of finality about the records of that data. But the problem is not finality of the records of data. Unlike bitcoin transactions, which are just strings of numbers moving around the internet, actual matter needs to cross borders. People. Stuff. With lives. Homes. And hugely varied perspectives on political matters. There were some nice takes on Monday that derided Wong's op-ed, like from Jessica Klein in Breaker Mag who rightly pointed out the dangers of just throwing tech at problems without considering the real ethical dilemmas underlying them: And Yessi Bello-Perez in The Next Web, who wrote: They're both absolutely right in showing contempt for such ridiculous, excessive techno-solutionism. But where they don't go quite far enough is that they that don't point out that blockchain, as we and others have said before, is a particularly crappy and incoherent technology (and this is understandable; they are after all writing for pro-tech, pro-blockchain news sites). If a mistake (whether deliberate or not) is made at the point that data representing real-world stuff is put on to a blockchain, there is no going back, because blockchain is an append-only database. If the person creating the code (which in Wong's vision would automate the payment of tariffs) makes an error in that bit of code (easy to do), we have ourselves a big problem. And if we're talking about blockchain in the context of a centralised system where data can be overwritten and changes can be made, so that these problems could be overcome, what's the point of it in the first place? Blockchain throws up all sorts of new questions and problems and it's therefore a particularly crappy idea to be throwing it at such a particularly crap-strewn spectacle as Brexit. The thing is though, the more this idea gets bandied about, the more the blockchainers expose the ridiculousness of their other ideas. Where an open-minded and uninformed reader might have (wrongly) bought into the idea that a blockchain can help combat the illegal fishing of tuna or ensure clinical trial integrity, they are likely to draw a line at the idea that blockchain can in any way solve a problem as intractable as Brexit. Or for that matter, solve the utter lack of any form of consensus in Parliament. And that, for nocoiners/blockshamers like us, is the beauty of the blockchain for Brexit idea. It's so obviously not a technology problem, but rather a political, societal, historical, cultural, ethical and economic one, that the idea that a flimsy bit of tech can come in and solve it seems, frankly, preposterous. And that means that the credibility of the blockchain for other things gets chipped away at. (The blockchain for Brexit idea also reminds us of the delightful “blockchain for Bloxwich” report put forward last year by Tory backbencher Eddie Hughes, which we felt served a similar purpose.) As for Wong, though, it's all quite simple. The obvious answer to all of this is not only the blockchain, but also the chainers' favourite new partner-in-crime, the stablecoin (a cryptocurrency pegged to a central-bank issued currency): Someone is painfully wrong on the internet.

The San Francisco blockchain payment company wants to connect stuffy old banking with the brash world of cryptocurrencies. Tie-ins with the likes of Santander and Barclays confer respectability. Ripple’s digital currency XRP gives it kudos with crypto hipsters, even if its value has dropped from $3 to about 30 cents. Fans of the start-up hope it does not need to “hodl” (hold on for dear life) for a rally like investors in bitcoin, which is enjoying a modest bounce. XRP is meant to have a legitimate function in greasing the wheels of Ripple’s payment system. The lingering question is whether XRP is necessary. If not, the market worth of $14bn quoted by Coinbase looks high. Particularly when global financial messaging service Swift reported revenue below $1bn in 2017. Ripple’s cart is ahead of its horse. The company must prove it has a business model involving XRP that justifies the market value of the token. Investment in XRP has run ahead of its practical deployment. Ripple hopes its new xRapid service will change that. This uses XRP as a bridge between normal currencies for cross-border payments. Ripple says this will bolster liquidity and shorten transaction times from days to seconds. That should reduce foreign exchange risk. Large banks seem to prefer using Ripple’s xCurrent system This lets them message, clear and settle transactions quickly. It does not require XRP. JPMorgan Chase’s decision to barge into the same space is a problem for Ripple. Having once dismissed bitcoin as a fraud, chief executive Jamie Dimon has launched the bank’s own digital currency, called JPM Coins. These are exchanged within a closed network and are pegged to the dollar. The US bank has the muscle to extend the use of JPM Coins, albeit that some rivals will be wary. Ripple is a digital native.

https://www.ft.com/content/333c631d-69e3-37f6-a5a9-5a10f2727b16,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,Why security tokens are categorically and absolutely not crypto tokens,Pinch, punch, first of the month.,Last week, Alphaville brought you the news that a failed initial coin offering (ICO) project called Sponsy was trying to flog itself on eBay. In the story, we reported that part of what Sponsy was selling was a “full set of investment documents . . . designed and approved by investment bankers”. We also told you that when Alphaville asked Sponsy’s founder Ivan Komar about this investment bank, we were told that in fact this was a “law firm based in the UK” and then, on further questioning, actually “just some firm that was considering investing in crypto”. The firm in question was Memorandum Capital, a Poland-based company that on LinkedIn lists its head office as a residential address in Manchester, along with 132 others companies. As one of you lot pointed out, these firms have a curiously high number of Polish names as directors. Here’s Memorandum Capital's HQ (via Google Maps): We looked up the company, and decided that it was neither an investment bank, nor a law firm (as Komar had in the end admitted), but instead, a company that helps other companies launch crypto tokens. But it seems that Memorandum Capital was not happy with that characterisation. The company got in touch with a “request for corrections”, so we thought we’d respond to its main grievances here. To start with: This seemed to be the main issue, so we went straight back to the website to check we’d got this right. There, we found the following: It seemed the company's issue was our use of the phrase “crypto tokens”, and the connotations that term carries of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). Indeed, in a follow-up email from the company, we were told that “token launches in ICO is a phenomenon of the past, and we are not in that line of business”. An STO, for those of you who don’t know, stands for a Security Token Offering. It is just like an ICO, but ever since the SEC starting clamping down on these, crypto-types have been trying to distance themselves from them, and have come up with all sorts of different ways to describe the practice. A recent report from the FCA into so-called “cryptoassets” (a term we have some issues with), divided these into three categories: exchange tokens (the ones that pretend to be currencies, like bitcoin), “utility tokens” (the ones that tell that you'll actually be able to use to redeem with the company issuing them — a kind of digital coupon) and “security tokens”, which the FCA says are likely to fall within the parameter of regulators like themselves, and “provide rights such as ownership, repayment of a specific sum of money, or entitlement to a share in future profit”. If a token passes the SEC's Howey Test, it is a security, and therefore needs to be registered and regulated as such, and subject to securities laws. There should not, therefore, be any kind of regulatory or legal arbitrage available for the issuers of such tokens to exploit. So we can see why Memorandum Capital might have taken issue with us saying they help companies launch crypto tokens — even if co-founder Sergey Vostrikov calls it a “crypto investment boutique” on his LinkedIn — given that they only help companies launch one type of crypto tokens. They wouldn't want readers thinking that this was about trying to do anything that wasn't in strict compliance with regulations. Instead, under “Benefits of Security Token Offering”, the company says: They also point out some of the advantages of those famously compliant crypto exchanges: ICOs have been criticised for encouraging the kind of madness that allows people to raise millions of dollars in a matter of minutes. So we imagine that when Memorandum Capital praised its newly appointed executives for having overseen such mania, the company must just have wanted to make its new employees feel welcome (emphasis ours): So we hold our hands up here. Of course security tokens aren't crypto tokens and of course Memorandum Capital is not about helping companies launch them. Next was a complaint about Komar calling the company an investment bank, or a law firm: We felt the rationale of mentioning Komar's claim was self-evident, given that the whole article was about someone trying to flog something on eBay with some misleading assertions. But we thought we'd check to see where he could have got that idea from. We didn't find much. Except this, on the Memorandum Capital website (emphasis ours): And this, on the company's Facebook page (same same): Oh and on its LinkedIn, Memorandum Capital lists its industry as “investment banking”. So again, we hold our hands up. In no way has Memorandum Capital ever presented itself as anything akin to an investment bank or law firm. We’re not sure how Komar could have got in a muddle here. Another complaint was the nature of Memorandum's dealings with Sponsy: Memorandum said all they had done was a “Brief Assessment” of Sponsy, and that the communications was “very brief”. So we went back to Komar, who told us that Memorandum had provided a “sophisticated, 7-pages long, deliberate analysis of our team, software, project, and business model” that had taken two weeks to carry out, and had included a SWOT analysis and market research. Komar also said there had been a category in the assessment called “Things to check during Deep Due Diligence”, which he felt had implied the initial assessment was doing some kind of “subtle due diligence”, as he put it. An audit, according to the dictionary, is “an official inspection of an organisation's accounts, typically by an independent body”. Again, we can't understand why Komar could have imagined a “Brief Assessment” was anything of the kind, or how he could have thought any due diligence had been done. The company's final request was: We thought that instead of removing any references to Memorandum Capital it would be fairer to just respectfully write up a whole article about them. To sum up: if someone ever tries to tell you that an STO is just a fancy name for an ICO, or that security tokens have anything to do with crypto tokens, or that the real benefit of “cryptoassets” is that they allow you to skirt regulation, or that it's strange to have 133 companies headquartered in a 2-up-2-down in Manchester, you just tell them to stop acting the fool.

https://www.ft.com/content/136b079b-ab33-32cd-9caa-f77b97c76ac1,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,The Bank of Hodlers [sic] (sigh),And the myth of decentralisation.,Back in the late nineties, free-marketeers reckoned that by opening markets up to the point of total decentralisation, away from the overarching domination of rent-seeking monopolies (especially those supported by governments) and overly powerful middlemen, consumers would be hugely advantaged. There was no better example of this doctrine in action than the liberalisation of the California power markets, beginning in 1996. And yet, as is often the case, things didn't turn out as expected. Rather than encouraging prices to fall as larger numbers of smaller-scale middlemen competed for business (encouraging producers to respond to higher prices with more production), deregulation instead encouraged providers to withhold supply until prices got even higher. All this was exacerbated by the fact that many entities were still committed to fulfilling retail contracts at fixed prices, even as daily prices began to fluctuate enormously, allowing them to be ruthlessly gouged by new entrants. One of the key lobbyists for this sort of deregulation — and a new entrant into the market when it was opened up — was Enron. At the time, the group was becoming extremely well-known for its innovative financial thinking, especially with respect to the creation of new and abstract markets like weather securities and other wholesale risk products. But Enron was also becoming well-known for gaming markets for its own benefit, especially the newly liberalised Californian market, which it began to ruthlessly exploit at the cost of the state as a whole. In the end, Enron became a powerful rent-seeking middleman in its own right, making a mockery of the dream of decentralisation. The group, of course, went bankrupt in 2002, following the revelation of mass accounting fraud. The inquiries into the rolling blackouts at the peak of the Californian energy crisis that followed concluded that a market approach for certain utility services like electricity would always be inherently gameable and vulnerable to exploitation by new types of rent-seekers and middlemen. Bear that story in mind when looking at the following perceptual map: It's from the “introduction deck” of a crypto company called the “Bank of Hodlers”, which depicts itself as getting top marks for ease of use — leaving traditional banks in the dust, as you can see — and also for decentralisation. But this, we'd argue, is contradictory. How can something calling itself a bank — the primary purpose of which is to be a trusted entity that can look after people's money for them — call itself decentralised? It may exist within a decentralised network of banks, but with respect to its own structure, a bank by definition exists as a centralised go-between, not a headless decentralised organism. Its whole raison d'être is to be a middleman. The crypto sphere, however, is convinced that decentralisation can rid the world of such middlemen forever. And yet, in order to function, so-called “decentralised assets” such as bitcoin or other digital tokens rely on countless points of centralisation in order to be usable, like wallet-providers, exchanges and specialist crypto-custodians. The idea of the decentralised “trustless” network is thus proving a fallacy. Blockchain does not eliminate trust; it just shifts it about and grants it to entities that have no history of being trustworthy, often with disastrous consequences. But far be it from us to pour scorn on the idea of a decentralised bank — which actually isn't actually a bank at all, as we will see — without getting the perspective of the Bank of Hodlers first. So we called up Naveen Mishra, the company's “head of partnerships”, who told us the following: The above implies two assumptions by Mishra. One, that by removing executive function and human oversight from an entity the said entity magically becomes decentralised. Two, that core banking is so centralised that the positioning of any new entity even slightly further up the decentralisation spectrum is a win for customers and consumers. What the view ignores, however, is that conventional banking, just like the power market, is no stranger to liberalisation and decentralisation efforts. These have been going on for generations. As have, for that matter, efforts to automate the industry and make it increasingly headless — to the point, today, that algorithmic black boxes have replaced human traders and robo-signers have in the past even replaced human credit evaluators. The problem is, just like with the California example, every time deregulation, decentralisation and automation has taken foot in the financial world, bad things have tended to follow. Most of the time what is revealed is that middlemen or rent-seekers weren't actually eliminated or disempowered, but rather regenerated into new forms. Meanwhile, where algos took on the responsibility for human judgments, they were easily gamed, and introduced all sorts of new risks into the system. Those bad things then justified the return of regulation and the effective reformulation of human-overseen processes that “recentralise” the industry. Banking, in other words, has always sat on a centralisation spectrum. Currently, with initiatives like “open banking”, the spectrum is veering back towards decentralisation. It's also veering towards the build-up of wholesale systems serviced by competing entities within a structure that still commits incumbent utility-type banks to certain restrictive regulations. Even as these new competitors — free of many of these restrictions — aggressively eat their lunch, potentially putting the core utility infrastructure at risk. In the BoH case, the pitch is to “create a decentralised bank”, which apparently will one day have some infrastructure that runs on “a decentralised back-end”. But what does that actually mean? And why is it supposed to make banking services better? Historically, one could argue, decentralisation always failed when entities forgot that the successful provision of core utility services was as much about reliability and accountability as price. People expect their core infrastructure providers to be robust and dependable. If and when they fail, they also expect processes to exist that can hold people within the organisation to account. A DAO, or Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (made famous by the blow-up of an entity of the same name on the Ethereum blockchain in June 2016) does exactly the opposite. It obscures both responsibility and accountability, due to its lack of executive (centralised) leadership, like a zombie body without a brain. But that doesn't stop Mishra being a believer about the potential of a DAO system: So what BoH currently amounts to is an enterprise (can you even call it that?) that oversees decentralised assets, but which eventually wants to become a decentralised autonomous entity when the "legal structures" are put in place. But how can it? A decentralised company is an oxymoron. In order for the BoH to become one it would have to cease to exist. Back to basics on funding BoH's original plan, as laid out in the white paper as well as the introduction deck, was to raise money for the project via an initial coin offering (ICO). But they've decided not to do an ICO for the time being because they'd rather take the now apparently innovative step of building a product first. (That nobody can make any money that way any more or because concerns are mounting that the SEC may come down on them like a ton of bricks is, allegedly, not a factor.) Apart from the ICO and a magically “dividend paying utility token”, many of the other ideas laid out in the white paper and on the company's website have also been dropped, such as insurance against crypto theft. (Too difficult to do, for now, apparently — they would have to “solve further technical problems” first.) The only thing the BoH is actually going to do, for the time being, is to allow HODLers of Ether (Ethereum's native cryptocurrency) to use their HODLings as collateral for loans, at a leverage rate of 1.5 per cent, to borrow from other BoH users in a kind of crypto peer-to-peer lending system. The HODLers can borrow either in crypto, or in the lovely centralised stuff that is real, spendable, fiat money — if they want to pay a 7.5 per cent fee for the privilege of doing so (on top of the borrowing fee set by the lender). The BoH says it won't take any fees for now (though it website says it will), because like all for good modern companies, market share is more important than profitability. So how do you raise money for a crypto project these days if not by ICO? Apparently it's back to old school methods like “the equity route”. Mishra says the company has managed to raise $500,000 so far from angel investors in India. But given that the introduction deck and white paper (both of which include a “road map” featuring the ICO and the crypto insurance stuff) was the only documentation available to review the offering, we wondered what information these investors had been given before they gave their money to the company. Mishra says the content shown to investors was being updated, and that he “would like to reconfirm that we have pivoted and are building a financial services product for digital assets starting with crypto assets”. So as it stands BoH has raised money for a decentralised bank that is nothing like a bank, and is not doing anything remotely decentralised beyond allowing people to use “decentralised assets” as collateral on P2P loans. (As we all know, P2P lenders mostly mutate into more centralised banking structures eventually due to scaling forces endmic in the industry ). But they do say they're “democratising access to capital”. As regards to who they are targeting? On that basis, we can assume the revolution will be decentralised, but only for as long as it's expedient for it be so. Given regulatory attention and growing investor scrutiny, it's arguably ever less so. So maybe the lessons of Enron and the attempted decentralisation of energy markets weren't completely wasted. The fact that the Bank of Hodlers has been forced to “pivot” away from the original “Hey, we're building a decentralised bank, give us your money for magical tokens” idea suggests that the actions of regulators — namely the SEC — are having some effect. The mythical allure of decentralisation is not dead yet — Enron executives after all are reportedly looking at blockchain closely — but it's clearly dawning on the Bank of Hodlers at least that it's more of a pipe dream than they realised. (Not that they will tell you that in any marketing material.)

That's the starting price in an eBay auction for all the documents, all of the branding, all of the strings of 1s and 0s, and all the broken dreams of an initial coin offering (ICO) that never managed to sell a single token. And yet, the prospective buyer is told: (STO meaning securities token offering. Which is completely different from an ICO, you understand, because it's called a securities token offering.) Below is the eBay listing (right-click to enlarge): We called up Ivan Komar, the founder of the rather wonderfully named “Sponsy” that is now selling itself off. We asked him why the project, which he founded two years ago when he was just 19, hadn't worked out. Apparently unwittingly, he managed to sum up all that was wrong with the Great Crypto Bubble of 2017-2018 with his answer: Komar acknowledged that the lawyer's advice was probably the right advice from the customer's — or token-buyer's — point of view, but not from the point of view of raising money. So what would Sponsy have done differently if they had the chance again, we asked? Instead, rather than launching in late 2017 when “this crypto craze bandwagon” was in full swing, Komar waited until summer 2018, by which stage, he says, the “market had vanished and nobody was interested in our offer”. So even though there is no market for ICOs, or at least not for his ICO, Komar is hoping his eBay auction will attract an “enterprise client” with a big blockchain R&D budget — he suggested Bosch — or an individual who wants to try to launch an ICO into the non-existent market. Or just someone who wants to start a sponsorship platform that has nothing to do with blockchain or crypto. Komar told us: Again Komar — without necessarily realising it — had managed to rather nicely encapsulate the speciousness and incoherence of the ICO bubble. All Sponsy requires to function is a “typical, centralised server”, and yet its tagline is: “Decentralised Sponsorship Platform”. The eBay listing also contained some other potentially attractive promises to prospective buyers, such as: Aside from the fact that it seemed a little odd to be selling any kind of preapproved investment documents, this seemed good! Which investment bank had approved the project, we wanted to know? At that point Komar, who is Belarusian but seemed to speak perfectly decent English, appeared to get in a bit of a twist: The "British firm" that Komar was referring to was a Poland-based firm called Memorandum Capital, which lists various "contact" addresses in different countries on its website. On its LinkedIn, the company says its head office is a residential address in Manchester where 132 other companies' offices are also listed, according to Companies House Data. It is not an investment bank, or a law firm, but a company that helps companies launch crypto tokens. There seem to have been some other translation errors in the eBay listing, too, like: Here's the latest tweet: To be fair to Komar, at least he sought a lawyer's advice before launching an ICO. Props must also be given to his lawyer, who told him he'd go to jail if he tried to flog tokens before he had any semblance of a product. We're not sure why he thinks someone else would now want to buy this business idea, though, when he himself has given up on it. Komar reckons $60,000 is a “very low amount for the product we are offering. The ideal amount would be $200,000". Offers so far, with four days to go: zero. Watchers: also zero. Happy bidding, folks!

Where much of the literature has focused on cultural issues, he homes in on structural questions, notably the science of “phase transitions” — such as the “tug of war” between binding and entropy in water as it reaches freezing point. “Small changes in structure, rather than culture, can transform a rigid team,” he writes, relegating the full innovation equation to an appendix, for those who want to check his working. The “loonshots” of the title are the crazy breakthrough ideas that flourish if the two states can be held in balance. If not, they are frequently crushed or starved by organisations that have started to freeze into unimaginative bureaucracies. Bahcall makes the whole idea sing by bringing in references from across business, history, cinema and science. It is an ambitious and entertaining effort to lay out some fundamental laws of success and uncover the truth about successful group behaviour. Julie Zhou became a manager of a design team at Facebook when she was just 25, when the social network was still a start-up. She admits that after accepting her promotion she realised she had little idea what she was doing. The designer did not have that much experience of actually being managed let alone managing other people. Now a seasoned product design executive, Zhou has produced a guide for first time managers on what management is, how to navigate the first three months, how to manage yourself and how to hire well. But she is also keen to stress that once you feel you have finally got to grips with the mammoth task of managing a team, the journey will continue “like a toddler’s attempt at drawing a straight line — full of squiggles” and that the process is one of continuous development and learning. Charisma and swagger are too often seen as indicators of leadership material, says Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic. The reason is that organisations and politicians are no good at measuring competence and instead fall for confidence. Prof Chamorro-Premuzic’s book is a punchy expansion of his Harvard Business Review article of the same title that was published in 2013. It is an impassioned argument to stop believing the hype and take a cool-eyed assessment of ability. Women are often told to be more confident but he suggests such an attitude is wrong. It might be that they have a true understanding of their talents. This is not an argument for quotas for female leaders but rather for companies to promote people based on their competencies — if they do that, argues Prof Chamorro-Premuzic then it follows that more women will rise to the top. How do you encourage entrepreneurial behaviour in large organisations? This is the problem to which Sahar Hashemi offers a straightforward solution. The former lawyer and co-founder of Coffee Republic, a coffee shop franchise, draws on her own experience of both the corporate and start-up worlds, as well as the insights gained from speaking to 400 other large organisations. Hashemi aims to debunk some entrenched ideas, such as “big business can never have a start-up culture” and offers answers to common questions, such as “how can we grow big but act small?”; “how can we encourage innovative thinking?”; and “how can we be more agile?” Tha author writes that she is no innovation expert but her 10 “shifts”, as she puts it, are simple, day-to-day approaches to everyday work with an entrepreneurial mindset. These lessons are easy to understand (there’s no having to memorise complex management concepts) and take up just 140 pages. Blockchain is the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. According to Igor Pejic (a finalist for the FT’s Bracken Bower Prize in 2016), blockchain commentators, from tech analysts to industry experts, have “strong and differing opinions” on the technology’s future. However, Pejic writes that while everyone in IT and banking seems to have an opinion, “there is little systemic research or strategic analysis”. Here he aims to fill the gap by tackling common myths — that the success of blockchain will see the downfall of banks, for example — and examines whether blockchain can really boost the economy and help reduce inequality. Blockchain may make financial services cheaper, allowing banks to grab millions of customers, but as Pejic points out, this relies on a common misconception that blockchain transactions are free, when in fact they are not. However, he argues that if you are not on the blockchain frontline “sit back and enjoy the ride”, because despite the uncertainties, Pejic believes consumers will be on the winning side as competitive forces push down the cost of banking services. This trio of professors of, respectively, history, anthropology and economics, devised a “map” of social behaviour that aimed to capture “essential elements of human decision-making”. Their first attempt at such a map was technical and academic. This slim book aims to provide what they describe as “a user-friendly approach to the map of decision-making”. Instead of equations, it offers real-world examples of decision-making behaviour and the evolutionary processes underlying them. It is an enticing digest, with shades of (and references to) Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking Fast and Slow and James Surowiecki’s The Wisdom of Crowds. Among the real-world references are the NFL draft choices in 2000, when the New England Patriots picked star quarterback Tom Brady, and Rico, the “wonder dog”, who was clever enough to identify a new object placed next to seven familiar ones. The academics claim their map is a tool to help “organise our thinking in the face of complex and dancing landscapes”. Unfortunately, their conclusion is a depressing one. Despite the utility of their map, decision-making is drifting towards a situation where a brute herding instinct overrides the wisdom of crowds. Paradoxically, they write, modern economies might as a result be less efficient in selecting life-improving technologies than they were in the past.,,Andrew Hill Emma Jacobs Janina Conboye,2019-03-06T04:00:26.000Z,

Vakt, which is backed by a group of oil majors and trading houses, aims to digitalise the paper-backed processing of physical commodity deals using blockchain technology, with plans to expand after launching late last year. Etienne Amic, Vakt’s newly appointed chief executive, said the platform had signed up four new clients ahead of its official launch at International Petroleum Week, an annual oil industry gathering in London that begins on Tuesday. The platform has previously only been used by its direct backers, which include BP, Shell and Total and traders Gunvor and Mercuria. Other Vakt investors include Chevron, Equinor, and Reliance Industries. “We felt that we needed about 60 to 70 per cent of a market to reach ignition point [that would] incentivise other people to join,” Mr Amic said. Vakt aims to modernise the current process of physical commodity trading, where stacks of paper-based contracts, letters of credit, invoices and other paperwork are exchanged by email, fax or post. Apart from the buyers and sellers, other service providers such as terminal or pipeline operators, port agents and inspection companies are involved in helping the material to move along the supply chain. By putting the information processing and paper trail on blockchain, traders are looking to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Leading agricultural traders, including the “ABCDs” — Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Company — and Cofco are also exploring setting up a similar platform for crop trading. Recommended “It’s become more and more difficult to make money by trading commodities and any means to lower costs and shorten the transaction times is welcome,” said Jean-Francois Lambert, a commodity consultant and former head of commodity trade finance at HSBC. The desire to bring more efficiency to the processing of commodity trading comes as digitisation is affecting profit margins for traders, which have traditionally made money from proprietary knowledge of commodity flows but are now losing their edge amid greater transparency of data and information. Alex Booth, head of market analysis at Kpler, a Paris-based intelligence company, argues that levelling the playing field between dominant industry players and the rest of the market has helped correct price imbalances and inefficiencies. He said lower barriers of entry to the energy markets was leading to “fairer pricing for the end consumer”. Vakt plans to eventually expand to barges of oil products such as gasoline, in northern Europe as well as US crude pipelines. Experts say that the digitisation of the back end of physical commodity trading could hasten innovation on the front end, where the bulk of trades are still agreed by telephone. Some start-ups have already created platforms for trading raw materials, with Open Minerals offering a site for minerals and metals, and Boston-based Indigo Ag offering a matchmaking platform for US crops. “The younger people want to click, they don’t want to talk on the phone,” said Mr Amic.,,Emiko Terazono,2019-02-25T06:08:15.000Z,
https://www.ft.com/content/af901fb4-1f32-11e9-a46f-08f9738d6b2b,https://www.ft.com/blockchain,News Article,,The rich column: Crypto’s enduring fascination for the wealthy,Wealth managers are hesitant to recommend investing in something unregulated and volatile,In February last year, Forbes magazine published its first-ever cryptocurrency rich list. But only one person in the top 10 was identified as an “investor”; the rest were either currency co-founders or ran a crypto-exchange. Less than nine months later, all those on the list were 50 per cent poorer, after the price of bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies plunged. Yet, even at the end of the year, with the boom apparently over, more than a quarter of wealthy clients at one US investment bank were saying they wanted to invest in crypto, according to Hayvn, a new digital currency platform. Crypto appears to hold an enduring fascination for the rich. Last June, Capgemini’s World Wealth report found that despite the enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies, wealth managers were the sticking point, as they couldn’t trade or advise on crypto for compliance reasons. Another 2018 survey by deVere suggested many investors would simply circumvent intermediaries: it forecast that 35 per cent of wealthy investors would have exposure to cryptocurrencies by the end of the year. In December, with the price of bitcoin down to £3,900 from £15,000 12 months earlier, one start-up hoping to facilitate crypto-investing reckoned the rich were still interested. TokenMarket, which began by giving access to initial coin offerings, told the Financial Times: “Investors, including many high-net-worth individuals, poured money in, and we’re not talking chump change here.” In some ways, this undimmed enthusiasm is not entirely dim. Ahmed Ismail, Hayvn chief executive, says the bitcoin bubble has distracted attention from the longer-term future of digital assets based on blockchain ledger technology. “Some have implications for the way we pay for things: it is quite revolutionary,” he says. “You can compare it to the tech bubble of the mid-1990s. In 2001-02, the bubble collapsed. But we still have Google and ecommerce today.” However, offering exposure to Ethereum remains anathema to wealth managers, for two reasons: cryptocurrencies are not regulated, and most assets are too volatile. Regulation is a longstanding problem. Last year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission said it had no plans to reclassify cryptocurrencies as securities — a move that would allow wealth managers to advise on them. In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority is still consulting on guidance to help firms understand whether cryptoassets fall under its regulation. A key question is an adviser’s duty to know the physical location, ownership and security of assets. Or, as Hayvn co-founder Chris Flinos puts it: “A wealth manager is not going to tell you to buy a million dollars’ worth of bitcoins and keep them on a USB stick.” Volatility is even more of a problem for managers. In light of the bitcoin fall, no wonder Alex Shaw, director of Progeny Wealth, says: “We have maintained a cautious stance due to the associated risks.” Nevertheless, solutions to these problems may present themselves — thanks to those two start-ups. Hayvn plans to offer regulated custody to investors concerned about the location and security of digital assets. Under the US Dodd-Frank rules, institutional investors with more than $150,000 of assets must have a “qualified custodian” secure the holdings. None has been available, but Hayvn is working with regulators in the Abu Dhabi Global Market to provide this security. Meanwhile, TokenMarket is planning to make a less volatile form of digital asset available with regulatory approval: security token offerings (STOs). These are digital tokens built on blockchain technology, like cryptocurrencies, but backed by something tangible, such as a company’s assets, profits or revenue. As TokenMarket chief executive Ransu Salovaara puts it: “We issue real shares and bonds on blockchain. But we do not need to use [a clearing house] for settlements or third-party custodians. So STOs are cheaper, faster and more transparent, and regulated.” Under FCA rules, companies can raise up to £8m via STOs, making them a potential alternative to venture capital investing. Even so, in a fast-moving market, most wealth managers will prefer to wait. “STOs have begun to embrace regulation,” says Shaw. “Time can only tell how this will increase liquidity, transferability and transparency. We will keep a watchful eye on its longer-term viability as an equity of the future.” Regulated custody may help, too, but not enough yet for some family offices. “Families turn to us for careful stewardship of wealth. That doesn’t sit too well with being a first mover in a crypto initial coin offering,” says James Fleming, chief executive of multi-family office Sandaire. JPMorgan Private Bank’s latest investment theme: Industry 4.0 — or the part of the Internet of Things that focuses on manufacturing.

Most of them just want to raise a couple-hundred mil so they can empower the poor or save journalism or cure cancer. Yes, they might get a bit cross when people don't understand that blockchain is going to be bigger than the internet, but they don't want to take things too far — they want to be taken seriously and really don't appreciate hype, hyperbole or hocus-pocus. This above chart, then, must be frustrating. It's from ARK Invest, an ETF provider that “focuses solely on disruptive innovation", in an article penned last month by ARK CEO Cathie Wood on the “Big Ideas" for 2019. We included it in a piece on Elon Musk yesterday but we felt it was so innovative that it deserved a second showing. In case you can't read what is written underneath, it says: (“Cathie, we're going to need a source for this graph; that data are pretty disruptive of historical paradigms and narratives. And are we sure about those future returns?" “I'll sort it.") The x-axis shows the course of history since the late 18th century. The y-axis? Why, the inherently quantifiable estimated impact of innovation platforms on economic activity, of course. The steam engine, automobiles, the railway, electricity — all these “platforms" came and went. Blockchain, in green, seems to have had a negative impact on economic activity around 2012, but it now appears to be going vertically to the moon, alongside, and at the same time as, genome sequencing, robotics, energy storage and artificial intelligence. Wood writes that “each of these innovation platforms" will create “multiple trillions in market capitalisation". Better buy the ETF, folks. We “reached out" to Cathie Woods to explain how it all worked but she passed, this time. Good luck fighting the chartcriminals, chainers. The decentralised future is in your hands.

The technology will facilitate near-instantaneous settlement of these money transfers and will, according to the bank, mitigate counterparty risk. The payment technology is a prototype, and JPMorgan plans to roll it out to a small number of clients within a few months. Combining shared databases and cryptography, blockchain technology allows multiple parties to have simultaneous access to a constantly updated digital ledger that cannot be altered. Having initially been sceptical about the technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, banks have in recent years started to explore its potential uses. Yet some observers question the value of using blockchain technology for intra-bank payments. Martin Walker, director for banking and finance at the UK’s Center for Evidence-Based Management, said that “fundamentally, for firms to make payments to each other instantly when they share the same bank and the same currency there is absolutely no need to use blockchain . . . there are no technical, credit or liquidity implications [of such payments]. Many banks do it already.” JPMorgan said there were limits to instantaneous intra-bank cash payments, and it hopes JPM Coin may open the way for other blockchain applications. “Even in the simplest case of money movement across institutional clients of the same bank, there are cut-offs across borders so not all transactions can be done real time 24/7,” said Umar Farooq, head of digital treasury services and blockchain at the bank. “In addition, there are various other uses for blockchain technology that may involve other types of transactions (eg, securities, asset tokens) where instant movement of value over the blockchain is necessary.” Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan chief executive, called bitcoin a “fraud” a few years ago, threatening to fire employees who traded in it, but he has since expressed regret about the comment and endorsed the potential of the underlying blockchain technology. Gabriel Wang, analyst at Aite Group, said applications of the distributed ledger technology underpinning blockchain systems in areas such as trading might lead to improvements in transparency and record keeping. “I don't think that settlements are the endgame for JPM Coin,” he said. Other banks continue to experiment with blockchain. For example, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, HSBC, MUFG and State Street teamed up on a common “utility settlement coin” created by Switzerland’s UBS, designed to be convertible into cash at central banks. The consortium had hoped to launch the coins in late 2018, but the project is yet to go live. HSBC has used a blockchain technology, dubbed “FX Everywhere” to help settle some 3m foreign-exchange transactions worth $250bn — a small part of its overall FX trading business. The tools serve to simplify internal trade flows by capturing transactions between different parts of the bank on a single ledger.,,Robert Armstrong,2019-02-14T19:04:45.000Z,

Imaginatively titled "JPM Coin", the digital currency will be tied to the dollar, and is designed for the bank's institutional customers, who apparently will be able to use it to make instant payments among themselves. Here's the bank: JPMorgan, whose CEO Jamie Dimon (in)famously caused a sell-off in crypto in late 2017, mid cryptomania, when he said bitcoin was "a fraud", also says: So why is the bank launching the coin? JPMorgan doesn't really explain why it would want to exchange value over a blockchain in the first place, however. Unlike a public blockchain, in which the security of the system is maintained by a decentralised network of computers, JPM Coin would run on a private blockchain, the bank's own "Quorum Blockchain". Private blockchains are just centralised data stores, whose security is maintained by their owners (in this case the bank). It's not at all clear why the bank thinks using one can speed up its payments. In fact, some might argue JPM Coin already exists and that it's just a JPM deposit by another name. But far be it from us to naysay this fine stablecoin. What does JPMorgan itself think will be the impact on its clearing and settlement business, or indeed on other parts of the business?

While the collapse in valuations vindicated critics, it does not appear to have deterred true cryptocurrency believers from promoting its potential. New cryptocurrencies continue to emerge (more than 2000 at the time of writing). Moreover, their precipitous falls — plummeting 90 per cent for those who enjoyed the bubble — have led some in the market to describe this as a buying opportunity. The supposed investment case hinges on two complementary but equally flawed ideas: first, that each cryptocurrency has an intrinsic value; and second, that its value should appreciate as blockchain — the distributed ledgers to which cryptocurrencies are tied — delivers on its promise as the next great disruptive technology. It also makes the heroic assumption that policymakers will allow these activities to go on unchecked. To understand the main problem with valuing cryptocurrencies, it is worth dwelling on the features that make fiat money — what states declare to be legal tender — so potent. Fiat money works because it is issued by a power that: has tax-raising powers; can pay interest; can achieve productivity in the form of trade; has a monopoly on minting new money; supports all of this with the legitimate use of physical force (through writing laws and raising an army); and is recognised by other nation states. The more stable the government and the international system, the more societal trust there is in fiat money as a store of value. Libertarians and cyber utopians, who are among the strongest advocates of cryptocurrencies, correctly point out that monetary authorities have historically debased their currencies. But, in contrast to fiat money, cryptocurrencies are a claim on nobody, cannot generate an income stream and are too volatile to be considered safe for deposits. And they are every bit as prone to debasement as fiat money, not least because of the proliferation of platforms and the absence of a central authority to create a common standard — as the case of QuadrigaCX aptly exposes. In this context, it is worth making an observation about gold, which also lacks some of the attributes that help fiat money succeed. While the metal has its detractors, it has established itself as a store of value globally and over millennia. The notion that a cryptocurrency’s value might be tied to the success of blockchain is just as contentious. Blockchain may generate some utility in the form of improved security and reduced transaction costs, and may even prove to be transformative at some stage. But it does not follow that the tokens used to support transactions should be elevated to the status of tradable currency and positioned as a store of value, or worse still, an investment opportunity. It seems those distributed ledgers that use fixed exchange rate, asset-backed tokens — a digital version of the chips used in casinos — stand a better chance of prevailing in the longer run. As an asset or a currency, then, the value of a cryptocurrency is in the eye of the beholder. It has no intrinsic value, so to buy in now on the basis of how far the coins have fallen in price would be to succumb to a value trap on a grand scale. In short, cryptocurrencies are wholly unsuitable for investment. Recommended While it may be impractical to outlaw crypto trading, expect policymakers to scrutinise initial coin offerings more intensively as they are marketed as investments and homes for individuals’ savings. Even if policymakers act in an uncoordinated way, it seems unlikely they will allow the growth of independent cryptocurrencies over the longer run, not least because they appear ideally suited to the circumvention of government supervision — and the erosion of tax income — and have proved attractive to the criminal underworld. The spawning of cryptocurrencies in some ways captures the zeitgeist by responding to a prevailing lack of trust in society. Yet, by attempting to create an environment that does not depend on trust — if such an ambition is achievable — it is in conflict with other spirits of the age: greater transparency, more people and corporations paying their fair share, and environmental protection (when one considers the energy consumption associated with mining cryptocurrencies). Were cryptocurrencies to be adopted widely, they could undermine the very fabric of civil society. Whatever the future uses of blockchain, investors should steer clear of cryptocurrencies as an investable asset. Instead, they would be best advised to seek returns through active asset allocation and careful security selection of companies that support societal and economic development.

And now it is the turn of the stablecoin.,Ampleforth: not just an ideal school to send your kids if you're Catholic and can afford it, but also, "an ideal money". More specifically (and perplexingly): And Niall Ferguson, the rightwing British historian and who once called himself a "fully paid-up member of the neo-imperialist gang", has joined its advisory board. A bit late to the crypto party? Maybe. But this isn't the first time Ferguson has dipped his toes into the world of crypto. He suggested last year in a Bank of England seminar that cryptocurrencies were "the financial system of the future". He also said he felt it's "only a matter of time before the next financial crisis". A potential answer, apparently, is stablecoins. These are digital currencies that run on blockchains, but that don't float freely. Instead, they are pegged to fiat currencies like the dollar, or currency baskets like the IMF's Special Drawing Rights, either via the (supposed) backing of those currencies, or via the magic of an algorithmic central bank that expands and contracts the money supply to keep the price stable. Ampleforth is trying the latter. Here's Ferguson, quoted in the press release: But how does this free and equal system work, we hear you ask? Well, it's quite simple really: Capiche? Good. Essentially, the idea is that Ampleforth -- named after the character in George Orwell's 1984 who is responsible for translating poetry into Newspeak -- would be pegged to the dollar by means of a "smart contract" that would pump "Amples" into the system when its price topped a dollar, and withdraw them when the exchange rate fell below $1 per Ample. It’s easy to see why Ferguson might have been attracted to such a project. In his 2008 book The Ascent of Money, he writes: If any of the Ampleforth stuff is sounding familiar to you, it might be because we wrote about a similar algorithmic stablecoin with academic backing last year: Basis, which was had John Taylor on its board. (Basis is now bygone, having returned what was left of the $133m it had raised from investors.) Ampleforth is a little different from Basis, but not very. It is cleverly not pushing the idea of "bond tokens" or "share tokens" which, as Basis found, might make the SEC nervous. Also, it acknowledges that it will be "volatile in price and supply at launch" (though it doesn't acknowledge that volatility might extend beyond the launch). We asked Nicholas Weaver, computer science lecturer at Berkeley, for his thoughts, who told us: We're not sure how much time this advisory role requires, nor the nature or scale of the compensation (we have asked). But Ferguson probably has some time on his hands since resigning from a senior leadership role at a Stanford University free speech programme, Cardinal Conversations, last year. We wonder whether he has commissioned any "opposition research" on the host of stablecoin rivals that Ampleforth must try to compete with.

Not so in a large chunk of financial services. One of my favourite pieces of research examining this dismal state of affairs comes from French academic Thomas Philippon, who teaches at New York University. In Finance v Wal-Mart: Why are Financial Services so Expensive?, Mr Philippon crunches the numbers on costs for consumers. The results aren’t pretty, with increased intermediation just one of the smoking guns. According to Mr Philippon: “The cost of intermediation per dollar of assets created has increased over the past 130 years.” He suggests that the “unit cost of intermediation has been somewhere between 1.3 per cent and 2.3 per cent of assets. However, this unit cost has been trending upward since 1970 and is now significantly higher.” I can’t help but think that one of the biggest smoking guns is the web of fund administration functions in funds settlement and management, which helps keep the professionals in places such as Luxembourg in Audis. Let’s chart the chain of agents involved in a fund value transaction: transfer agents, fund accounting, global custody services, depository services, fund distribution solutions as well as index firms if we’re using exchange traded funds. Processes vary but we can note down calculations of net asset value, know-your-customer and anti-money laundering controls, plus a longer list of even more boring, repetitive but necessary tasks. The net effect is a decline in efficiency (with settlement of trades taking two or three days) plus the inevitable extra costs to fund manager and end investor. Perhaps technology can provide a solution? At this point I gently, hesitantly, fearfully even, introduce the dread words — crypto and blockchain. For the record I remain to be convinced of many claims made about this impossibly boosterish world of nerds. What I would be willing to place a small bet on, say a lunch, is that the disruptive technology behind distributed ledgers (DLT) could result in many job losses in Luxembourg and beyond. I’m not alone. A Deloitte report concluded: “Blockchain technology has the potential to wipe Luxembourg oﬀ the map of the fund distribution and administration market.” Bad news I’d suggest for those Audi dealers. More to the point I am beginning to run into outfits of varying size — such as Calastone, FundsDLT and Amun — that are beginning to figure out how to apply smart contracts and DLTs to the fund admin chain. Swiss-based Amun for instance has been quietly building a full-stack fund admin structure that could be used with outside firms — it was forced to build these multiple functions so as to launch its own physically-backed crypt tracker. FundsDLT has also worked with Amundi, the €1.47tn European asset manager. In effect, these early-stage companies have worked out that this long chain of fund admin functions is just a value chain of paper-based commands that need recording somewhere accessible and verifiable. Smart contracts, where technology implements actions based on conditions, can be built into permission-based ledgers and blockchains. Along the way we could see costs reduced and efficiency vastly increased with T+0 (same-day trade settlement) theoretically possible. There are already businesses building DLT-based architecture. Challenges remain: regulators will need to get behind these ideas, but the way in which central banks have begun to seriously consider digital ledgers — for emoney versions of fiat money — suggests that their bureaucratic minds may be open to the possibilities of blockchain. It is also true that the technology is not user-friendly and is vulnerable to tech-savvy manipulation. Open access to the transaction and settlement blocks scares many while even more insiders worry about scalability — my guess is that leviathans such as State Street or BNY are not quaking just yet. Looking even farther out, another vista appears: the tokenisation of most fungible assets. I would be a rich man now if I had received £1 for every opportunity spun to me about tokenising an office building (or expensive violin or bottle of precious French wine). A few projects have emerged in the US, in the property space for instance, but it is clear that the back-office settlement systems on which these projects rely are far from complete. If fund admin is blockchained, that could change; even better if the smart contracts sitting under the bonnet help cut costs (especially magic-circle legal costs) and result in access to new alternatives. This brings me to my last contrarian thought. Could a progressive regulator mandate a wholesale move to blockchain?

Cobalt was set up in 2015 by former Citi banker Andy Coyne and ex-trader Adrian Patten to create a cheaper and more efficient alternative to incumbents by using distributed ledger technology. The size and cost of IHS Markit’s new stake has not been disclosed. The investment comes as banks hunt for cost savings in trade processing as the margins they can demand from clients are squeezed. While trading in currencies is overwhelmingly done on electronic venues and increasingly through algorithms, processes that take place after trading have remained largely manual, fragmented and expensive. Technology investment over the years has largely focused on improving trade execution. “For too long, FX has been burdened by an ageing, inefficient post-trade environment,” said Mr Patten. “If we were to start building out connections to the market it would take years and years. Being able to plug into the [Markit] network means that we can get clients on board quicker and we can show significant cost savings to clients in year one.” Most large banks have a multitude of systems for post-trade processing, which creates additional costs and inconsistencies and leads to replication. That complexity also increases the amount that institutions have to pay for messaging and getting transactions completed. Cobalt has developed a way to create a single, unchangeable record for FX transactions, which Mr Patten said could cut costs by up to 80 per cent. Up to now, he said, the company had lacked the reach of some established peers. Recommended IHS Markit’s derivatives processing unit, dubbed MarkitSERV, is connected to more than 800 counterparties in the foreign exchange market. Through this deal, they will be able to access the full suite of Cobalt’s products and services with the existing network. “We are trying to re-engineer the whole trade lifecycle and create savings for our clients. It’s quite a profound change for the market overall because delivering confirmation at a much lower cost will allow clients to cut headcount, costs and to fully invest their balance sheet,” said Chris Leaver, managing director and head of FX at MarkitSERV. This month, UK bank HSBC started to roll out distributed ledger tools for clients for processing currencies trades. That came after the bank used the technology internally for more than a year to co-ordinate payments across its internal balance sheets.,,Eva Szalay,2019-01-30T08:08:11.000Z,
