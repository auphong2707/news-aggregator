PACEID reported in late August that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with technology supporters to launch its trade facilitation platform TradeXchange. In Tuesday’s announcement, a technology consortium including Technology Associates and CargoX (TA-CargoX) explained the platform would be built off of CargoX’s blockchain document transfer solution. “We are pleased to work with CargoX, who already does work in [the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)] and many other parts of the world, to bring fresh thinking on how to gather, build and utilize data for our exports from Uganda. Our target of [$6 billion] in five years would be difficult to attain without more [work on] our hard infrastructure as well as the soft one in digital performance,” said Odrek Rwabwogo, chairman of PACEID.   This is CargoX’s second sizable partnership aimed at bringing more efficient import and export practices to global markets. In March 2022, the company announced a long-term extension of its partnership with the Egyptian government to continue providing blockchain technology to the country’s customs facilitation platform, the National Single Window for Foreign Trade Facilitation (NAFEZA). With CargoX’s assistance, NAFEZA condensed over 26 cargo-related government systems into one, reducing customs documentation from 18 to six. This strategy is part of Egypt’s 2030 Vision aimed at improving technology across economic, social and environmental sectors in the country. Since implementing NAFEZA, import compliance costs have dropped from $600 to under $165 and cargo release times have improved from 29 days to under nine days, according to CargoX.   With its experience providing these solutions to help nations improve their economic goals, CargoX expressed its conviction in helping Uganda build a more efficient trade platform. “With proven experience working with more than 110,000 companies worldwide and CargoX processing more than 4.8 million electronic documents to date, we are confident that this will position Uganda at the vanguard of global trading nations, demonstrating their commitment to technological innovation and business transparency. Uganda, renowned for its high-quality goods, will now set a precedent in digital trade processes for other countries to emulate,” said Igor Jakomin, deputy chief executive officer of CargoX.

In 2018, IBM and GTD Solution, a division of Maersk, launched the blockchain platform TradeLens with the principal objective to leverage technology to eliminate the use of paper BOLs in global shipping. While TradeLens was able to onboard global carriers — CMA CGM, MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co., Hapag-Lloyd, Ocean Network Express and Zim Integrated Shipping Services — it announced in November 2022 it would shutter due to a lack of a path toward profitability. “Unfortunately, while we successfully developed a viable platform, the need for full global industry collaboration has not been achieved. As a result, TradeLens has not reached the level of commercial viability necessary to continue work and meet the financial expectations of an independent business,” Rotem Hershko, head of business platforms for Maersk, said at the time.   Now CEBS Worldwide, a large integrator for TradeLens’ product, is teaming up with CargoX to provide previous TradeLens customers with a working blockchain solution for digitizing BOL operations. “We are committed to digitalizing the supply chain network for all trading partners and ensuring all transactions and documents exchanged are secure, traceable, and immutable. We have good partnerships and teams working with the public and private sector to shape the future and usher in a new era of global trade that is both frictionless and compliant,” said Satish Swaroop, chief executive officer of CEBS Worldwide. According to both companies, the transition should be straightforward for customers who are looking for a similar TradeLens product, and CargoX has already partnered with a number of industry groups looking to standardize blockchain and data standards in the industry, including the Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA). “In order to create an innovative mobile application for any industry, you need a standardized way of communicating data through API integrations. We are not trying to standardize each company’s mobile application, just how they are communicating that data,” Ellen Sun, chief marketing officer at DCSA, told FreightWaves.   Using these global standards, CargoX assisted Eygpt in adopting its National Single Window for Foreign Trade Facilitation (NAFEZA), merging more than 26 cargo clearance systems and eliminating the need for over 10 additional customs documents for goods entering and exiting the country. In January, CargoX also proved interoperability for eBOLs after transferring global trade documents for a shipment between its blockchain solution and competitor edoxOnline. The transfer brought the traditionally long transfer process down to six minutes. “The digitalization of trade documentation is in full swing worldwide, and companies need all the support and advice they can get to implement the optimum solutions into their everyday workflows,” said CargoX CEO Stefan Kukman in the CEBS partnership news release.   “We see demand rising daily, and more than 104,000 companies registered on our platform prove that the CargoX Platform is becoming a standard item in the toolboxes of modern supply chain participants.”   Q\u0026A: Standardizing supply chain data exchange for ocean transport CargoX extends agreement with Egypt on transfer of global trade documentation   Q\u0026A: CargoX COO sees TradeLens’ failure as learning opportunity","TAGS":"Blockchain, CargoX, DCSA, electronic bill of lading, ocean carriers, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Grace Sharkey","CATEGORY":"American Shipper, Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Business, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2023-02-21T15:56:43-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/cargox-proof-of-concept-showcases-interoperability-for-global-trade-ebols","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/23/Fw_060920_Houston_Port-283_Data_1-390x220.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"CargoX proof of concept showcases interoperability for global trade eBOLs","INTRO":"Study suggests eBOLs could open up $40 billion in new global trade","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Document transfer solutions provider CargoX says that by utilizing blockchain technology, it recently concluded an electronic bill of lading (eBOL) transfer with a competing provider, edoxOnline, within six minutes, a process that traditionally takes hours or even days. The potential benefit of that streamlining is highlighted by a recent McKinsey study showing that 40% of containerized trade still relies on the transfer of paper record copies with up to 50 sheets of paper from up to 30 different parties. Sending all of this information using blockchain-powered eBOLs could reduce direct costs by $6.5 billion and open up potentially $40 billion in new global trade. However, a challenge to the deployment of eBOLs technology has been its interoperability — the ability for systems to exchange this information with systems outside their own network. This brought CargoX and edoxOnline together to prove the concept and showcase that currently available technology can make blockchain tools interoperable and bring savings to ocean shipping.   “We are proud to be part of this first-in-history interoperability launch between eBOL platforms,” said CargoX founder and CEO Stefan Kukman. “Distributed global computing solutions have emerged as an alternative to centralized systems. It is only logical that eBOL platforms provide interoperability between them to avoid centralization and market manipulation. We support standards-driven interoperability, and we firmly believe this is good for all economic operators and governmental entities participating in global trade.” Moreover, the eBOL for global trade is still very popular among global shippers. Since 2018, CargoX has processed over 3.4 million electronic trade documents within its system, which currently has more than 100,000 registered users. Another concern with eBOL implementation is the data and blockchain standards that would need to be utilized to continue to grow interoperability between global trade solutions. In 2019, the nonprofit Digital Container Shipping Association was formed by container shipping companies to create the technical standards needed to support the future interoperability of document exchange, trade finance and freight rating.   CargoX and edoxOnline used these standards for their eBOL proof of concept as well. “We are proud to lead this eB/L initiative of a distributed global eB/L solution built using standards published by DCSA,” said Kukman. “We support standards-driven interoperability, and we firmly believe this is good for all economic operators and governmental entities participating in global trade.”     Q\u0026A: CargoX COO sees TradeLens’ failure as learning opportunity Commentary: COVID-19 pushes India down path to digitized trade documentation Digital Container Shipping Association helping shape paperless trade  ","TAGS":"Blockchain, CargoX, container shipping, eBOLs, Integration, Shipping, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Grace Sharkey","CATEGORY":"American Shipper, Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Business, Finance, Maritime, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2023-01-24T00:01:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/qa-cargox-coo-sees-tradelens-failure-as-learning-opportunity","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/13/LA_Port_032219-213Data_1-390x220.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Q\u0026A: CargoX COO sees TradeLens’ failure as learning opportunity","INTRO":"Blockchain technology provider believes skeptics shouldn’t be bystanders","DETAILED_CONTENT":"What does the demise of TradeLens mean for the standardization of supply chain technology? Ocean carrier Maersk and technology corporation IBM came together in 2018 to create TradeLens, touted as an open and neutral platform underpinned by blockchain technology for the transparent and secure exchange of global trade information. But TradeLens said the platform failed to win widespread adoption and also cited the lack of commercial viability when it announced late last month that it would be shutting down by the end of Q1 of 2023. Questions remain: Will the global shipping industry be able to standardize its digital processes? What can we learn from TradeLens in order to move the industry forward?   To answer those questions, FreightWaves spoke with CargoX Chief Operating Officer Peter Kern. CargoX in March expanded its relationship with the Egyptian government to provide its blockchain technology to standardize the country’s customs facilitation platform, the National Single Window for Freight Trade Facilitation (NAFEZA). In the interview, Kern described the difficulties of standardizing blockchain procedures, what global communities have helped create the standards the company has applied to NAFEZA and what skeptics of global shipping standards should know about the industry’s tech-driven future. Questions and answers were edited for clarity and length. FREIGHTWAVES: What was your initial reaction when you heard about the launch of TradeLens in 2018?   KERN: I wanted to compliment their effort. I mean, bringing together such a complex and diversified industry, with so much siloed data, into one single ecosystem is a very bold approach. We did have some questions around data management and compliance and whether blockchain is a solution for this kind of network. We also had some concerns about having one of the strong industry players running a platform and claiming it to be completely neutral. FREIGHTWAVES: From your perspective, why did TradeLens fail to make a viable platform?   KERN: Personally, failure is part of this industry’s revolution. We are human beings, we privately fail and companies fail and we learn from it and make things better. It’s difficult to comment on what exactly led to the collapse of the project. They were struggling with getting enough collaboration on the platform in regards to other carriers and entities sharing data. FREIGHTWAVES: Your company is also working with governments, carriers and logistics companies to standardize digital trade document transfers using blockchain as well. How has your approach to standardizing these practices differed from TradeLens’ execution? KERN: We believe in the decentralized storage of data because we believe there is no single authority who should be able to intervene with this data. We are also laser focused on our approach. We are not trying to fix all the pain points in the industry. We have a modular approach. We see a pain point, we address it, we scale its solution and then we move on to another functionality of global trade. We started with the bill of lading, then we added advanced cargo information and now we are working on trade facilitation elements. We are building a data pool with features around how to manage the process paperless, using data standards put in place by the [United Nations], the standards for the BOLs and standards from the World Customs Organization for the advanced cargo information. FREIGHTWAVES: To build a solution to improve global shipping operations, it sounds like digital players will need to team up with neutral organizations that are already working on setting global shipping standards.   KERN: Yes, and we are starting to invest quite a lot of time and resources in being part of the working groups that are setting those standards. We are a part of the Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA) working on the standards around BOLs. We have been cooperating with the United Nations and the World Trade Organization to write white papers around these digital transformations. It is very important that tech companies collaborate in the standard-setting process because the standards need to be technologically adoptable and later enforceable. FREIGHTWAVES: What are the biggest hurdles to overcome when setting these standards? KERN: Trust is a major element. That is why we are sticking to public blockchain and decentralized data storage facilities heavily encrypted using decryption keys. CargoX does this so that no single authority collects, uses or misuses the data. Also, so far, we have not found an industry consensus on what’s best for everyone moving forward. Everyone is building different nodes in different locations controlled by different entities that want to protect their own data. Data protection in international and cross-border trade is very tricky. Lastly, blockchain is a complex technology. You need to use a very complex technology with all the technical specifications like encryption, cybersecurity, data protection, but the front end needs a great user experience. For a normal user, it needs to be a seamless process to join the network. FREIGHTWAVES: If someone was skeptical about CargoX or anyone with your same standardization goals of being focused on their own ambitions instead of creating standards that work for all global shipping participants, what would your response be?   KERN: With our expertise, it’s important that we are in the front seat and that our opinion is adopted by standard setting bodies. Rightfully, I must also compliment those who have got us all here — the International Chamber of Commerce, the World Trade Organization, DCSA, the European Commission and the World Customs Organization. They are very inclusive. My message to those skeptics is: Don’t be a bystander in the standard-setting process because it is quite democratic. You can influence and you can make your own comments and that is more than we hoped for just three years ago.

Moller – Maersk and IBM announced Tuesday the dissolution of the blockchain-enabled TradeLens platform. “TradeLens was founded on the bold vision to make a leap in global supply chain digitization as an open and neutral industry platform. Unfortunately, while we successfully developed a viable platform, the need for full global industry collaboration has not been achieved. As a result, TradeLens has not reached the level of commercial viability necessary to continue work and meet the financial expectations of an independent business,” Rotem Hershko, head of business platforms for Maersk, said in the announcement. The platform will go offline by the end of the first quarter of 2023, according to the news release. TradeLens was launched by IBM and GTD Solution, a division of Maersk, in August 2018 as an open and neutral platform underpinned by blockchain technology for the transparent and secure exchange of global trade information.   Zim Integrated Shipping Services joined TradeLens in April 2019, followed by CMA CGM and MSC in May and Hapag-Lloyd and Ocean Network Express in July of that year. By December 2019, TradeLens was publishing 2 million events per day and its ecosystem included more than 175 organizations. Marc Bourdon, senior vice president of CMA CGM’s commercial agencies network, acknowledged in October 2020 that it was highly unusual for competitors to cooperate, particularly when it came to sharing information. “Digitization is a cornerstone of the CMA CGM Group’s strategy aimed at providing an end-to-end solution tailored to our customers’ needs. An industrywide collaboration like this is truly unprecedented. Only by working together and agreeing to a shared set of standards and goals are we able to enact the digital transformation that is now touching nearly every part of the global shipping industry,” Bourdon said. At the time of Bourdon’s statement, TradeLens was gathering daily data from more than 600 ports and terminals around the world.   Andre Simha, MSC’s global chief digital and information officer, called the TradeLens collaboration “an important initiative in the digitalization of global shipping and logistics with the potential to help carriers and their customers to increase transparency and reduce errors and delays, all at a crucial time when the industry is rethinking and improving the resiliency of supply chains.” Tuesday’s announcement said Maersk is still committed to digitizing the supply chain “through other solutions to reduce trade friction and promote more global trade.” Hershko said TradeLens’ progress will be used as a steppingstone to advance Maersk’s digitization efforts and that the company looks forward to “harnessing the energy and ability of our technology talent in new ways.”   The announcement did not say what roles, if any, TradeLens employees or its CEO will have at Maersk going forward. Kim Spalding, who was hired to lead TradeLens earlier this year, recently told FreightWaves her priorities for the platform. “First, we want to help the industry scale digitization. One of those areas I’m focused on is partnerships. The second thing is just to focus on really great customer experiences, which means we want to continue to rapidly launch features that make our products better, and we want to expand the breadth, coverage and quality of the data that we have on the platform to help customers,” she said. Asked Tuesday what would become of Spalding and other TradeLens employees, a Maersk spokesman told FreightWaves, “At this point, we have no further comments.” CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd announce leadership changes in North America   MSC acquiring international harbor towage provider Hapag-Lloyd acquiring SAAM terminal operations in $1B deal Click here for more American Shipper/FreightWaves stories by Senior Editor Kim Link-Wills.","TAGS":"AP Møller-Maersk, Blockchain, CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd, IBM, Ocean Network Express, TradeLens, Zim Integrated Shipping Services, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Kim Link Wills","CATEGORY":"American Shipper, Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, International, Maritime, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2022-11-29T14:15:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/digital-asset-truckcoinswap-promises-free-invoice-settlement-fast-pay","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Data_2_120921_1-1-2-2.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Digital asset TruckCoinSwap promises free invoice settlement, fast pay","INTRO":"Fintech company plans 1st live token transaction for FreightWaves’ Future of Freight Festival","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Fintech company TruckCoinSwap (TCS) announced its transportation digital asset program has launched on CrossTower Exchange, a global crypto and non-fungible token marketplace. This is the first step for TCS Token as it looks to compete with factoring companies and banks. “The cost of milk and eggs aren’t just going up due to inflation. Banks and factoring companies are making it more expensive for trucks to operate,” said TCS Chief Technology Officer Jake Centner. “The very best use case for blockchain technology and digital assets is to disintermediate these types of financial problems in industry. “Using the TruckCoinSwap mobile and web apps — and TCS Token — transportation companies can now receive free invoice settlement and get paid sooner. TCS is helping to write a new chapter in blockchain and Web3.” In an interview with FreightWaves, TCS Chief Executive Officer Todd Ziegler explained the momentum behind providing a digital asset for the trucking industry, describing the factoring and banking systems that provide cash flow solutions for both trucking and third-party logistics companies.   “We started doing the math and while 3% of every receivable doesn’t sound that bad, annualized over terms, it is essentially a 20% to 25% interest rate on an advance of cash,” said Ziegler. Ziegler went on to write a white paper on the subject and quickly caught the attention of the University of Wyoming’s Advanced Blockchain Lab. TCS announced its partnership with CrossTower Exchange this past weekend during the university’s Blockchain Stampede conference. Working with the university and the lab’s current director Steve Lupien, who now advises TCS on its digital asset exchange, the company is now preparing a beta test with about 10 drivers over the next five weeks as it prepares to run its first live TCS transaction during FreightWaves’ Future of Freight Festival Nov. 1-3. While Ziegler acknowledged there could be some apprehension among drivers to trust a blockchain and token system for payment, adviser Lupien described how using drivers paperwork, or in this case, their digital assets, is not the same as trading cryptocurrency.   “The beauty of what TCS is doing is using digital assets as a vehicle for solving the payment problem. For the user of the product, it doesn’t matter what the back end is. Essentially a driver is going to take a picture of their manifest using their phone and then using a debit card, get nearly instant access to their liquidity at much lower costs. It’s not like they are trading in bitcoin or doing cryptocurrency in that regard. Blockchain is simply the back-end vehicle that allows TCS to provide that liquidity at a lower cost,” said Lupien. Users could also be concerned about volatility of these digital assets and cryptocurrencies in general, although Philip Schlump, TCS’ chief customer officer and lead developer, explained the security of the model. “Carriers and 3PLs need to get to liquidity, so they need to sell TCS. Drivers need to fill up their rigs and get to their next load. They’re not investing in crypto, so we’ve built the tokenomics model around that need,” said Schlump. “If TCS needs to buy the token on the other side of an exchange transaction, it will. In fact, TCS will become the single largest buyer.”     TruckSmarter raises $25M to grow owner-operator ‘ecosystem’ FreightTech investment now that the cheap money is gone Top 4 trailblazing moments for FreightTech in 2021  ","TAGS":"Blockchain, digital assets, Technology, TruckCoinSwap, Trucking, Web3, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Grace Sharkey","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Business, Finance, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2022-09-28T11:48:18-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tribal-aims-for-latin-american-smbs-with-blockchain-crypto","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Borderlands_Tribal-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Borderlands: Tribal aims for Latin American SMBs using blockchain, crypto","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The global cross-border payment market totaled $903 billion in 2021, and the worldwide blockchain and cryptocurrency market is expected to reach $23 billion by 2028, according to Vantage Market Research. Fintech companies such as San Francisco-based Tribal see big opportunities in challenging established payment services for cross-border trade using blockchain and cryptocurrencies. While cryptocurrencies have been under fire in recent months as their values have fluctuated wildly, the basic blockchain technology on which many cryptos are based is being adopted quicker in emerging markets such as Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, said Mohamed Elkasstawi, chief strategy officer of Tribal. “In the Middle East, even though you are a startup and you raise $10 million or $20 million, it’s still very hard to get a bank account for your company,” Elkasstawi told FreightWaves. “It can take up to three years to get a credit card in some countries. We have heard similar stories in Latin America, where some companies pay up to 300% interest for credit.”   Tribal is a crypto-focused B2B financing and payment platform focused on emerging markets, providing spend management solutions, multi-currency corporate Visa cards and payroll services for employees and contractors to small and midsized businesses. The company currently operates in about 26 countries, including Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Chile. About 62 million SMBs are transacting globally every year, with Latin America representing a $175 billion market opportunity led by Mexico, according to Tribal. “There are a lot of opportunities for countries like Mexico and other Latin countries to leapfrog to the new technology using new financial rails, where it can provide faster and cheaper ways to send money around the globe,” Elkasstawi said. In December, Tribal partnered with the Stellar Development Foundation and Latin American cryptocurrency exchange Bitso to launch a cross-border B2B payment service between the U.S. and Mexico using Stellar’s U.S. dollar-based stablecoin for that purpose.   Stellar Development Foundation is a nonprofit based in San Francisco that supports the development and growth of Stellar, a blockchain network that connects global financial infrastructure. Bitso is a Mexico-based global cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2014. Along with services such as corporate cards and digital spend management solutions, Tribal is launching a few crypto-specific products. “We’re launching a crypto as a cash-back service. You can think about it as crypto, but for businesses,” Elkasstawi said. “We are also launching a platform to connect to crypto lenders with SMBs.”   Tribal also aims to connect crypto lenders with borrowers who are running successful businesses and have a good credit score but can’t get access to lower cost capital with traditional banks. “A lot of traditional banks prey on [SMBs], so we would like to connect these lenders with these borrowers at much cheaper rates and for a fixed period of time like one to three years,” Elkasstawi said. Logistics startup Nuvocargo has launched a carrier billing platform with the goal of helping carriers get paid faster, save time on invoicing and reduce complexities when receiving data from multiple communication points. Anaid Chacón, Nuvocargo’s head of product, said the company’s clients pointed out existing billing processes in the transportation industry were a major point of inefficiency. “Nuvocargo’s carrier platform keeps track of all invoices and load details all in one place, helping carriers streamline invoicing,” Chacón said in a press release.   New York-based Nuvocargo also announced that Jonathan Rojas, a former vice president at Transfix, has joined the company as head of supply to lead the carrier sales and operations team and execute the rollout of its carrier platform. Nuvocargo was founded in 2019 as a digital logistics platform for cross-border trade between the U.S. and Mexico. The company offers freight forwarding, customs brokerage, cargo insurance and trade financing services. Japan-based Daikin announced it will build a $230 million manufacturing facility in Mexico, according to the Cooling Post. The 761,000 square-foot facility — the location of which has not been revealed — is scheduled to be operational by 2024. The company said the new plant is a response to increasing demand for its products in North America and Latin America, which include the Daikin, Goodman and Amana brands. Daikin is a global manufacturer of air conditioning and HVAC products. The company’s North American headquarters is in Houston.   During the first five months of the year, seaports across Mexico handled 3.3 million loaded twenty-foot equivalent units, a 9.8% increase compared to the same period last year. Mexican ports handled 1 million TEUs of empty containers from January through May, a year-over-year increase of 14.3% compared to 2021, according to data from Mexico’s secretary of the navy. Imports from January through May totaled 1.6 TEUs, a year-over-year increase of 11.2%. Exports also totaled 1.6 million TEUs, an increase of 10.9% compared to the same year-ago period. The Port of Manzanillo on the west coast of Mexico handled the most containers between January and May at 1.3 million TEUs, followed by the ports of Lázaro Cárdenas (853,782 TEUs), Veracruz (470,998 TEUs), Altamira (334,543 TEUs) and Ensenada (174,442 TEUs).

A new software-as-a-service player has entered the FreightTech community looking to add a marketplace option that democratizes the intermediary experience for shippers and carriers. Opening in September as a private beta test for both parties, digital freight platform Toggle looks to solve logistical challenges with real-time data, AI and blockchain technology by directly connecting the two groups and eliminating the business model of freight brokerages. “This will allow shippers to have access to all carriers in our platform with direct access to their location so they can independently manage their operations,” said Jeremy Spillman, founder and CEO of Toggle, in an interview with FreightWaves.   “For carriers, it will give them a complete, customizable solution to manage their business, and build relationships with shippers directly.” On the surface, it sounds very similar to the business operations of a digital freight brokerage. What Spillman says differentiates Toggle from these companies is the direct connection Toggle is creating between the two parties that freight brokerages normally separate completely. In a freight brokerage, carriers are often assigned or asked to bid on specific loads based on standards set by brokers. The same is true for shippers, who are rarely given the opportunity to choose their carrier and instead are given a blanket price by the brokerage with a margin that fluctuates based on the broker’s carrier relationships within given markets. Having a business as the intermediary often adds to everyday logistical problems for shippers, with unclear transit delays, erratic pricing models and issues arising from brokers changing their systems. Carriers find issues with brokerages as well from unexplained payment delays to barriers on preferred freight and inability to contact shippers and receivers for proper route planning.   “A lot of tracking is done through manual labor,” said Spillman as he explained the work brokers are currently doing to justify their margins — work that can be eliminated with applicable blockchain technology. With Toggle’s carrier network using its tools to manage their business coupled with integrations into electronic logging devices and easily accessible historical carrier data, shippers can get true real-time location updates or contact the carrier directly to communicate effectively. Spillman also described how his platform will enable shippers to build smart contracts, creating direct relationships with carriers that are seen as taboo within a digital freight brokerage business. As contract law continues to evolve within blockchain technology, Toggle will become a true decentralized autonomous organization to facilitate these contracts legally.   “Iowa is now at the leading edge of the inclusion of blockchain in contract law here,” said Spillman, as his team recently fought to have these contracts recognized under law in Toggle’s operating state. This distinct intermediary concept has enabled Toggle to raise $1.6 million from undisclosed investors in an angel round last week to prepare for its private beta testing next month between shippers of various industries and new carriers looking to help with capacity constraints. After proper beta testing, Toggle aims to provide its service through a hybrid model of subscription and transparent transactional fees. “There are a lot of issues within supply chains,” said Spillman. “We just want to make it as easy as possible for drivers to enter the market, grow their business and do what they love to do: drive.” Relay Payments plans to raise $60M for lumper remittance platform   TextLocate smooths driver and load tracking SEDNA raises $34M, brings ‘speed, simplicity’ to supply chain communications","TAGS":"Blockchain, FreightTech, Toggle, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Grace Sharkey","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Business, Finance, New Tech, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2021-08-10T08:57:32-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/co2-supply-chain-tracing-company-circulor-raises-14m-in-series-a","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AS_061121_1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"CO2, supply chain tracing company Circulor raises $14M in Series A","INTRO":"EV supply chain transparency grows","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Electric vehicle (EV) adoption is growing, which is increasing the demand for electric batteries and all the metals they contain. Because calls for decarbonization are at least partly driving this transition, some observers wonder if companies are sourcing battery materials sustainably and what will happen to these useful metals at the end of their life cycles. Supply chain traceability and CO2 tracking technology provider Circulor tracks “the flow of raw materials through supply chains from source to end product” and then attaches the appropriate amount of scope 1 and scope 2 emissions (direct emissions) to those materials, Circulor CEO Douglas Johnson-Poensgen told FreightWaves. This allows original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to see the embedded carbon emissions coming from suppliers for each part of a product such as an EV battery, he said. The London-based company closed a $14 million Series A funding round Thursday. Circulor said it is planning to use the funds from the “significantly oversubscribed” round to invest in expansions in North America and Asia. “Net-zero is impossible if companies cannot measure and start to manage the embedded carbon in the products they buy and consume. Traceability is an essential enabler of decarbonization. The circular economy also needs data on the state and location of assets that could be reused or recycled, including aggregating the additional energy invested in the reuse/recycling,” Johnson-Poensgen said.   Circulor’s enterprise software platform combines blockchain technology, business logic and machine learning to track supply chain data. According to Circulor, it assigns a digital identity to each commodity, making it possible to track the carbon footprint throughout production, recycling and end of life. “We are on a mission to make the world’s most complex industrial supply chains more transparent, and help prevent the exploitation of people and our planet. Traceability-as-a-Service is fast becoming a requirement for the world’s leading brands and this funding will help us accelerate our impact and revenue growth,” Johnson-Poensgen said in a statement. Circulor is the only company with proven technology to help automotive manufacturers and suppliers track EV materials such as cobalt, nickel, plastics and lithium, according to the company. The company is also involved in efforts to remanufacture automotive parts, driving the industry closer to a circular economy. “Month-on-month, the embedded carbon in the same battery will be different because different suppliers in the midstream were involved. While a life cycle assessment is static, our approach provides a tool that enables OEMs to understand the fluctuations and so use buying as a tool for reducing the embedded carbon in the products they buy,” Johnson-Poensgen said.   Volvo Cars invested in Circulor to trace 100% of the cobalt used in batteries of the company’s first fully electric car, the XC40 Recharge P8. The two companies are discussing expanding the supply chain technology cooperation to include carbon emission tracking and reductions. “We are committed to an ethical supply chain for our raw materials, and our partnership with Circulor has been instrumental in that regard,”’ Martina Buchhauser, chief procurement officer at Volvo Cars, said in the release. “By supporting Circulor’s ongoing development we can expand the use of blockchain technology in our operations and contribute to a more sustainable business.” Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Alyssa Sporrer.

Viewers from around the globe tuned in to hear about the community collaborative efforts around the development of open-source data standards that may be leveraged to create efficiencies for trade. BiTA President Patrick Duffy was joined by professionals who continue to push forward the development of standards for the use of blockchain-enabled business processes. They discussed how the community has been working while facing the additional challenges imposed by COVID. “While BiTA has always been a remote-first community, COVID, at least at first, really drained the bandwidth of the professionals that were doing some heavy lifting in the area of standards development,” Duffy said. “It also exposed the inadequate nature of the tech stack the community was previously leveraging.   “We’ve been very busy over the past year upgrading our collaboration tools and working on internal infrastructure to make sure we’re well positioned to move forward in executing against our mission.” BiTA’s collaboration platform, a tool called Acuwize, will be the new workspace that the community and external standards development organizations and stakeholders leverage to provide feedback, iterate on work in progress and utilize to distribute the standards that are developed. Rogers Stephens, the chair of BiTA’s Data Formats Technical Committee, discussed how it will now leverage OpenAPI 3.0 documentation and why it will promote interoperability. Ben Kothari, chair of the Location Specification Work Group and one of the founders of Acuwize, detailed how the new collaboration platform will solve the challenges of modern standard development and how it will encourage collaboration with other groups working to create business process efficiencies through the development, or refinement, of data standards.   Data standards need to be applied for impact, and the webinar introduced the community to the next chapter of BiTA’s work – the Implementation Technical Committee. Chaired by professor Daniel Conway from the University of Arkansas’ Blockchain Center of Excellence, this new committee is working with top technologists across leading transportation and supply companies to frame up the business practices that are ripe for blockchain-enabled processes that leverage open-source data standards.

Supply chains are having a moment. President Joe Biden issued an Executive Order on America’s Supply Chains on Feb. 24, in which he stated, “More resilient supply chains are secure and diverse — facilitating greater domestic production, a range of supply, built-in redundancies, adequate stockpiles, safe and secure digital networks, and a world-class American manufacturing base and workforce. Moreover, close cooperation on resilient supply chains with allies and partners who share our values will foster collective economic and national security and strengthen the capacity to respond to international disasters and emergencies.” UN Climate Change issued a Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) Synthesis Report on Feb. 26, “showing nations must redouble efforts and submit stronger, more ambitious national climate action plans in 2021 if they’re to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise by 2°C — ideally 1.5°C — by the end of the century.”   The report quotes U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres saying that 2021 is a make-or-break year in the world’s effort to confront climate change. Press reports on Monday indicated that China is taking steps to bolster its domestic supply chains in industries that the government deems strategic, with immediate attention being paid to semiconductor chip manufacturing. In addition, Wall Street is warming to environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing so much that the CFA Institute is developing a set of standards to guide investment managers. According to a Nov. 22 article published by the Financial Times, the CFA Institute, “the global organisation that hands out the coveted designation of ‘Chartered Financial Analyst,’ recently became the latest body to try to inject order into the space by starting work on a standardised framework for ESG disclosures.” I am a member of the CFA Institute. That is not all. On Feb. 9, The Wall Street Journal reported that investors and analysts increasingly expect corporations to report ESG information, stating, “Providing frequent updates about the sustainability of their business is becoming more crucial for finance chiefs, as analysts and investors increasingly rely on this information when evaluating a company’s outlook and its creditworthiness.”   The reader will be forgiven for thinking, “OK, Brian. You have mentioned climate change. Now you are talking about ESG investing. I don’t see supply chains mentioned anywhere yet? What am I missing?” This is what is not always obvious. Climate change is all about supply chains. ESG concerns are entirely about the environmental and social impact that are a consequence of the way the supply chains that enable production, consumption and trade are being managed by the corporations that control them. ESG concerns are also entirely about how humanity governs the operation of global supply chain networks, with large corporations and governments acting as the proxy for every man, woman and child. Yes, between the climate crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chains are having a moment. I believe we are on the cusp of a golden age of technology-led innovation in supply chain.   FreightWaves has been at the forefront of reporting on many of these trends: electric vehicles. mobility, logistics technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, blockchain and distributed ledger technology. The just-ended Global Supply Chain Week also highlighted progress in this area. In this column I have tried to give you a window into what early-stage venture capitalists like me see emerging at the intersection of supply chain, innovation and technological invention. On March 23, 2020, FreightWaves ran An open letter to the Supply Chain Caucus of the U.S. House of Representatives, in which Craig Fuller, FreightWaves’ founder and CEO; Lisa Morales-Hellebo, my co-founder at REFASHIOND Ventures; and I called on “leaders and professionals in supply chain, innovation, and technology, whether based in the United States or abroad, to unite in helping the recently formed Supply Chain Caucus of the U.S. House of Representatives as well as leaders in other countries set an agenda for supply chain, innovation and technology that is built to withstand the challenges the world will contend with in the future.” On Jan. 21, 2020, FreightWaves published Commentary: Davos 2020 is about supply chains, disguised as climate change, in which I argued that “the supply chains on which human civilization has been built must be refashioned. Man-made supply chains are having a severe adverse impact on natural supply chains and ecosystems, and mankind’s current path is unsustainable.” On March 5, 2020, FreightWaves ran Commentary: Is 2020 the year of supply chain risk?, in which I argued that “2020 marks a watershed moment in how we all think about supply chain risk and how corporate executives think about managing the risks inherent in their supply chain.”   People now want resilient supply chains that do not continue to harm the environment. COVID-19 has forced us all to grapple with how utterly dependent we are on the supply chains that form the foundations on which modern society has been built. Supply chains are having a moment. I wish I could predict what this moment will translate to 10, 20, 30 years from now. I can’t do that. But I can continue reporting on what I see happening today among the men and women who are working to define the future of the supply chains that you and I will be reliant upon. If you are a team working on innovations that you believe have the potential to significantly refashion global supply chains, we’d love to tell your story in FreightWaves.

He has over 20 years of experience working with organizations around the world such as Intel, Siemens and Blue Buffalo on business performance improvement, organizational change and enterprisewide digital transformation initiatives. KEY QUOTES FROM GOLDSTON: “Supply chains are complex for a reason. In some aspects, we have modern slavery within our supply chains. We have child labor in our supply chains. And I think we can leverage technology such as blockchain to increase the transparency through the supply chain.” “We can create supply chains where we start from the farm and start putting those transactions on the supply chain in a permission-list blockchain that’s transparent to consumers around the world. So, if you have a particular garment’s lot number on the blockchain, you can track and trace that garment all the way to the source.” “If, let’s say Amazon, instituted a policy that says all transactions that go into making a particular garment have to be put on the blockchain, then all the business partners will have skin in the game. Whenever a manufacturer has to have its information on the blockchain, it has to go to all of its suppliers and say, ‘In order for us to continue to do business — because Amazon makes up this percentage of my business — you have to put your transaction on the blockchain.’ That’s where we move upstream through the supply chain.”","TAGS":"Blockchain, ethical supply chains, Global Supply Chain Week, Supply chain, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2021-02-26T11:15:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/gscw-chat-recap-new-opportunities-ahead-via-open-mobility-network","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/mobi-pic.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"GSCW chat recap: New opportunities ahead via Open Mobility Network","INTRO":"‘For the first time, we can begin to export digital economics to physical things’","DETAILED_CONTENT":"This fireside chat recap is from Day 4 of FreightWaves Global Supply Chain Week.

Passing it was the goal, but I think we were realistic to just get through it. There was a phrase we didn’t want to hear; it was called ‘pencils down.’ Everything is so messed up, I can’t even do this, I can’t even audit it.” “At one point, there was an entity within DOD that said, ‘I want blockchain.’ And when his or her folks said, ‘To do what?’ the answer was, ‘I want blockchain.’ No clue as to why, just ‘I’ve heard about this.’ I think there’s a quote from an admiral back in World War I or II — ‘I don’t know what this logistics thing is but I want some of it.’ It’s kind of similar to that.

The day’s focus on energy, chemicals and mining will kick off with an interview conducted by FreightWaves Executive Publisher Kevin Hill, who sits down with Benjamin Shattuck, director of Wood Mackenzie’s Lower 48 team. The exploration and production activity in the lower 48 of the U.S. has had a wild year with a plunge in prices followed by a slowly rising market that at the time of his interview may have crude oil prices at levels right where they were before the pandemic. But at the same time, it’s a business that needs a constant infusion of new lending and is a target of divestiture, either for political or business reasons. Shattuck will speak on the need for that capital, whether the industry will get enough of it and whether that may impact it in the future. Looking back a bit, interviewer John Kingston will speak with two trucking executives from Texas on how they handled the pandemic that flattened prices and sent drilling activity plunging in the first half of 2020, with a recovery in the second half of the year. John Esparaza is the president of the Texas Trucking Association and Bob McDowell is the president and owner of W.M. Dewey \u0026 Son Inc., a trucking company serving the oil patch. The two of them discuss how tough it got as the industry imploded around them and what steps they took to bring back the Dewey business or in the case of Esparza, the businesses of so many of the association’s members.   Kingston also will interview Rana Basu, the founder and COO of Omniflo. Basu’s Omniflo was one of the first companies to try to bring blockchain into supply chain solutions in the oil patch. He’s been able to see the successes and the places where there’s been resistance to the supply chain turning to this solution, which from day one was always viewed as having strong potential to improve logistics. Tim Sensenig, the chairman and CEO of TMS First, also joins the energy-focused day of the summit to discuss his company’s cloud-based logistics system that leans heavily toward an energy-focused base of customers. TMS First is based in Houston and a hefty portion of its customers are operating in the oil patch with an entirely separate set of logistics needs that his technology solutions seek to address.

In a recent announcement, the company said as a result of a more than $2 million payment to the Securities \u0026 Exchange Commission, ShipChain “is now without sufficient resources to continue its business. Consequently, ShipChain Inc. has made the difficult decision to cease operations and is now in the process of closing its affairs.” In the announcement, ShipChain said it had been cooperating with the SEC over the status of the SHIP token. The initial coin offering (ICO) that put SHIP tokens into circulation in late 2017 was actually a sale of securities that had not registered with the SEC. That inquiry, ShipChain said in its statement, concluded that the sale of the tokens did require registration. To settle the charges, ShipChain will pay $2.05 million to the SEC. The money will be used to create a Fair Fund, a creation administered by the SEC and authored under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2020, that disburses payments to people who have a claim against the unregistered sale of the SHIP tokens.   According to the settlement document, ShipChain raised $27.6 million in its ICO, selling more than 145 million tokens. Based on what ShipChain management was telling buyers of the tokens, “SHIP tokens were offered and sold as investment contracts, and therefore securities,” the settlement document said, citing other legal precedents that established what constituted an unregistered sale of securities. “A purchaser in the offering of SHIP tokens would have had a reasonable expectation of obtaining a future profit based on ShipChain’s representations and efforts to build its business.” ShipChain’s plans were to build a shipping and logistics platform on the back of Ethereum blockchain technology, which is the preferred blockchain technology for such applications. The far better known bitcoin platform is a digital currency, with sales of bitcoin powered by blockchain. But its platform is not seen as adequate to host actual applications, unlike Ethereum. “ShipChain publicized the potential impact of its platform on the transportation and logistics industry and the necessity of SHIP token ownership to participate in any capacity on the platform,” the settlement document said.   The plan that investors were told is that the funds from the ICO would be used to build the platform. As the settlement document notes, the platform was not up and running at the time of the ICO. The ShipChain platform had made some progress. This past summer, it introduced its Mainnet, which is a blockchain protocol that would allow users to transact on a less-congested platform than Ethereum. “A big part of the Mainnet launch is the ability for others to develop on top of the platform,” the company said in a blog post at the time of the release. “Other developers are welcome and encouraged to build on top of ShipChain, further enhancing its utility for end users.” ShipChain was founded by John Monarch. Its history was always rocky; in the summer of 2018, South Carolina, where the company was based, had issued a cease-and-desist order over the same issue that ultimately brought the company down by the SEC: the allegation that the sale of the SHIP token was an unlicensed security sale.   Some of the work it has accomplished can be built on, the company said in announcing its closure. “The substantial work that we have done … is open-source and so can, we expect, help accelerate that innovation pathway,” it said.

The rise and fall of coronavirus outbreaks has made for “a very dynamic situation” and requires close collaboration among the shipping lines and their port partners, customers and intermodal providers, he said. “It takes a whole community.” A digital community would provide that needed transparency and visibility as the world’s ports currently struggle with congestion caused by import surges that followed factory shutdowns, particularly in China.   “We need to be able to react when we see things that are turning,” Hughes said. “Watching those trends now so very closely is what’s most important for us right now.” Based in New York, Hughes oversees all U.S. imports for MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co. MSC launched its Instant Quote e-tool this summer and completed its integration onto the TradeLens blockchain-enabled shipping platform in mid-October. During the height of shutdowns, “we allowed containers to basically rest or sit at different transshipment hubs around the globe until things started to open up. And did they ever,” Hughes said.   “The demand started creeping back and suddenly it started taking off,” he continued, pointing out that MSC added services during the third quarter to meet the need. “We also brought in extra loaders to help because the demand was so great.” Hughes said MSC was able to do this by maintaining close contact with stakeholders — and making changes where needed. “Obviously everything with COVID is a learning curve — working from home, buying things from home.” MSC expects the import rush in the U.S. seen in Q3 to continue into the first quarter of 2021.   “We have to manage capacity and that’s something that we’ve been doing. … We’re trying to do it smartly,” Hughes said. “It’s kind of a prudent approach to capacity management.” All this, he said, drives home the “need to be agile and nimble and the need for digitization.” Like the ocean carriers, ports around the world have been issuing “busiest month ever” reports for October. Port Houston has joined that bandwagon, heralding its single busiest month. Port Houston in October handled more than 296,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), its highest total in a single month and a 15% increase over the same period last year. Notably, 2019 was the port’s busiest year and as of the end of October, it is only trending 1% down. Ty Reasonover, senior manager of trade development for Port Houston, said during Thursday’s webinar that the fourth quarter is looking “very, very strong.”   Reasonover said the port is planning for larger container ships in part with the widening of the shipping channel by 170 feet to 700 feet along Galveston Bay and deepening of upstream segments of the channel to 45 feet. The project is slated for a 2024 completion, Reasonover said. Funding is included in the Water Resources Development Act, which has passed the U.S. House and sits in the Senate, he said.

This problem stems from logistics stakeholders struggling to trust their partners both upstream and downstream in the value chain, jeopardizing data interconnectivity and the resulting efficiency gain. Blockchain as a technology can be a powerful tool to infuse trust into a value chain, especially in situations that require transactions to be made based on data arising from different stakeholders in the network. FreightWaves spoke with executives from Data Gumbo, a blockchain-based smart contract platform, to understand how blockchain can be leveraged across the logistics industry to ensure seamless transactions. “At Data Gumbo, we automate the execution of contracts between buyers and sellers using a combination of data held by those parties and other third parties to confirm those transactions have occurred. Our platform then automatically calculates the appropriate payments and pushes that information back in a pre-reconciled way to the parties’ systems of record — be that SAP, Oracle or QuickBooks,” said William Fox, chief product officer at Data Gumbo. Data Gumbo works in the oil and gas logistics space, where it helps enforce trust into transactions incurred around the trucking of produced water that is hauled from oil wells to disposal facilities. Fox explained that the company frequently heard from trucking companies that complain of their payments getting delayed, as the usual 30-day payment terms get extended to over 45 days due to invoices getting disputed and kicked around before being paid.   A blockchain network serves to eliminate such disputes, while also reducing massive physical paper documentation that translates into saved operational costs. “Savings can be looked at in other ways. For instance, in the diesel context, there are 3-6 cents per gallon of saved costs on our platform. Getting paid on time reduces the interest charge of financing your customer, who’s not paying fast enough and less administration, middleware and subscription software that needs to be paid from your pocket,” said Fox. To enable such transactions through the blockchain network, it is crucial for data that enters the system to be standardized across the value chain. Since it is not feasible to ask every stakeholder in the trucking supply chain to be compliant with data standards, Data Gumbo looks to bridge the gap by acting as a standardized aggregator. “We utilize standards where they’re available. But we map our data to a standard model within our system. In essence, we aren’t trying to get the industry to standardize but use our internal model to map data,” said Andrew Bruce, the CEO of Data Gumbo. “This relieves companies of the burden to standardize while getting on the network.” Data Gumbo’s quest to create seamless trusted transactions centers around ensuring the data it uses is reliable and with little margin of error. Within the blockchain consortium, the margin of error is capped at 1.6% for transactions to remain automated between two parties, with a larger margin of error in transactions needing manual intervention before approval.   “This way, companies become highly interested in data. This is because there is a high incentive in making sure the data quality is high, and data is accurate,” said Bruce. Data Gumbo recently partnered with Texas Alliance of Energy Producers to deploy its interconnected blockchain network to its members, powering smart contracts that help stakeholders cut operational costs and increase efficiencies in commercial transactions. By ensuring a trusted environment for data sharing, Data Gumbo has enabled energy producers to capture the value and mitigate risk via better and informed decisions.

The Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA) wants to make those savings reality and on Tuesday released its first publication as part of its just-in-time (JIT) port call program. DCSA said by moving the industry toward a JIT port call process, established standards will enable container ships to optimize their steaming speed, lowering fuel consumption and reducing CO2 emissions because they won’t be stuck outside ports waiting for berthing slots. “The JIT port call will streamline a number of key processes for industry stakeholders and it will also benefit the environment,” said DCSA CEO Thomas Bagge in Tuesday’s statement. “Enabling a vessel to optimize its speed during the voyage to arrive just in time at the pilot boarding place, when berth availability is ensured, will significantly reduce the amount of fuel consumed. “Achieving this will require digital collaboration between carriers, ports and terminals,” said Bagge, formerly an executive with A.P. Møller – Maersk. “DCSA digital standards play an important role in establishing the harmonious ecosystem that will allow this level of collaboration and today’s release is the first step towards the creation of that ecosystem.” Port Call Data Definitions can be downloaded for free from the DCSA website. The definitions are designed to help carriers, ports and terminals exchange event data in a uniform way, enabling digital planning and operational optimization.   Widespread adoption is the first step toward achieving a digital, global, transparent, just-in-time port call ecosystem, DCSA said in its announcement. DCSA was founded in April 2019 to drive standardization, digitization and interoperability in container shipping. The Amsterdam-based nonprofit is made up of nine container carriers: MSC, Maersk, CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd, Evergreen, Yang Ming, HMM, ZIM and Ocean Network Express (ONE). The latest release is part of DCSA’s continuing efforts to make information sharing easier. In early July, it tackled ship-related information transparency with the publication of standards for the exchange of operational vessel schedules. In June, it published what it said were the first Internet of Things connectivity standards for shipping containers. And in May, it announced a collaborative effort to push for industry adoption of electronic bills of lading. DCSA said its port call data definitions align with International Maritime Organization and International Task Force Port Call Optimization JIT standards. The task force has said that improving the quality and availability of event data, including planned time of arrival at berth and estimated time of completion of cargo operations, will enable just-in-time berth scheduling and preplanning of port services. Subsequent releases in DCSA’s JIT port call program will include application programming interface definitions for automating the exchange of event data.   Frank Kho, CEO of Terminal Industry Committee 4.0, applauded DCSA’s efforts to develop standards to enable greater port call efficiency. “Port call optimization will enable terminal operators to provide many benefits to their shipping customers,” Kho said in Tuesday’s announcement. “With just-in-time port calls, arrival times and berth space can be optimally managed. This means capacity, equipment and staffing can be more accurately estimated and planned.” Webinars will be scheduled to provide more information about the DCSA JIT port call standards.

The digital platform, which is designed to help ensure a more fully integrated, timely and consistent view of logistics data for containerized freight around the world, is run on the IBM Cloud and IBM Blockchain. TradeLens was jointly developed by IBM and A.P. Møller – Maersk and launched as a beta product in August 2018. By the time a commercial product was offered in December 2018, more than 1 million shipping events per day were being published to the platform. CMA CGM and MSC joined TradeLens in May 2019, followed by Hapag-Lloyd and Ocean Network Express in July of last year. By December 2019, TradeLens was publishing 2 million events per day and its ecosystem included more than 175 organizations.   CMA CGM and MSC, together with Maersk, will act as platform foundation carriers to help expand the ecosystem and platform operations and play key roles as validators on the blockchain network, according to the announcement. Marc Bourdon, CMA CGM senior vice president of the commercial agencies network, acknowledged in the announcement from TradeLens that it is highly unusual for competitors to cooperate, particularly when it comes to the sharing of information. “Digitization is a cornerstone of the CMA CGM Group’s strategy aimed at providing an end-to-end solution tailored to our customers’ needs. An industry-wide collaboration like this is truly unprecedented. Only by working together and agreeing to a shared set of standards and goals are we able to enact the digital transformation that is now touching nearly every part of the global shipping industry,” Bourdon said. CMA CGM announced on Oct. 2 that it had hired Nicolas Sekkaki, the chairman and CEO of IBM France since 2015, to execute its digitization and technology strategy as its executive vice president of IT, digital and transformation.   “Digitization is the heart of the CMA CGM Group’s development strategy: a driver for growth, differentiation and performance,” CMA CGM said when announcing the hire. “A number of initiatives have already been taken to give the group’s customers access to the world’s most innovative technologies in the fields of blockchain, artificial intelligence and internet of things. In order to accelerate the industry’s digital transformation, the CMA CGM Group is recruiting the world’s best experts in the sector.” The integration of CMA CGM and MSC onto the TradeLens platform completes a digital transformation that has taken more than a year. TradeLens said an important milestone in the process was a 15-customer pilot involving more than 3,000 unique consignments, 100,000 events and 6,000 containers to ensure the platform distributed and shared shipment data across various supply chains with speed and accuracy. Thursday’s announcement did not say whether the integration process was at all affected by a ransomware attack on CMA CGM, the world’s fourth-largest container shipping line, in late September. No. 2 MSC was knocked offline in April.   MSC also has been investing heavily in digitization. When it launched its e-business tool Instant Quote in early July, it said, “At MSC, we recognize the importance of digitalization across the shipping industry. For that reason, we are continuously investing in and developing new technologies to make our services better for our customers.” TradeLens members use the platform to connect within the ecosystem and share information needed for their shipments based on permissions — without sharing sensitive data. TradeLens is designed to make it possible to access data from the source in near real time, boost the quality of information, provide a comprehensive view of data as cargo moves around the world and help create a more timely, secured record of transactions. Today the TradeLens ecosystem extends to more than 10 ocean carriers and encompasses data from over 600 ports and terminals. TradeLens said it already has tracked 30 million container shipments, 1.5 billion events and roughly 13 million published documents. Andre Simha, MSC’s global chief digital and information officer, called the TradeLens collaboration “an important initiative in the digitalization of global shipping and logistics, with the potential to help carriers and their customers to increase transparency and reduce errors and delays, all at a crucial time when the industry is rethinking and improving the resiliency of supply chains.” Shipwaves goes with TradeLens information flow   Maersk Flow launched to help control flood of information Maritime industry’s need for digital transformation surfaces Click for more American Shipper/FreightWaves stories by Senior Editor Kim Link-Wills.","TAGS":"CMA CGM, Digitization, Hapag-Lloyd, IBM, Maersk, MSC, Nicolas Sekkaki, Ocean Network Express, TradeLens, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Kim Link Wills","CATEGORY":"American Shipper, Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Container Shipping, International, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2020-10-15T08:15:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/tachyon-joins-blockchain-in-transport-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BiTA-Tachyon.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Tachyon joins Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"Maker of machine learning-based logistics platform to participate in determining best practices and standards for blockchain in the transportation industry","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Tachyon, maker of the revolutionary, machine learning-based logistics platform, announced that it is joining the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). As part of BiTA, Tachyon will participate in devising standards and best practices for the use of blockchain technology in the transportation industry. With this move, Tachyon is joining other industry leaders, such as Descartes, Daimler, FedEx and Uber Freight in support of blockchain-based solutions for the industry. “We feel there is a natural fit between our mission and blockchain,” said Abdulrahman Ijaabo, Tachyon’s Chief Operations Officer. “Blockchain is a key driver of our product’s functionality, so being part of BiTA will help us deliver even more effective and secure solutions to our customers,” he added. “On behalf of the members of BiTA, I am very pleased to welcome Tachyon to the Alliance, stated Patrick Duffy, president of BiTA. “I am certain that Tachyon will contribute to the work of BiTA and help us bring blockchain to the transportation and logistics sectors.” Tachyon, which is headquartered in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, targets clients in the Middle East/North Africa region.   Tachyon leverages machine learning algorithms to find the right carriers, assign suitable trucks, perform route planning and provide competitive pricing. The toolset enables users to keep track of the most commonly requested trucks, destination and goods. Blockchain gives Tachyon the ability to cut costs and save time through the solution’s automated shipment cycle. Tachyon’s uses of blockchain include a trip closure process, events authentication, enabling of smart contracts and automated, secure payment processing. The Tachyon platform provides a seamless user experience, one that enables the users to monitor their shipments’ entire lifecycles using a single platform interface. A shipper can start by using Tachyon to book a trip. From there, Tachyon’s machine learning algorithms assess the freight specs and assign the shipment to the most appropriate transporter, down to the level of the specific truck. As the shipment gets under way, the shipper receives regular, real-time status updates. Tachyon also electronically generates and handles the documentation for the shipment. The shipper enjoys transparency over the full shipment lifecycle. This includes receiving proof of delivery, invoices and payments. Blockchain uses its secure, unchangeable ledger structure to enable transportation companies to more effectively track goods and freight across the supply chain. This is possible due to a blockchain providing unique identification and tracking of transactions – along with the ability to share the information securely across a distributed network. With blockchain, transportation and logistics companies can operate in a more seamless and transparent manner. With each blockchain ledger entry secured by a unique cryptographic formula, users can be confident that their shipment information will be secure and free from fraud or tampering. The technology can thus fuel the creation of more profitable operations. BiTA was founded in 2017 by technology and transportation executives who envisioned creating a forum for the development of freight industry blockchain standards and education programs. The organization unites freight industry leaders who share a vested interest in the development of blockchain technology. BiTA is renowned for its successful engagement with the industry.

In this installment of the AI in Supply Chain series (#AIinSupplyChain), I tried to discern the outlines of an answer to the question posed in the headline above by reading three academic papers. This article distills what I consider the most important takeaways from the papers. Although the context of the investigations that resulted in these papers looks at the economy as a whole, there are implications that are applicable at the level of an individual firm. So, if you are responsible for innovation, corporate development and strategy at your company, it’s probably worth your time to read each of them and then interpret the findings for your own firm. In this paper, Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock and Chad Syverson explore the paradox that while systems using artificial intelligence are advancing rapidly, measured economywide productivity has declined.   Recent optimism about AI and machine learning is driven by recent and dramatic improvements in machine perception and cognition. These skills are essential to the ways in which people get work done. So this has fueled hopes that machines will rapidly approach and possibly surpass people in their ability to do many different tasks that today are the preserve of humans. However, productivity statistics do not yet reflect growth that is driven by the advances in AI and machine learning. If anything, the authors cite statistics to suggest that labor productivity growth fell in advanced economies starting in the mid-2000s and has not recovered to its previous levels. Therein lies the paradox: AI and machine learning boosters predict it will transform entire swathes of the economy, yet the economic data do not point to such a transformation taking place. What gives? The authors offer four possible explanations.   First, it is possible that the optimism about AI and machine learning technologies is misplaced. Perhaps they will be useful in certain narrow sectors of the economy, but ultimately their economywide impact will be modest and insignificant. Second, it is possible that the impact of AI and machine learning technologies is not being measured accurately. Here it is pessimism about the significance of these technologies that prevents society from accurately measuring their contribution to economic productivity. Third, perhaps these new technologies are producing positive returns to the economy, BUT these benefits are being captured by a very small number of firms and as such the rewards are enjoyed by only a minuscule fraction of the population.   Fourth, the benefits of AI and machine learning will not be reflected in the wider economy until investments have been made to build up complementary technologies, processes, infrastructure, human capital and other types of assets that make it possible for society to realize and measure the transformative benefits of AI and machine learning. The authors argue that AI, machine learning and their complementary new technologies embody the characteristics of general purpose technologies (GPTs). A GPT has three primary features: It is pervasive or can become pervasive; it can be improved upon as time elapses; and it leads directly to complementary innovations. Electricity. The internal combustion engine. Computers. The authors cite these as examples of GTPs, with which readers are familiar. Crucially, the authors state that “a GPT can at one moment both be present and yet not affect current productivity growth if there is a need to build a sufficiently large stock of the new capital, or if complementary types of capital, both tangible and intangible, need to be identified, produced, and put in place to fully harness the GPT’s productivity benefits.” It takes a long time for economic production at the macro- or micro-scale to be reorganized to accommodate and harness a new GPT. The authors point out that computers took 25 years before they became ubiquitous enough to have an impact on productivity. It took 30 years for electricity to become widespread. As the authors state, the changes required to harness a new GPT “take substantial time and resources, contributing to organizational inertia. Firms are complex systems that require an extensive web of complementary assets to allow the GPT to fully transform the system. Firms that are attempting transformation often must reevaluate and reconfigure not only their internal processes but often their supply and distribution chains as well.”   The authors end the article by stating: “Realizing the benefits of AI is far from automatic. It will require effort and entrepreneurship to develop the needed complements, and adaptability at the individual, organizational, and societal levels to undertake the associated restructuring. Theory predicts that the winners will be those with the lowest adjustment costs and that put as many of the right complements in place as possible. This is partly a matter of good fortune, but with the right roadmap, it is also something for which they, and all of us, can prepare.” In this paper, Brynjolfsson, Xiang Hui and Meng Liu explore the effect that the introduction of eBay Machine Translation (eMT) had on eBay’s international trade. The authors describe eMT as “an in-house machine learning system that statistically learns how to translate among different languages.” They also state: “As a platform, eBay mediated more than 14 billion dollars of global trade among more than 200 countries in 2014.” Basically, eBay represents a good approximation of a complex economy within which to examine the economywide benefits of this type of machine translation. The authors state: “We show that a moderate quality upgrade increases exports on eBay by 17.5%. The increase in exports is larger for differentiated products, cheaper products, listings with more words in their title. Machine translation also causes a greater increase in exports to less experienced buyers. These heterogeneous treatment effects are consistent with a reduction in translation-related search costs, which comes from two sources: (1) an increased matching relevance due to improved accuracy of the search query translation and (2) better translation quality of the listing title in buyers’ language.” They report an accompanying 13.1% increase in revenue, even though they only observed a 7% increase in the human acceptance rate. They also state: “To put our result in context, Hui (2018) has estimated that a removal of export administrative and logistic costs increased export revenue on eBay by 12.3% in 2013, which is similar to the effect of eMT. Additionally, Lendle et al. (2016) have estimated that a 10% reduction in distance would increase trade revenue by 3.51% on eBay. This means that the introduction of eMT is equivalent of [sic] the export increase from reducing distances between countries by 37.3%. These comparisons suggest that the trade-hindering effect of language barriers is of first-order importance. Machine translation has made the world significantly smaller and more connected.” In this paper, Brynjolfsson, Rock and Syverson develop a model that shows how GPTs like AI “enable and require significant complementary investments, including co-invention of new processes, products, business models and human capital. These complementary investments are often intangible and poorly measured in the national accounts, even when they create valuable assets for the firm” AND they “develop a model that shows how this leads to an underestimation of productivity growth in the early years of a new GPT, and how later, when the benefits of intangible investments are harvested, productivity growth will be overestimated.” Their “model generates a Productivity J-Curve that can explain the productivity slowdowns often accompanying the advent of GPTs, as well as the increase in productivity later.”   The authors find that, first, “As firms adopt a new GPT, total factor productivity growth will initially be underestimated because capital and labor are used to accumulate unmeasured intangible capital stocks.” Then, second, “Later, measured productivity growth overestimates true productivity growth because the capital service flows from those hidden intangible stocks generates measurable output.” Finally, “The error in measured total factor productivity growth therefore follows a J-curve shape, initially dipping while the investment rate in unmeasured capital is larger than the investment rate in other types of capital, then rising as growing intangible stocks begin to contribute to measured production.” This explains the observed phenomenon that when a new technology like AI and machine learning, or something like blockchain and distributed ledger technology, is introduced into an area such as supply chain, it generates furious debate about whether it creates any value for incumbent suppliers or customers. If we consider the reported time it took before other GPTs like electricity and computers began to contribute measurably to firm-level and economywide productivity, we must admit that it is perhaps too early to write off blockchains and other distributed ledger technologies, or AI and machine learning, and their applications in sectors of the economy that are not usually associated with internet and other digital technologies. Give it some time. However, I think we are near the inflection point of the AI and Machine Learning Productivity J-curve. As I have worked on this #AIinSupplyChain series, I have become more convinced that the companies that are experimenting with AI and machine learning in their supply chain operations now will have the advantage over their competitors over the next decade.   I think we are a bit farther away from the inflection point of a Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies Productivity J-Curve. I cannot yet make a cogent argument about why this is true, although in March 2014, I published #ChainReaction: Who Will Own The Age of Cryptocurrencies? — part of an ongoing attempt to understand when blockchains and other distributed technologies might become more ubiquitous than they are now. Examining this topic has added to my understanding of why disruption happens. The authors of the Productivity J-Curve paper state that “the more transformative the new technology, the more likely its productivity effects will initially be underestimated.” The long duration during which incumbent firms underestimate the productivity effects of a relatively new GPT is what contributes to the phenomenon studied by Rebecca Henderson and Kim Clark in “Architectural Innovation: The Reconfiguration of Existing Product Technologies and the Failure of Established Firms.” It is also described as Supply Side Disruption by Josgua Gans in his book, “The Disruption Dilemma,” and summarized in this March 2016 HBR article, “The Other Disruption.” If we focus on AI and machine learning specifically, in an exchange on Twitter on Sept. 27, Brynjolfsson said, “The machine translation example is in many ways the exception. More often it takes a lot of organizational reinvention and time before AI breakthroughs translate into productivity gains.” By the time entrenched and industry-leading incumbents awaken to the threats posed by newly developed GPTs, a crop of challengers who had no option but to adopt the new GPT at the outset has become powerful enough to threaten the financial stability of an industry. One example? E-commerce and its impact on retail in general. If you are an executive, what experiments are you performing to figure out if and how your company’s supply chain operations can be made more productive by implementing technologies that have so far been underestimated by you and other incumbents in your industry?

Up to 70% of invoices had some sort of issue where numbers didn’t align with company expectations. The results were not good. Walmart personnel would lose time sorting out the long list of charges that go into each load. Meanwhile, payments to carriers were delayed. “Life was a bit rough in terms of processing payments,” recalled Francis Lalonde, Walmart Canada’s vice president for transportation. “You want to process them on time. The carriers want to get paid on time.” So Walmart turned to DLT Labs, a Toronto-based startup, and deployed a customized version of its freight invoice and payments system. By the end of August, the system had processed over 150,000 invoices, with fewer than 2% resulting in disputes.   That result came less than a year after the system launched at the Blockchain in Transport Alliance’s BiTA Symposium Chicago in November. It became the largest publicly known deployment of blockchain for freight payments. “The transformation is pretty remarkable,” DLT Labs CEO Loudon Owen told FreightWaves. The invoice for a single load of truckload freight often gets far more complicated than the base rate and distance traveled. Fuel surcharges, in particular, can take on a life of their own when a load travels through multiple Canadian provinces and into the U.S. The sheer abundance of data points created almost limitless potential for invoicing issues to arise. Each represents an opportunity for misunderstandings, miscommunications and human errors.   “Nobody was doing anything on purpose,” Lalonde said. “In the end, dollars weren’t matching.” Walmart Canada, the Canadian division of the global retail giant, is one of the largest truckload shippers in the country. It works with around 60 outside carriers to move millions of pounds of freight annually. Lalonde has overseen carrier partnerships since joining Walmart Canada in 2018. After his first introductory calls with carrier executives, payment issues became a common thread.   As Lalonde and his team investigated further, it became clear that the payment issue represented something more than something aggravating the carriers. It was creating enormous amounts of additional work for the company and carriers alike without generating value. “It was leaving dollars on the table,” Lalonde said. The chronic payment issues also hung over carrier relationships. “It’s complicated to manage that if you haven’t paid the carriers on time,” he noted. Walmart Canada decided it wanted to tackle the problem aggressively. That decision coincided with Walmart Canada’s CA$3.5 billion ($2.75 billion) expansion, which includes new distribution centers and supply chain upgrades. “We want to build a world-class supply chain,” Lalonde said.   Rather than “leapfrog from old technology to old technology,” Lalonde continued, the company wanted to implement something transformational. It found it with DLT Labs’ platform based on blockchain technology. The underlying technology behind blockchain is complicated in technical terms. But at its core, blockchain allows parties to transact through a shared ledger with ultra-high security. DLT Labs specializes in blockchain-based solutions at the enterprise level. It worked closely with Walmart Canada to deploy and scale its freight payments platform, DL Freight. The use of carriers’ existing systems is key to DL Freight’s smooth implementation. The platform serves at the bridge between carriers and Walmart Canada, providing a single ledger with consistent data. “There’s nothing to fight over if there’s a single source of truth,” Owen said. Invoices get paid and processed automatically. Discrepancies — when they do occur — are flagged for correction.   Started as a pilot program, the platform now serves as the national standard for Walmart Canada carrier invoicing and payments. Meanwhile, the company is exploring additional ways to leverage DLT’s platform to improve load visibility. DL Freight can handle a wide array of data inputs from internet of things (IoT) devices. It opens the door for real-time sharing and transparency on pressure points such as temperature-controlled freight and detention issues. DLT Labs is now looking to court other companies to adopt DL Freight after the successful implementation at Walmart Canada. “It’s a completely new paradigm for managing information and managing it securely,” Owen said.   Walmart Canada and DLT Labs’ efforts with blockchain are also getting attention. The Council for Supply Chain Management Professionals named them as a finalist for its Supply Chain Innovation Award.

Mainnet is a blockchain protocol that is fully developed and deployed, and can handle transactions that are recorded on a distributed ledger. “ShipChain’s public mainnet brings the trust of public blockchains with the throughput and scalability that enterprise supply chains require,” said John Monarch, the CEO of U.S.-based ShipChain. “The ability to certify and prove truth and origin of everything, from documentation to products themselves, acts as a base layer of trust for IoT, all in a fully auditable and immutable, yet private and secure, environment. It brings trust between parties that may never have had it before.” With the inevitable digitalization of supply chain operations, the need for securing data streams that arise within workflows becomes paramount. Blockchain as a technology is attractive, as it provides remarkable security to data by decentralizing ownership within the network and making data immutable. ShipChain provides a trustless end-to-end logistics platform that delivers full visibility to the global supply chain. The platform is powered by Ethereum, with a sidechain built on Loom for network scalability.   Monarch explained that ShipChain used Ethereum, as it saw the decentralized platform to be “one of the most significant technological developments in the past decade.” ShipChain’s Mainnet acts as a sidechain to Ethereum, operating on a different “delegated proof of state” consensus, which dramatically speeds the network up. ShipChain can now process roughly 1,000 transactions per second that can be scaled once further advances come into use. Monarch contended that it is critical for track-and-trace operations to certify that companies involved in the shipment process tell the truth. Apart from certifying trust, blockchain also acts as a springboard for new technologies that can improve efficiencies — in segments previously unheard of. For instance, digital original documentation can be easily transferred over the internet via a blockchain network, rather than being forced to use representative copies. “Proof of ownership of documentation is a critical piece in maritime shipping especially, and until now, it has been very difficult or even impossible to prove the originality of digital documents. Combined with our work on Baseline Protocol, you’ll also see blockchains like ShipChain help take things like EDI into the modern era,” said Monarch. ShipChain’s goal has been to keep the cost of using blockchain down while making it more accessible. The company’s mainnet has been received positively by its users, with it generating a lot of interest from other companies — especially after the mainnet release and ShipChain’s involvement with Baseline Protocol.   COVID-19 has largely been a spoilsport to the supply chain ecosystem, but has taught logistics stakeholders the need to have high-end visibility into operations and trust between parties they work with — both upstream and downstream. Monarch said that more companies are reaching out to ShipChain due to broken supply chains since the pandemic, especially in the medical and food space. *** More from Vishnu Rajamanickam TIRPORT ushers real-time visibility into trucking industry Amazon now authorized to fly commercial delivery drones Warehouse picking robot startup XYZ raises $17 million  ","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain logistics, blockchain technology, COVID-19, decentralized ledger, immutable record, Mainnet, public blockchain, ShipChain, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, International, New Tech, News, Startups, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2020-09-03T10:00:47-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/connecting-seafood-producers-to-consumers-via-blockchain","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Connecting_seafood_1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Connecting seafood producers to consumers via blockchain","INTRO":"Unisot’s blockchain solution brings visibility to the seafood supply chain","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Within the global food supply chain, seafood logistics are among the most compromised, due to the widespread misuse of labels and direct seafood fraud. Marine conservation non-profit Oceana published a report on the extent of seafood fraud within North America. Its research showed that the U.S. was particularly vulnerable, as 90% of all the country’s seafood is imported – often from Southeast Asia. Unisot, a Norwegian blockchain-based company, is working to bring visibility into global seafood supply chains. Unisot’s platform is powered by blockchain and provides all parties within the network a ‘universal source of truth’ to the end-to-end movement of shipment – from origin to the end customer. “We have technology like electronic data interchange (EDI) and email in use right now, but they are old and inefficient technologies. This results in companies not exchanging enough information with each other,” said Stephan Nilsson, the co-founder and CEO of Unisot. “Companies collect tons of data and store them in their data warehouses. They only use it internally, creating closed data silos inside their organizations. That’s a big problem, and we are tackling that.” Trust is a deciding factor in data exchange, which the technology of blockchain can provide via its secure and decentralized ledger system. Nilsson explained that Unisot realized early that supply chains could benefit tremendously by adopting blockchain across their ecosystems.   Due to its Norwegian roots, Unisot chose the seafood supply chain to pilot its blockchain technology, as the fishing industry is one of the largest contributors to Norwegian exports. Unisot created the Seafood Chain, which is a vertical built over its blockchain platform. The company is currently working with two pilot customers in Norway – one being a fish producer and the other a seafood distribution business. “By working with these two customers, we can cover the whole seafood supply chain – right from fish eggs to breeding and then the distribution that goes all the way to restaurants and end consumers,” said Nilsson. He contends that the COVID-19 situation has exacerbated the need for implementing such technology within supply chains, as they depend heavily on a human workforce to run logistics operations. “When you have people staying at home due to the pandemic, it disrupts the supply chain. Automating simple things such as order and delivery messages can help save a lot of time,” said Nilsson. “We’ve built the blockchain data interchange (BDI) that is just like EDI, but with blockchain as the communication layer. Instead of going via third parties and EDI providers, we do it peer-to-peer via the blockchain and have a secure, encrypted and cost-efficient network.”   The end-to-end visibility into supply chains will mean complete provenance tracking for end consumers. Nilsson explained that consumers would only have to scan a code on the seafood product they buy at the market to get details on the type of fish, the fishing company, fishing location, the time and place of its processing, and the time to reach the supermarket shelf. The transparency also allows seafood producers to seek feedback from end consumers directly. Unisot has developed a feedback process that works similarly to that of Uber or Airbnb, in which consumers can leave a rating between one to five on the product they consume. This rating would reach the producers, helping them improve their seafood quality based on real-time feedback. With data stored within an encrypted and secure network, companies can now start sharing information with businesses of their choosing. Companies can also monetize data, with critical data put behind a paywall and charged for according to its market need.   “Our customers only pay for what they use and do not need any understanding of blockchain to work on our platform,” said Nilsson. “Most blockchain companies only provide APIs for companies to build integrations, making it very complex and time-intensive. We mitigate that, making it very easy and low cost for companies to start using a blockchain system.” *** More from Vishnu Rajamanickam Bumble Bee Foods is tracking seafood across global supply chains through blockchain In the blockchain race, supply chains stand to gain the most Blockchain can leverage transparency to make supply chains more consumer-centric","TAGS":"automation, Blockchain, blockchain company, blockchain data interchange, blockchain technology, digitalization, Electronic Data Interchange, seafood exports, seafood industry, seafood logistics, Unisot, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Europe, Global Supply Chain, International, Logistics, News, Startups, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2020-07-22T12:30:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/walmart-canada-adds-dcs-supply-chain-tech-in-c3-5b-push","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/walmartcanada0720.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Walmart Canada adds DCs, supply chain tech in C$3.5B push","INTRO":"Big-box retailer to build two new distribution centers as part of a five-year investment.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Walmart Canada plans to build two new distribution centers and bring more technology into its supply chain as part of a C$3.5 billion (US$2.6 billion) investment to grow its e-commerce and in-store operations. Walmart said it will spend C$1.1 billion to construct the new distribution centers near Toronto and Vancouver and renovate an existing one in Ontario. “The retail business is as dynamic as ever and this investment ensures we’re developing a supply chain that is the envy of the world,” John Bayliss, Walmart Canada’s senior vice president of logistics and supply chain, said in a statement. “The better the supply chain, the quicker our customers can get the products they want.” Walmart Canada revealed its supply chain upgrades when it announced its broader C$3.5 billion investment plan. The investment over five years targets Walmart’s brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce operations.   The single-biggest supply chain investment is the forthcoming 550,000-square-foot distribution center in Vaughn, Ontario. Located in the Greater Toronto Area, the facility will be Walmart’s largest distribution center in Canada when it opens in 2024. Walmart has already started building a 300,000-square-foot distribution center in Surrey, British Columbia, as part of the investment. Walmart is accelerating the adoption of technology in its Canadian supply chain operations as a part of the investment.

Greater transparency into operations allows stakeholders to take stock of their situation and more effectively partner with associated companies to improve efficiency. Automated freight forwarder Transship has partnered with digital cargo insurance company Loadsure to provide its broker customers options for pay-as-you-go, wraparound insurance coverage for all perishable goods. FreightWaves caught up with Amit Hasak, the CEO of Transship, to understand the synergy between the two companies and how the partnership will help in its efforts to deliver a fully automated freight forwarding offering. “I ran a cold storage warehouse in Chicago for many years, where we stored perishable goods like frozen beef, poultry, pork, vegetables and dairy. I dealt almost exclusively with exporters, and I saw that they hated the business as the freight forwarding industry at that time was very outdated,” said Hasak.   Hasak contended that traditional business models within freight forwarding were time consuming, expensive, unreliable and inefficient, as they predominantly depended on manual labor in their daily operations. “Our idea is to automate as many processes as possible,” he said. Transship looks to automate end-to-end global refrigerated maritime shipping processes. When vessels carrying perishable goods arrive at the port of destination, they need to have the bills of lading, certificates of origin and other provenance details in order. However, these documents often get lost, misplaced or damaged, leading to customs delays and added detention charges. “By digitalizing these documents and putting them over a blockchain network, Transship users can invite people they’ve authorized to get on the network and check the documents in real time even as the vessel arrives at the dock,” said Hasak. “We also provide real-time tracking of the location and the temperature and humidity inside the reefer unit.” Reefers on long journeys, like between China and the U.S. for instance, spend over six weeks at sea. This makes it vital for shippers to know if the reefer units broke down and started back up during the journey, as long breakdowns can damage perishable goods.   “We empower the shipper. If and when there’s a problem, shippers can check for the type of issue, the time of its occurrence and the event’s duration. Based on those details, shippers can go after anybody responsible. Our business model is not based on manual labor but strategic partnerships. The recent one is Loadsure, and we are talking to a 3PL from Panama and a freight forwarder from China to join our network,” said Hasak. With Loadsure, Hasak sees great synergy, as both the companies are looking to disrupt outdated operations within the supply chain industry, albeit from different ends. “What we are creating is a marketplace for small or new exporters, aside from the giant exporters who can also save time and money on our platform. Transship brings small shippers together to be part of our platform, and then goes out on their behalf to negotiate lower shipping rates,” he said. Transship’s blockchain network helps small exporters enjoy the logistics sophistication enjoyed by the bigger shippers within a trusted and secure network, while also eliminating daily manual tasks like phone calls and emails.   “We are creating a consortium that has all components of an exporting ecosystem under a single roof. Transship can make processing and scheduling shipments in five to 10 minutes, which would normally take hours if not days to process,” said Hasak. “All our partnerships with 3PLs, freight forwarders and carriers complement each other while we continue to remain this system’s mothership.”","TAGS":"digital transformation, digitalization, digitalization in shipping, Loadsure, logistics automation, maritime shipping, reefer, reefer containers, Supply chain digitalization, Transship, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, International, Maritime, New Tech, News, Startups, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2020-07-20T15:00:46-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/bita-symposium-home-discussions-over-blockchain-in-logistics-part-2","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BiTA-Symposium.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BiTA Symposium @HOME: Discussions over blockchain in logistics — Part 2","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The BiTA Symposium @HOME on June 10 saw speakers present blockchain use cases and possibilities across various verticals within the supply chain industry, elucidating ways to leverage blockchain to bring in more transparency and visibility into logistics operations. In a series of two digests, FreightWaves outlines key aspects of those talks individually. For the first part of the discussion, check here. Specright empowers Salesforce blockchain customers to create trusted supply chains Customer relationship management (CRM) software company Salesforce is currently working on a closed blockchain pilot program, initiated based on customer interest in cross-company collaboration. Dan Harrison, emerging technologies architect at Salesforce, explained that such collaboration is more important than ever, whether to simplify supply chains or to track the provenance of products. “In Salesforce blockchain, we focus on a couple of things from a value perspective. It’s the ability to, in a few clicks, be able to deploy a network. We give our Salesforce admins the tools to manage their blockchain, exactly the same way they manage their current Salesforce projects,” said Harrison. “So now, you have a huge number of people that are able to create, deploy and manage a blockchain network.”   Harrison contended that for the blockchain network to be a success, it was important to gain widespread adoption, as that would bolster the network. Salesforce has built its blockchain network on the Hyperledger Sawtooth, but the company also encourages businesses to bring their own blockchain networks. The Salesforce blockchain sits inside the Customer 360 platform. Specright comes into the picture with its already existing blockchain network with a large number of businesses adopting it. Specright is pioneering “specification management,” which deals with managing the most granular details of products and their packaging. The company digitalizes these specifications and places them on a single source of truth via its blockchain network. Being a decentralized network, it equally allows all users to track changes as products move across multiple stakeholders. Interoperability innovations: Addressing the cross chain challenge Dean Tribble, the CEO of Agoric, spoke about driver credential verification that uses a secure and immutable blockchain network. “A low-hanging fruit for blockchain in freight is the high-assurance chain of custody, which requires driver authentication,” he said. Such networks also help realize payment automation, as processes can be set to automatically issue payment out to intended recipients as and when freight custody changes hands.   However, the issue with structuring such a system is that data is spread over several networks and they would need to be interoperable for seamless operations. Data privacy is another parameter that needs to be addressed, as companies would need to disclose private data for credential verification. Agoric is building a next-generation platform for smart contracts, for public, private and consortium chains alike. This allows millions of developers who are familiar with JavaScript to write smart contracts. Smart contracts are an arrangement between multiple parties that can be expressed in software code, where the behavior of the code enforces the terms of the contract. Such smart contracts, when built within a blockchain network, can realize integrity within computing.   Interoperability between independently functioning computers becomes easy, as smart contracts provide high assurance across multiple machines, increasing trust across ecosystems. Using Routeique to ensure touchless collection in a post-COVID world Mike Allen, CEO of Routeique, a cloud-based order and delivery management platform, spoke about the changes that can occur in the way records move through the supply chain in the post-COVID world. Though paper documents were already waning in popularity as a means of communication, the pandemic has forced companies to adopt digitalization faster. Allen explained that putting together a road map on what to do right now and planning for a couple of years into the future will help companies stay on track toward getting their processes digitalized. Allen spoke of how Routeique would be part of a larger ecosystem and of the need for accessing data, ingesting and broadcasting it to all parties that need it — securely via a blockchain network. “It is about making sure the data we’re ingesting is making the algorithms smarter and trustworthy,” he said.   Today, blockchain ecosystems are about having a descriptive model that shows stakeholders the current state of the supply chain, giving an accurate picture of what is happening. However, Allen explained the need for switching to prescriptive models that can help predict bottlenecks within the ecosystem before they occur. “That is where things are headed with smart contracts within blockchain networks. It’s about where we can get to, beyond just reporting and analytics. It is about actually improving the bottom line using those metrics, as opposed to just reporting on them,” said Allen. Delivering supply chain transparency using a turnkey, configurable blockchain platform Sergei Beliaev, the CSO of DLT Labs, a blockchain-based distributed data management platform, spoke about how the company established a single trusted version of truth that is truly shared between participants in real time. “If there are no multiple views of the world, there is nothing to reconcile,” he said. DLT Labs has partnered with Walmart Canada to create a blockchain solution for the latter’s supply chain to improve efficiency, reduce costs and increase control over operations. Pete Gowanlock, vice president of freight at DLT Labs, explained how a single version of the truth would reduce the number of steps in a process from 11 to five. “A freight invoice is complex. In our scenario, we have one invoice per shipment. Each contains a lot of information with many data elements associated with it. The invoice is the first step in the process. The Internet of Things (IoT) data will be collected from this point forward. GPS tracking helps track shipment delivery. It can help find if there were wait times at the distribution center loading docks and if the shipment incurred any damage,” said Beliaev.   The next step would be for companies to have an additional review of the transportation provider and other assets that are not necessarily tracked by GPS. Walmart as the shipper will have full visibility into all the information being added in real time. “Everything going through the smart contract process within the platform is being tracked. It is visible and is approved as you go through each step. So when the final invoice is submitted, there will be no reconciliation needed,” said Beliaev. *** Related from Vishnu Rajamanickam BiTA Symposium @HOME: Blockchain in logistics discussions (Part 1) BiTA blockchain standards bring the industry closer to seamless shipment tracking  ","TAGS":"Agoric, BiTA, BiTA @HOME, BiTA Standards, Blockchain, blockchain technology, DLT Labs, Routeique, Salesforce, Specright, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Asia-Pacific, Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Borderlands: Canada, Europe, Global Supply Chain, International, Logistics, News, Startups, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2020-07-16T10:00:04-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/without-data-standards-blockchain-technology-is-irrelevant","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Without_data_2.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Without data standards, blockchain technology is irrelevant","INTRO":"Data standardization is fundamental to blockchain adoption","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Though blockchain as a technology has shown great promise within the logistics industry, mainstream blockchain adoption has been left wanting.

FreightWaves spoke with Kevin Otto, senior director at GS1 US, to discuss how data standards are fundamental to sustaining blockchain adoption in logistics. “The goal of GS1 standards is to improve traceability within supply chains by transparently capturing and transferring data. The idea is to identify data captures and ultimately share that information with trading partners in a standardized fashion,” said Otto. “This is hard if companies are creating proprietary numbering systems for their items and then sharing that via blockchain. Without standardization, those numbers do not mean anything downstream.”   GS1 standards create a common global language of business that industries can agree upon, bringing seamless interoperability closer to reality. “Without standardization, data across the supply chain becomes meaningless. If there is a recall for a product and companies speak in different languages, then even with access to all the information, companies will have no idea what it means,” said Otto. In that context, GS1 standards can be utilized in a blockchain ecosystem to optimize data sharing. For example, the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) standard allows supply chain partners to capture transactional information about supply chain events related to product movement. Associated trading partners get access to this information. EPCIS is in use today across various industries. It helps document the product’s chain of custody across trading partner networks when used for blockchain.   In March, GS1 also announced a guideline that would act as an educational resource, enabling supply chain visibility in blockchain implementation by leveraging GS1 standards. Otto explained that the development of the guidelines took about six months. This expedited development was achievable due to visibility data standards that already existed within GS1, which was leveraged and applied for blockchain purposes. “We had a large group of users that helped us develop these standards. I think it’s important to know this isn’t something that gets developed in a vacuum. You have that cross-industry discussion group, which has 100 to 150 representatives from about 95 different companies that helped us put together this guideline,” said Otto. This has ensured that user feedback remains consistently positive. However, the guidelines will continue to evolve based on use cases. Otto contended that the goal was to add to the document every time the industry comes up with a new blockchain use case that needs recognition.   ***** More from Vishnu Rajamanickam Without standardization, blockchain can become a forgotten piece of code BiTA blockchain standards bring the industry closer to seamless shipment tracking In the blockchain race, supply chains stand to gain the most  ","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain standards, blockchain technology, data standards, GS1 standards, GS1 US, interoperability, supply chain visibility, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, International, Logistics, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2020-06-29T11:00:13-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/bita-symposium-home-blockchain-in-logistics-discussions-part-1","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-05-at-11.00.54-AM-1.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BiTA Symposium @HOME: Blockchain in logistics discussions (Part 1)","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The BiTA Symposium @HOME on June 10 featured speakers presenting blockchain use cases and possibilities across various verticals within the supply chain industry. They illustrated ways to leverage blockchain to bring more transparency and visibility into logistics operations. In a series of two digests, FreightWaves attempts to outline key aspects of those talks individually. Founded in August 2017, the Blockchain in Transport Alliance, or BiTA, has become the largest commercial blockchain alliance in the world, with nearly 300 members. BiTA members are primarily from the freight, transportation, logistics and affiliated industries. Alliance members share a common mission to develop a standards framework, educate the market on blockchain applications/solutions and distributed ledger technology, and encourage the use of those applications. COVID-19 testing solutions for transportation companies Stephan Noller, CEO of German-based blockchain startup Ubrich, spoke of the hassles that companies have guarding their sensor data against being tampered with. Apart from compromising the company’s integrity in question, insights drawn off tampered data can be flawed and end up being detrimental to downstream logistics operations.   Ubrich leverages blockchain to make data trustworthy. Blockchain is used to seal the data at the source via digital signatures, which is marked over every piece of data that is generated during the logistics operations. Customers who wish to verify data can run a query against the verification API to check if the data has been compromised. Ubirch came out with a COVID-19 certificate that is a digital representation of a test result made verifiable via blockchain. Users can show this digital certificate when they are stopped and checked. Authorities can scan QR codes embedded in the certificates to verify their authenticity, making the whole interaction seamless and more efficient. Proof of concept on blockchain-enabled tracking and chain-of-custody ecommerce Rick Ryan, fellow at retail logistics firm Pitney Bowes, spoke of real-world learnings from the company’s proof of concept (PoC) project focused on tracking and chain-of-custody within ecommerce operations. Pitney Bowes’ PoC was an internal trial – kept that way to have more control over the project and its ease of access. One idea was to test non-sunny day scenarios like missed and out-of-order events and network outages.   Though the chain of custody of a package looks relatively simple from the point of shipping to last-mile delivery, there are several complexities associated with logistics. For instance, not every single event creates a change to the parcel status on the blockchain. Pitney Bowes used the Hyperledger Fabric platform for its full implementation. Events that were looked at and pushed on the blockchain were simple reports that included shipment arrival and departure, aggregation and disaggregation of trackable entities, and unnesting of items. Ryan explained that learnings from running the pilot highlighted the need to plan for missed and out-of-order events. “It was really important to include the event time, which is part of the constructs in the BiTA standards. Using the event time, you can reconstruct what happened when events come out of order,” he said. Companies also need to plan for attempts to write multiple events for the same asset simultaneously. Pitney Bowes’ also simulated the project with historical data, which was found to reflect reality.   Chainyard and Trust Your Supplier: trust your product in the supply chain Gary Storr, general manager at blockchain services company Chainyard, spoke about the company’s product called Trust Your Supplier (TYS). TYS is a product that helps buyers and suppliers establish a partnership to do business, with its use case centered around the pain points of buyers, including supplier qualification, validation of supplier information, and physical onboarding of a supplier. “We see a lot of inefficiencies in that process, leading to huge delays in transaction times. Regulatory requirements are also moving very quickly, but technology is not really meeting that pace,” said Storr. “We came up with TYS, which led to a 90% improvement in the ability of a supplier to provide relevant information to a buyer. We’ve seen a substantial reduction in cycle time around onboarding and an associated reduction in cost.” Storr likened TYS to be similar to a LinkedIn profile, where people can provide a single link to their profile, rather than sending out resumes individually to people looking for a background check. The digital identity provided by TYS is easily consumable by buyers, further augmented with expertise from organizations that Chainyard works with. Chainyard has partnered with IBM to create a “white label version of trust” for the suppliers delivering essential medical utilities to hospitals and healthcare organizations. When medical supplies like PPEs were in severe shortage, hospitals had to buy them from unconventional suppliers like General Motors, Ford and even Gucci. Chainyard developed a solution that used blockchain to protect the associated financial transactions and keep bad actors and fraudsters out of the system.   Linking insights for transportation with NorthStar Digital Solutions Linking insights for transportation (LiFT), is a program initiated by NorthStar Digital Solutions, which is an on-the-ground actuation of hyper technology in the trucking market. Dave Brajkovich, the CTO of NorthStar Digital Solutions, spoke about how the company uses robotic process automation (RPA), artificial intelligence (AI), and deep learning to allow its users to interact with the automation routines to make their lives easier, while also enhancing their skill sets in other areas of the business. Brajkovich explained that NorthStar captures and integrates data arising from trucking assets. “The measures we took were to bring LiFT into a category where there’s digitalization. Automation is a big piece, as we deal with loads of documents – from order to dispatch and dealing with customs. We ended up integrating our APIs into our ERP back-end, and with intelligent OCR and machine learning, we arrived at a scalable solution,” he said. This automation has helped NorthStar during the COVID-19 situation. Employees were able to work remotely from home, as the bots kept working around the clock. To achieve further automation, NorthStar worked with IBM’s Hyperledger Fabric to create a blockchain platform that logs incoming orders coming through the system and pushes that to its partners. These businesses accept orders through smart contracts with data being embedded inside the Hyperledger. All partners and clients in the network are privy to the process and have the ability to check progress at every stage.

At a time when many trucking companies are figuring out whether to try to adopt blockchain technology into their operations somehow, the (mostly) water-hauling company Nuverra is engaged in not one but two blockchain initiatives. The energy-focused hauler has a three-year deal with one provider of blockchain technology. Separately, it just completed the first phase of a trial with a major oil company that was working as part of an oil industry-backed blockchain initiative. Nuverra Environmental Solutions is based in Arizona but is active in most of the major oil basins in the U.S.   Its deep plunge into blockchain technology was highlighted in the past few days with the announcement of the completion of phase 1 of a pilot project between Nuverra and the Offshore Operators Committee Oil \u0026 Gas Blockchain Consortium, with the Norwegian state-controlled Equinor as the operating oil company that worked with Nuverra. The Consortium’s membership consists of some of the biggest companies in the world. The pilot used blockchain technology to track record keeping for the water-hauling and disposal service that Nuverra provided to Equinor for five wells in the Bakken field, the North Dakota-centered producing area. A company called Data Gumbo provided the blockchain technology for the initiative between Equinor and Nuverra. The other initiative has been ongoing since earlier this year. A pilot project turned into a three-year contract between Nuverra and Ondiflo, a Houston-based blockchain technology company. The blockchain service that Ondiflo provides for Nuverra deals with services other than water disposal, such as dispatching. The Ondiflo-Nuverra initiative, which went from pilot program to three-year contract on April 1, involves both Nuverra and well operators.   “They’re definitely technology-hungry,” Rana Basu, founder and COO of Ondiflo, said of Nuverra, agreeing that the company is further ahead on adoption of blockchain technology than any other trucking company he knows. Basu spoke specifically of Greg Tipton, the Nuverra CIO, who he said has been given “a lot of room to be able to make them more and more technologically able to do things.” Tipton, in an interview with FreightWaves, said Nuverra operates about 350 trucks and hauls mostly water. It also uses third-party drivers for surge capacity.   The theoretical advantages that blockchain technology can provide a trucking company are numerous. It can make transactions “touchless,” without the filing or scanning of paper documents. The distributed ledger aspect of the blockchain means that the data uploaded to the blockchain is shared among all the members — who are on what are known as “nodes” — helping to eliminate disputes over data since everybody has the same information and there is no central database. If a hacker wants to hack into the data, it needs to hack into every node on the blockchain. That gives the information stored on the blockchain an enormous level of trust, and data on it has been referred to as “immutable.” Like all trucking companies, Nuverra faces the same issue that virtually all its peer group does: transactions handled through paper, delays in getting paid, and disputes over the actual size or timing of deliveries. One example of where the pilot with Equinor and DataGumbo proved beneficial: the number of “tickets” approved when it disposed of water through a third-party operator of disposal well services. In the pilot, it stood at 85%. Although Tipton did not give a number for comparison with the 85%, he clearly was happy with the figure. The process on the blockchain would grant approval on such data points as the amount of water picked up, the amount of water disposed, the time of the disposal, etc. once data supplied on a delivery was confirmed by all the parties on the blockchain pilot. “If our hauling ticket is within the [blockchain’s required parameters] ] it is auto approved without any human intervention,” he said. “This allows us to focus only on the disputed tickets.”   “What I liked about the business model is that it is a win-win for both sides,” Andrew Bruce, the CEO of Data Gumbo, said of the pilot with Nuverra. “The oil company has a win because they can make sure they pay for what is getting delivered. They have that contractual certainty.” Meanwhile, Nuverra “gets paid for what is performed and they get paid on time,” Bruce said, because the blockchain speeds up the process. That has long been one of the promises of blockchain: that the sharing of data about transactions to all parties, with the data considered immutable, will accelerate the payment process. Any gains in efficiency can fall to the bottom line. “We’re being asked by multiple trucking companies to look at this,” Bruce said. One area: transporting diesel to drilling facilities, with the prospect that if even 1 cent per gallon could be saved through blockchain technology, that’s a significant gain in a market with such tight margins. In a prepared statement announcing the completion of the pilot program, Rebecca Hofmann, chairman of the OOC Oil \u0026 Gas blockchain consortium, said the pilot “proved that non-manned volume validations can trigger automated payments to vendors, and showcase the opportunities that exist for blockchain to reduce costs, increase efficiency, provide transparency and eliminate disputes in the oil and gas industry.” She said the results are “just the tip of the iceberg for the potential of blockchain in our industry.” The OOC consortium laid out some specific wins from the pilot. It said the current process workflow was cut to one to seven days from 90 to 120 days, and the number of steps in the process was cut to seven from 16. The shared network validated 85% of the volume measured automatically, with the expectation that can be driven to 100% in the future. When the network was validated by the network, it automatically kicked off the invoicing process, “which reduces financial risk by giving assurance that payments coincide with field activity.” Tipton said phase 1 involved ensuring all the data needed for the project could be gathered and aligned. Phase 2 will automate invoicing so that a bill sent by Nuverra to Equinor for payment will be a process completely handled by the blockchain once the necessary data is in the system. “This phase is building on the previous phase,” he said.   The OOC consortium’s role is to be a driving force in helping to move along blockchain adoption, Bruce said. “They’ve been taking the lead on what’s required from standardization, what’s required on the regulatory front, does blockchain work and is it ready for prime time,” he said. “So this project kicked off in part to answer that question for them. While the OOC consortium initiative with Nuverra was limited to measuring water disposal, Basu said the Ondiflo deal with the company is covering a wider range of activities, including dispatching. The trucks in the field are working off an Ondiflo app, with the data from it loaded onto the blockchain.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Kingston","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Energy Industry, Fuel News, News, Technology, Truck Driver Issues, Trucking, ","CREATION_DATE":"2020-06-14T07:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/commentary-fedex-microsoft-partnership-points-to-era-of-supply-chain-platforms","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Aoaeh_commentary_060820_1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Commentary: FedEx/Microsoft partnership points to era of supply chain platforms","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The views expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of FreightWaves or its affiliates. On May 18, FedEx and Microsoft announced that they are joining forces to transform commerce. It is the kind of announcement I have been looking forward to and expecting for some time because of Microsoft’s share of the market for desktop operating systems. It is also the kind of announcement that gives us an idea of where innovation in the supply chain may be heading. Supply chain platforms – information, physical products and services   One can think of a supply chain as comprising two parts. The first is a supply chain for information. The second is a supply chain for physical products or services. Without one the other is rendered ineffective at best, perhaps even useless. Physical supply chains involve things like the design and management of networks, logistics and transportation systems and processes to enable the production and movement of goods from one place to another, from producers to consumers. It involves satisfying demand by actually delivering the product or service from its point of production to its point of consumption. Information supply chains involve the design and management of information technologies and systems that facilitate the creation, storage, transmission, management and distribution of information and data related to all the activities that must be fulfilled in physical supply chains in order to match production with consumption. The companies that are great at building and managing the infrastructure required to operate physical supply chains are typically not the same companies that are great at building and managing the infrastructure and software for information supply chains.   Microsoft excels in building information supply chains. FedEx excels in building physical supply chains, especially as they pertain to logistics. It makes sense that at some point a company like Microsoft would partner with a company like FedEx to explore ways in which to make physical and information supply chains work more seamlessly with one another. Where is this heading? In August 2018, Maersk and IBM announced a partnership to build TradeLens, an enterprise blockchain product designed to empower “multiple trading partners to collaborate by establishing a single shared view of a transaction without compromising details, privacy or confidentiality.” Here too, Maersk excels in physical supply chains while IBM excels in information supply chains.   In April 2017, Maersk announced that it would build a marketplace of business applications on Microsoft Azure, in addition to selecting Microsoft “as the preferred cloud partner for Maersk’s digital transformation journey, supporting its high-value assets such as carrier performance, equipment utilization and supplier performance.” A bit of time spent on Google reveals more announcements of this sort, suggesting that we may be in the midst of an unfolding trend. In Global Supply Chain Ecosystems, author Mark Millar, wrote “we have seen supply chains evolve into elongated, inter-connected, multi-layered networks of partners, suppliers, regulators, service providers and customers – with profound interdependencies – which can no longer be described adequately using the linear concept of a ‘chain.’ The depth and breadth of complexity, connectivity and interdependencies are such that we are now firmly in the sphere of global supply chain ecosystems.” If that observation is accurate, then we should expect to see more partnerships like the one between FedEx and Microsoft, the one between Maersk and IBM, and the one between Maersk and Microsoft – wherein the physical supply chain incumbent focuses on what it does best, and relies on its partner to manage the information infrastructure on which to build a supply chain ecosystem. We should also expect to see more partnerships between large companies and emerging startups that have developed proprietary software technology to solve what would formerly be considered narrow problems in specific legacy industries – but with the new advantage of being able to distribute the product over the internet to customers all over the world, instantaneously.   This is the marketplace of business applications that Maersk described. I assume Maersk will open this marketplace to third-party app developers, while perhaps it builds only a handful of applications where it has unique experience and insights which make it best-positioned to build those applications. I expect that FedEx too will follow Maersk’s lead and develop a marketplace of business applications. Other large third-party logistics service providers are probably considering how they should react to this new partnership between FedEx and Microsoft, much in the same way that other large container shipping companies are probably considering how they should react to the news about Maersk.

During the BiTA Symposium @Home, Alisa DiCaprio, head of trade and supply chain at R3, provided an overview of Corda, R3’s blockchain platform. Corda was built for the financial sector, but has been diversified to the automotive sector, working with companies like Daimler, Infosys, Icertis and Kratos Labs to manage fleets, implement machine-to-machine payments, track spare parts and brainstorm the future of mobility. Before COVID-19, R3 focused on Corda going live and digitally representing documents, and revving up on the standards. “But in February 2020, all of that fell apart,” DiCaprio said. “I sit on the International Chamber of Commerce Digital Standard Working Group and we surveyed banks and asked them about the emergency measures they were putting in place. One bank responded that it is possible to go digital in an emergency. It was messy and not sustainable, but it happened, and that changed a lot of people’s minds about where things [with blockchain] are going.” With COVID-19’s disruption, DiCaprio said there’s less pressure and focus on the latest technology and more attention on application and making features reliable to specific problems customers are having. There’s also more focus on creating seamless integrations and enforcing the idea of a visible supply chain.   “There is this acknowledgement that whatever digital technology it is, it needs to be able to scale up and down really quickly. That’s what really didn’t work during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some solutions weren’t able to scale. We saw that with electronic signatures in particular. I worry that there will be a rapid wave of implementation of blockchain solutions before the standards are done.” Logistics beyond land, air and sea For James Regenor, Founder/CEO of VeriTX, COVID-19 provided an opportunity to build upon his 31-year career in the U.S. Air Force using 3D printing for aircraft parts. He recently helped design a low-cost 3D-printable ventilator to assist COVID-19 patients, which is now going through an FDA approval process. The logistics industry, Regenor said, has to look beyond the air, land and sea modalities. “With digital logistics, you can democratize manufacturing to the point of consumption,” said Regenor. “By looking at the convergence of blockchain with 3D printing, you are now able to create a digital asset. This is not e-commerce, it’s d-commerce, which is really slick because you can push something across a border to a ship or aircraft carrier directly from the manufacturer. You can shift the manufacturing to the point of use.”   While Regenor once thought blockchain technology would push the freight forwarders and brokers out of the industry, he admitted he was wrong and what they provide are essential relationships. Blockchain may redefine the values and roles of third-party providers, but even in peer-to-peer digital trusts created in blockchain, those key relationships are fundamental. By unmooring from cryptocurrency, Regenor said, blockchain can create enterprise solutions with social impact like food traceability or prevention of counterfeit goods. But challenges persist, such as interoperability, scale, value creation and behavior modification.    Blockchain and COVID-19 both changed the “realm of the possible” Day one of BiTA Symposium @Home concluded with a roundtable discussion of blockchain projections for the next 24 months. Regenor responded that before COVID-19, people were “dipping a toe into the pool” of blockchain, but the pandemic forced them to jump into the digital realm and see how to create value with data. “The world that I see going into the future is that when a product comes off the manufacturing line, it’s traced all the way to the consumer,” said Vincent Annunziato, director at U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Washington, D.C. “This has innumerable avenues that are positive for the government, private sector and consumers themselves. I don’t know how that would affect the cost for the consumer, but for the security of knowing they got a legitimate product from a legitimate place, the safety of that is incredible.” As far as whether COVID-19’s impact could be metaphorically compared to the asteroid that eventually wiped out the dinosaurs, Chen Zur of Ernst \u0026 Young said COVID-19 could not be considered an asteroid, but could trigger the greatest economic depression we’ve seen in 100 years. What Zur thinks will become more ubiquitous is the importance of digital identity, organizations needing to prove the health of their data, and smart contracts managing the flow of money instead of banks. “The original bitcoin paper in late 2008 just showed up out of nowhere and pulled our blinders back and showed us the realm of the possible,“ said Dale Chrystie, Business Fellow and Blockchain Strategist at FedEx, who also serves as the Chairman of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance Standards Council Board. “Even if blockchain never lives up to what all of us think it will, it has changed the way we think. COVID-19 has also changed what we think is in the realm of the possible. In our case, we instantly created an airline within an airline to react to PPE. It forced us to do things that you could never brainstorm in a conference room.”   One of the perils of COVID-19 was not being able to share patient data securely. Hilary Carter, managing director at the Blockchain Research Institute, reiterated the importance stewarding the blockchain technology forward to realize its operational benefits. Collaboration between competing organizations, she said, is “the order of the day.” The BiTA Symposium @Home will be hosting the second of its three events next Wednesday, June 10.

Long before the COVID-19-induced economic collapse we’re currently facing, FreightTech was the hottest thing in venture capital. Remember that just three to four months ago, venture capitalists (VCs) were talking about how there was more money than deals and they couldn’t find enough great ideas to fund. Fast-forward to our current state, and we’re seeing the next wave of unicorns die on the vine as venture markets tighten and public exits feel nearly impossible. Today’s commentary is about an unassuming entrepreneur from the middle of the country who isn’t letting his location be the nail in the coffin of his Silicon Valley dreams. Taylor Monks of Lincoln, Nebraska was your typical broke college senior in the spring of 2018 before setting off on a two-year mission that has landed him at the helm of one of FreightTech’s hottest startups, BasicBlock. “Like most kids in college, I was broke at the time. I was always having to ask my parents for money – except my dad lives in the U.K., so I wasn’t able to get money transferred from him instantly like many of my classmates. Instead, we started using Bitcoin to transfer money because it was instant and free,” said Monks. The couple of years the Monks’ used Bitcoin to move funds coincided with the growth of the technology – the Great Bitcoin Rally of 2017 and 2018 was on.   “One day in the summer of 2017 my dad messaged me and asked if I’d checked my Bitcoin wallet recently. I hadn’t because I was earning some money at that time so when I opened my wallet, I was shocked to see thousands of U.S. dollars just sitting there. I was blown away.” Taylor was immediately enthralled and began scouring the internet to learn everything he could about blockchain, the underlying technology behind cryptocurrency, so he could better understand the substantial growth in his net worth. “At Thanksgiving 2017 I was home celebrating with some family members in rural Nebraska and everyone around the table was talking about Bitcoin. I thought to myself, ‘Holy shit, this is bigger than anyone realizes.’ And I started right away thinking about how to build a business in the blockchain world.” Monks spent nearly all of his free time during his junior and senior years at Nebraska Wesleyan University learning about blockchain and engaging in the local and global blockchain communities. “The more I learned, the more people I met. Each new learning was a breakthrough for me and made the future look clearer. I knew one day, all payments would become automated. And at that time, I probably thought it was ALL going to happen through blockchain,” Monks admitted as he laughed. During his senior year, all Monks could think about was blockchain and FinTech and how many opportunities existed for startups to thrive in the world. Monks went on to say, “In Nebraska, we have corn and trucks. Interstate 80 connects San Francisco to New York and runs right through the middle of the state. In fact more miles [of I-80] run through Nebraska than any other state. I knew I could leverage technology in the supply chain – be it road transport or agriculture. I started spending time with truckers and farmers. It was obvious that cash flow is the single largest determining factor of a trucking company’s success or failure. Speeding up payment was the perfect problem to solve with technology and that became my life’s mission from that day on.”   After a few internships and side hustle projects with startups in the space like Transferwise, Pipedrive, ScoutSheet and Skype in Estonia and Nebraska, Taylor began looking for a co-founder and researching the process to begin building a tech startup company in Lincoln. “I just started googling things and watching videos on YouTube to see what I could learn about building a startup. We’re not in Silicon Valley and it felt like that was a whole different world. I’d always admired entrepreneurs and tech leaders but never really thought about becoming one. To me, the problem was just too big not to be solved and I couldn’t see anyone around me paying attention to the problem or working on a solution. I just always knew the problem needed to be solved and if no one else was going to do it, why not me?” Taylor said as he grinned. As Taylor’s research progressed, so did his knowledge of the trucking ecosystem. Taylor cold-called fleet owners and hung out at truck stops along Interstate 80, asking rudimentary questions until he knew enough to be dangerous. With a base layer of knowledge and some intuition, Taylor was ready to start offering solutions to trucking companies to automate their workflow with a vision to speed up the entire payment process. He began calling Nebraska- based trucking companies early in 2019. One of the first trucking companies Taylor targeted was W.N. Morehouse Truck Line, Inc. in Omaha. “He just wouldn’t stop calling,” said Curt Morehouse, Office Manager of W.N. Morehouse. “When he first called in, I didn’t take his call. I get a lot of sales calls and blew him off. After the third or fourth call, I finally picked up and listened. Taylor had done some homework but had a lot to learn. He said he wanted to come in and learn my business because he thought he could bring technology that could help. I said ‘Come on in,’ and he did.”   Morehouse tells the story that Taylor and his co-founder showed up, took notes, listened and came back to Curt starry-eyed. “They said they could help.They had a lot of ideas but they were passionate they could get documents back into our TMS [transportation management system] better and faster than the expensive app we were using. I was all ears and told them to come back when they had it mapped out. They were back in a few days and went to work building the solution. By the time they came back with the app, they had some more customers already. They were off and running.” Morehouse and his team invested in the relationship with BasicBlock and gave their feedback on app design, process and ideal workflows, allowing Monks and the team to refine their app over time until it was better and easier to use than the largest providers in the space. “What people didn’t know was I was taking part in clinical trials and taking experimental drugs at the time to make money to live. Sometimes I was feeling the side-effects of a particular drug from a trial I was in but I had to power through and get the work done so we could continue pursuing our mission,” said Monks. With a few happy customers and an exciting new product to offer, Taylor hit the road to explore funding options around Nebraska and the Midwest. “Honestly, there wasn’t a lot. I was fortunate to meet Invest Nebraska that helped me secure a little bit of grant money and then I had to hustle. I found out about Launch, an accelerator run by Jason Calacanis. I applied and we got in. I think it helped that I was from Nebraska; Jason was looking for teams in tech outside of the [Silicon] Valley and I think that helped us out.” After successfully completing LAUNCH, Monks was awarded a small investment from the accelerators syndicate and BasicBlock was on its way. “With the grant money from Invest Nebraska and the check from Jason, we rebuilt our tech team and our product within a few months,” Monks recounted. The product was better than ever and our customers were telling their friends. We started growing faster than we expected so I had to spin up sales while Brett and Corey spun up development and customer success. It has been so crazy – but so fun!”   BasicBlock has continued to rack up new customers and introduce new products over the past nine months and just last week announced it had successfully closed a $1.5 Million Seed Round led by Emergent Ventures with participation from Invest Nebraska, LAUNCH FUND, Rise of The Rest Revolution Seed Fund and SaaS Ventures. Immediately after the round closed, I spoke with Monks and he said, “This is absolutely wild. We went from college kids to venture-backed in a couple of years and we did it in Nebraska. Things like this haven’t happened here in the past, and I think that will change. There were many times I felt like I had to take the company to California or New York if we were going to get people to take us seriously. Hopefully, our success helps others get funded. That idea motivates me.” With money in the bank and recent enterprise partnerships announced, BasicBlock appears to be on the fast track to FreightTech stardom. The COVID-19 pandemic has not slowed the team down; in fact, it appears to be fueling growth as fleets seek to reduce physical contact for drivers, while drivers are finally demanding a more digital experience.","TAGS":"BasicBlock, Bitcoin, Blockchain, FinTech, freight tech, Trucking, venture capital, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Charley Dehoney","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Business, New Tech, News, Startups, Technology, Trucking, ","CREATION_DATE":"2020-05-15T12:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/german-blockchain-anchored-data-security-company-ubirch-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BiTA-Ubirch.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"German blockchain-anchored data security company Ubirch joins BiTA","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Cologne-based blockchain company Ubirch announced it has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an organization dedicated to determining best practices and standards for blockchain in the transportation industry. BiTA’s members include Descartes, Daimler, FedEx and Uber Freight among dozens of other global brands. Ubirch will bring its deep expertise in cyber security technologies to the Alliance and help develop blockchain-based solutions for the Industry. Ubirch is already working hand in hand with strong industry partners. Cooperation with Lufthansa Industry Solutions and mobile security specialist Giesecke \u0026 Devrient Mobile Security shows how logistics and supply chain can work together in the digital age. Blockchain in connection with the Internet of Things (IoT) enables tracking of condition, position and other data-points, directly from containers, ships, forklifts, AGVs or trucks, allowing for a data-driven aupply chain and parametric transport insurance that reacts immediately when something goes wrong. For example, using an air cargo container, Ubirch, together with Lufthansa Industry Solutions, demonstrate how this works with 5G, damage-detection on the Edge and secure data transmission. Stephan Noller, CEO at Ubirch, said, “Ubirch’s partnership with BiTA, as well as working alongside other global industry leaders in transportation, logistics and supply chain, will allow us to engage in the development of security standards for how blockchain technology will be used in such transportation activities as track and trace, provenance, smart contract management and fraud detection. By helping to develop a common framework and standards by working with other industry participants, we will promote broad adoption of this disruptive digital technology for transportation and logistics.” “Blockchain technology will transform the supply chain by introducing greater transparency, innovation and efficiency,” said Patrick Duffy, BiTA President. “We are fortunate to have member companies like Ubirch, that have experience with blockchain security applications. It will be a key player in helping us develop blockchain standards in transportation.”   The Ubirch solution works in a similar fashion to notarizing a contract. The seal can still be broken and the contract changed but not without leaving traces (evidence of tampering), and if these traces are detected, the original document can be retrieved from the notary’s archive for comparison. Innovative cryptography and blockchain technologies guarantee the trustworthiness of IoT data. While most other IoT security solutions focus on securing the transmission channel and/or the device, Ubirch focuses on securing the IoT data-packets individually. The advantage and uniques selling proposition of this approach are pervasiveness, warranted authenticity and order of sequence as the security is attached to the data-packets with these interlinked in a blockchain. They are always secured – even if they have been transmitted over non-secure channels. Ubirch technology – deployable as software or on SIM-cards – is aimed primarily at customers in the industrial, smart cities, insurance, IoT start-ups, energy supply, homeland security and logistics segments. About Ubirch Ubirch is the specialist for blockchain-based security technology in the field of IoT with locations in Cologne, Berlin and Munich, Germany.

Deloitte tweeted in 2017 that 10% of the global gross domestic product would be built on top of blockchain. However in 2020, the conversations around blockchain have turned inward, and in some cases, pessimistic. Interested parties question blockchain’s profitability and success because companies have serious hesitation about sharing private data with other companies. Craig Montgomery, senior vice president of global branding and marketing at Powerfleet, believes blockchain’s big bang moment will occur in an area with the highest value and risk and where people are willing to pay for the data – the pharmaceutical industry. “Blockchain won’t gain broad adoption in any market or vertical until it’s truly commercialized, and a hallmark of that is when third-party companies are willing to pay for the value of the data within it,” said Montgomery. “Also, an impartial player leading the blockchain efforts will be key. Blockchain data on our supply chain will illuminate areas that are inefficient in various lanes and supply chain management. So the organization advocating and managing a supply chain blockchain can’t have anything to hide or any axe to grind.” The New York Supply Chain Meetup organized its first 2020 conversation with representatives from IBM Blockchain and TradeLens. Freightwave’s takeaway from this discussion was that blockchain will be best utilized when applied to a supply chain network across an entire industry.   The pharmaceutical industry, Montgomery believes, is the perfect space for the commercialization of blockchain, because it’s already heavily regulated, its products are environmentally sensitive and need to be monitored, and they are very valuable in both cost and societal impact. This makes their products primed for the transparency that blockchain can provide. For instance, every time a pharmaceutical product goes bad, it’s the pharmaceutical company, not the trucking company’s responsibility to complete a corrective and preventive action report (CAPA), run diagnostics to understand the cause of the issue, and write a report to ensure the same scenario will be avoided. Using blockchain, a company like Bristol-Myers Squibb, for example, would have access to robust supply chain data (location, hauler, ambient- and product-level temperatures within the trailer or container) from various logistics providers. Data such as this becomes very helpful in identifying the root cause of a temperature variance that could harm several pallets of product worth millions of dollars. Projecting $1.3 trillion in global sales for 2020, the pharmaceutical industry can afford an end-to-end technological investment. Of those sales, 28% goes towards cold chain cargo or environmentally sensitive products – products that cause the industry to lose $35 billion each year due to temperature deviations. This amount of waste is too expensive and time-consuming for an industry whose priority is human health and survival. When looking at the current environment with COVID-19 and the criticality of pharmaceutical products, sensitive medical equipment or other key items such as plasma, the value of a blockchain for the industry’s global supply chain makes complete sense. “Being able to identify where key medical supplies are during shipment, and ensuring their environmental status is known and stable is key,” said Montgomery. “We must move quickly to provide the industry with a more holistic and robust view of pharmaceutical and medical products.”   The ongoing Drug Quality Security Act (DQSA) states that by 2021 the government must “Develop regulations establishing enhanced drug distribution security systems for interoperable electronic tracing of product at the package level.” This will require not only traceability, but being able to validate that a drug is indeed not counterfeit. This means that pharmaceuticals anywhere in the supply chain must have the ability to be scanned for quick information access to prove the drugs’ authenticity via barcode or small bluetooth chip encoded with its manufacturing date, etc. However, 2020 is here, but there is no centralized database in the cloud allowing for the collection and dissemination of that data. “The only way you can make the DQSA work efficiently is with blockchain,” said Montgomery. “It won’t work efficiently otherwise, because information has to feed from multiple sources into a single database across all of the chains of custody for that to work. And, it has to be cryptographically secure. That is by definition a blockchain.” Here’s another alternative for blockchain commercialization – one pharmaceutical company decides single-handedly to provide qualifying data for its products at any point in the supply chain. Anyone could scan to see that the product was kept at a controlled temperature for the entire journey from bulk manufacturers to redistribution centers, and eventually, the consumer.   “Consumers may choose to buy one brand over the other if they feel better about it because they know it was kept within its limits during shipment – which in turn will elevate their brand,” said Montgomery. Consumers already think about supply chain transparency when they make food purchases, whether they’re conscious of it or not. How chickens were raised, how many times the spinach was rinsed and whether or not the granola was packaged alongside peanuts are primary health and lifestyle concerns for consumers. Blockchain would just take transparency to the next level. When inoculations, whether for the flu or whooping cough, go bad, they become less effective. The problem is, the defective product has the same appearance as the bonafide product. It’s imperative that consumers standing in line for a vaccine aren’t given a dose only 60% effective because it was not shipped or stored properly. “Our ability to effectively combat this sort of stuff as a country is going to rely on the sanctity and the transparency and the effectiveness of our supply chain,” said Montgomery. “And the only thing that can handle all that is blockchain.”  ","TAGS":"Blockchain, cold chain logistics, pharmaceuticals, PowerFleet, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Corrie White","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, ","CREATION_DATE":"2020-04-01T11:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/bmw-group-uses-blockchain-to-improve-auto-parts-traceability","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_303881333.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BMW Group uses blockchain to improve auto parts traceability","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"BMW Group has announced that it will adopt blockchain to improve transparency across its global supply chain, specifically targeted at the parts and raw materials procurement segment. A blockchain network, in essence, is a decentralized and immutable ledger that helps store information effectively. It does this by making every stakeholder within the network equally responsible as ‘custodians of the data’ that flows within it. Enabling collective liability fosters transparency within the ecosystem, as every stakeholder in the chain is now privy to all the information that flows through the network. For a massive entity like BMW, using blockchain can help optimize its operations and increase traceability in its supply chain, while also making sure the data being shared is tamper-proof. “In 2019, we conducted a successful pilot project to purchase front lights. This year, we want to expand the project to a large number of other suppliers,” said Andreas Wendt, a member of the Board of Management of BMW AG responsible for the purchasing and supplier network. Understanding the provenance of components is vital for an original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The occurrence of faulty auto parts on a vehicle is disastrous for the company’s bottom line and reputation, because it can cause accidents and will lead to a mass recall – complicating the relationship between owners and the OEM.   Until recently, the usual practice was for OEMs and their suppliers to store and manage their data in their separate IT systems. This often led stakeholders in the auto supply chain to work in silos, lacking any forms of consistent communication between each other. BMW is working to make the environment more collaborative by initiating the PartChain project, which will ensure “seamless traceability of components and provide immediate data transparency in complex supply chains for all partners involved going forward.” PartChain works on blockchain technology and will enable tamper-proof and consistently verifiable collection and transaction of data in BMW’s supply chain. The 2019 parts tracking via blockchain was a start; it involved BMW’s plants in Spartanburg, South Carolina and Dingolfing, Germany, as well as three locations of its supplier, Automotive Lighting. BMW now plans to build on to the pilot, eventually reaching a point where the company can have complete traceability of critical raw materials – from mines to smelters. Right now, however, the platform will be rolled out to about 10 suppliers. “This move is designed to take the digitalization of purchasing at the BMW Group to the next level. Our vision is to create an open platform that will allow data within supply chains to be exchanged and shared safely and anonymized across the industry,” said Wendt.   BMW had also initiated a consortium called the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI) in 2018, which brings together 120 companies from the automotive, mobility and technology sectors. MOBI engages all the different stakeholders within the consortium to create common standards and control models needed for blockchain to break through in the mobility sector. “We want to share our PartChain approach with the initiative and invite interested companies to join the initiative,” said Wendt.","TAGS":"auto parts traceability, Blockchain, blockchain technology, BMW Group, decentralized ledger, supply chain transparency, Transparency, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Europe, International, New Tech, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2020-04-01T08:22:22-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/data-gumbo-joins-blockchain-in-transport-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BiTA-Data-Gumbo.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Data Gumbo joins Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"GumboNet network delivers industry speed, accuracy, visibility and transparency with smart contracts","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Data Gumbo Corp., the trusted transactional blockchain network for tomorrow’s industrial leaders, announced that it has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an organization dedicated to determining best practices and standards for blockchain in the transportation industry.

However, what keeps logistics moving? In 2020, we’re seeing new global pressures, opportunities in ecommerce markets and alliances coalescing around new technologies. Here’s a look at some of the top logistics trends impacting supply chain management, shipping, compliance and more. January 1, 2020, marked the beginning of the first calendar year in which new maritime regulations for sulfur dioxide (SOx) will be in full effect. Freight-carrying ships have been under fire for heavy crude oil emissions since at least 2005, the year the International Maritime Organization (IMO) ratified Annex VI, which began tightening emissions standards for ships at sea. Enforcement authorities in ports are ramping up compliance verification, which is big news for shipping and logistics companies.   According to the IMO, switching to higher-quality, lower-sulfur fuel is likely to bring about a 77% decrease in SOx emissions per year, or around 8.5 million tons. Experts link sulfur dioxide to acid rain, climate change, premature death and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Making this change could raise the cost of fuel oil from $400 to $600 per metric ton. It’s an expenditure made for the best possible reasons, but it may still cause a ripple effect. According to a 2018 report, blockchain is on track to bring a 5% increase in global GDP and a 15% rise in trade volume, and it’s not hard to understand why. Global supply chains are already heavy with data – from ships and trucks, sensors, shipping pallets, business partners and inventory management systems. Blockchain provides unprecedented visibility and security for this first- and third-party information. The industry knows it, which is why groups like the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) are growing.   A spokesperson for LaneAxis, a BiTA partner, explained why logistics technologies are already coalescing around industry blockchain standards. “[Third-party logistics firms] have held an iron-grip on the industry for far too long. [Our] focus is solely on leveraging blockchain to create a shipper-to-carrier direct network that will eliminate the need for freight brokers and 3PLs that charge exorbitant rates.” Blockchain helps achieve a supply chain trend that’s becoming common across multiple industries – eliminate wasteful intermediaries and recover value companies could better use elsewhere. Research shows that artificial intelligence (AI) is better at predicting outcomes and making projections than unaided human cognition. Richard Nisbett and Lee Ross, two cognitive scientists, are explicit on this point, claiming, “Human judges are not merely worse than optimal regression equations; they are worse than almost any regression equation.”   A vast amount of opportunities exist to put AI to work in shipping and logistics, including: · More accurate predictions for customer demand mean more lead time and opportunities for distributors and shippers to engage in predictive shipping. · Substantial predictive insights into back-office functions, such as looking for potentially risky language in business contracts. · Optimizing shipping routes and making last-mile delivery more efficient, helping companies save money on fuel costs. Shipping companies are gearing up to meet rising global demand for refrigerated shipped products – including foods, beverages and pharmaceuticals – through 2020 and beyond.   Some reasons for this growth include shifting consumer preferences, such as the rising demand for non-local foodstuffs. Plus, globalization has significantly expanded the accessibility and diversity of perishable goods available for shipment. Research shows that refrigerated shipping containers should expect a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.2% through 2025, which is faster than the growth of any other container market segment. To answer this challenge, companies are expanding their fleets of refrigerated trucks and shipping containers, not to mention climate-controlled warehouses. To prepare for 2020 and beyond, Ocean Network Express announced the addition of 6,000 new refrigerated containers to its fleet. Hapag-Lloyd announced the addition of 13,420 new refrigerated containers. Other service providers will have to reevaluate their preparedness as customers demand more. One report predicts a 12.6% CAGR for warehouse automation technologies through 2024. One of the cited reasons is the low – 3.8% – rate of unemployment in the U.S, making it more difficult to find and retain talent in logistics and distribution. Warehouses and distribution centers have a great deal to gain from automating critical processes, such as: · Machine vision inspections significantly reduce the rate of errors, including cutting down on the likelihood of shipping damaged, incomplete or incorrect items to customers.   · Robotic automated guided vehicles (AGVs) reduce repetitive motion and lifting injuries in warehouses by raising, transporting and preparing heavy shipments without human intervention. · Compared with human warehouse workers, robotic order-pickers can locate bins and identify products faster and with greater accuracy. Companies everywhere are heeding consumer demand for greener products and processes. Research shows that products marketed as sustainable accounted for half of the growth of the consumer packaged goods (CPG) market between 2013 and 2018. Therefore, the world’s supply chains are becoming circular rather than linear. For instance, manufacturers are looking at ways to improve product longevity and the ease with which they can recover, repair and resell goods. The circular economy also impacts shipping and packaging choices. Governments throughout the world are taking steps to cut waste from supply chains and boost recycling and reuse for commonly used products. European Union member countries must now recycle half of their packaging waste. In California, businesses cannot use plastic bags and must recycle 25% of their plastic containers. In Japan, companies must reuse all packaging materials.   One might choose to look at these regulations as a burden. However, reusing products for longer, rather than buying new, provides financial benefits as well as environmental ones. Each of these trends is consequential in its own right, but they add up to a global supply chain that’s maturing rapidly.New technologies and consumer and regulatory demands require new ways of thinking – but they bring financial and competitive opportunities as well.","TAGS":"Blockchain in transport alliance, blockchain technology, green logistics, logistics, logistics disruption, logistics industry, logistics robots, logistics service providers, logistics software, logistics technology, logistics visibility, reefers, refrigerated trucks, Robotics, Supply chain digitalization, Supply chain disruption, supply chain industry, supply chain logistics, supply chain software, supply chain technology, Supply chains, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Kayla Matthews","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Business, Global Supply Chain, International, Logistics, New Tech, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2020-02-18T13:30:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/digitization-promises-to-level-the-supply-chain-playing-field","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/digital-supply-chain-shutterstock.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Digitization promises to level the supply chain playing field","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"If there is one segment of global freight movement that fosters distrust, it is the supply chain. Goods move around the world, change hands multiple times, sit unattended for long stretches, and ultimately show up in a warehouse or on a store shelf. Few know how they got there, and most don’t care. But all the intermediaries responsible for ensuring that good reached that shelf do care. They care that the product is in good condition; they care that it arrived on time; and they care that it arrived in the least costly way possible so as to maximize the profit margin. Slip up in any one of these steps, and someone doesn’t get paid. The result: lack of confidence in the system. Take the example of the trucker who picks up product and makes the delivery on time, only to find out the load was damaged during loading. It’s not the driver’s fault, but the receiver wants to hold someone responsible, so damage costs come out of the driver’s pay. Can that driver go back to the shipper and demand the lost payment? Maybe, but the time and expense of doing so will likely cost more than the lost payment is worth. It is exactly these types of scenarios that blockchain backers believe the technology is destined to solve. According to the Institute for the Future, “A blockchain is an online database that stores information across a network of personal computers, making it not just decentralized, but distributed. This means no central company or person owns the database, yet everyone in the network can use and help run it, but not tamper with it.”   At the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) Spring Symposium in Atlanta, Agoric CEO Dean Tribble explained how the immutable aspects of blockchain technology underpin smart contracts and build that trust. “Blockchains provide high integrity to data and choices,” Tribble said. “A smart contract reduces the cost of creating arrangements with people that you can rely on. That’s the game-changer; that’s one of the reasons why people are so deeply excited about this.” A key element of a blockchain is that it requires a cryptographically created key. Without the key, the information is hidden. The key may be nothing more than a login screen, but it helps provide the security that ensures the blockchain is a true representation of the transaction it represents. In the supply chain, that is the movement of shipments. One of the special features of a blockchain is that everyone included in the chain has access to all the data in the chain — complete transparency — but can only alter their part of the chain. Basically, blockchain is a record-keeping tool, and the supply chain is all about record keeping.   Within the supply chain, the movement of a single box can generate hundreds of documents and thousands of data points. Customs paperwork, bills of lading, vehicle GPS data and even available driving hours for truck drivers are just a few of the possible data points. The digitization of these data points, and the use of blockchain to verify them, is the here and now. In the journey of a shipment, what happens if a driver shows up late? Typically, there may be some kind of financial penalty, but what if the contract stipulated penalties are not to be assessed for situations beyond the driver’s control, such as weather or detention at the pickup facility? Without the ability to document and verify those circumstances, it becomes the driver’s word against the receiver’s, and drivers rarely win that argument. A blockchain-based digital record, though, would record all that data, including GPS location, and verify that the truck spent more time at a facility due to slow loading. It could also pull in weather data and “lock” that information into the digital record, showing that the driver had to slow down or even stop due to a snowstorm. That is the hope that blockchain and digitization provide for the supply chain. It is the ability to document, verify and record data points that prove a single point of truth and eliminate the he-said, she-said aspect of transactions.   FreightTrust is one company that has taken the digitization of the supply chain to new levels. The company offers a complete cloud-based electronic data interchange (EDI) and paperless document platform for shippers, carriers, brokers and other third parties. The digitization means finance and factoring can be integrated, allowing for real-time insight into the finances of any job and shipment details. Integrated real-time GPS tracking and instant quoting and carrier availability streamline costs. Additionally, parties sign documents electronically and automate customs paperwork and even duties payments. The current supply chain is siloed and burdened by trust issues. Trucking and the supply chain may be about relationships, but they are relationships built on a hill, one rainstorm away from crumbling. Blockchain and the digitization of the supply chain promise to transform the status quo. “Digitization will change that, bringing down walls and creating a completely integrated ecosystem that is fully transparent to all the players involved,” according to an article in the Harvard Business Review. “This ecosystem will depend on several key digital technologies — including logistics platforms, analytics, robots, and even 3D printing. Those who move quickly to digitize their supply chain will gain efficiencies, develop new business models and revenue streams, and create competitive advantage.”  ","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain supply chain, Digitization, FreightTrust, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Trucking, ","CREATION_DATE":"2020-02-04T14:10:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/opentext-joins-the-blockchain-in-transport-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/BiTA_opentext.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"OpenText joins the Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"OpenText™, a global leader in Enterprise Information Management (EIM), has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) to network with companies exploring the use of blockchain technologies across their supply chain operations.

Much of the discourse and sentiment surrounding the application of blockchain, and other distributed ledger technologies, in enterprise supply chains has taken a decidedly pessimistic turn. This is evident on Meetup.com where blockchain and cryptocurrency meetups that used to be very active have become decidedly and remarkably less so. According to a press release issued by Gartner Inc. on October 8, 2019, blockchain technologies that are most mature have slipped into the trough of disillusionment, while less mature blockchain technologies are approaching the peak of inflated expectations. So it was with a bit of nervousness that The New York Supply Chain Meetup organized its first meetup of 2020 on Thursday, January 23, #TNYSCM18 – Blockchains in Supply Chain. We wanted to hear directly from people building away from the hype, the crowds and the noise.    The view from IBM and Maersk First, we heard from Nigel Gopie, Head of Marketing for IBM Blockchain, and Zach Tomlinson, Head of Marketing for TradeLens. They were interviewed by Rachel Premack, Senior Transportation Reporter at Business Insider. My take from the hour-plus conversation among them is that, while there are still issues that need to be ironed out, the enterprises with the most entrenched supply chain management problems remain committed to the application of blockchains in supply chain, where it makes sense to do so. One of the issues that is slowing progress is that blockchains really only make sense if applied within a supply chain network, preferably across an industry.   That is raising questions about governance that businesses did not have to contend with in the past. It is also raising questions about the nature of competition in a scenario where the greatest value is obtained from businesses that collaborate as part of an industry consortium. The view from early-stage startup land Second, we heard from four startup showcase speakers:   Each of them described enterprise deployments in progress. It should not be surprising all of them appear to be growing customer adoption by using a land-and-expand approach. That is, first enterprises test the products and services on a relatively small scale, and growth occurs as customers gain comfort and confidence, and start to understand how the product can enhance the customer’s business operations, as a result start using the product or service more broadly within the company. “How do you make money?” quickly became a refrain during the meetup. The responses to that question varied to cover almost every customary and established software pricing model one would expect. The bottom line is that, when it comes to blockchain applications for enterprise supply chains, there’s still some experimentation going on to determine what pricing models work best. Nevertheless, the urgency with which the audience asked each speaker that question makes it clear to me that the conversation around blockchains in supply chain is moving beyond the novelty of the technology, and starting to focus more on the creation of value for customers and the extraction of value for startups themselves. In that vein, Connecting-Food is a startup based in Paris that audits and tracks food chains in real-time. After speaking on the phone with Samantha Gadenne, International Business Developer for Connecting-Food in early December, I emailed her to ask what is causing Connecting-Food’s growth in customer adoption. She said, “One of the reasons we have been able to scale is because we provide a one-stop-shop that helps food brands and retailers address both their internal traceability challenges and their external customer transparency issues, instead of having to find multiple solution providers.” My opinion about the state of affairs in blockchain + supply chain   According to Avivah Litan, a vice president of research at Gartner, “Blockchain technologies have not yet lived up to the hype and most enterprise blockchain projects are stuck in experimentation mode. Blockchain is not yet enabling a digital business revolution across business ecosystems and may not until at least 2028, when Gartner expects blockchain to become fully scalable technically and operationally.” I agree with that assessment. We know that every new technology must encounter and conquer technological, sociological, psychological and economic barriers before it can succeed. It is only after it has gained a firm foothold among innovators and early adopters that a new technology starts to gain traction with the wider population of potential users or customers. Innovators and early adopters show what is possible with a new technology by creating innovations based on the new technology’s specific and unique characteristics when the rest of the world is still skeptical, pessimistic or downright cynical. This process takes time. Nearly 30 years elapsed between the first time two computers at MIT’s Lincoln Lab communicated with one another, to the creation of web browsers. We all know what has happened since 1994. It is likely something similar will happen with blockchains in enterprise supply chains. In my February 18, 2018 blog post, #ChainReaction: Notes on Centralized, Decentralized and Distributed Systems, I delineated when centralized systems are preferable over decentralized systems. Based on that work, I understand that the technology questions that must be solved before successfully deploying blockchains in enterprise supply chains are much more tractable than the culture questions that must be tackled for that to happen. What is the culture question? It is the question of how companies in the shipping industry do business with one another, for example. It is about how companies in the food and agriculture sector engage collaboratively with one another, as another example. You get the point; It is the people question that was alluded to during the discussion with IBM and Maersk.   How do people and companies that have traditionally not needed to cooperate significantly with one another learn to do so in that way that is necessary to unlock the full value of blockchains, and other distributed ledger technology? It takes time. Something took me completely by surprise at the event. There is nothing outwardly fancy about our meetups. We are just a bunch of people who are obsessively enthusiastic about supply chains, innovation and technology. I assumed we’d have a low turnout. When I took a count of people at about 6:30 p.m., we had more than 60 at the event. Many more arrived between 6:30 and 7:00 p.m. Many had to stand. I assumed most people would leave early. I was wrong. By my estimate 80% or more of the people who came stayed. We were supposed to end at 8:00 p.m., or 8:15 at the latest. We started promptly on time. The last group of people who were talking to one another left at about 9:30 p.m. I did not get home till after 11:00… Based on the enthusiasm at #TNYSCM18, I would say that rumors about the death of blockchains in supply chain have been wildly exaggerated.   If you are a team working on a blockchain innovation for enterprise supply chains that is gaining adoption, we’d love to tell your story in FreightWaves. I am easy to reach on LinkedIn and Twitter.

Or not. Their value will be evident in the next few years as more businesses roll out smart contracts to handle the paperwork side of logistics. Whether that will result in a sea change for the industry or just a more streamlined process remains to be seen, but smart contracts are coming — and coming quickly. Smart contracts are based on blockchain technology, but their promise lies in the ability to streamline paperwork processes — everything from order to payment — and improve confidence among parties that all aspects of the contract will be executed. At the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) Spring Symposium in Atlanta, Agoric CEO Dean Tribble explained some of the transportation-specific use cases for smart contracts. These include driver credential verification; chain of custody; payment; automated payment release; automated accounts receivable loans for completed delivery; and links to associated financial transactions. Recent tests of smart contracts have demonstrated a significant cut in bill of lading (BOL) transfer time to as few as four minutes and payments to carriers being made in just hours instead of days or weeks.   The term “smart contract” may be unfamiliar to many, but it is not new. Thousands of people already utilize smart contracts on a daily basis. “The first smart contract happened in 1989,” Ron Leibman, a partner with McCarter \u0026 English, a full-service law firm headquartered in Newark, New Jersey, told attendees at the BiTA Symposium Chicago in November. “If you use Paypal and Venmo, those are smart contracts because you agree to terms and there’s automatic processing.” National law firm BakerHostetler has partnered with Clause, a software platform for smart legal contracts, to develop a blockchain-based automated legal agreement for the freight market. This is a smart legal contract available digitally to the involved parties which tracks the post-signature performance of the contract by integrating with the existing enterprise systems. According to Katherine Lowry, director of practice services at BakerHostetler, leveraging blockchain creates more transparency and “notarize(s)” that certain events in the transaction happened, such as timely pickup or delivery, or even the use of lumpers when needed.   “After a traditional contract is signed, all you have is a PDF,” Lowry explained. “Someone has to create an Excel spreadsheet that calculates one metric, configure a software system to manage another, and manually input data or send emails to ensure everything flows smoothly in carrying out the contract. It’s inefficient, difficult to track and more likely to create deviations from the agreement.” From the perspective of a trucking company or owner-operator, the smart contract could be the most positive change to happen in the industry in decades. Smart contracts can turn the old BOL into an interactive document that follows the shipment from origin to destination, recording each step along the way and triggering executables, such as fuel surcharge payments or detention payments, when certain conditions are met.   Smart contracts also can speed up the payment process, automatically triggering payment upon delivery verification. The simple act of scanning the barcode on a box or receiving an electronic signature will trigger that payment. According to Leibman, the ability to standardize language in a smart contract can also dramatically speed the process and lower costs. “I think the more forward-thinking folks in the smart contracts area are not thinking all or nothing, they are thinking, what areas of the contract [can we automate] so folks can have a paralegal look over the contract instead of a lawyer.” Standardizing contracts that include costs for detention or accessorial charges and that trigger those payments automatically could potentially reduce time truckers spend chasing payments that may never materialize. FreightTrust offers a digital freight management solution for brokers, carriers and shippers. “The FreightTrust Protocol for Smart Contracts enables not just a completely paperless workflow for carriers, it also provides new opportunities for leveraging data to make better decisions,” the company said. Smart contracts have already found success in other areas of society, from financial markets to e-commerce payments, and there is no reason to believe they can’t be successful in logistics markets.

The technology that underpins Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies has developed a complicated reputation. Is it the savior of all things logistics or another fad destined to build a market, only to bring down all those involved? Is it creating the new dot-com bubble? The technology certainly has its detractors, and it unfortunately has become synonymous with Bitcoin, which saw a rapid rise in value in 2017 only to come crashing down months later as the promised replacement for the world’s global currencies failed to live up to expectations. Blockchain, though, remains a viable technology that will ultimately alter the landscape of many segments of the global economy — it just needs time. “We are seeing some interesting real-world applications emerging,” said Patrick Duffy, president of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). BiTA is the leading global organization supporting the development of blockchain and blockchain standards within the supply chain.   Walmart has been testing blockchain-based tracking in its logistics operation, and IBM (NYSE: IBM) has been a leading proponent. The Maersk (CSE: AMKBF) The Maersk project has led to the development of the blockchain-based TradeLens platform for global shipping. Walmart Canada just announced it would deploy blockchain technology starting in January for its third-party carriers. It is companies like these that convince Duffy blockchain will eventually move into the mainstream. “The solutions will be pushed, in my opinion, by major retailers when they are ready. When Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and the major retailers in the world are ready to go all in on blockchain technology, there will be a way for these smaller players to use it. They won’t need to develop it themselves,” he said.   Duffy explained that blockchain will eventually be a background system for transportation management systems (TMS) and other solutions, meaning fleets and shippers, regardless of size, will not need to have blockchain experts on staff. “They will be uploading information from Shipper A needing to send a 53-foot trailer to Retailer A’s warehouse in Virginia, and [blockchain] will take the unstructured data, put it into structures, and share it to provide complete visibility into the process,” Duffy said. “If something goes wrong, it will provide a complete and immutable trail to find where something went wrong and why.” At its recent Chicago meeting, BiTA announced it would participate in two real-world tests of blockchain. One will be BiTA-led and will use a permission blockchain. The organization will also be involved in a project with the Port of Miami and the Florida Blockchain Foundation on a multi-modal blockchain-enabled platform. A shipping line, terminal operator, freight forwarder, airport organization, insurer, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and customs are involved in the project as well.   Blockchain breaks through trust barriers, which is why so many believe the supply chain is the perfect use case for it. With multiple parties involved in moving freight — including, among others, shippers, ocean carriers, port operators, truck drivers, warehouse workers and the end customer, none of whom know or trust each other — blockchain’s ability to verify that each party has executed its part of the freight contract correctly is the solution so many in the industry are searching for. Getting there has just taken awhile. “This is not a technology play, this is a business model shift, so it needs to be approached that way,” Duffy said. “It’s not just your tech team that is involved in this journey. It’s your whole organization that is going to be affected by this.” The examples cited above provide clear evidence that blockchain has arrived as a technology. Getting buy-in from executives, though, is taking a bit longer. Dr. Mary Lacity, director of the Blockchain Center of Excellence at the Walton School of Business at the University of Arkansas, said her team analyzed 36,000 10-k forms of publicly held companies, and only 242 mentioned blockchain or distributed ledger technology.   “Our C-suites are getting really fatigued by blockchain, so we have to shift the conversation to the value it provides,” she said. That value proposition, including operational efficiencies, cost reductions and verification, is what will bring blockchain to new heights. One of the companies showing the value exists is FreightTrust. The San Francisco-based company offers a cloud EDI (electronic data interchange) and paperless document platform for supply chain businesses. Among the business cases the company can solve for is the automation of detention claims. Leveraging blockchain technology, FreightTrust is able to integrate finance and factoring into operations. Real-time GPS tracking of deliveries allows it to instantly update timestamps to make detention payout resolutions quick and accurate. U.S. Customs duties payments are also integrated, along with the opportunity to validate insurance for new shipments. All of these processes, while common on many logistics platforms, benefit from the immutability that a blockchain-based platform provides. All parties to the transaction can be assured that the information is correct and verified. FreightTrust’s platform can be integrated with leading telematics solutions, including PC*Miler, BlueJay Solutions, Trimble, SMC3, McLeod Software and Descartes.

With each year and each holiday shopping season that passes, global retail ecommerce sales attain a new record. According to forecasts released in February 2019 by Statista, ecommerce sales in the United States have grown from about $468 billion in 2017 to about $550 billion in 2019, and will grow to more than $740 billion in 2023. Over the period that these projections cover: Confirmation of this phenomenon comes in this press release issued by Amazon.com on December 26, 2019: Customers Shopped at Record Levels this Holiday Season with Billions of Items Ordered Worldwide – Plus Customers Purchased Tens of Millions of Amazon Devices.   However, an insidious problem accompanies all this growth – returns. How bad is the problem of returns in retail ecommerce? In this article, retail ecommerce refers only to the sale of physical goods to private, individual end-consumers, through a digital channel. In its 2018 Consumer Returns in the Retail Industry report, Appris Retail incorporated data from the National Retail Federation’s (NRF) Organized Retail Crime Survey and concluded that:   The data makes it clear that fraud and abuse increase during each holiday shopping period. However, the data specific to ecommerce is even more dire. In Retailers Brace for Returns This Holiday Season, published by eMarketer on December 12, 2018, the author states: “According to data from B-Stock Solutions, a liquidation platform founded in 2008 by the team that built eBay’s private marketplace business, around 11% to 13% of holiday purchases are returned with closer to 30% of online purchases being sent back. By their estimates, between $90 billion to $95 billion in holiday gifts will be returned this year.” Before you get tempted to think that is a temporary blip, B-Stock Solutions estimates that “77% of shoppers are anticipating returning some of their gifts this season [2019], and nearly 20% expect to return more than half. In total, that will equate to more than $90 billion in returns this holiday season.” That’s a problem, since returns reduce profits, and increase operating costs for merchants. The experience of processing returns also has an impact on customer satisfaction and loyalty. The image below from eMarketer’s article about returns outlines the categories of products online shoppers are most likely to return, comparing 2017 and 2018. Even if we assume no change from 2018 to 2019, one must admit that the data is startling, and returns represent a significant and growing problem for all ecommerce merchants.   In its 2019 Holiday Flash Report,1010data points out that online returns are both more frequent and more costly, since many ecommerce merchants offer free shipping for returns. According to 1010data: Insights from the field According to Crunchbase, “Optoro is a technology company that helps retailers and brands manage, process and disposition returned and excess inventory,” and “B-Stock Solutions offers liquidation sales management solutions for companies.” B-Stock Solutions has raised $73.2 million over three funding rounds, with the most recent being a growth equity round of $65 million led by Spectrum Equity. Other investors in B-Stock include Susquehanna Growth Equity, True Ventures and Harrison Metal. Optoro was founded in 2010 and has raised $244.4 million over eight funding rounds. The most recent round of financing was a corporate round of undisclosed size from IKEA. Other investors in Optoro include Franklin Templeton Investments, UPS, Kleiner Perkins, Revolution, and Grotech Ventures. Optoro raised $40 million in venture debt in July 2016.   In addition to competing with one another, Optoro and B-Stock Solutions compete directly with Happy Returns, Loop Returns and Returnly. Optoro and B-Stock serve both digital native and digital immigrant brands, while the others appear to focus on digital native brands. Howard Rosenberg built eBay’s Private Marketplace business. After more than six years doing that, he and the team that built the business left eBay in 2008, taking the business with them to form B-Stock Solutions. As you might imagine, he’s seen various incarnations of the returns problem, and has a unique view of the role reverse and last-mile logistics are playing as ecommerce continues to grow. I asked Rosenberg for his perspective about how the retail industry, and ecommerce merchants in particular, are turning to technology to help them manage the problem posed by returns, and how this has changed over the past decade. According to Rosenberg, three main things have changed in retail over the past 10 years: I pressed him for a bit more background, with some examples of how B-Stock helps solve this problem, given that it appears to only be getting more acute each year. He sent me this response: “Returns have become the ‘freemium’ offering of ecommerce; retailers know if they get new consumers to buy things, they can build on that relationship and keep the customer over a long period of time with repeat purchases – building their lifetime value to the retailer. The fastest path to purchase is to remove all risk, and a liberal return policy achieves that. But an easy return for the customer has become a logistical and financial nightmare for the retailer; this is forcing companies to rethink processes for how they offset loss, both pre- and post-return. The smart ones are turning to technology.   Some retailers are using augmented reality apps to give shoppers a better way of visualizing the product and thereby cutting down on buyer’s remorse. Other companies are enlisting third parties to discreetly track how often shoppers return purchases and punishing serial abusers. We’re also seeing a few retailers adopt technology-based programs for how to deal with the merchandise once it’s returned to the warehouse. For example, there are software-as-a-service inventory management solutions that – based on data – determine the best channel for an item once it returns to the warehouse (re-shelve, refurbish, liquidate, scrap). More of this returned inventory is being slated directly for liquidation into the secondary market. This is due to a few reasons including: Many retailers are leveraging newer technology-based liquidation methods like B-Stock’s. We bring a huge business buyer network and introduce real-time competition for the goods, which produces higher pricing on the merchandise as well as a faster sales cycle in which the inventory is sold.   Adoption of our B2B [business-to-business] liquidation marketplace platform has spiked in the last decade. We now operate over 60 B2B liquidation marketplaces including for nine of the top 10 retailers among dozens of other recognizable brands and manufacturers. Over the last 10 years we’ve seen a 96% compound annual growth rate in GMV (the sales proceeds of all merchandise sold across our network of marketplaces). The higher pricing our clients achieve drops straight to the bottom line. Less than half of retailers are currently incorporating technology-based solutions for the reverse flow of merchandise, but as return rates rise, it will be essential for survival. This will include leveraging technology to tackle the last mile of the reverse supply chain – liquidation.” Is blockchain a partial solution? Coincidentally, while I was catching up recently with Stephanie So on a telephone call, we talked about potential applications of blockchain technology and digital tokens to this problem. She’d been thinking about it as well. So is co-founder and chief development officer at GEEQ, a multi-blockchain platform secured by a proprietary proof-of-honesty protocol. As So pointed out to me, one of the issues at play in returns is that there’s information asymmetry between all the parties involved. Even worse, there’s moral hazard and the free rider problem at play too when fraud is involved – think of shoppers who buy clothes to wear to a fancy party, with the intention to return those clothes after the party. A simple digital token could be created that monitors usage of various types of merchandise to ensure that a merchant using the platform knows the state of the product before fully processing a return. I am simplifying our conversation greatly, and there are issues of privacy to consider, but you can see how this might work for electronics, footwear and certain types of apparel. Given the growth rates reported by Rosenberg, it is inevitable that merchants will start turning more and more to technology for solutions to the problem of fraudulent returns. In that instance a solution such as the one being conceptualized by So and the team at GEEQ could offer some promising approaches to solving this growing problem.

From new computing models to new ways to connect vendors with clients, technology is making the global supply chain steadily more efficient and cost-effective. Below is a look at just six of the Industry 4.0 technologies at work in freight handling today, and how they’re making the field both more productive and more competitive. In 2020 many of the last holdouts in the freight industries make their peace with cloud computing and software-as-a-service (SaaS) models. Some decision-makers over the years have felt some trepidation over sacrificing “ownership” over their primary technologies in favor of subscription-based cloud products. By now, however, the many benefits are well-known. Cloud-based software services for logistics ensure operators always have the latest security patches and features.   It also frees these companies to devote more of their in-house resources to their daily functions and growing their business, rather than building IT projects and updating software. Cloud-based SaaS toolkits also provide interoperability – an important consideration in supply chain with many participants and technologies. Bringing automation into a manufacturing plant or freight distribution center doesn’t have to displace humans entirely. Human workers may be displaced from highly repetitive jobs, but in the best cases, workplaces don’t have to shed employees even as they invest in automation technologies. Thanks in part to this realization, automation will continue to be extremely consequential across the freight industry in 2020 and beyond. Picking and stowing freight are great examples of tasks that emerging robotics technologies are very well-suited to carry out. Robotic inspection stations are another. The coming years will see humans gravitate toward cerebral, strategy-minded positions and programming jobs, and away from the tedium of many positions that now exist in freight handling. It may take until beyond 2020, but the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) already has its sights set on this milestone.   The 300-member-strong Alliance represents freight transportation companies all over the world, meaning it has plenty of interest in tapping blockchain’s potential. Among other things, blockchain’s immutable and distributed ledger will eliminate a considerable amount of the administrative busywork, as well as potential fraud, involved in getting freight from point A to B. TradeLens provides a look at what a newer, sleeker and more secure global freight network could look like if it’s built on blockchain. Companies that have already committed to TradeLens include the largest names in maritime cargo, representing some 60% of the industry. Just as Uber and Lyft proved that the taxi of the future is an app, freight brokerages and forwarding services are proving that logistics can be an app, too.   Companies like Flexport, Hub Group and Uber Technologies have turned Chicago and other cities into hotspots for logistics innovation and are looking to expand their reach further. According to one of Flexport’s senior directors, Chicago is now “one of the great logistics hubs” on the continent. But logistics looks a little different today, and it’s thanks to FreightTech. Uber isn’t a taxi company – it’s a technology company. And Flexport and Uber Freight aren’t freight companies per se – they are high-tech brokers. Their digital platforms connect those who need freight services, like forwarding or splitting shipments, with available vendors in the area that have the means and the space to get the job done. The sharing economy provides new business models in other industries, and it’s doing the same in freight and logistics. Companies that outsource logistics using these platforms or other tools tend to enjoy lower costs for transportation as well as faster and more efficient freight handling. These services deliver the added benefit of consolidating many disparate shipments, too, which is good for the emissions footprint of the industry. The only thing better than reacting quickly to customer orders is reacting proactively to customer orders. Many of the freight technologies written about in this article lend themselves well to the idea of serving customers from distributed inventories and strategically placed fulfillment centers. This isn’t anything new. However, what’s new is that predictive analytics tools are more accessible than ever to smaller and mid-sized freight and warehousing companies that rely on them.   In 2020, they will continue to add value to distributed inventory models by using data from a variety of sources, like real-time demand and historical trends, to help plan where in the country or world key merchandise is staged and which freight companies receive shipments. Among other things, this is how pharmaceutical companies keep allergy medicines in stock around the world. In short, predictive analytics help the entire supply chain stay ready to respond to any and all developments – both current and future ones. According to Deloitte, freight providers in every industry – be they air, truck or rail – have an almost unique ability to capitalize on the Internet of Things (IoT) and its “widely distributed networks.” There are almost too many applications to name, but here are a few: ·The Industrial Internet of Things gives every partner and process in freight and the larger supply chain the means to gather data on the work it is doing, and its condition, and improve itself over time. And the IoT, together with the other FreightTech named here, is turning the entire industry into an even more well-oiled machine. From labor-saving automation to technologies that speed up order fulfillment and keep an eye on freight in transit, technology continues to prove itself an ally.

Not! XPO shares flourish a year after thrashing","INTRO":"Short-seller\u0027s bearish call has backfired so far","DETAILED_CONTENT":"On Dec. 13, 2018, short-selling firm Spruce Point Capital Management LLC took XPO Logistics, Inc. (NYSE:XPO) to the woodshed in one of the harshest attacks ever directed at a publicly traded transportation and logistics company. XPO, Spruce Point wrote in a 69-page report, relies on asset sales, external financing and factoring receivables just to survive. XPO’s $6.1 billion in capital deployment since 2011, funds that went to 17 acquisitions in four years, had generated just $73 million in cumulative adjusted free cash flow, results that reflected a “failed business strategy,” according to Spruce Point. What’s more, XPO Chairman and CEO Brad Jacobs had surrounded himself with a “web” of longtime associates who had been convicted of illegal acts in the past, the report charged. Should credit conditions tighten and the cost of capital escalate, Spruce Point warned, XPO could collapse in “Enron-style” fashion, a reference to the high-flying energy trader that dissolved in 2001 amid massive accounting fraud that led to prison time for three top executives. XPO shares — which had already fallen about 50% from nosebleed levels of $116 a share in September 2018 — promptly cratered on the report’s release. Shares plumbed an intra-day low of $41.05, down $17 a share from the prior-day’s close, before closing at $44.50. It was the worst one-day performance in the company’s then nearly eight-year history. The counterattack was swift, aimed mostly at Ben Axler, New York-based Spruce Point’s founder and chief investment officer. Analysts slammed the report as misleading and based on erroneous data. Deutsche Bank’s Amit Mehrotra, arguably the most bullish analyst on XPO, went so far as to publish a special research note extracting numerous passages from the report and then disputing them one by one. Mehrotra said the sharp sell-off in XPO shares would create one of the most compelling buying opportunities in recent memory.   His comments have proved prescient, at least up until now. XPO shares closed Friday at $83.31 a share, more than doubling the intra-day low of last Dec. 13. Since that fateful day, shares would never close below $46 a share. Investors who initiated long positions a year ago or added to existing positions at the time have made substantial profits. XPO also reaped the rewards after authorizing a $1 billion share buyback the day after the report was published and a second $1.5 billion buyback two months later. Through June 30, XPO, which declined to comment for this story, has bought back 34.5 million shares for $1.9 billion, at an average price of $53.42 a share. It did not make any share repurchases in the third quarter. It is unclear if or when Axler, who did not respond to requests for comment, covered Spruce Point’s short position, or if the company still holds all or part of it. Yet if comments on Twitter earlier this year are any indication, he is unrepentant. In August, noting that XPO had reported a string of disappointing quarterly results, he tweeted that it was “time for real change in management and at the Board level.” Axler followed that up in September, tweeting: “Tip to public companies that think a hasty buyback is an adequate way to combat an activist short seller instead of directly addressing the issues: it generally doesn’t work.” Axler also apparently takes a dim view of the analysts covering XPO, saying in the December report that their brokers had been “recruited” by the company, and that none of them conducted a “forensic look into XPO’s earnings quality, or revealed its board and management’s connections to convicted felons.” It can be argued that Axler’s comments played a role in changing the course of XPO’s strategy. Earlier this year, Jacobs revealed that XPO was close to pulling the trigger on an acquisition that would have doubled the size of the $17 billion company. However, the sharp drop in XPO shares made a buyback a more cost-effective use of the company’s capital, he said. XPO, which had not made an acquisition since it acquired Con-way in September 2015, was widely expected to make one or two acquisitions by the end of 2018. It did not make any last year or this year.   Like all short sellers, Spruce Point wins some and loses some. However, short selling in general has been a challenge in a 10-plus-year bull market. In late September, Lou Whiteman, a journalist who writes for the financial website The Motley Fool, posted a list of 12 active short positions held by Spruce Point. Of those, nine had shown gains ostensibly since Spruce Point established short positions in each, based on Whiteman’s data. According to Whiteman’s Twitter feed, Spruce Point blocked him from emailing the company through its website. One notable Spruce Point short position in transport has been freight broker Echo Global Logistics (NASDAQ:ECHO). Spruce Point has actually shorted Echo shares twice: The first time was on Sept. 9, 2016, at $24.79 a share. Echo shares declined to $13.85 a share by July 2017, just above Spruce Point’s $13-a-share target and making the firm a tidy profit. Spruce Point re-established a short position in Echo on Dec. 21, 2017, with shares trading at about $28.55 share. Echo shares climbed as high as $35.60 a share in September 2018 before starting a 15-month descent which has left it at $19.43 a share as of Dec. 13. It is unclear what position, if any, Spruce Point still holds in Echo. In the letter that disclosed the second short position, Axler reiterated the points that prompted the first action, namely that Echo was plagued by poor management, a failed roll-up strategy and poor positioning in an increasingly techno-centric freight environment. The “astounding” 117% rally in its share price from five months prior was due mostly to the tightening of spot market pricing in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Axler wrote. Echo’s lousy fundamentals would eventually re-assert themselves, he predicted.   J. Bruce Chan, who covers Echo and other brokers for investment firm Stifel, said Echo’s recent problems are due to weak macro conditions and a difficult environment for brokers, not to structural issues with the company. “I think the pressure on the brokerage stocks is overdone here,” Chan said Dec. 13. “While we see limited demand growth next year, it should be a tighter supply market, and that tightening should happen more gradually than what we saw in 2017,” when supply contracted in the wake of the implementation of the electronic logging device (ELD) mandate. Chan also took issue with the notion that Echo is being marginalized by the move to digitization. “Our thesis is and has been that a few winners emerge from the (digital freight matching) set, and that they begin to look much more like incumbent leaders,” he said. “This is not a ‘winner-take-all’ situation in our view. The sandbox is getting bigger, and everyone has an opportunity to benefit from more efficient operations.”","TAGS":"Echo Global Logistics, Spruce Point Capital Management, XPO, XPO Logistics, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Mark Solomon","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Finance, Less than Truckload (LTL), Logistics, News, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-12-13T17:31:07-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/suku-dreamview-studios-partnership-brings-transparency-to-virtual-world-across-industries","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SUKU_launches_1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"SUKU, DreamView Studios partnership brings transparency to virtual world across industries","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"On Dec 10, industry agnostic supply chain ecosystem SUKU announced a partnership with DreamView Studios. The platform, enabled by blockchain, and media ecosystem produces photo-real and AR CGI assets for eCommerce clientele. This partnership will enable virtual product representation in the ecosystem of SUKU from production of goods to consumption by end customers. Coupling SUKU’s digital traceability with DreamView Studios’ CGI production and media management makes for a first-of-its-kind partnership. Powered by blockchain, the production of transparent products with virtual capabilities will display a variety of touchpoints along the entire product journey, which will enable accessibility to a wider range of industries and marketplaces. According to a press release, there has been significant growth in the demand for supply chain transparency in recent years. The demand has widely impacted the entire industry, including suppliers, manufacturers, shippers and even the end consumer.   According to Yonathan Lapchik, CEO of SUKU, the partnership was created with a goal to bridge the gap between conscious consumers and brands. “By offering more transparency in our customers’ supply chain,” Lapchik said, “we have seen mutual benefit — for suppliers, manufacturers, retailers and customers — in advancing brand loyalty, trust and customer satisfaction.” Lapchik predicts the partnership will lead the way for supply chain transparency by offering visual representation powered by blockchain. “We see this partnership having an impact far beyond commodities and retailers, and look forward to expanding our collective offers to customers of all sizes and industries,” Lapchik added. Combining SUKU and DreamView Studios allows stakeholders to visualize their products in many steps along the product journey regardless of supply chain volume. Further, it enables new virtual experiences by providing engaging opportunities for both brands and consumers through the virtual journey.   For example, online furniture retailers can provide virtual representation, along with physical and digital traceability of furniture pieces, and allow customers to engage with the brand and product throughout the process from purchase to final ownership. “We are tremendously excited to partner with SUKU in creating the world’s first integrated physical and virtual product ecosystem,” said Euan Macdonald, co-founder and CEO of DreamView Studios. “As the eCommerce marketplace as evolved, consumers’ tastes have become more selective, requiring more media products to inform buying decisions, and the creation of photorealistic CGI products are fast becoming a marketplace fixture.” The SUKU platform leverages two blockchains — Ethereum and Quorum. According to the release, SUKU is designed to be “industry-agnostic,” from farming to pharmaceuticals to electrical goods to household consumer products. Leveraging the two platforms streamlines numerous critical processes that slow down any supply chain.   SUKU’s streamlined blockchain integration empowers more socially responsible and traceable practices between trading partners by building transparency and auditability. This largely benefits smart contract deployments or critically confidential transactions.","TAGS":"AR CGI, Blockchain, demand for supply chain, DreamView, Dreamview Studios, end consumer, media ecosystem, photo-real AR CGI, physical and digital traceability, product journey, SUKU, suppliers, virtual capabilities, virtual product representation, Virtual reality, virtual world, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-12-12T08:35:05-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/commentary-food-supply-chains-providing-greater-transparency","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/French_retailer_Carrefour_2.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Commentary: Food supply chains providing greater transparency","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"New demands for transparency and ethical sourcing are shaking up the food supply chain. For the first time since the packaged food revolution, consumers are now learning more about where their food comes from and how it gets to them. And for a large swath of the public it is raising some questions. Consumers now living in a world of constant content and accessible information are pushing for a change. In a recent poll conducted by consulting firm AlixPartners of consumers in Europe, China and the U.S., around 60% of all shoppers place a heavy emphasis on the source of the ingredients of their food. Data about food sourcing and transport that was once inaccessible to the average consumer is now much easier to find. And it is also easier for environmental and human rights advocacy groups to leverage against the biggest players in the food business. JBS, a Brazilian company that is the world’s largest provider of red meat, lost some of its key contracts earlier this year after the discovery of its forced labor practices. These included workers living in inhumane and degrading conditions without shelter, toilets or drinking water. Unfortunately, the situation is not particularly rare. Within the past quarter-decade more than 13,000 modern-day slaves have been liberated from the proverbial plantations of Brazil’s red-meat magnates.   But food production companies now face consequences for not addressing these issues in their supply chains. Inappropriate supply chain practices are resulting in costly litigation from governments that are stepping up their vigilance against humanitarian crises. Moreover, negative publicity is impacting hard-won market share. Palm oil is the world’s most widely produced plant-based oil. The high demand has threatened rainforests, especially in Malaysia and Indonesia, where 90% of the world’s palm oil is produced. Some experts estimate that an area as large as 300 football fields of rainforest is destroyed every hour, creating a devastating chain reaction with potentially disastrous consequences for the future of these nations’ economic sustainability. It is precisely because of problems like this that Mondelez, General Mills, Kellogg Co., Unilever and Nestle have begun to list the companies that produce the palm oil that they buy. “When empowered individuals have the ability to search and learn more information, we were forced to up our game and to understand the complexity and intricacies of supply chain in a way we hadn’t before,” said John Church, chief supply-chain officer at General Mills. Wilmar International, Asia’s leading agribusiness firm, learned this first-hand when allegations about worker treatment in Africa and Southeast Asia came to light. Satellite photos revealed the company had illegally deforested large swaths of Sumatran jungle. It was later discovered that Wilmar used forced child labor and exposed workers to dangerous pesticides.   Wilmar customers still include Colgate-Palmolive, Kellogg’s, Nestlé and Procter \u0026 Gamble, none of which are eager to be associated with what has been called “the biggest and dirtiest palm oil trader in the world” by environmental advocacy groups. There is intense pressure for Wilmar to reform, with strict deadlines to meet and protocols to follow. “We wanted to stop this kind of negative perception of the food industry, Nestlé, everybody, that this is a black box that nobody understands,” Benjamin Ware, global head of responsible sourcing at Nestlé, told The Wall Street Journal.","TAGS":"beef, Blockchain, Distributed Ledger Technology, ethical supply chains, food logistics, food safety, food supply chain, Palm oil, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Asia-Pacific, Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Business, Economics, Europe, Global Supply Chain, International, News, Sustainability, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-12-08T11:00:57-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/us-citizen-charged-with-assisting-north-korea-on-blockchain","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/U.S._citizen_charged_1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"US citizen charged with assisting North Korea on blockchain","INTRO":"A U.S. man living in Singapore illegally presented technical information at the Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference in April on how North Korea can use blockchain technology to evade sanctions.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The Justice Department said a 36-year-old U.S. citizen was charged in a Manhattan federal court Dec. 2 with illegally providing technical information to North Korea on how to use cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to evade sanctions. Authorities took Virgil Griffith into custody at Los Angeles International Airport on Nov. 28, according to the Justice Department. “Despite receiving warnings not to go, Griffith allegedly traveled to one of the United States’ foremost adversaries, North Korea, where he taught his audience how to use blockchain technology to evade sanctions,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers in a statement. “By this complaint, we begin the process of seeking justice for such conduct.” “We cannot allow anyone to evade sanctions, because the consequences of North Korea obtaining funding, technology, and information to further its desire to build nuclear weapons put the world at risk,” added FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. “It’s even more egregious that a U.S. citizen allegedly chose to aid our adversary.”   In April 2019, Griffith, who lived in Singapore, traveled to North Korea to present at the first Pyongyang Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Conference, despite the fact the State Department had denied him permission to travel to the country. He also failed to obtain permission from the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control to provide goods, services or technology to North Korea. After the conference, Griffith began making plans to exchange cryptocurrency between North and South Korea, despite knowing that facilitating this type of exchange violates U.S. sanctions against North Korea, the Justice Department said. In addition, Griffith intended to renounce his U.S. citizenship and started researching how to purchase citizenship from other countries.   If Griffith is found guilty of violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, he faces a maximum of 20 years in jail, according to the Justice Department. The U.S. government and the U.N. Security Council have expressed concern that North Korea could use blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to hide funding for its nuclear weapons program.

This delivery is the first livestock to head to Algeria from Ireland after a new veterinary protocol was agreed upon recently by the Irish and Algerian departments of agriculture. The last cattle delivery from Ireland to Algeria before this consignment happened in the 1980s. Every year, Algeria imports roughly 150,000 cattle, making it a highly lucrative market for Irish rearers if they continue to deliver high quality and healthy livestock to the north African nation. The Wicklow Calf Company exported the Angus bulls in association with Bord Bia, the Irish food board, which was in touch with the customers and facilitated the logistics required to safely transport the cattle from the farm to the Algerian port. But going beyond the trade dynamics between countries with regard to cattle exports, it is also essential to make sure the authenticity of the breed in a transaction. Take the case of the black Angus bull consignment that was sent to Algeria from Ireland. The Angus breed is highly sought after for well-marbled beef, leading it to be heavily counterfeited.   The U.S. is the largest consumer of beef in the world, having consumed 60.9 million metric tonnes of beef in 2018. The black Angus variant is a consumer favourite as can be seen with the number of businesses that claim to rear these cattle. Of the 86 U.S. Department of Agriculture-certified companies that total 25% of all the beef produced in the country, 63 of them have Angus on their list. Counterfeiting and mislabeled products start right from the colour of the Angus cattle in question. The Angus breed comes in two primary colours – black and red, with the former being the one that draws the most interest, leading to black Angus cattle selling for a much higher cost in the market than its red counterpart. Though clamour for black Angus beef is well documented, cattle growers and beef stakeholders mostly agree that the taste of meat from both the black and red variants taste the same. This makes it easy for slaughterhouses and beef businesses to wilfully interchange variants, as the cost of the red Angus is slightly lower than the black Angus. Cattle growers have also found that the black Angus bulls are more reactive to heat than their red counterparts, as their black hide absorbs heat better than the red one. During the hot summer months, black Angus bulls tend to graze less and rest under the shade a lot more than the red Angus bulls. This shows up on the weighing scale, as red Angus bulls from the same farm as the black ones tend to be a bit heavier – giving greater dividends to stakeholders who can rear, buy, and sell the red Angus by mislabeling them as a black variant.   All this leads black Angus beef to be at the epicenter of counterfeiting, pushed forward by small- and mid-tier rearing farms and beef stakeholders that wish to exploit the system. Introducing the technology of blockchain can help bring more order into the black Angus supply chain, as blockchain will force every stakeholder in the value chain to push data onto an immutable ledger – from the farm to the supermarket shelves. Being decentralized, blockchain provides all the stakeholders with equal control over the network, making it impossible for any single party to edit or mislabel products without the explicit approval of every stakeholder in the system. Apart from restricting the entry of counterfeit products, it also helps with trust, because consumers can scan QR codes to understand their product’s provenance.   As consumer traits and expectations keep evolving and as supply chains increasingly go global, it is critical to provide transparency and visibility into logistics operations. Apart from infusing trust into the system, such technology can help stakeholders shed inefficiencies and move towards precision logistics – thus benefiting the landscape in its entirety.","TAGS":"Algeria, Angus bull, black Angus, Blockchain, blockchain logistics, blockchain supply chain, Europe, Ireland, red Angus, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Europe, International, Logistics, New Tech, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-11-26T05:28:11-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/loadsure-joins-blockchain-in-transport-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BiTA_Loadsure.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Loadsure joins Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The latest company to join the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) is Loadsure, a London-based company that is an international InsurTech Managing General Agent (MGA) with a focus on the freight spot market. Loadsure’s U.S. affiliate is located in Denver, Colorado. Blockchain technology enables companies to identify and track transactions digitally and share this information across a distributed network of computers. Blockchain allows transportation and logistics companies to operate in an increasingly seamless and transparent manner. It also enables participants to more effectively track goods and freight across the supply chain. Moreover, blockchain can also help to create new revenue streams and value for customers by enabling the completion of transactions and managing fleets. The concept of Loadsure was developed several years ago by its founder and CEO, Johnny McCord. His extensive background as a Lloyd’s cargo broker helped him to quickly realize that the process to buy and sell policies must be automated. Traditionally slow, manual and costly, automation significantly decreased the time involved, cutting cost and labor-intensive processes. Concurrently, the U.S. transportation industry, especially the spot freight market, was becoming increasingly digitalized. Existing offerings began to innovate and new offerings came to market, launching high tech electronic platforms and ecosystems to meet the demands of the industry.   The rapid changes in both the insurance and transportation markets, as well as greater acceptance of innovation and technology, led to the introduction of Loadsure. “BiTA’s vision to drive the standardization and adoption of blockchain technologies aligns perfectly with Loadsure’s vision to advance the way transportation is insured, by providing a fully digital and simple-to-use product that features well-established and emerging technologies,” McCord said. “Loadsure’s membership in BiTA will lead to collaboration with others in the industry, creating effective blockchain standards for the transportation and logistics industry,” according to McCord. He explained, “Loadsure plans to incorporate blockchain technologies into its solution. This will enable smart contracts to handle Loadsure policies, and utilize the immutable information incorporated in logistics-centric blockchain technologies to improve rating modeling, claims handling and payments.” BiTA President Patrick Duffy said, “On behalf of the members of BiTA, I welcome Loadsure to the Alliance. Blockchain is transforming the supply chain through greater transparency, innovation and efficiency. Members like Loadsure are one of the keys to BiTA’s success, because the collective knowledge, insight and experience of Alliance members will help enable the best uses of blockchain in the transportation industry.”   About Loadsure Loadsure’s fully digital end-to-end insurance solution uses cutting-edge, cloud-based technology. It provides the spot freight community with a full-service insurtech solution that seamlessly integrates with load boards, marketplaces and transportation management systems, complementing that platform’s customer journey. The user no longer needs to go outside of the platform of their choice to obtain insurance, and no longer needs to take the risk of not having insurance because the time or resources weren’t available to take the traditional route of acquiring such coverage. Insurance can now be added with one click of a button. Loadsure uses real-time data analytics and AI to provide real-time rating that is realistic and low cost, consistent with its digital approach. The company’s platform handles every step of the process – from onboarding and risk assessment to policy management, payments, digital claims handling, sales and support.   About BiTA Founded in August 2017, BiTA has become the largest commercial blockchain alliance in the world, with nearly 300 members. BiTA members are primarily from the freight, transportation, logistics and affiliated industries. Alliance members share a common mission to develop a standards framework, educate the market on blockchain applications/solutions and distributed ledger technology, and encourage the use of those applications.","TAGS":"BiTA, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Distributed Ledger Technology, Insurance and Risk Management, Loadsure, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, New Tech, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-11-25T12:00:15-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/todays-pickup-fema-report-suggests-blockchain-for-disaster-insurance-claims","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fema_1122.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Today’s Pickup: FEMA report suggests blockchain for disaster, insurance claims","INTRO":"Federal Emergency Management Agency’s advisory board recommends a pilot of the blockchain-based registry to ultimately improve claim processes and disaster responses.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Good day, The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) should pilot the use of blockchain technology to speed up the payouts of disaster assistance or insurance claims, an advisory board said in a report. FEMA’s National Advisory Council recommendation appeared in a draft report released on Nov. 18. The report suggested the creation of a pilot blockchain-based registry that could contain vital information such as property ownership records and policy documents, which otherwise could be lost in disasters.” “By piloting a blockchain-based registry in this manner, FEMA can catalyze cross-sector engagement and develop technology-enabled use cases that can improve the speed of disaster responses and insurance claim payments, without sacrificing accuracy or increasing the risk of fraud.”   While the proposed blockchain pilot wouldn’t have a direct implication on FEMA’s disaster logistics and its partners in the transportation industry, it could pave for their adoption down the road.

IBM is the first company onboarding suppliers through the system, and it’s saving a tremendous amount of time and money in the supplier onboarding process. “This network will onboard tens of thousands of suppliers very rapidly because of the types of companies that have committed to use it,” Rosen said.   Headquartered in Morrisville, North Carolina, Chainyard is a consulting and implementation provider that has built over 24 blockchain projects and has four networks currently in production — one of which thousands of users rely on for financial transactions. Chainyard has been in blockchain production for four years, using both Hyperledger and Ethereum. It has 65 employees working on blockchain.  Chainyard’s blockchain solution responds to a common pain point among logistics providers: qualifying hundreds of carriers by validating documentation while managing risk and regulations is a convoluted and inefficient process. Onboarding and updating data is also inefficient when multiple parties are using different databases to manage the same data. Chainyard built a trusted source of supplier information and digital identity (DID). The DID allows for persistent identities, meaning they don’t change over time; they’re cryptographically verifiable, decentralized and universally dissolvable.   “What we implement on TYS is self-sovereign identity (SSI) but for organizations,” said Mohan Venkataraman, Chainyard’s chief technology officer. “SSI is a mechanism by which the organization, individual or item holds the identity and can share and manage. TYS is seen as a digital passport for suppliers.” Chainyard put together a network not just for suppliers and buyers, but for other parties like verifiers and insurers. While the supplier holds the DID, the insurer issues credentials to the supplier. The verifier validates those credentials, and the buyer is then able to trust the supplier. The credentials could be a university degree, a business license or insurance issued. “TYS is all about qualifying the supplier and business partner by answering questionnaires on various topics, whether its diversity, environmental compliance or financial compliance,” Venkataraman said. “It also stores verifications from third parties, whether it’s verifying that the DMV number or address is correct.”    Building a blockchain network, Rosen said, is the biggest upfront challenge, but once the system begins to scale, the challenges become more technical. What’s imperative is making sure each player in the ecosystem — shippers, recipients, consignees, payers, brokers, carriers and logistics providers — finds value in the network. “How TYS works is, we classify business objects into two zones: off-chain and blockchain,” Venkataraman said. The off-chain zone is where they maintain data that’s necessary to keep but is not revealed on the blockchain. This data consists of member credentials data, personally identifiable data and application-specific data. On the other side, blockchain data consists of publicly shared supplier data visible to all parties. Privately shared supplier data will be visible to two parties that have a contractual relationship. Public securely shared data can be selectively shared publicly.   “This looks like a regular application,” Rosen said. “If you’re using the application, you would not think that it’s blockchain. Under the covers, however, there’s a body of these companies that are working together to govern the dataset.”","TAGS":"Blockchain in transport alliance, Chainyard, Digital Identity, IBM blockchain, self-sovereign identity, suppliers, Trust Your Supplier, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Corrie White","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-11-20T14:45:37-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/five-ways-digitization-and-ecommerce-changed-freight-shipping","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Ecommerce-delivery-shutterstock.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Five ways digitization and ecommerce changed freight shipping","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Digitization is an ongoing process that’s proving consequential in nearly every industry. This is certainly true of freight shipping, where digitization, along with online shopping, global marketplaces and new productivity technologies, have had a lasting impact. Logistics, cargo handling, last-mile fulfillment, customs and compliance and many other aspects of this business are responding to these and other influences. Here’s how. According to Statista, the global retail ecommerce market – the B2C market – could be worth more than $6.5 billion by 2023. Additional findings say the B2B market is six times this size. The sheer volume of products is a major change and challenge for the freight shipping industry. It’s fair to state that ecommerce has had a direct impact on the amount of freight being transported. According to freight industry research:   It’s not news that the ability to buy and sell things online creates online shoppers. What’s more interesting is how the ubiquity of ecommerce has fed into the other technologies and trends on this list, including the call for better trust mechanisms, global demand, eco-friendliness and the construction of an Industrial Internet of Things for freight carriers. Ecommerce doesn’t just compound the problem of volume. It also raises the bar for turnaround times and lowers the bar for price expectations. The freight industry must answer in kind. The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) represents more than 300 members of the global transportation business community that see blockchain as the foundation to a new kind of freight industry. As a BiTA spokesperson explained, “Over the next five years, we envision the massive adoption of several digital technologies, including blockchain, that will provide for the nearly seamless transportation of goods from origin to destination.” TradeLens is one blockchain initiative that already has impressive cargo and freight industry buy-in. Five of the biggest cargo lines, representing 60% of global maritime cargo capacity, have signed on already. This type of trading system will lower costs and offer a much shorter value chain thanks to blockchain’s common distributed ledger technology.   The issue isn’t that blockchain will disrupt freight carriers, forwarders and third-party logistics companies – it already is disrupting them. Smaller companies need to know what’s on the horizon and which technologies stand the greatest chance of disrupting their business models and workflows. One of the biggest freight carriers, Maersk, has signaled that it intends to go carbon-neutral by the year 2050 – a pledge made with the knowledge that oceangoing freight represents 90% of global trading, and so has an outsized environmental and climate change impact. Transparency is one of the major pressures of a global, commerce-focused marketplace. When customers have a choice, they increasingly choose products or services from the greener of two companies if both offer similar products and services. That goes for choosing freight services as much as it does any other product. Freight carriers and other companies play an enormous role in the overall sustainability of a supply chain, and a global marketplace means they can’t hide outdated practices anymore.   As the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) notes, companies should use the technologies at their disposal, like sensors and enterprise analytics platforms, to engage in “measuring, benchmarking and assessing freight transportation activities and strategically making better choices that reduce emission[s].” One place to begin is the EPA’s greenhouse gas emissions calculator, which helps companies quantify the kind of environmental impact they have. From there, making a difference means knowing which technologies may provide a credible solution, including the Internet of Things. As Deloitte notes, companies that deal with cargo and freight transported by rail, ground, sea or air have a unique opportunity to take advantage of “widely distributed networks” to gather information rapidly about freight processes and react to emerging conditions. The IoT provides data mobility down to individual assets and items in the freight carrier supply chain. For instance, consider the problem of keeping foods, beverages and medications at fixed temperatures. Shippers and freight forwarders that use sensors in climate-controlled vehicles or facilities can tell in an instant if a product is no longer in compliance. Smart refrigeration systems can even adjust the temperature automatically. Sensors improve the detail in paper trails and chain of custody documents in other ways too. Fragile products, including delicate parts and carefully calibrated equipment, often require especially close inspections on arrival. Shippers have to make the right packaging decisions to begin with, but having sensor data available from the journey helps manage risk and makes any questions about fault easier to answer should the need arise.   Trucks and other vehicles are extensions of the industrial IoT in freight too. Electronic data loggers for trucks help eliminate unnecessary idling, identify more expedient routes and deliver data in close to real-time about vehicle and operator performance. Route optimization software may even incorporate weather and traffic data to provide new suggestions in real-time. Automation is one of the most important digital breakthroughs in the cargo and freight handling industry. Here are just three reasons why: The shift to just-in-time business processes, not to mention pipe dreams of “anticipatory shipping,” means the freight industry is under constant pressure to modernize and streamline all that it does. The ecommerce explosion is both an opportunity and a major headache for companies in this space – and exciting new technologies are helping them weather the changes.","TAGS":"B2C, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Digitization, ecommerce, logistics, logistics visibility, Supply chain, Supply chain digitalization, Supply chain disruption, supply chain logistics, supply chain visibility, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Kayla Matthews","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Digital Supply Chains, Global Supply Chain, Insights, Logistics, New Tech, News, Technology, Warehouse, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-11-19T10:00:58-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain-decentralization-proves-difficult-in-oil-and-gas-industry","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BiTA-CHI-Block2-6.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain decentralization proves difficult in oil and gas industry","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ondiflo, a Houston-based startup, was founded by Jean-Pierre Foehn and Rana Basu at the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) Symposium in 2017. The software service they built on the Ethereum blockchain addresses inefficiencies across three verticals of the oil and gas industry: upstream, midstream and downstream. Their goal was to understand how obfuscation works in multiparty transactions, as well as how to deliver on their promise to make automation “legally enforceable” using blockchain. Their strategy has been to streamline ticketing-based services — beginning with the first service order to the final payment. Instead of relying on paper invoices, the proof is in the blockchain, which also helps companies avoid risk dispute. Two years later at the BiTA Symposium in Chicago last week, Basu, Ondiflo’s chief operating officer, shared not only the company’s successes but also its struggles. “I’m a definite believer in blockchain, but we’ve found that production is indeed very different, and we haven’t been able to decentralize,” Basu said.   Ondiflo’s first project went live April 1 and ended July 31. BPX Energy and three trucking companies — Select Energy Services, C\u0026J Energy Services and Common Disposal ⁠— began using Ondiflo’s platform to track their water-hauling process. With a six-week deployment time before going live, the platform connected 50 facilities and hauled 11,100 truck rotations.  “We had to rewrite code for each company just to get them on board,” said Basu. “We used geotagging, geofencing and bread crumbs. All of these provide operational controls and legal certainty.” Ondiflo focused on the proof of value (PoV) model and acquired a large data set organized by location, timing, quantity and quality. This includes service request time, tank levels, acknowledgement of jobs accepted, time-stamped tank levels for start and end of filling and time when crossing a geofence.   In the oil field, everyone is worried about spills. With Ondiflo’s system, if a driver notices a spill and takes a picture, the blockchain will see the time stamp of when the driver crossed the geofence and took the picture. This feature exonerates the driver from suspicion that he or she caused the spill. Also, while electronic logging devices (ELDs) have provided great insight for dispatchers into the position of the truck, the direction the truck is moving, toward or away from the job, has remained a mystery. Ondiflo’s app has provided dispatchers this function. All parties can view how the software connected and automated devices, drivers and dispatchers. The app tracked the time it took the person in each role to complete a task and deciphered whether this role could be partially or fully automated. Invoice approval, for instance, took 26 days to approve before the blockchain app helped eliminate several of the steps. Potential cost savings also became evident ⁠— “11 cents a barrel,” Basu reported.    Because the app allowed trucking companies to see 48 hours out, they were able to optimize their shifts. This was best seen over the Easter weekend, when many drivers wanted time off, and the trucking companies were able to keep business running with 25% fewer drivers each shift. Due to the addition of automatic approvals, yard managers or accounts payable clerks weren’t necessary. Basu said Ondiflo’s “biggest success” was that 65 drivers used the app and they only trained seven. Drivers could train each other to use the app without really understanding or caring about the underlying technology. Next week at least 100 more drivers will be added to the app in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. Blockchain is about connecting participants on either side, but what that equates to is “trading visibility to get transparency.” While automation comes from this transparency, automation itself does not create savings, said Basu. “One of my biggest concerns is that if my competitor and I are on the same platform, can my competitor gain intelligence about my operations? If I put A and B on the blockchain, my competition will be able to see A and B,” he said.   Basu reflected on various difficulties, ranging from the implementing standards for back-office systems to the threat of natural disasters like Hurricane Harvey. After they finished testing the platform in Houston, they took it into production and “everything fell apart,” Basu said. Blockchain is a recording mechanism, so it was relatively easy to write code for it, but dentralizing it was another issue. “If someone starts sending bad data, understanding whether the problem lies with the device or the code becomes tricky. Devices nowadays are working fine and then they suddenly go nuts. They could be leaving cellular or Wi-Fi coverage or the batteries could die,” Basu said. He said the aptitude of these human variables needs to be researched more fully in order to know if the smart contract can legally enforce itself or if a manual process will have to be used. Because of these and other human factors, the growth of the app’s automation stalled. “By the end of week six, we had crossed 90% automation. At the end of week 13 when we brought this pilot down, we had reached 91%,” Basu said. He granted that as a small startup, Ondiflo needs BiTA’s help to establish standards.   “We are waiting on you all to participate and provide the staff to work on these standards to bring down the costs of adoption and to make this move faster,” he said.","TAGS":"Blockchain in transport alliance, blockchain standards, oil and gas industry, Ondiflo, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Corrie White","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-11-19T09:30:35-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain-can-help-end-child-labor-in-cosmetics-supply-chains","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/shutterstock_610097531.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain can help end child labor in cosmetics supply chains","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The cosmetics market is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world, with it being valued at $532 billion last year and projected to grow rapidly – buoyed by social media influencers and targeted marketing. But what is ironic is the fact that sustaining the world of glitz and sparkle ultimately boils down to lackluster supply chains, which power the market by sourcing ingredients for cosmetics businesses to continue addressing market demand. Like all global supply chains, cosmetics logistics contends with its fair share of complexities, which flare up due to the lack of transparency and visibility into operations of all the stakeholders within the value chain. Of the several raw materials being shipped around the world to cosmetics manufacturing plants, mica is proving to be a staple commodity, with most of the cosmetic brands using the mineral to add the much-needed “glean” to their products. However, it is only when the discussion moves to the sourcing of mica that it starts becoming a concern. Most of the biggest brands in the business – like L’Oreal and Estee Lauder – source their mica from India, which is one of the largest producers of mica worldwide. In India, mica production is concentrated in the states of Bihar and Jharkhand and account for roughly 25% of the global mica production. The problem with sourcing mica from these states is the rampant existence of forced child labor, in a population base that is part of the poorest demographic within India. About 35% of the population of Bihar and Jharkhand live on less than $0.50 per day, forcing low-income families to send their children to the mines rather than to schools. The Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA), an organization fighting against child labor, estimates that around 10 to 20 kids die in collapsed mica tunnels every month in this region.   A report from the non-governmental organizations Terre des Hommes and SOMO estimates that about 20,000 children work in the mica mines. It is also estimated that 90% of mines are illegally run businesses without licenses from the central government. The illegally mined mica is then pushed into the supply chains of big corporates, often without them realizing where their mica is sourced from. And it is here that the technology of blockchain can be of use, as it can help foster accountability into mica mining – something that cosmetics brands have been desperately trying for a decade, but with limited success. Being a decentralized network, blockchain throws open the supply chain for all the stakeholders to gain visibility into operations. And since its ledger is immutable, this prevents stakeholders from passing off mica mined by children as legal mica. To make this work, it is vital to have all the stakeholders within the mica supply chain to be part of the blockchain network, allowing every party to be privy to the sourcing and handling of mica across every node within the supply chain. Companies cannot push in illegally sourced mica into the value chain, as that would need the express approval of all the parties within the blockchain network. Cleaning up mica supply chains also helps cosmetics brands to band together and look at providing reasonable pay to the miners, who suffer from exploitation by intermediaries that pay them extremely low wages. Consumers of these fashion accessories will also have a way to ascertain their brand’s sourcing sustainability, as with a blockchain-based supply chain, consumers will be able to access provenance information on their cosmetics to verify its authenticity as exploitation-free products.

Here are five changes you should expect for ERP software for 2020, and how they’ll likely affect the supply chain. When the Supply Chain Management Review published its 2019 Warehouse and Distribution Center (DC) Operations Survey, labor scarcity was a persistent challenge for those professionals. However, many are dealing with the consequences by using technology to keep costs down. The research showed that 85% of respondents used warehouse management systems (WMS). Moreover, ERP systems and legacy or homegrown options were the most popular WMS choices cited. This year’s survey showed more people bringing automation to their processes, too, with 23% mentioning that compared to 15% last year. Then, 45% recognized that improving information technology in their warehouses was important for managing costs. In 2020, as supply chain professionals continue to look for ways to reduce costs and compensate for an insufficient labor force, many will investigate whether 2020 is the right time to connect complementing technologies to their ERP systems.   Supply chain businesses have a variety of reasons for implementing ERP software. The desire to improve business performance is one of the top drivers, and others set their sights firmly on growth, frequently understanding that a company that performs well is typically in a good position for growth. ERP systems also help companies integrate multiple systems, and many end up selecting an ERP provider because they want to replace legacy systems. But, as we move into 2020, expect more supply chain businesses to see a link between using ERP systems and keeping their customers satisfied. In the case of one manufacturer of hydraulic jacks, the company discovered that installing a new ERP system after previously relying on business accounting software streamlined both the creation and distribution of products. Those advantages made it easier to meet customers’ needs. More specifically, the company fulfilled 30% more orders with the same resources after implementing the ERP tool. The company previously used paperwork to track orders and admitted that sometimes orders were misplaced, which caused delays. Supply chain professionals will keep using ERP software for many of the other reasons listed above and others not mentioned. However, you should anticipate they’ll increasingly understand why using an ERP makes it substantially easier to have happy repeat customers.   People earning their MBA degrees with an interest in supply chain management often choose Operations Management specializations during their educations. Besides that concentration preparing them for a fulfilling career, it could also introduce them to some of the emerging technologies more frequently associated with ERP software. This could make them conclude they made the right decision to get into the industry now. One of them is artificial intelligence (AI). Although AI is excellent for removing some of the manual, time-consuming tasks that humans do concerning managing their relationships with customers or achieving their sales goals, AI also applies to supply chain professionals due to its inventory management capabilities. Applying AI to ERP means lower costs and higher revenue, particularly because it helps tackle problems with over- or under-production. Additionally, AI can offer predictions that help a supply chain manager make more accurate assessments when determining if the company can or should scale up the business to accept a big client or take on a lucrative project.   AI is already starting to integrate into some ERP platforms. In 2020, however, more vendors may begin offering it, especially if substantial numbers of their clients from supply chain companies expect and demand it. 2020 will also likely include an increase in companies using Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and ensuring the respective data gets factored into the information shown in an ERP interface. Some supply chain leaders put IoT equipment on their trucks. This approach allows for tracking the vehicles in real-time and predicting the demand for sales. Having that information on hand allows supply chain professionals to make smarter and more informed decisions about how to run their businesses. They’ll also be able to avoid issues, such as if an IoT sensor warns that a component of a crucial piece of equipment is faulty and will break down if it doesn’t get serviced soon. Even though many people know about blockchain technology because of cryptocurrency, its already proved useful in the supply chain sector. For example, blockchain provides a higher level of transparency that can improve ethical sourcing in the supply chain, cut down on fraud and more. Some well-known ERP vendors, including Oracle and SAP, are working hard to incorporate blockchain into their ERP offerings. Look for more of the same in the coming months, particularly as other prominent brands from inside and outside the supply chain sector continue realizing blockchain’s potential.   The five trends listed here are likely candidates for developments that will change the supply chain management landscape, specifically by impacting ERP software. They aren’t the only ones you should look for but be sure to prioritize keeping a close eye on these to see how things evolve.","TAGS":"Artificial intelligence, Blockchain, blockchain supply chain, Distributed Ledger Technology, enterprise resource planning, ERP, ERP software, internet of things, Supply chain digitalization, supply chain visibility, Supply chains, warehouse management systems, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Kayla Matthews","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, New Tech, News, Technology, Warehouse, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-11-15T13:00:58-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/what-blockchain-means-for-lawyers-e-commerce-merchants-and-financial-services","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/BiTA-CHI-Block2-2.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"What blockchain means for lawyers, e-commerce merchants and financial services","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Executives gathered at the BiTA Symposium Chicago to share the opportunities and bottlenecks of blockchain, as well as provide perspectives on smart contracts, supply chain visibility, and maintaining Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) standards. “The first smart contract happened in 1989,” said Ron Leibman of McCarter \u0026 English, a full-service law firm headquartered in Newark, New Jersey. “If you use Paypal and Venmo, those are smart contracts, because you agree to terms and there’s automatic processing.” Leibman joined the stage with Houman Shadab, the co-founder of Clause, and Shane Orians, the managing counsel at Meijer. Clause is a software company that makes commercial contracts to utilize real-time data, and Meijer is a grocer with 250 supercenters across the Midwest. “Law firms are spending lots of money on artificial intelligence,” Leibman continued. “They’re trying to eliminate the need for junior lawyers doing rote work. In 20 years, none of your companies are going to pay for that. Sizable firms will be focusing on higher level issues like indemnities. That is the way the industry is going.”   Clause creates smart contracts using blockchain partnered with Docusign, and they can be used by companies to reduce errors in transactions as well as overhead. While Clause can’t automate every part of the contract, it can automate the objectively verifiable aspects like penalties.  “Contracts are not just a tool for attorneys, but can help manage the company. Contracts provide governance between the party and the company. It helps reduce the friction of onboarding,” said Shadab. However, Orians said that at Meijer the company is still using paper contracts that he calls “dumb smart contracts.” He said Meijer is embracing automation with contracts to decrease legal involvement. In fact, he said of the thousands of contracts that go through, a lawyer only touches 4%. Because the workload at Meijer increases with scale and it’s not hiring more full-time employees, that percentage needs to be maintained or decrease.   “Automation may not be a threat to lawyers; it might be a threat to young lawyers,” Orians said. It’s not just automation and blockchain, however, that revolutionizes the supply chain, said Stephen J. Rogers, vice president of blockchain initiatives for supply chain at IBM. It’s also the hybrid cloud, which ensures that the right infrastructure and data are in the right place, and also artificial intelligence. While IBM has four blockchains to join – TradeLens, IBM Food Trust, Trust Your Supplier and IBM transaction intelligence, Rogers said that companies can also build their own. If they do, however, he said make sure your approach to the problem you’re trying to solve has a value proposition that’s beneficial to everyone in the supply chain.    “Once you have the platform, there are tremendous opportunities to innovate,” said Rogers. “Building a network is as much work as developing the solution. People only appreciate that when they finish their first blockchain project. Always keep the pilot and production phases in mind when you’re working on your first project. It’s not easy to bring others into the network.” Yuval Rooz, co-founder and CEO of Digital Asset, a financial services company, was asked in 2015 to help Australia put its entire stock market and its security on a blockchain. So they created DAML, an open source smart contract language that is platform-agnostic and designed for distributed apps. The mission of Digital Asset, said Rooz, is “to help our clients and BiTA members get to market first, and stay there longer.” Rooz reiterated the importance of trust – in the technology and the team. After realizing the complexity of the task, Rooz decided to remove the cryptography from the 23 developers, so when they wrote code on DAML, they only focused on the business direction. They never missed a deadline and are going into production phase next year. DAML can be horizontally scaled and has been tested on U.S. equity markets? with much success.   Another blockchain development company, web3devs, uses BiTA standards and EOS blockchain to solve the real-world problems of an e-commerce merchant. Brian Wentzloff and James Ruffer started developing Pollinate at the 2018 Hackathon in San Francisco when the merchant said it wanted to break into new markets by using gig-economy methodologies and stay competitive with same- or next-day delivery. With the app they created using WordPress, blockchain increased visibility for all parties, even for the gig-worker carriers who have a companion app that guides them through delivery with interactive maps. BiTA standards are used for track and trace when a package changes hands. Smart contracts are used with payment processing, and the app has cut this merchant’s traditional budget by 39%.","TAGS":"Artificial intelligence, BiTA Symposium Chicago, Blockchain in transport alliance, Clause, digital assets, hybrid cloud, McCarter \u0026 English, Meijer, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Corrie White","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-11-15T12:00:25-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/ups-ships-u-s-beef-to-japan-traces-movement-via-blockchain","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fresh-meat-112781.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"UPS ships U.S. beef to Japan, traces movement via blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"There have been a steady stream of blockchain-based pilot projects within the supply chain landscape. Today, UPS announced a collaboration with agri-tech solutions provider HerdX of the successful delivery of a blockchain-verified beef shipment from a U.S. farm to Japan. UPS heralded this to be a significant step forward in quality assurance and traceability in the beef industry, which incidentally was also the first time HerdX shipped beef on the back of a blockchain network. The excessive fragmentation of the logistics market in terms of the volume of stakeholders has led to opacity within the market, as businesses work in silos and continue to have blindspots all across the supply chain, severely affecting their operational efficiency. To an industry that is distressed with a perpetual lack of visibility and transparency, blockchain may be an antidote. Blockchain is a decentralized ledger that effectively makes every stakeholder within the network equally responsible as custodians of the data that flows within it. The data in the blockchain network is immutable and can only be edited with the explicit approval of all the stakeholders within the ecosystem. The logistics industry was quick to begin blockchain pilots, understanding fully well that blockchain had the wherewithal to get all the stakeholders within a particular supply chain to toe the line, while ushering never-before-seen levels of transparency and visibility into shipment movement.   “Blockchain verification for international air freight shipments is complex and requires a great amount of expertise in customs and freight forwarding. Getting it right has implications for many industries, such as restaurants, food \u0026 beverage, and retail,” said Romaine Seguin, the president of UPS Global Freight Forwarding. “We’re committed to upholding HerdX’s industry-leading quality assurance and traceability standards for all customers eyeing international growth moving forward.” The beef shipment originated from a Kansas farm, and it was put in a UPS temperature-sensitive air freight container that contained sensors that monitored and recorded the shipment’s temperature throughout its journey to Japan. The data derived from the sensors were fed in real-time to HerdX’s blockchain verification platform. After the beef shipment landed in Japan, it was transported to a contemporary steakhouse where invited guests were given a menu that featured beef dishes with QR codes. Going forward, upon scanning the codes, diners will be able to gather information on the shipment’s journey from the farm to the fork, which essentially helps them verify the quality of the beef being served. “It’s an exciting time to be entering the Japanese market with a much-needed, innovative solution to a pervasive industry issue,” said Seguin. “We hope our relationship with HerdX will catalyze an expansion of service offerings for our international shipping customers.”   To expedite the use of blockchain in the supply chain industry, it is vital to create data standards that help businesses to easily develop pilots without burning a lot of cash in the process. Standardization also helps immensely with interoperability, which will be crucial for different blockchain networks to interact seamlessly in the future. The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) is looking to achieve standardization, having published its inaugural set of royalty-free blockchain data standards earlier this year. These standards can be leveraged by any company looking to create a blockchain platform within the logistics space. BiTA is the largest consortium of its kind in the world, with nearly 500 members spread across 25 countries and collectively generating over $1 trillion in annual revenue.

Indeed, while the shipping industry has changed dramatically in recent years, the market for ocean freight services remains exposed to the inherently dynamic nature of demand and fixed nature of supply that results in oscillating vessel load factors and freight rate volatility. This fundamental supply and demand mismatch causes significant structural inefficiency that adversely impacts all market participants. Freight rate volatility remains high. Phantom bookings often amount to 20 to 25% of a vessel’s total loadings. Technology providers have been addressing the lack of efficiency in quoting and booking processes by creating faster and more transparent execution. But should we now expect electronic platforms to meet the spot shippers’ needs for secure freight capacity and predictable rates and service levels and the carriers’ need for high load factor predictable revenue and opportunities to differentiate their services? The structural mismatch between supply and demand in ocean freight exacerbates the distortion on the spot market even outside the usual peak seasons. The situation is complex. Ocean carriers’ vessel procurement and network planning activities aim to bring long-term stability to the trade’s service patterns, based on which efficient supply chains can be planned. Once vessels are deployed, however, the ocean carriers’ only option to adjust supply to meet changes in demand is difficult and often suboptimal: adjusting a vessel’s port time or port rotation, blanking a sailing or, in the extreme event, laying up ships to take out a complete string. Shippers’ demand patterns display huge, short-term variations throughout any given year and regular seasonality plays an ever-smaller role in the overall variability. External factors such as political instability, exchange rate fluctuations, changing trade policies and weather cause further swings in demand. The monthly demand on the Asia-West Coast North America trade fluctuated by, on average, a standard deviation of about 10% over the past four years. During the same time, the monthly supply on the Asia-West Coast North America trade only fluctuated by, on average, a standard deviation of 3.9%, according to Drewry. The vicious cycle is here to stay. When volatile demand meets static liner services, vessel load factors oscillate. Monthly load factors on the Asia-West Coast North America trade fluctuated by, on average, a standard deviation of 8.6% over the past four years. In parallel, weekly spot rates on the Asia-West Coast North America trade fluctuated by, on average, a standard deviation of 25.5% during the same period. Such price variation is because ocean carriers often drop freight rates close to the marginal cost of moving containers in order to cover their high fixed costs. In these circumstances the spot freight market deprives shipping lines of sustainable profits and leaves their customers unable to get reliable pricing and service levels. To make it worse, spot rate volatility and short-term capacity management contribute to unreliable booking practices. Going to the spot market may not always be the preferred choice for shippers. Rates often are valid only for one week or for one month and most of the shipping lines have difficulty confirming bookings at a known rate six weeks or longer ahead of vessel calls. Only larger shippers can negotiate annual contracts with the shipping lines and most of them still will have quarterly BAF clauses. Eventually, there are limited choices between yearly contract and the uncertain spot market, especially for small and midsize shippers that then rely on large freight forwarders and their buying power to try and secure space for their cargo. The practices of double booking from shippers or forwarders and overbooking from carriers aim to achieve the same goal of securing shipment. It ends up being costly for both parties. It generates a downfall up to 25% for carriers and rollovers estimated by Drewry at 3 to 4% of total worldwide shipments. Furthermore, at the operational commercial level, freight rate volatility poses challenges to shipping lines: The multiplication of quotes also multiplies the number of manual errors. Drewry’s 2018 Shippers Survey found that 66% of shippers are not satisfied with their shipping line’s billing accuracy. This is particularly experienced as rates change every week, at times even more than once, which makes selling ocean services with any sort of stable price tag impossible and causes huge amounts of administration for the forwarders to make sure their buying cost data is kept up to date and their selling margins remain intact. The spot market seems to be locked in a damaging circle in which all participants, whether carriers, forwarders or BCOs, are juggling among inefficiencies and uncertainty that eventually work at their expenses. Carriers are seeking alternatives. Against the spot market inefficiencies, new forward selling and instant booking services are coming on the market through digital solutions. This year has seen the development of Maersk Spot, Hapag-Lloyd Quick Quote, CMA CGM SeaPriority and Hamburg Sud Instant. These are new carrier online services granting a binding quote and instant booking. For most of them, these digital offers are enforced by bilateral compensation and penalty schemes in case the booking does not materialize as committed. Previously a few prominent startups tried to change spot market practices. 300Cubits ushered booking penalties using a blockchain solution. Its difficulty in growing has been more related to the acceptance of blockchain than the actual concept of guarantee that key carriers accepted to test from Day One. NYSHEX continuously has expanded its guaranteed rate-booking services for the last four years. This demonstrates the growing appetite for forward contract as an alternative to the unreliable spot market and its costly traps. Shippers and forwarders may see these new binding quote and booking offerings as limited in terms of available trades and cargo types. However, they are clearly targeting the shippers putting service quality first. Contradicting the common view that only price matters to shippers, Hapag-Lloyd experts have estimated that the “value seeker” shipper segment accounts for only 40 to 45% of the market. It also has planned that online quote should represent 15% of its shipments in the next three to four years. The bigger picture raises the opportunity for forwarders to operate digitally in a cost-effective way to secure midterm space and rate with carriers through bilateral digitally signed commitments and advanced bookings. Forwarders and carriers will find advantages in trading capacity electronically, using standard binding transactional services operated by neutral and trusted platforms. The recent research conducted by Drewry and the maritime supply chain technology provider CyberLogitec shows that trading a large part of the spot market using technology-enabled forward contracts and advance bookings will benefit both customers and providers of container shipping. (Source: Drewry September white paper “Technology to reduce freight rate volatility and capacity risks”). This will dynamically curb freight volatility and reduce capacity risk. However, to achieve the efficiency promise, reach adoption and automation, comprehensive technology solutions must be more than just a “bulletin board” of prices with an email facility sent to the provider once the booking has been made. They will have to swiftly orchestrate and synchronize the purchase or sale of capacity, the procurement and the booking at the slot-shipment unit level. Part of the exercise may require the standard itemization of sea-freight “products” on offer and demand. This drives the players to agree on rate and booking terminology, standard data model and business rules applied to guaranteed space allocation, equipment and service levels. The active cooperation of forwarders and carriers toward electronic forward contract and advance booking is fundamental in any attempt to reduce the spot market inefficiencies. Driving efficiency through a comprehensive vision on forward contract and advance booking. On a larger scale, multiple pain points could be addressed through the capability to flexibly buy or sell ocean freight services in advance, using neutral, global and comprehensive platforms. Volume commitments and capacity guarantees would provide an early visualization of demand in the market, thereby reducing the supply-demand mismatch and rate volatility. Besides, these improved practices also would address related inefficiencies, ranging from disconnected quotes and bookings to documentation and invoice errors. Will the carriers and forwarders take on this challenge?

Though not too different from the supply chains across other segments in the context of complexity or opacity of operations, the fashion industry has frequently contended with issues like labor inequality and proliferation of counterfeit items, especially with regard to established brands in the ecosystem. For instance, take the case of the global apparel market that accounts for $1.3 trillion in retail sales annually. Much of this industry in the developed nations is sustained by exports, with products usually being manufactured across China and countries in the Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia. Several reports have pointed fingers at the unethical practices followed by fashion brands, in which they extract work from impoverished workers for wages of less than $1 an hour, while selling the finished products at a considerable premium across outlets in the West. Though consumers are increasingly becoming wary of pay inequality and are forcing brands to be accountable, there are not many effective ways to ensure businesses do not continue exploiting their vulnerable workforce. Blockchain can help solve this predicament, as it can throw fashion supply chains open to all relevant stakeholders within its network, letting them gather information on essential parameters concerning operations, while having a window-seat view to the manufacturing, packing and distribution of products.   Being a decentralized and immutable ledger, blockchain circumvents the issue of power centralization, which has traditionally weighed down supply chains and led to intermediary stakeholders awaiting instructions from the central command. Decentralization helps, as it allows every member to access and monitor records. With the records also being immutable, blockchain essentially makes editing or replacing of records impossible for any single entity. Immutability works out well within fashion supply chains, paralyzing bad actors from injecting counterfeit products into the value chain. Fake goods are a debilitating problem within the fashion industry, as about $450 billion worth of fashion-related products were identified to be counterfeit last year. With the visibility that blockchain ushers into the landscape, stakeholders can now have more trust in the system and can help reduce excessive red tape at nodal points – leading to significantly improved customer satisfaction. Several companies are already taking an interest in improving the situation by developing blockchain platforms and end-consumer applications to induce visibility in the industry that has long been considered operationally opaque. For instance, New Balance, the sports footwear company, has introduced a blockchain application that allows users to verify the provenance of all the shoes in its inventory. Blockchain can also be extremely effective in solving waste in the fashion industry. The industry grapples with excessive waste, not just during the manufacturing phase, but also due to the obsessiveness of businesses to hold on to their lofty brand image. Brands routinely destroy unsold but completely well-made fashion products by the end of the season, citing the need to keep the brand desirable amongst its target audience.   With the greater visibility brought about by blockchain, consumers can understand the amount of waste within the fashion industry and can question the conscience of brands, which can possibly claw back on the waste. Reducing waste not only makes the brands more sustainable, but redirecting unsold items to the secondary market could also help trickle-down fashion to other sections of the society.","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain logistics, Blockchain logitics, blockchain supply chain, blockchain technology, fashion supply chain, logistics technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, New Tech, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-11-04T10:30:16-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/jim-handoush-believed-he-was-destined-for-apple-but-blockchain-has-ignited-his-passion","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DexFreights_new_CEO_1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Jim Handoush believed he was destined for Apple, but blockchain has ignited his passion","INTRO":"New dexFreight CEO explains why the cutting-edge technology will change freight","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When Jim Handoush was growing up in Silicon Valley, he envisioned one day working for the growing startup down the street. A job at Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) never materialized for Handoush, but technology turned out to be his calling, even if it meant heading into logistics rather than computers. “I always thought watching the tech industry develop and evolve that that was where I’d end up,” Handoush, the recently named president \u0026 CEO of dexFreight told FreightWaves. Handoush explained that his father, who was in the supermarket business, told his young son that if he got a “job in the food business, you would always have a job, because people have to eat.” “It’s the same thing in freight,” he said. A professor in college turned Handoush on to the industry, helping him secure an interview with Consolidated FreightWays, whose headquarters were based in Palo Alto, California. The company was just starting up a division that would ultimately become Con-way and Handoush took the job, eventually becoming the fifth employee at Con-way Transportation Services.   By 1996, he took a job on the East Coast as CFO at Landstar Logistics Group, eventually becoming president of that group before being promoted to co-chief operating officer of Landstar Systems (NASDAQ: LSTR). Along the way, he helped build up Landstar’s brokerage business and learned a lot about the inefficiencies in the trucking space during that time. Putting his love of technology to work, Handoush moved to Rising Sun Systems before joining Optym in early 2017. While at Optym, he co-founded Axele by Optym, a transportation optimization system for carriers. “During that time I ended up meeting the dexFreight team,” Handoush explained. “As I got to learn more about dexFreight, it led me into blockchain and smart contracts, which is the foundation of our solution. I thought it was a way to bring together the industry.” dexFreight is a blockchain-based logistics platform that aims to handle everything from booking to payment. It was named one of FreightWaves’ FreightTech 100 companies in both 2018 and 2019. The FreightTech 100 recognizes the most innovative and disruptive companies in freight. The company is a member of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA).   Handoush said he is excited about the opportunity dexFreight has before it. “There’s so much room to bring in other solutions such as optimization, for [participants] to collaborate together, and improve what is going on,” he said. “From a blockchain and smart contract standpoint, when you have that kind of information being consolidated from the shipper and carrier, that information is of higher quality.” dexFreight recently completed a pilot project with cooperation from Centrifuge and the Maker Foundation using a decentralized finance (DeFi) blockchain. The project turned freight invoices into collateral to allow the carrier to be paid within minutes of making the delivery.   In the pilot, a third-party logistics (3PL) provider agreed to pay on 45-day terms for the invoice, but the carrier opted to finance the invoices using dexFreight ‘dexFi’ feature. Once the carrier pressed the dexFi button on the dexFreight platform, it took less than a minute for it to receive the funds at less than a 1% borrowing rate with little or no paperwork involved, dexFreight said. It is an example of the type of change Handoush believes is possible through deployment of blockchain. “Most of us come out of logistics so we know there is so much more that can be done for the industry in general, and that’s what drives us each day, it’s these new technologies [that can change industries],” he said. Handoush likened blockchain to the development of the Interstate Highway System that completely altered the way people and goods moved across the United States. “The more research I did, the more I understood that what we are creating here is a digital highway,” he said. “This is a digital structure that allows everybody to move commerce… and as that became clearer and clearer to me, I started to understand how massive the impact could be. I saw dexFreight as being cutting edge, and its vision tied into the vision I had of cutting waste and improving efficiencies.”   Right now, dexFreight is onboarding two early adopters to its platform and expects to announce a larger participant in the coming weeks that will “really stretch the system,” Handoush said. “Like any beta, you go through pain points as you test the system, and you get feedback and make changes to it.” Handoush replaces co-founder Rajat Rajbhandari as CEO and president. Rajbhandari, who holds a Ph.D in transportation, remains with the company, moving into the chief information officer role. He continues to focus his efforts on the optimization and data marketplace sides of the business. “This group of founders doesn’t have any egos,” Handoush said. “They have a plan; they are not about titles and roles; they are about making this platform as successful as possible. To me, at this stage of my career, it’s very important to work around people that you feel great about and that you enjoy working with.” Naturally, Handoush sees great things for both blockchain and dexFreight and believes that as more use cases roll out, blockchain will move beyond the hype stage and into reality. “It’s not every day you get to be on the front edge of something like this,” he said.

During each of those events we have tried to figure out what it will take for blockchain, or some other distributed ledger technology, to become widely applied in a real world industrial supply chain. Naturally, an unspoken question during these discussions is “Which industry will be the first to find an application for which a blockchain-based solution is the best of all the alternatives available?” On Monday, October 14, the Nikkei Asian Review reported that five automakers will begin field tests in the United States next month to test blockchain-based identification systems that enable drivers to pay various types of fees without using cash or credit cards. The size and scope of the global automotive manufacturing industry According to IBISWorld, as of April 2019, the global car and automobile manufacturing industry was trending towards:   The exhibit below shows market share based on 2018 revenue. To get a sense of how complex automotive supply chains are – Toyota vehicles are sold in 170 countries and regions. Those sales to customers are enabled by a network of 51 manufacturing partners in 28 countries and regions. The exhibit below shows the number of cars sold.    According to World Vehicle Population Rose 4.6% in 2016, by Sarah Petit at Wards Intelligence, “The global vehicle population stood at 1.32 billion cars and trucks at the end of 2016, nearly double the volume 20 years prior when vehicles-in-operation totaled 670 million in 1996. Coincidently, the fleet grew at about the same pace in the 20 years through 1996 by roughly doubling 1976’s 342 million.” The exhibit below shows the number of vehicles in operation by region, between 2010 and 2016.    What is the potential impact of blockchain in automotive supply chains? In Blockchain’s profound impact on the automotive industry, EY states that blockchains and other distributed ledger technologies will enable: The article is based on EY’s Tesseract blockchain technology platform, which is built for original equipment manufacturers in the automotive industry. What are the reported field trials going to be testing? According to the Nikkei Asian Review, the trials will test a new vehicle identification system. This system is linked to ownership information, as well as other information such as compliance with service requirements. This system will also be used to identify vehicles on highways, enabling transactions such as toll payments without the need for external devices such as EZ-Pass tags in parts of the United States.   These trials are the outcome of work that is being done by the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI), “a nonprofit global foundation formed to accelerate the adoption of and to promote standards in blockchain, distributed ledgers, and related technologies for the benefit of the smart cities and mobility industries, consumers and communities.” In a press release published on July 7, 2019, MOBI said of its vehicle identification standard (VID): “In order to establish existence, this first standard focuses on the “birth” of the vehicle as a minimum representation of that vehicle’s creation. Subsequent VID phases will add additional product definition, ownership history and a log of key events in the vehicle’s lifecycle. The result will be a trusted and immutable master record of the vehicle’s history and data usage.” Digging beneath the surface: What is a cyber-physical system? The VID forms the basis for the creation of digital twins of vehicles in which the technology is deployed. A digital twin is a digital or virtual replica of any entity, that enables information about the replicated entity to bridge the physical world and the virtual world – forming a cyber-physical system (CPS), or a cyber-physical network. According to the Ptolemy Project at the University of California Berkeley; “Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation, networking and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa.” A digital twin must be connected to its corresponding physical counterpart. This connection between physical counterparts and their corresponding digital twins is made possible through the industrial internet of things, pervasive computing and simulation, enabling digital twins to be updated frequently to reflect the real-time condition of their physical counterparts in space and time based on data collected from the physical system. The feedback loops allow inferences about the physical entity’s current and future operational states to be reached without the need to interact directly or interfere directly with the physical processes unless that is necessary in order to prevent a breakdown or some other interruption of service.   We are already surrounded by relatively simple and primitive cyber-physical systems. The promise of the future is that advances in information and computational technologies will make such systems much more advanced than in the past. Insights from the field Michael Zargham is a complex systems scientist and architect who has been a speaker at two events organized by The New York Supply Chain Meetup on how blockchains and other distributed computing technologies will transform physical supply chains. Michael holds a Ph.D. in electrical and systems engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. He is the CEO and founder of BlockScience, a consulting firm that works with companies in legacy industries on the conception, design and implementation of cyber-physical systems. He is also an advisor to a number of technology startups. I asked Zargham for some insights about the economic potential of cyber-physical systems. He said,   “CyberPhysical Systems are large-scale, coordinated systems enabled by advances in IoT, embedded control and decentralized optimization. As our physical systems become increasingly equipped with internet-connected sensors and decision-making systems, we’re seeing a trend towards intelligent infrastructure, e.g, smart grids and autonomous vehicles. Higher combinations of automated decisions systems require some level of trust between the entities sharing that infrastructure, especially when sensitive information or high value assets are being controlled. This is where distributed ledger technology brings great value. The cryptographic guarantees provided by secure multi-party computation can be used to govern access control rights to sensitive data, to automate multi-stakeholder business processes, and to enforce adherence to agreed-upon economic protocols. By bridging automated infrastructure with principles of market design, our intelligent infrastructure is becoming more integrated with our economy. Imagine a future where the digital twin of a truck not only identifies a need for preventative maintenance but can follow all the way through to confirming and paying for that work.” Conclusion According to Future Market Insights, the “global cyber-physical system market is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 8.7% during the period 2018-2028. The market was worth $55,075.3 million in 2017 and is likely to reach a valuation of $137,566.0 million by the end of 2028.” This growth is driven primarily by the rapidly decreasing cost of sensors, data storage, cloud computing and other related technologies. Recent advances in CPS have not eliminated the uncertainties and risks that could slow the development and adoption of CPS. In An Overview and Some Challenges in Cyber-Physical Systems, Kyoung-Dae Kim and P. R. Kumar group the issues in four broad categories. As with many blockchain and supply chain applications, the overarching challenge that CPS has to overcome is the ability to quantify how the costs of such systems compare to the short- and long-term benefits that customers and users will experience.","TAGS":"auto cybersecurity, automobile industry, Automobiles, automotive cybersecurity, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, blockchain logistics, blockchain standards, blockchain supply chain, blockchain technology, Distributed Ledger Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Aoaeh","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Business, Cybersecurity, Digital Supply Chains, Global Supply Chain, Insights, Logistics, New Tech, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-10-21T16:00:15-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain-for-fishing-scallops-to-help-reduce-food-fraud","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Seafood_supply_chain_1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain for fishing scallops to help reduce food fraud","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The IBM Food Trust platform signed a partnership with Raw Seafoods on October 17, bringing in blockchain-based traceability possibilities to the seafood supply chain that includes stakeholders like fisheries, distributors, retailers and restaurateurs. Of the different niche segments within supply chains, the seafood industry stands to gain a great deal from visibility into its product movement, as it remains one of the most counterfeited products within the food supply chain. Earlier this year, a study by ocean-protection foundation Oceana found that one in every five seafood products tested were mislabeled – making 20% of all seafood in the supply chain at any given moment fraudulent. Oceana’s sample set ranged over 400 samples collected from 250 locations in 24 states and the District of Columbia. The study found that mislabeling is an issue across the spectrum, right from the place where the fish is caught to the consumer-facing restaurants. Mislabeling is a rampant problem at the rear end of the supply chain, with Oceana finding 26% of restaurants and 24% of smaller markets selling mislabelled products, compared to the much-lower 12% of supermarkets that were found guilty of this practice. In this context, the IBM Food Trust’s association with Raw Seafoods will help digitalize the supply chain for scallops sourced from the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery. The IBM Food Trust is a platform that caters to global food supply chains, leveraging blockchain technology to provide visibility and foster accountability between key stakeholders through an immutable record of food system data.   The chain of data starts from the minute the scallop fleets bring the catch on deck, with the fleet captain scribing details of the scallops onto the blockchain platform. This helps the rest of the stakeholders in the supply chain to accurately identify the quality, nature and volume of scallops harvested. “The platform will also track when the boat landed portside, and when each scallop lot was hand graded, selected, packed and shipped to its final destination. This information, as well as images and video, is uploaded via satellite to a distributed ledger while still offshore. Once it is uploaded, this information is then available to permissioned parties, including distributors, suppliers, retailers, and their customers at point of sale,” said IBM in its statement. In the U.S., roughly 80% of all the country’s seafood is imported, which makes tracking a necessity to ascertain the quality of products finding its way to American consumers. IBM believes that providing people with a way to understand where their seafood is coming from would help prop up the consumer numbers, which currently is less than favorable. Though dietary guidelines recommend that people consume two servings of seafood every week, studies conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that about 80 to 90% of all U.S. consumers do not meet their seafood requirements. IBM points to the lack of trust among consumers and the widespread prevalence of food fraud and blatant mislabelling as primary factors for this low seafood patronage.   More specifically, having visibility into scallop fishing ultimately helps with creating sustainable fisheries – a necessity considering that the scallop population was nearly driven to a point where they could not replenish themselves due to overfishing. Keeping a tab on the volume of scallops fished annually will ensure the well-being of the fisheries, and also assist the Port of New Bedford, Massachusetts, in maintaining its position as the most valuable fishing port in the U.S. At the receiving end of the supply chain are the seafood retailers and restaurateurs – with Santa Monica Seafoods and TAPS Fish House \u0026 Brewery looking to sell and serve scallops sourced through the IBM Food Trust platform. “This data will help us forge a more direct and fruitful partnership with the captains and crew that are harvesting the seafood we serve,” said Tom Hope, director of food and beverage at TAPS Fish House \u0026 Brewery. “Not only will the data help us be more strategic as a business, we think customers are going to love it.”  ","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain technology, data benchmarking, IBM, IBM blockchain, IBM Food Trust, seafood, visibility, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, New Tech, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-10-21T10:10:24-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/global-container-terminals-joins-ibm-maersk-blockchain-group","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Global_Container_Terminals_1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Global Container Terminals joins IBM-Maersk blockchain group","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Global Container Terminals Inc.

TradeLens is an early stage platform, and we may join other platforms. But this is an important first step.” As for what GCT hopes to get out of TradeLens, Grosman said improved ability to timestamp events such as when a container exits the terminal and gets loaded on a train or truck is one area of focus for marine terminals. “Containers may sit at a terminal for 36 to 48 hours, so not a long time, but it’s an important time for beneficial cargo owners,” Grosman said. Mike White, the head of TradeLens, said, “Integrating data with ports, terminals, logistics providers, shippers, and carriers is essential for the vision of TradeLens to realize new ways of working within a collaborative industry ecosystem.”   He added, “GCT’s connection to TradeLens strengthens this new era of transparency and collaboration for the global supply chain.” Maersk subsidiary APM Terminals is also integrated with TradeLens. PSA International’s Singapore terminal and Chinese operator Modern Terminals are also participants in the TradeLens platform. TradeLens also encompasses more than half of the world’s container ship capacity thanks to the addition this year of CMA CGM, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), Hapag-Lloyd and ONE to the platform.

Although it initially gained recognition that way, the potential uses for blockchain span much further. More specifically, the technology could bring more trust to the supply chain, improving the reputations of companies that make merchandise available for sale. Reducing the instances of counterfeit goods Counterfeit merchandise collectively represents substantial losses for many industries. As a start, about 10% of all luxury goods sold each year are fakes, resulting in about $28 billion in lost profits. Plus, the consequences of non-authentic components can be especially severe for electronics manufacturers, particularly if they make products for the aviation or military industries.   One blockchain-based solution to combat these problems involves cryptographic “smart tags” that have unique identifiers to confirm the provenance and source of each part of a product. If all the parties in a supply chain have access to that information, they can rest assured of an item’s authenticity. Giving guaranteed uptime and high integrity Blockchain offers several characteristics that make it a secure method of storing information. For example, it’s a distributed network, so even if part of it goes down, that failure does not cause an entire network outage. Additionally, a blockchain’s ledger system is virtually immutable due to the verification process that each entry goes through before getting added to the blockchain. Since blockchain has security components built in, it’s easier for supply chain professionals to rest assured of consistent functionality when using it. In addition to the security-related benefits, blockchain provides data that supports better decision-making. In the apparel industry, for example, parties using blockchain can see real-time information about the top-selling items of clothing, enabling better demand forecasting.   The way that blockchain makes it difficult to tamper with information and how it’s unlikely to go down due to hacks makes this technology appealing for fulfilling the supply chain needs faced by various industries, regardless of the specific products they track. Improving the ability to trace consumable products Today’s consumers are increasingly concerned about where the things they eat and drink come from. Many prefer to purchase items that are sustainably sourced, organic, fair trade-certified or produced without genetically modified ingredients (GMOs).   IBM created a Food Trust blockchain that reportedly tracked millions of food products during a trial participated in by brands including Dole and Carrefour. Plus, the National Fisheries Institute is using the system to aid in verifying species information for seafood products. This ability to trace products also supports the brand reputations of companies that produce gourmet products. For example, statistics say that 59% of Americans drink gourmet coffee daily. Most willingly pay more for it, but they care about where the coffee comes from, the production process and how it tastes. Blockchain can provide that information for them, leading to more-confident purchases. Proving that companies don’t use conflict materials Similar to how people are paying more attention to the sources of the things they eat and drink, they also want proof that companies don’t use conflict materials. Those are substances that come from war zones and perpetuate the continued unrest in the region. Unfortunately, many high-tech materials, like those used to make electric car batteries, could potentially originate in conflict zones. Some companies are taking steps to show that their supply chains are conflict material-free. Volvo uses blockchain to make that promise by tracking recycled cobalt from China across two months.   Tracking minerals like cobalt using blockchain is not the only solution for eliminating a company’s dependence on conflict materials. But, it’s a step in the right direction because it helps a brand show a commitment to responsible sourcing. Applying IoT technology to blockchain for cold-chain transport Effective cold-chain transport ensures that perishable items such as frozen foods and refrigerated medications stay at the correct conditions from the time they leave their sources to when they reach their destinations. A report from MarketsAndMarkets shows that the cold chain monitoring market will have a combined annual growth rate of 11.17% from 2018-2023 due to factors like the demand for increased food quality and temperature-sensitive medicine. Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can track the conditions of temperature-controlled items in transit, verifying that the responsible parties don’t keep the goods in environments that could damage them. Bringing IoT sensor data to blockchain allows parties to quickly identify issues and resolve them before the merchandise remains in a dangerous temperature zone for too long. Parties that are excited to use blockchain for supply chain management must be aware that it may not be a magic fix – or at least not right away. That’s because whether companies use blockchain to check the process of temperature-sensitive items or other things, all the entities within the supply chain must be fully committed to using it. Moreover, they must implement steps to tackle irregularities in the stored information. Technology that’s worth a closer look   This overview shows that although blockchain technology is still in the early stages and not a solution that will instantly fix every problem that the supply chain faces, it’s already making significant positive changes. Companies and consumers alike want to feel comfortable about trusting the products they buy. The visibility that blockchain provides could help that happen.","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain as a service, Blockchain in transport alliance, blockchain logistics, blockchain standards, blockchain supply chain, blockchain technology, Blockchain transportation, Distributed Ledger Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Kayla Matthews","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Business, Digital Supply Chains, Global Supply Chain, Insights, Logistics, New Tech, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-10-16T12:00:20-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/commentary-wolfgang-lehmacher-a-profile-in-supply-chain-innovation-and-technology","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/4PLshutterstock.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Commentary: Wolfgang Lehmacher – a profile in supply chain, innovation and technology","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"I am very excited to bring FreightWaves readers a profile of Wolfgang Lehmacher. I have never met Wolfgang, but I discovered him while I was making the transition from a generalist early-stage venture capitalist (VC) at KEC Ventures, to becoming a VC specializing in early-stage tech startups in supply chain across various industries. I often refer to my copy of his 2017 book, The Global Supply Chain: How Technology and Circular Thinking Transform Our Future. He graciously agreed to connect with me in June 2017, when I sent him a note through LinkedIn. An article providing Wolfgang’s thoughts about Brexit and how it will reshape Europe’s logistics, ran on October 11 in American Shipper, FreightWaves sister publication. As you will see, he has an enthusiasm for supply chain, innovation and technology. One could even say he’s obsessively enthusiastic about supply chain, innovation and technology – which is my way of saying, I know he’s someone I’ll instantly like when we hopefully meet in real life one day. I hope you enjoy the interview as much as I have. If his name sounds a bit familiar, perhaps it is because you may have read: Explained: How and why Brexit will reshape Europe’s logistics landscape, published on FreightWaves on October 11. Brian: Let’s start with a bit of biographical background. Tell us a bit about yourself. How did you come to be working in the areas of supply chain and innovation?   Wolfgang: Sure. I was born in Bonn, the German capital at the time. Since then, I have lived in Paris, New York, Hong Kong and Geneva. It was a friend of mine who worked at Schenker that inspired me with his stories about global connectivity and the movement of goods. Hence, I joined Kuehne + Nagel and ASG, before I studied business administration. After my studies, I joined TNT, now a subsidiary of FedEx, where I headed among others, Switzerland and the Eastern European and Mediterranean regions. Then, I drove the global expansion of French La Poste for more than 10 years. Since then, I have been working as a strategy consultant, engaged with corporations and startups, and led the supply chain and transport industries group at the World Economic Forum (WEF). My mission is to promote the supply chain industry. I partner with companies to help them grow. I have published numerous books and papers, and over 100 articles. I have spoken at more than 100 events in more than 30 countries, including the Annual Meeting in Davos, the Boao Forum and at MIT. I am a judge of the IATA Air Cargo Innovation Awards and member of the Logistikweisen, a think tank under the patronage of the German Federal Ministry BMVI. Brian: I found you through your work for the WEF, as Head of Supply Chain and Transport Industries from 2014-2018. Please explain what you did at the WEF. Why does that work matter? Will that work continue now that you are no longer at WEF? Wolfgang: In 2014, I was responsible for finalizing the ‘Beyond Supply Chains’ report. The report identified 31 supply chain cases and showed that companies applying sustainable practices can increase brand value by 15 to 30%, revenue for responsible products by up to 20%, reduce carbon footprints by up to 22% and decrease supply chain costs by 9 to 16%.   In 2015, we delivered ‘Enabling Trade: Unlocking the Potential of Mexico and Vietnam.’ Working closely with the governments on jointly agreed sectors, we developed proposals to improve policies and increase competitiveness. One of the selected sectors was the medical devices industry. The study showed that by removing specific non-tariff barriers throughout the value chain, Mexico could generate up to $1.5 billion in economic growth per year. In the same year, we worked with the electronics industry community on the impact of the digital era. The study predicted that analytics services will become the new standard in logistics with the potential to save up to 10% of distribution costs and up to 30% of vehicle maintenance costs. In 2016, we worked on outlining the digital dimension of the Belt and Road Initiative. The study showed that making the new Silk Road ‘smart’ can boost a region’s GDP by 4 to 7%. We also facilitated an open communication to reboot trade for the Annual Meeting in Davos in 2018, signed by 10 supply chain CEOs, including Søren Skou, chief executive officer of A.P. Moller Maersk, and David Abney, chairman and chief executive officer of UPS. Today’s trade situation shows the importance of such initiatives. The work continues in the various teams.   Personally, I support the Forum as a member of the Expert Network. This year, I facilitated a concept note on new innovative models in production and contributed to several blockchain papers. Brian: That’s amazing. It dovetails with the studying I have done, which led me to conclude that innovation in supply chain is a source of sustainable competitive advantage for companies, and an economic multiplier for countries and economic regions of the world. Here’s a related question – what three or four technologies do you see that will most transform supply chains and transportation over the next decade or two? Why? Wolfgang: Key technologies in supply chain are robotics, robotic process automation, the internet of things and artificial intelligence. The technologies are all at different stages of maturity and come in bundles. According to a Gartner report, at least 50% of large global companies will be using artificial intelligence, advanced analytics and internet of things in supply chain operations by 2023. The automotive industry has been using robots in manufacturing for decades. In 2012, Amazon was the first to introduce robots in its warehouses and others have been following its lead. Last year, Mujin, a Tokyo-based startup, equipped a warehouse operated by Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com with 20 industrial robots that pick, transfer and pack packages using cameras, crates on conveyor belts, as well as Mujin robot controllers. Other robots cart merchandise around to loading docks and trucks. JD.com calls this 40,000-square meter facility in Shanghai the world’s first fully automated warehouse. Recently, robotic process automation has moved into the spotlight. It’s artificial intelligence that works with computer software to perform repetitive, detailed administrative tasks ranging from data cleansing to preparation of documents to digital interactions with customers. According to another Gartner report, 73% of corporate controllers will be using some form of robotic automation by 2020.   In search of end-to-end supply chain visibility, Maersk has equipped 300,000 reefer containers with internet of things devices and shipping line CMA CGM announced that it is ordering 50,000 devices to increase its offer of connected containers. The company that knows in advance what will be bought, when and where can streamline its supply chain. Artificial intelligence is the key to achieve this goal. Otto, a German e-commerce merchant, has created a system that analyses around three billion transactions and 200 variables, including sales data, website searches and weather information. With 90% accuracy, it can predict sales behavior in the next 30 days. Now, the company says it can purchase around 200,000 items a month without human intervention. Brian: Wow. We were fortunate to have JD Logistics participate in an Urban Distribution event sponsored by DHL, and organized and hosted by The New York Supply Chain Meetup in May. On another related note, at my prior fund, I sourced our investment in Ayehu Software Technologies in 2013 precisely because I believed that robotic process automation would become more critical for enterprises seeking ways to more effectively cope with various IT challenges. It’s heartwarming for me, personally, to see the increased focus and excitement around what seemed like an arcane and rather boring business at that time. You recently joined a think-tank that is part of Reefknot Investments. Tell us a bit about Reefknot Investments, and the role that the think-tank will play. Why did Temasek and Kuehne + Nagel decide to team up to launch a venture fund? Wolfgang: Singapore-based Reefknot Investments is a capital fund backed by Singapore investment firm Temasek and Swiss logistics group Kuehne + Nagel. Portfolio companies will leverage insights from Temasek, Kuehne + Nagel, and Reefknot’s partners, such as EDBI, SGInnovate, Vertex Ventures, Unilever Foundry, and NUS Enterprise, among others. Kuehne + Nagel is most interested in tech applications that can help solve real-world problems. The Reefknot think tank, called the Centre of Excellence for Global Emerging Supply Chain Technologies, aims to drive new business models and transformations in the supply chain and logistics industry. Some key themes we will focus on are disruptions that result from changing consumer behavior and the challenges resulting from climate change.   Besides contributing expert opinions through forums, panels and thought leadership papers, the think tank will work with start-ups, established companies and scholars to promote the sharing of knowledge. Brian: That is very exciting. So, it sounds to me that the Centre of Excellence for Global Emerging Supply Chain Technologies will serve as a bridge between people building tech innovations for supply chain and people who want to buy tech innovations for implementation in real-world commercial supply chains. That’s precisely why we started the The New York Supply Chain Meetup, and it’s the motivation behind our effort to grow into a global network of grassroots-driven communities focused on supply chain, innovation and technology. I love that. Based on your experience, what advice would you offer startup founders who are in the very early stages of attempting to develop new innovations to solve problems in supply chain and to bring those innovations to market? Wolfgang: It is critical is to focus on innovations that address real-world challenges, such as the lack of end-to-end visibility and the carbon footprint. Also, the seamless delivery of online orders is still not the standard. Everything that helps the industry to better understand the value of data is helpful too.   Solutions need to be scalable. Supply chains are global and require interoperability with many different systems and practices and need to comply with a broad range of laws and regulations. By nature, supply chains can’t be fully digital, and the physical layer needs to be considered. Startups need to be lean. But certain functions are critical. A founder and chief executive officer that is tied-up with raising capital doesn’t use time wisely. A professional fundraiser or an advisor that supports this activity is critical. Brian: I couldn’t agree more. You’re basically paraphrasing our rationale for building a specialist supply chain technology fund. Which brings me to my next question. My partner and I are in the early stages of building a venture fund, REFASHIOND Ventures, to invest in technology startups that are developing innovations to refashion industrial supply chains. What advice would you offer people like us? Wolfgang: Start with a thesis of the market. What are the key developments and how will they impact the supply chain? Then, select target areas based on potential and find use cases that eliminate specific pain points to map out the space. Scoring models will help you to narrow the search and a proper due diligence will guide you to the most promising players in the respective fields. Involve industry experts to confirm your assumptions and findings. They can also help to grow and scale the portfolio companies. Brian: I am chuckling because I know my partner and co-founder, Lisa, is silently pumping her fists. We’ve debated the use of scoring models in the past. Initially, I wasn’t totally invested in the idea, but I have since persuaded myself that we should use some internal scoring model to help us develop time-series analyses as we build the fund. Now we just need to raise our first fund and create a model that works. (This is my attempt at cracking a joke.) Wolfgang, this has been an amazing conversation. I say that with all sincerity. What should readers of FreightWaves expect to see from you in the future? Wolfgang: The continuation of the past. I enjoy what I am doing, and the feedback received confirms the relevance of my work. But who knows? Life is full of opportunities and I am open to expand or move beyond my scope. Brian: Thank you for spending this time with us. I look forward to being able to share your work with FreightWaves readers in the future.","TAGS":"Artificial intelligence, Gartner, Industrial Internet of Things, internet of things, Kuehne + Nagel, Machine learning, Maersk, Reefknot Investments, Supply chain, Supply chain digitalization, Supply chain disruption, supply chain industry, supply chain management, supply chain visibility, Supply chains, World Economic Forum, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Aoaeh","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Business, Digital Supply Chains, Global Supply Chain, Insights, Logistics, New Tech, News, Startups, Technology, Warehouse, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-10-16T11:00:49-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/supply-chain-management-specialist-lynkit-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BiTA-New-Member-Press-Release-Graphic-2.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Supply chain management specialist Lynkit joins BiTA","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Lynkit, the first Indian company to develop the e-consignment note on blockchain, has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). The application — Lynkit.io — has been built on Hyperledger Fabric and has led the company to be featured on The Linux Foundation’s Blockchain Showcase. BiTA is developing best practices and standards for blockchain in the transportation industry. Blockchain is an open, distributed digital ledger that can record and share transactions between two or more parties efficiently, securely and permanently. Blockchain enables transportation companies to more accurately track shipments, routes and transport vehicles while providing a highly secure platform that permits faster processing and payments. “Lynkit has joined BiTA because we believe that our development experience and user feedback can contribute to the ongoing discussions on standards and interoperability in the logistics industry,” says Lynkit’s Chief Operating Officer (COO) Sadhika Kumar. “We firmly believe that blockchain bridges the trust gap between parties in supply chain transactions and allows businesses, transporters, banks and regulators to transact with confidence.”   Kumar added that they were looking at significant gains for their clients from convergence of their existing suite of applications built around IoT, augmented reality, and real-time kinematics for the port logistics and trucking industry. “BiTA is the leading organization establishing blockchain standards within transportation, which will result in more efficient freight movement, supply chain management and more. We are proud to be a part of the organization promoting mass adoption of this technology in logistics,” according to the COO.

Legalization of medical marijuana in Germany happened fairly recently (in 2017), while recreational cannabis continues to remain illegal. Nonetheless, even with medical marijuana being legal, patients still face significant difficulties in procuring it as Germany contends with supply shortages and unnaturally high shelf prices. This ultimately boils down to the confusing reality of laws that govern marijuana in Germany. Since marijuana is still classified under narcotics and carries a state prohibition on its growth, sale and distribution, domestic cannabis fields cannot exist in Germany – making patients rely entirely on pharmaceutical imports for their needs. Recognizing a huge opportunity, several foreign pharmaceutical companies have taken an interest in importing medical marijuana in Germany. A growing number of doctors jump onto the cannabis bandwagon every year, endorsing cannabis therapies for a variety of ailments, and thus creating a perfect recipe for the medical marijuana supply chain to flourish.   For AMP, the EU-GMP certification will help push products earmarked to meet the highest consumer health and safety standards. Meeting these standards will also ensure a more effortless entry into the German market. “In addition to ensuring the suppliers’ production and operating processes meet EU-GMP certification standards, AMP’s German pharmaceutical consulting partner will audit AMP’s supply chain service providers during the fourth quarter of 2019 to ensure the quality and integrity of the pharmaceutical goods is maintained during transportation, warehousing, handling, testing and distribution,” said the company in a statement. The idea of EU-GMP certification apart, global cannabis supply chains can also look to leverage the technology of blockchain to bring transparency and visibility into the movement of marijuana from the field to the pharmacy counter. Blockchain can also ensure accountability from every stakeholder across the value chain, as the decentralized ledger technology demands equal participation and responsibility from every party involved. Pushing all the stakeholders onto a single decentralized blockchain network will also eliminate possibilities of counterfeit cannabis products making their way into the supply chain. Marijuana cultivation produces a lot of waste and some plants die along the way, which makes it vital to keep an accurate measure on the volume of harvested cannabis to ensure safety.   AMP expects its first imports into Germany to begin by the first half of 2020. AMP will be procuring its medical cannabis from two licensed producers based in the state of Alberta, Canada. The supply agreements will be made more concrete once these producers clear the audit for EU-GMP certification and receive their sales license from Health Canada. AMP will check the medical cannabis products before they are transported from Canada to Frankfurt, Germany, via air freight. Upon landing in Frankfurt, the products will be stored at a narcotics storage facility. The products will be inspected one last time before they are cleared to be sold to German pharmaceutical wholesalers. These wholesalers will only be allowed to sell the stocks to pharmacists who are contractually bound to AMP for their medical cannabis supply – thus ensuring strict accountability over the cannabis inventory.

What is the role for new technologies in global supply chains for perishable products? The question gnaws at me each time I am in the grocery store staring at produce that has travelled thousands of miles to get to retailers in the United States. According to data from the USDA, between 1999 and 2017: As these food products traverse the food supply chain – from producers to processors to distributors to retailers and then finally to consumers – there is a complex set of regulations and requirements that govern how they are transported across the food value chain. These regulations focus on preventing and responding to foodborne illnesses. A big problem, and a big opportunity   In an August 2018 report; Tackling the 1.6-Billion-Ton Food Loss and Waste Crisis, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) concluded, “Each year, 1.6 billion tons of food worth about $1.2 trillion are lost or go to waste – one-third of the total amount of food produced globally. To put the figure in perspective, that is 10 times the mass of the island of Manhattan. And the problem is only growing; BCG estimates that by 2030 annual food loss and waste will hit 2.1 billion tons worth $1.5 trillion.” Additional data from the BCG study is available in the following two exhibits. The first exhibit shows where food loss and food waste are most severe across the value chain. The second exhibit shows where, according to BCG’s analysis, there’s an opportunity for savings to be realized. In Food Routes: Growing Bananas in Iceland and Other Tales from the Logistics of Eating, Robyn Metcalfe discusses four pillars that support food supply chains. They are:   Looking at the second exhibit from BCG’s study, it would appear that supply chain infrastructure and supply chain efficiency hold the most promise for technology startups to introduce innovations into food supply chains. One issue that could pose a significant stumbling block is the degree of fragmentation within global food value chains. Insights from the field Amit Hasak is founder of Transship, a startup based in Chicago that is building an automated freight forwarding platform for perishable goods – food, pharmaceuticals, etc. Prior to launching Transship in 2017, Amit worked in his family’s cold storage business in Chicago, starting in 1999.   In Amit’s view, “Automation is the name of the game. The food supply chain in particular relies very heavily on manual labor. Freight forwarding for example is basically done the same today as it has been for decades when arranging international shipments. Needless and time-consuming telephone calls, emails and even faxes. This leads to inefficiencies that affect the food supply chain and also sustains the high cost of shipping. By introducing technologies such as application programming interface, blockchain and real-time tracking, startups such as Transship help reduce the cost of shipping, increase efficiency and introduce visibility. As a result, there is less food waste, the cost of food will be reduced and companies can invest more in business development rather than logistics. Conclusion It would be a mistake to assume that the $700 billion opportunity identified in the BCG study is one that is wholly available to technology startups. For startup founders and investors looking at this market, a more granular analysis makes the most sense – How many potential customers exist? How much would these customers pay for a product or platform that improves critical supply chain information infrastructure and also increases supply chain efficiency? What other related problems could software startups solve? Whichever software startups can build products that solve problems in global food supply chains in a way that gains quick adoption by the industry will do well. After all, it’s not as if people are going to stop eating food anytime in the near future.

Vottun develops interoperable platforms over which blockchain applications can be built and made to interact with distinctly different public or private blockchain networks. The idea is to create an application that can be used by Madrid commuters to centrally access and pay for all different modes of public mobility available within the city. The use of blockchain here is justified as it helps bolster the security behind the payment platform through its decentralized ledger technology, with Vottun promising high levels of user data security in the application. This is part of an initiative called Madrid in Motion, which was begun by the Municipal Transport Company of Madrid (EMT) in an attempt to digitalize the city’s transit system and bring order to the myriad of transport companies that offer services under the EMT umbrella – including the metro, buses, taxis, e-scooters, bikes, and car rentals. Currently, all these mobility types have their own applications; users have to separately install and register themselves, making processes extremely redundant. Unifying the system will not just help make processes more seamless for an average commuter, but will also help the government gather tremendous amounts of data on commuter transit patterns. This can be channelled to create insights on transit corridors that are frequently congested, which can be used by the city planning authorities to improve sections that need added transit options.   Vottun’s proposal on a unifying transport application won in a startup competition conducted by Madrid in Motion; it was chosen from among 300 such proposals. During its presentation, Vottun allowed attendees to test its product features like facial recognition and biometric payment gateways for EMT buses. “The user registration and validation system will be unique in all mobility services in Madrid because of the EMT app. This will facilitate the use of any mobility service to the citizen, and the payment in a simple and transparent way,” said Luis Carbajo, the CEO of Vottun. Before Madrid, there have been a few instances where public transport networks are leveraging the potential of blockchain to improve commuter interaction. Argentinian state public transport card SUBE was in the news earlier this year, when it announced a partnership with Bitex, a blockchain financial firm, for introducing the option of paying for services through bitcoin cryptocurrency. Though this is not necessarily innovation in itself, it is a decisive move towards greater understanding of the technology and to promote it across different avenues. SUBE cards are used by over seven million people in 37 locations in Argentina, to travel in trains, trams and buses.   The Brazilian city of Fortaleza has also jumped onto the blockchain bandwagon, announcing that it will allow commuters to pay for bus tickets by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies alongside conventional card payments. Users of the city transit app can pay through their smartphones through which they will get a QR code that they can scan as they get aboard a vehicle.","TAGS":"Bitcoin, bitcoin technology, Blockchain, blockchain technology, cryptocurrency, Madrid, Public transportation, technology disruption, technology startups, Vottun, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Europe, International, New Tech, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-10-07T11:00:36-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/chemdirect-joins-blockchain-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-01-at-3.02.55-PM.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"ChemDirect joins blockchain alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"ChemDirect, an online marketplace serving the chemical industry, announces it has joined the Blockchain in Transportation Alliance (BiTA), an organization dedicated to determining best practices and standards for blockchain in the transportation industry. BiTA’s members include Daimler, FedEx, SAP and Uber Freight among dozens of other global brands. ChemDirect brings deep supply chain and chemical industry expertise to the Alliance. Blockchain is a game-changer for supply chain management transparency. Jon Vorabutra, ChemDirect co-founder and COO explains it this way. “Every time a product changes hands, the transaction can be documented, creating a permanent history of the product, from manufacture to sale. This could dramatically reduce time delays, added costs, and human error that plague transactions today. Smart shippers are finding ways to leverage these innovations to increase profits and strengthen relationships across the supply chain.” Current chemical distribution channels do not reflect the modern advances of ecommerce. Traditionally slow to change, the chemical industry is positioned to see substantial benefit as more small and medium size businesses take advantage of online opportunities to grow their companies. By offering buyers immediate access to manufacturers, ChemDirect removes friction in the purchasing process and increases operating efficiencies.

Launched in July 2018 after a series of pilot shipments, the company is best known for coming out with its Ethereum-powered cryptocurrency called the “TEU tokens.” The TEU tokens did generate considerable interest within the maritime space as major container lines like CMA CGM, MSC, COSCO and Sealand of Maersk Group participated in pushing maritime logistics processes through the decentralized ledger technology. 300cubits estimates that about 100 shippers have registered on 300cubits for their share of the TEU tokens and over a dozen of the shippers ended up utilizing the platform for moving their shipments. However, the traction that 300cubits has received since its inception has not been flattering. “The transaction volume through the system has been far from commercial. Only a couple hundred containers have gone through the system, which, although may seem plenty among the shipping blockchain projects, is not sufficient to keep the system going commercially,” said 300cubits in its statement.   Though 300cubits’ capitulation might send shockwaves within the logistics blockchain segment, this was a disaster in the making. It is common knowledge that blockchain’s relevance within the logistics market lies in eradicating traditional issues that the industry contends with – like the lack of transparency and visibility into freight processes. But tokens like TEU had little bearing on how these issues were going to be solved. Stakeholders soon understood that cryptocurrency tokens did not have much inherent or perceived value to begin with, as volatility within the cryptocurrency market swayed its value unpredictably. “The lack of liquidity for the TEU tokens and the volatility of all cryptocurrencies in general also cast a constant doubt among the users on whether the value of the tokens could be realized,” said 300cubits in its statement. 300cubits, which set out to solve the problem of rolled cargo and no-show cargo, found itself in a spot as the lack of clarity in government regulations surrounding digital currencies overwhelmed the startup’s marketing efforts. A complicated technology and its associated regulatory scares kept potential shippers at bay, hampering 300cubits’ chances of scaling up its network.   Possibly the final nail in the coffin was the last-minute letdown of a potential partnership with INTTRA, the world’s largest maritime stakeholders association, due to regulatory concerns. Once 300cubits system is suspended, the company plans to burn at least 75% of the unsold TEU tokens and will continue to burn off tokens as and when they circulate back into its fold. Another apparent cause for the lack of traction on the platform was the lack of interest shown by maritime stakeholders towards primary blockchain differentiators like immutability and anonymity. That apart, the lack of interoperability between blockchain systems and central server-based systems was a significant stumbling block, as seamless connectivity between such disparate systems would be essential for the smooth functioning of maritime logistics processes. This brings the need for data standardization within the blockchain space into the spotlight. Building blockchain-based platforms over a standard data framework would create fluidity in the interactions between different networks, which will eventually help increase adoption levels.   The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) is doing just that, having published its inaugural set of royalty-free blockchain data standards that can be leveraged by any company looking to create a blockchain platform within the logistics space. BiTA is the largest consortium of its type in the world, with nearly 500 members spread across 25 countries and collectively generating over $1 trillion in annual revenue.","TAGS":"BiTA, BiTA Standards, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, blockchain standards, blockchain supply chain, maritime industry, maritime shipping, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Asia-Pacific, Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Logistics, Maritime, New Tech, News, Startups, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-09-30T13:30:33-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/port-report-barge-business-goes-digital-with-blockchain","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/North_West_Europe_1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Port Report: Barge business goes digital with blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Europe’s barge markets are set to deploy blockchain as they migrate to a paperless post-trade world VAKT, a specialist in commodity post-trade processing underpinned by blockchain, has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with essDOCS, a provider of paperless trade solutions. The MOU focuses on the northwest European barge markets, where the companies believe it is possible to further smooth the post-trade process for all parties involved in the transaction. Initially the solution’s rollout will focus on tanker barge markets in northwestern Europe, but the partners also are exploring global options.   “Previously, this market relied on a highly inefficient paper-based post-trade process,” said a joint statement. “Trading parties would agree on information to send on to the terminal, which would add its own information before sending on to barge captains to agree and sign for the product and quantities loaded or discharged from the vessel. This lengthy process results in several paper documents including the barge receipt, which when physically signed allowed the barge to sail and the seller to invoice the buyer.” In the future, a combined VAKT-essDOCS solution will allow the entire process to be handled digitally, speeding it up, reducing the scope for error and cutting costs. “By working with VAKT, the key shipping documents and data can then be added to the immutable, tamper-proof blockchain platform, offering an easily retrievable single source of truth for all parties involved in the transaction,” said the statement.   “While our initial focus is the northwest Europe tank barge market, where combined we have a critical mass of customers and an unrivalled digital post-trade offering, we are also exploring additional global markets where eDocs are key to full digitization,” said essDOCS CEO Alexander Goulandris.

This assimilation between two different blockchain solutions is one of the first instances of public and private blockchains working in tandem to provide greater utility to users from either of the platforms. “The partnership with CargoX is a big step forward in the supply chain industry and further sets the stage for next-generation logistics. We are joining the strengths of different kinds of blockchain – public and private, in a way that the users don’t need to lose time switching between them,” said Cory Skinner, chief executive officer of RoadLaunch. “Global organizations will be able to see an enhanced, trusted and simple interface for their shipment tracking and document transactions using multiple blockchain technologies. This is truly the world’s first project of this kind and the first step towards true blockchain interoperability.” Blockchain technology is now constantly in the limelight within the logistics and transportation industry. It is seen as an enabler of digitalization and in helping bring visibility and transparency across supply chains by forcing stakeholders across value chains to collaborate over decentralized ledger networks. CargoX pioneers in processing bill of lading (BoL) documents through its Smart B/L platform – the first open and neutral blockchain network within the shipping industry. Being an open and neutral network is key, as it allows CargoX to attract companies universally across the supply chain, unlike closed and privatized blockchain networks that garner a lot of skepticism over lopsided power equations between participants and network owners.   RoadLaunch was founded with the intent to improve logistics efficiency and reduce operational costs by digitalizing available capacity on trucks and making the procurement of freight quotes a breezy experience for users. RoadLaunch gathers data from different parameters like fleet location and available capacity and matches loads to that capacity in real-time. The collaboration between RoadLaunch and CargoX is vital to blockchain’s future within the logistics space, as it is an example of interoperability between two contrasting blockchain networks – an essential trait for the technology’s mainstream adoption within the industry. “CargoX is happy to provide the technology to send and transfer ownership of the most important document in global shipping – the bill of lading. RoadLaunch decided to connect both worlds for a truly versatile platform. Their hybrid model provides the speed and efficiency of a private blockchain, and the trustworthiness and reliability of a public blockchain, where it matters most – for document ownership transfer,” said Bojan Čekrlić, chief technology officer at CargoX. And to foster interoperability between different blockchain networks, it is vital to create open blockchain standards that can be used by companies to build their respective blockchain platforms.   The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), a consortium of over 500 members across the logistics space, has pioneered the development of open blockchain standards that companies can use as a pedestal for their blockchain-based solutions. With blockchain solutions being built over universally applicable standards, it becomes easier and more seamless to integrate disparate platforms without either of them needing to adapt to distinct data protocols.","TAGS":"BiTA, BiTA Standards, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, blockchain technology, CargoX, data standards, RoadLaunch, technology disruption, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, New Tech, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-09-18T14:30:31-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/imaginnovate-joins-blockchain-in-transport-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/BiTA-New-Member-Press-Release-Graphic-8.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Imaginnovate joins Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The latest company to join the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) is Imaginnovate, which is headquartered in Visakhapatnam, India.

The pilot run already has been completed, with Traca being used by CS Recycling to transport seven containers of used paper to Thailand from Potters Bar, England. Waste recycling is a particularly complicated affair, with trash moving through a long pipeline of stakeholders geographically spread out and often cut off from any interactions.This makes trash logistics operations prone to lengthened delays across the value chain. The Traca tool is built over a blockchain framework, helping stakeholders dispense information on a decentralized ledger that reaches trash producers, recyclers, regulators and processing centres. The U.K. grapples with a lot of waste and finds trash freight topping the country’s export list. With Brexit already expected to increase the workload of British Customs, making trash logistics seamless is particularly important.   “We are an increasingly regulated industry, and data is the only way the wheels turn smoothly. We rely on it to be true and accurate, but when it passes through different parties and becomes third-, fourth- or fifth-hand information, there’s rarely anything to prove its provenance,” said Simon Ellin, CEO of The Recycling Association, in a statement. “Therefore, for our members to be compliant and sustainable, we need a system that is transparent from cradle (the producer) to grave (the reprocessor). This solution can achieve that.” The initial focus is on verified gross mass (VGM) and electronic Annex VII forms that are prerequisites to transport waste out of the U.K., which will now be made easily accessible to relevant parties. The first trial with CS Recycling was successful as Traca cut down administrative processing times from a few hours to minutes, while providing greater visibility into the data and documentation the process entailed. MTI built its VGM technology on a distributed ledger platform called Activeledger in a bid to provide better security to data while helping disseminate information to all the stakeholders within the value chain. The International Maritime Organization has had extensive requirements for the movement of VGM since 2016, necessitating shippers to provide precise details on loads to respective carriers before containers are loaded onto vessels. “Recycling logistics is a complex sector, with a multitude of systems and processes. If we went in asking people to deploy yet more software, yet another login, they wouldn’t be interested. By developing this adaptor, we’re able to easily connect existing applications with the solution,” said Jody Cleworth, CEO of MTI, in a statement.   Cleworth said Traca automates the data flow between different parties, with smart contracts binding it together and verifying its authenticity. “This way we have a clear operational cost savings between all parties that are using the solution and the ability to deliver trusted data into the multitude of industry systems,” he said.","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain supply chain, blockchain technology, Marine Transport International, recycling supply chain, The Recycling Association, Verified Gross Mass, VGM, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Europe, Logistics, New Tech, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-09-10T08:00:27-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/mercedes-benz-collaborates-on-blockchain-based-used-car-management-platform","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/auto-automotive-brand-163774.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Mercedes-Benz collaborates on blockchain-based used car management platform","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Beijing Mercedes-Benz Sales Service (BMBS) has partnered with PlatOn, a blockchain-based used car value management platform to help understand the value depreciation of its cars and automate the process in real-time. Chinese-based PlatOn is a privacy-preserving computing network that develops solutions within different segments including payments, healthcare, smart cities and transport. PlatOn’s Vehicle Residual Value Management Platform (VRVMP) will be able to store static and dynamic data of vehicles along their lifetime, helping companies compute the residual value of vehicles at any given point in time. Until now, the used vehicle market did not have a concrete yardstick for objectively measuring the value of a vehicle, with estimations being roughly calculated based on some defining incidents in the vehicle’s life – including miles driven, gas mileage, general wear and tear, and damage caused by accidents. To normalize and have greater control over prices set in the used vehicle market, it becomes essential to have cognizance on these parameters by collecting historical and real-time data flowing out of the vehicle. Apart from storing this information, PlatOn’s platform goes one step further to preserve privacy by embedding data into a blockchain-based network that effectively cannot be altered without the explicit approval of all the stakeholders in the value chain – the used vehicle owners, vehicle inspection firms and car dealerships.   “With over 6.5 million used cars in China traded in the first half of the year alone, we hope that our collaboration with BMBS will highlight the need for more sophisticated data collection systems to accurately monitor the value of the vehicles comprising China’s substantial used car market,” said Ada Xiao, the chief strategy officer of PlatOn. Apart from its collaboration with BMBS, PlatOn has also opened its platform to all relevant stakeholders within the used car market, including the 4S dealerships. The 4S model in China is the abbreviation for sales, service, spare parts and surveys – making such stores the one-stop-shop for all car-related needs in the country. Automakers generally tend to partner with authorized 4S stores, as it helps them understand the pulse of the market and keep in touch with its customers. Daimler, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz, has been quite busy within the blockchain space looking to leverage the nascent technology – specifically in the payment space. Earlier this August, Daimler collaborated with German bank Commerzbank to develop a blockchain-based payment solution that automates machine-to-machine (M2M) transactions. This project was undertaken to test the direct handling of charging operations of electrically powered trucks when they need to interface with charging stations. Using blockchain in this process helps secure the payment gateway, as the digital ledger that blockchain entails is both immutable and decentralized. That said, this automated payment process is a use case that is reserved for the future, because the current auto landscape does not see immediate relevance in a scenario where both the vehicle and the charging point are automated.   Daimler also has been working with Riddle \u0026 Code, a European blockchain interface solutions startup, to create an open car hardware wallet that will have a myriad of use cases ranging from autonomous vehicles, secure exchange of real-time traffic data and interaction with smart city initiatives. “Autonomous cars must behave consistently to be trusted. Cars are already computing devices. A secure identity ensures that the right authorities have approved code executed inside vehicles and the trustworthiness of data exchanged,” said Tom Furstner, the CEO of Riddle \u0026 Code. “Riddle \u0026 Code secures this with its cryptographic hardware and uses ledgers to turn automobiles into future market places.”  ","TAGS":"Beijing, Beijing Mercedes-Benz Sales Service, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, blockchain technology, Commerzbank, Mercedes Benz, PlatOn, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Asia-Pacific, Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, International, New Tech, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-08-30T08:50:05-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/logistics-businesses-adopt-technology-or-revenue-will-slide","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Logistics_Businesses_Need_1.jpeg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Logistics businesses: adopt technology or revenue will slide","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Global auditing firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) released a report on trends that define the transportation and logistics (T\u0026L) segment for this year, citing technology to be the most significant factor determining the health of businesses in the space. An annual survey by PwC with CEOs of several companies within the industry found concerning evidence in the shortage of confidence in the market, with only 29 percent of the executives stating they are ‘very confident’ of their organization’s revenue growth in the space over the next year. Statistically, executive confidence languishes at a five-year low; in 2018 45 percent of the CEOs were confident of the future. This apparent lack of optimism puts the limelight on the ecosystem, which seems to be evolving rapidly alongside consumer expectations and the explosion of startups looking to marry technology with traditional logistics processes. PwC contends that this uncertainty with assured annual revenue has pushed incumbent companies to search for revenue streams that are ‘tangential’ to their core business. For instance, Deutsche Post DHL has become a manufacturer of electric delivery vans. Though initially intended only to serve DHL’s e-van needs, the company has now expanded its manufacturing subsidiary StreetScooter and plans to sell its vehicles to rival T\u0026L companies, eyeing a secondary stream of income to add to its bottom-line.   The industry’s fascination with blockchain technology was not lost on PwC; the report highlighted the prowess of blockchain to usher visibility and transparency into often siloed logistics processes. One of the biggest hassles faced by stakeholders within a supply chain is their inability to gain cognizance into the precise location of shipments while in transit. Documentation is also an issue, because missing or incomplete paperwork means delays that potentially last for days. “Blockchain has the potential to eliminate most of these roadblocks because it can serve as an encrypted digital ledger tracking the movements of products from warehouse to customer and linking documentation directly to the shipment as it makes its way to the destination,” said PwC in the report. However, to tap into the potential of blockchain, it is critical to form consortiums within the space that take the technology forward and standardize its data frameworks, which companies can utilize to spin off blockchain pilots. The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) is one such collaborative venture that has about 500 members across the logistics space. BiTA has developed open blockchain standards that companies can use as a platform for their blockchain needs. Artificial intelligence (AI) is another defining factor in the future roadmap of transportation and logistics, with digitalization playing a crucial role in data assimilation across different processes in the supply chain. These data sets are pushed through AI algorithms that help businesses to “distinguish themselves from the competition, provide better service, cut costs and enhance day-to-day operations.”   Despite being a proven technology, AI’s usage in the T\u0026L industry is still not widely prevalent, with 40 percent of the CEOs who responded to PwC’s survey stating they had “no plans to pursue any AI projects,” which is dismal considering that only 23 percent of CEOs from other domains claim non-interest. Worker utilization can also be improved with technology, as T\u0026L companies can now hire carriers and warehouse workers based on actual operational activity rather than inaccurate forecasts. “Partnerships or alliances linking startups with innovative technology ideas and established T\u0026L firms may become more routine in the future, especially as a way to recruit talent that is able to conceive new ways to implement advanced technology both in operations and in improving services offered to customers,” said the report. There is growing apprehension about the skills of workers, with 55 percent of the CEOs responding that they were ‘extremely concerned’ with the skill levels of their employees, which is restricting them in terms of innovation. A further 53 percent stated that the dearth of skill sets is causing their companies to miss their growth targets, and 49 percent said that it was preventing them from pursuing a market opportunity.   PwC called the T\u0026L industry a ‘cottage industry’ of sorts, as it remains highly fragmented and is comprised of thousands of small companies that are involved in limited shipping and logistics activities. “As a result, decisions to implement new technologies will vary, depending on availability of funds to invest in new technologies and R\u0026D,” said the report. “Nonetheless, with the overall T\u0026L arena moving quickly towards adopting more digital functions and capabilities across its value chain, R\u0026D investment and innovation is essential, no matter what size the company is.”","TAGS":"Blockchain in transport alliance, blockchain technology, logistics disruption, logistics industry, logistics technology, logistics visibility, Technology, technology disruption, transportation technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Business, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, New Tech, News, Startups, Technology, Warehouse, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-08-27T09:33:56-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/law-firm-bakerhostetler-develops-blockchain-based-smart-legal-contracts-for-the-freight-market","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Law_Firm_Baker_1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Law firm BakerHostetler develops blockchain-based smart legal contracts for the freight market","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"From an idea that envisioned currency devoid of centralized authority a decade back to thousands of use cases across various industries, the rise of blockchain has been explosive. The logistics and transportation space has been no different, witnessing several blockchain projects being commissioned by businesses looking to stay ahead of the curve. National law firm BakerHostetler has partnered with Clause, a software platform for smart legal contracts, to develop a blockchain-based automated legal agreement for the freight market. This is a smart legal contract available digitally to the involved parties, with it tracking the post-signature performance of the contract by integrating with the existing enterprise systems. “We have found that some of the pain points our clients experience post-signature can be alleviated with the use of a blockchain. For example, a distributed ledger can increase transparency among parties and allow them to use a shared database for certain transactions instead of siloing data that everyone needs to see in their own databases,” said Katherine Lowry, director of practice services at BakerHostetler. Such a smart contract allows stakeholders across the supply chain to “notarize” that certain events have occurred. Lowry pointed out that this could be leveraged to negotiate better positions in agreements, demonstrate compliance with regulators, provide new benefits to consumers or structure new kinds of mutually beneficial business arrangements.   These smart contracts fundamentally disrupt the way traditional contracts work. “After a traditional contract is signed, all you have is a PDF. Someone has to create an Excel spreadsheet that calculates one metric, configure a software system to manage another, and manually input data or send emails to ensure everything flows smoothly in carrying out the contract,” said Lowry. “It’s inefficient, difficult to track and more likely to create deviations from the agreement.” However, a smart digital contract can directly respond to real-time internal and external business data, automate the performance of contract obligations, and provide visibility into the contract’s roadmap. “With a computational contract, you directly connect the legal agreement to the business processes that flow from it. It’s a way of combining software – which is why we’re working with Clause – and the practice of law to create better alignment,” said Lowry. “What we do is help clients figure out which parts, if any, of their processes should be tied to a blockchain-based system. This also gives us the opportunity to redesign and improve the overall workflow given the advantages and constraints of working with a blockchain.” For instance, smart contracts can be used in the management of fuel surcharges in the supply chain. BakerHostetler identified several pain points within the process, including redundant phone calls, burdensome manual reviews, and variable financial costs due to seasonal differences across the length of the contract.   One of the use cases of this contract is in automating the weekly calculation of the fuel surcharge adjustment. The smart contract can trigger payment to a carrier or refund to a shipper, raise an invoice, and record the fuel surcharge calculation – all on a permissioned blockchain network. Baker Hostetler’s collaboration with Clause is an extension to the firm’s IncuBaker program that has been helping lawyers and clients understand and navigate the intersection of digital business, emerging technology and law. “Our most recent market analysis shows the breadth of our legal clients’ engagement with blockchain technology – whether through strategic investments, consortia, proofs-of-concept, or joint ventures,” said Lowry. “After heavily researching and crafting a thoughtful methodology, we made the decision to bring what we think is a best-in-class approach to computational contracts to market.”  ","TAGS":"BakerHostetler, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, blockchain technology, freight industry, freight market, legal agreement, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Business, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, New Tech, News, Technology, Trucking, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-08-20T10:30:53-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/maersk-beefing-up-it-staff","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Follow__Up_To_Maersk_Earnings_1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Maersk beefing up IT staff","INTRO":"About half of its 6,000 information technology workforce are consultants and the company is planning to make more of them direct employees.","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Reporting its second quarter earnings last week, A.P. Moller-Maersk said it is planning to boost the size of the company’s IT staff and that “Technology is core to both our vision to become the global integrator of container logistics and a key enabler to enhance our operating performance.” The company said its technology strategy focuses on three areas: Carolina Dybeck Happe, the company’s chief financial officer, said in a call with investment analysts that the company has in total around 6,000 people working in information technology, about half of whom are contractors. The company is looking at increasing the share working directly for Maersk “in the more strategic areas, and the important areas, and then keep a healthy balance of contractors for the rest,” she said. Adam Banks, Maersk’s chief technology and information officer (CTO), told the Danish newspaper Borsen in July that the company was hiring 26 new employees a week and that in a year and a half it planned to have 4,500-5,000 IT employees. He said two-and-a-half years ago the company had an 800-person IT staff.   This year the company introduced “Maersk Spot,” a product that offers shippers carriage of their cargo at a fixed price as well as guaranteed equipment and space in exchange for a penalty if they don’t show up with promised cargo. Chief Executive Officer Soren Skou said the Maersk Spot was an “important step in the digital journey of the company.” Maersk said it is now offering the Maersk Spot product on all trade lanes except in and out of the U.S., and at the end of the second quarter it was moving the equivalent of about 8,000 40-foot containers, or 8 percent of spot volumes, using Maersk Spot. Silvia Ding, global head of ocean products at Maersk, said in June that it was “not uncommon to see overbookings to the tune of 30 percent, and often this leads to rolling of the customers’ cargoes since there is overbooking to compensate for the high downfall.”   Ding continued, “This creates a lot of uncertainty for our customers,” and Maersk Spot will allow “customers to move their cargo in a much simpler and more reliable way.” A Maersk spokesman said the company is planning to launch Maersk Spot in the U.S. in the fourth quarter and is preparing an offering compliant with Federal Maritime Commission regulations. Maersk said it has “achieved improved fuel efficiency for our vessels through technology,” allowing it to prevent an increase in bunker costs even while moving more cargo. Though the average price for bunker fuel in the second quarter of 2019 was $436 per tonne, 8.5 percent more than in the second quarter of 2018, the company was able to keep fuel costs at $1.2 billion for the quarter by reducing bunker fuel consumption by 7.5 percent “mainly due to efficiency initiatives, the more efficient newbuild vessels delivered in the past year as well as from a stable network in the second quarter that also impacted schedule reliability positively.”   Fuel costs for shipping companies are expected to increase dramatically next year when IMO 2020 – the International Maritime Organization agreement that will require ships not equipped with scrubbers to use low sulfur fuel – goes into effect on January 1, 2020. Skou said Maersk has been “very successful in terms of getting fuel adjustment clauses into all contracts. We are right now at 90 percent coverage on that and on the fuel supply side we are testing some scrubber technology. We are making supply contracts for low sulfur fuel and we believe generally and we are reducing fuel consumption very importantly to mitigate the extra costs, so we believe we are well-prepared at this point in time.” Maersk noted that automation is also helping it improve service delivery and that since the first quarter of 2018 it has improved service reliability from 70.4 percent to 85.5 percent in the second quarter of 2019, citing figures from the consulting company SeaIntelligence, though it noted these figures exclude Hamburg Süd, which Maersk acquired in 2017. Alan Murphy, CEO of SeaIntelligence, explains the metric Maersk cited is his company’s “global measure of vessel schedule reliability, where ‘on-time’ is defined as actual vessel arrival within +/- 1 calendar day of scheduled arrival. We measure the schedule reliability of Maersk and Hamburg Süd separately, as they offer a different set of services.” Speaking about TradeLens, a “blockchain-enabled” digital shipping platform jointly developed by A.P. Møller-Maersk and IBM, Skou said Maersk is “building towards TradeLens becoming a business in its own right as if you will, an internet of trade.” In addition to Maersk, carriers such MSC, CMA CGM, Hapag-Lloyd and Zim are joining TradeLens, as well as terminals and logistics companies.   “It was a very important step to get commitments from some of the largest carriers in the world to join the platform because without the data from the carriers, the platform will not be interesting for the customer,” said Skou. “The rest of this year we’ll do the work to actually get these carriers on board,” he said. “We will have around 60 percent of global capacity on the network then on the platform. At the same time building the platform with the landside participants – container terminals, container truckers, railroads and so on, so that we get as much of a network covering as many participants as possible.” Skou said, “The concept for TradeLens is that the shippers will be the customers of TradeLens. So the revenue model will be that shippers will be paying for access to all the data on the shipments. Today we have today around eight customers, all of them big name companies.” He said these “pilot customers are interested in the new platform because they think it can help to manage their supply chain, improve visibility, make it more efficient and so on.” Computer security remains a continuing challenge for Maersk, which in June 2017 was hit by what CTO Adam Banks described as “the world’s most expensive cyberattack.” In its 2017 annual report the company said the attack caused by the NotPetya malware resulted in it suffering “losses in the order of $250-$300 million covering, among other things, loss of revenue, IT restoration costs and extraordinary costs related to operations.” Speaking in June at the Inforsecurity Europe conference in London Adam Banks said,   Banks says that “if you look at the defensive side of cybersecurity, perimeter security is no longer sufficient. With the state actors that we see at play today, we have to assume they are inside. So we need the perimeter, but equally we need to be vigilant inside that perimeter looking for odd behaviors and reacting to those.” He said there is a need for companies to focus on “cyber-hygiene” because the rise in nation-state cyber-crime means many more companies are likely to be impacted.","TAGS":"A.P.

On August 4, the University College of London’s Center for Blockchain Technologies (UBL CBT) published Distributed Ledger Technology in the Supply Chain,“a market report looking at the adoption of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) in physical supply chains.” The CBT added that the report “is the first comprehensive outlook on the state of DLT in the global physical supply chain sector.” In this article, I synthesize three themes that the authors of this report identify as affecting the broad adoption of distributed ledger technology in global supply chain networks. The report assessed 105 DLT projects.    Track and trace is the most common use-case across industries The globalization of supply chains presents an advantage – goods can be sourced at lowest cost from any part of the world. However, that advantage comes with an attendant disadvantage – individual consumers, business customers and regulators all require information about products that have been sourced from far-flung parts of the world. Given the size of the global food retail market, the complexity of food supply chains around the world, and the need to monitor and minimize outbreaks of food-borne illnesses, it is not surprising that retail food supply chains account for the majority of track and trace DLT in supply chain projects.   The report highlights IBM Food TrustTM, an ecosystem of food industry participants who share information with one another to create a more transparent and secure global food supply chain. This project already counts some of the world’s biggest food companies as members. One promising early application of DLT is the digitization of manual, paper-based processes in supply chain logistics One area in which we may see rapid adoption of DLT is in the digitization of manual, paper-based processes and record-keeping related to supply chain logistics. This is particularly relevant for the record-keeping required by the regulatory bodies involved in the import and export of goods around the world. Some port authorities are experimenting with blockchain-based bills of lading. One of the startup projects that the report highlights is CargoX, whose chief operating officer was a presenter at The New York Supply Chain Meetup’s one-year anniversary event in November 2018. Projects like CargoX have application across several industries.   On the other hand, as the authors state, “However, since supply chains typically involve many and varied participants it is also among the most complex use cases to implement. As with all blockchain deployments, benefits are only realized at scale once critical mass is obtained. Consequently, whilst a raft of proof of concepts have been completed over the past three years, rollout at scale is still a work in progress. This is challenging because it requires a collective approach with industry-level engagement.” I have written that the cultural obstacles to DLT and blockchain adoption in supply chain logistics may be more difficult to overcome than the technical difficulties. This is because private, permissioned implementations of DLT in supply chain need to be interoperable with one another. This requires intra- and inter-industry collaboration. It requires collaboration between once sworn competitors. It requires collaboration between startups and established companies. DLT in financial applications may take longer to gain widespread adoption than one would expect In my opinion, applications of DLT in supply chain finance or trade finance are possibly the most exciting and most significant in terms of their potential economic impact. However, I believe they may be the last to gain broad adoption amongst enterprises. Applications in supply chain management and supply chain logistics will need to become more mature and widespread before applications in supply chain finance gain wider adoption. The authors of this report explain why this may be the case. Applications in this area include: payments enabled by smart contracts; selling directly to individual consumers; and alternative methods of obtaining and deploying working capital. The chart below shows how the projects studied for this report are distributed.   The authors point out two reasons financial transaction applications of DLT in supply chain could take longer to gain adoption than the others. First, distributed ledger technologies and cryptocurrencies are still poorly understood. The lack of understanding of the technology creates negative perceptions. This creates barriers to adoption in financial transactions. Second, financial transactions must adhere to a high degree of regulation and legal scrutiny. It takes time for a regulatory framework that accommodates new payment methods to be developed. As I wrote above, supply chain finance applications of DLT will become more prevalent once supply chain management and supply chain logistics applications become more prevalent. Conclusion: DLT in supply chain is here to stay, even if it takes time The authors conclude by stating that DLT is set to transform physical supply chains, even though there is still much work to be done before decentralized systems become a reality for real-world applications at scale. They end the report with three observations. First, data quality remains a concern in DLT in supply chain applications. Second, input and output connections between DLT supply chain applications and physical supply chains must be built and defined. Lastly, “the new co-opetition model of consortia is not an easy one to implement. It requires a new way of working for companies and also is potentially challenging from a regulation and antitrust perspective. New collaborative forums can play an important role here to bring stakeholders together and drive industry level adoption.”","TAGS":"Blockchain, Cargo X, Distributed Ledger Technology, DLT, food safety, food supply chain, global supply chains, IBM blockchain, IBM Food Trust, Supply chain, Supply chain digitalization, Supply chain disruption, supply chain management, Supply chains, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Aoaeh","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Business, Digital Supply Chains, Global Supply Chain, Insights, Logistics, New Tech, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-08-13T16:00:17-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/trucks-merit-no-mention-in-analysis-of-congestion-pricing","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Todays_Pickup_1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Today’s pickup: Trucks merit no mention in analysis of road congestion pricing; YRC drivers lose satellite radio","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Good day, The National League of Cities’ recently published an analysis of congestion pricing options to reduce traffic bottlenecks. The report was notable for what it didn’t include. There was nary a mention of commercial motor vehicles (CMVs), even though they are major contributors to congestion, and will be more so as a growing volume of goods that used to be picked up in person are now delivered to residences after being ordered online. In fact, past discussions over congestion pricing have focused on ways to get trucks out of cities during daytime commuting hours. Perhaps the League is planning a follow-up study focused on CMVs. Failing that, it is shocking that CMVs got no mention. Did you know?

Daily Facts) Final thoughts: FedEx Corp.’s move to end its domestic ground-delivery contract with Amazon has little, if anything, to do with its fears about Amazon being a competitor. Nor does it have to do with FedEx wanting to make its service offerings available to other e-commerce companies. It has everything to do with Amazon being a relatively small customer with outsized demands and low-yielding traffic. It’s hard to believe FedEx would have cut Amazon loose had it thought the e-tailer was paying a compensatory rate for the services rendered. Amazon may one day compete with FedEx. And FedEx believes it will be able to fill the void with other, higher-revenue business. But neither was a factor in severing the relationship. It was a dollars-and-cents decision.

This pilot project is in collaboration with Daimler Trucks, with this M2M payment part of the test for the direct handling of charging operations of electrically powered trucks. The automated payment pilot involves the transaction process between an electric truck and the charging station it docks at for its electricity needs. “In the transaction, Commerzbank first brought in euros on the blockchain and then provided the so-called “cash on ledger,” i.e. the money on the blockchain, to Daimler Trucks for the settlement of the payment transactions,” said the bank in its statement. Digitalization has transformed the transportation sector, bringing the concept of connected vehicles, making them smart enough to be interacted with, unlike traditional vehicles that were designed with the singular intent of moving people and freight. Connected vehicles have allowed automakers and service providers to tap into the various data streams flowing out of vehicles in real-time, which is further used to create insights into vehicle operation and maintenance. However, as technology proliferates within the cab, it is critical to understand the threats that are associated with vehicles being connected in real-time to the cloud. One of the greatest concerns is hacking, a real possibility as connected vehicles can be vulnerable to external data hijacking if their firewall defenses are not strong enough.   For payment processes within such connected vehicles and future autonomous vehicles, blockchain provides a way to be more secure with transactions, because it is a digital ledger that is both immutable and decentralized. Commerzbank has stated that mapping end-to-end automated payment processes is not possible in the current scenario, thus pointing out to the need for a network that is as secure as the one built over blockchain. “Following the recent digitization of securities transactions and the use of blockchain technology, we are now focusing on DLT-based payment structures. As a bank, we naturally also see our mission as creating new digital payment architectures for our customers,” said Stephan Müller, divisional board member of transaction banking at Commerzbank. Commerzbank has termed the pilot a success, mentioning that it has proved that in the future, “both the loading and the subsequent payment process can proceed completely autonomously and without human intervention.” With industry incumbents in the space clearly convinced that autonomous driving technology will surface initially within the freight hauling industry, it becomes all the more essential for payment systems to be made secure, as M2M transactions will soon be the norm. To make sure the blockchain-based networks are interoperable across different layers and processes, it is necessary for companies to look at standardizing blockchain frameworks, which can be done through organizations like the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). BiTA currently has over 500 members from within the transportation and logistics industry, intending to create open blockchain standards that can act as a springboard for companies in the space to develop blockchain-related applications that can interact seamlessly with each other.

But though the value of cryptocurrencies has fluctuated since then, blockchain’s relevance in the supply chain market has only grown in stature, with businesses pushing for pilot runs and joining blockchain consortiums to standardize usage. Blockchain’s place in a supply chain is in shedding light across the length of its value chain, providing visibility on logistics operations and transparency in transactions between different stakeholders. Blockchain, being a decentralized and immutable ledger, also brings in the much-needed trust found severely lacking between stakeholders – in part due to the absence of end-to-end visibility. That being said, though the benefits of proper implementation of blockchain across supply chains do provide utility, the more pertinent question at this juncture is how the industry can bring that to fruition. This is a concern, because although companies within the supply chain realm understand the possibilities of integrating blockchain within their operations, the technology still remains an enigma in regard to its implementation. For instance, a large part of the industry is yet to come to terms with the fact that to realize true visibility through blockchain, it is critical to have all the stakeholders within a supply chain to be on-board and sharing relevant and accurate data. The difficulty here is in two parts – convincing every stakeholder of blockchain’s presumed benefits and making sure the data fed into the system is devoid of irregularities.   In the eagerness to drive efficiency through better operational visibility, companies rush toward adopting blockchain, forgetting the fact that the technology is not a magic cure-all, but rather has several limitations, which if misconstrued, would make its possibilities irrelevant. Take, for example, the use of blockchain in a coffee supply chain. The coffee industry is bereft of visibility, a common occurrence across supply chains that source, process and sell products across several parts of the world. Coffee supply chains are particularly of interest as a blockchain use case, as the industry witnesses several human rights violations at coffee bean farms that are predominantly situated in economically poor regions across Africa and Asia. Provenance tracking of the coffee bean from the farm to the cup is critical to improving the livelihood of the farmers while providing accountability to the end customers. But before putting data on a coffee bean’s journey across this supply chain, it is vital for companies to audit the information that is being fed into the system. This is difficult, because it involves stakeholders who might not necessarily understand the technology or the positive impact it could have on their earnings. The first step towards successful implementation of blockchain is educating stakeholders on the technology. Within the capacity of coffee supply chains, major stakeholders like Starbucks or Tim Hortons will need to work with the farmers they source their coffee beans from and push them to register their farms on a blockchain platform. When farmers enter information on how and where a bean is sourced from, it provides the industry a way to ascertain ethical sourcing means and helps clean-up redundant intermediaries who take up a bulk of the profits today.   Likewise, for different blockchain platforms to be interoperable, it is crucial to standardize their use across all discretely functioning supply chains. The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), a consortium of over 500 members across the logistics space, has pioneered the development of open blockchain standards that companies can use as a platform for their blockchain needs. In the context of blockchain standards, it is also essential to make sure they are open because that will help small- and mid-tier businesses to adopt blockchain without being forced to pay royalties for the framework. For blockchain to truly transcend the chaos of supply chains, it is crucial to tick off all the prerequisites – without which the technology will gradually be reduced to a pointless exercise and ebb away from mainstream relevance.

The primary reason for these issues is the way food is being sourced. Food sourcing is now truly global, with produce being shipped from different corners of the world and stocked in supermarkets, moving through the hands of several stakeholders along the way. This brings complexity into managing logistics, with stakeholders at different nodes of the value chain having no visibility into the operations of the other parties involved. This has fanned interest for businesses to look into blockchain, which can help standardize supply chain processes, while also ushering in the much-needed transparency and visibility. “As supply chains grow increasingly more global, you don’t necessarily have that personal relationship with some of the trading partners in a supply chain that you may have had 10 or 15 years ago,” said Kevin Otto, senior director at GS1 US, a standards organization that standardizes blockchain frameworks for easy adoption within food supply chains. “So the idea that you can actually track and trace products through a global supply chain and ensure that you’re shipping safe food to consumers, becomes increasingly more of an acute problem.” Otto explained that the idea of linking supply chain trading partners together in a trustworthy environment through blockchain or any suitable data-sharing mechanism is essential because there has been an increase in the number of recalls and contamination issues in recent years – threatening authenticity within food supply chains.   “So as supply chains grow increasingly more global, it becomes a bit harder to link all these people together. So I think that’s a major problem that food supply chains have been trying to tackle for a number of years. I think the whole idea behind blockchain becomes another arrow in the quiver to be able to address that food safety concern,” said Otto. He contended that the real value behind blockchain is its possibilities in enabling more open data sharing and in creating an audit trail – helping ease and expedite the movement of food through the value chain. “I think the biggest concern that we are looking at is that data is still only as good as the people who are providing it. So if we need accurate and standardized data, blockchain makes it more effective to audit that data in the supply chain and provide greater visibility,” said Otto. “At GS1 US, we help the industry understand that it can’t just adopt blockchain and have supply chain visibility. You still need to actually be capturing and sharing the data in a standardized fashion for it to mean anything to trading partners down the line.” In essence, though blockchain can bring in auditability, the technology still needs its core data to be populated and accurate to start with. The rapid rise of blockchain in the industry comes with a caveat – eager businesses that look to adopt blockchain into their operations without understanding the fundamental precincts of blockchain.   “Data governance becomes a key concern in blockchain. The standards that we provide are around identification of assets as they move through the supply chain,” said Otto. “For instance, take the barcode on a bottle of water. The ability for the barcode to capture that product’s batch number, lot and serial number as it moves through the supply chain can be used to identify physical locations like manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, farms and further upstream. All this can be done through GS1 standards.” Otto pointed out that these standards help supply chains at-large visualize critical questions on the provenance of products – namely, the what, the when and the where part of the process. “The important part about starting these conversations around blockchain is to know your use case. Blockchain is not a cure-all for supply chain visibility,” said Otto. “Blockchain will not be a fit for some use cases, and so the C-level people in organizations must understand the limitations before they start writing checks for blockchain pilots.”  ","TAGS":"Blockchain, food supply chain, GS1 US, supply chain visibility, Technology, Transparency, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, New Tech, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-07-23T11:30:42-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/todays-pickup-usps-pension-problems-may-have-long-term-competitive-impact-will-the-cookie-crumble-for-cpg-companies","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Pickup_7-22-19_1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Today’s pickup: USPS’ pension problems may have long-term competitive impact; will the cookie crumble for CPG companies?","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Good day, How can FedEx Corp. (NYSE:FDX) and UPS Inc. (NYSE:UPS) benefit from the U.S. Postal Service’s (USPS) pension-funding challenges? As many know, USPS sets aside about $5.5 billion a year to pre-fund employee retiree health benefit obligations. In a column in the financial weekly Barron’s, Allen Root writes that USPS must emphasize competitive parcel services with its first-class mail monopoly in secular decline. That puts it in more direct competition with FedEx and UPS. At the same time, USPS will continue to raise its competitive rates to offset higher costs, including those for future pension payments, Root says. This, in turn, will shrink the price gap between the three players. USPS’ competitive edge lies in its pricing, not in its service or the depth of its portfolio. If that advantage narrows or vanishes, USPS customers may see no reason to stay, he added.

The bad news is that carbon emissions from freight will double by 2050, making freight the most carbon-intensive sector by then. The good news is that processes, metrics and technologies are in place to measure performance and success, which may halt that grim march, she said.

Ask big food why they can’t broaden their fulfillment, and they’ll shrug their shoulders and say that it’s not that done way. Truth is that doing it another way will take a lot of heavy lifting.

This leads to a scenario where food supply chains rarely remain localized, but are instead becoming quite international, leading to a lengthening list of stakeholders spread out globally within a value chain. Such a scenario also makes provenance tracking very hazy, as the complexities involved in tracking products or the flow of data from the farm to the customer’s table is hazy at best and often too opaque to glean insights into its movement through the supply chain. “It’s hard to pull data, hard to really get to the bottom of what a supplier provides, and which retailer or consumer is holding on to a specific last batch in a product line,” said Pratik Soni, the founder and CEO of Omnichain, a blockchain-based supply chain technology startup. “The challenge is to get visibility through a singular platform where a user can get visibility without sifting through a bunch of Excel files, trade customs paperwork, purchase orders, or receipts.” Soni contended that the process of provenance tracking is complicated as the supply chain is flooded with several data streams and stakeholders’ complexities, making it hard to answer simple questions on origin and lineage.   “The number one concern for data transparency is essentially data validation. How can I, as a consumer, be sure that a product is truly organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, or kosher? Without lots of paper trails – both physical and digital – it is really hard to come to a conclusion on a product’s authenticity,” said Soni. Aside from validation, it is essential to look at how consumers perceive the need to understand the provenance of the products they consume. “These days, everyone is looking for fresh and healthy food. However, we also see many recalls happening in the marketplace every week, for example, with the salmonella outbreak in meat and lettuce,” said Soni. “It now becomes essential for vendors and food and beverage manufacturers to instantly identify the potential of a recall or contaminant, wherever be the issue within their value chain. But right now, this is very difficult.” The technology of blockchain does come in handy to combat such a situation, as it can put checks across every single step within a supply chain, making sure there is proper quality control, food handling, and that all the requirements with regard to testing and certification are met. Recently, Omnichain collaborated with Ruby Rockets, the health frozen food brand, to implement blockchain within the company’s supply chain to better understand the provenance of the raw materials that go into producing its products.   “Ruby Rockets’ pain point was that they had to sift through a lot of paperwork and contact suppliers to figure out what went into producing a specific batch. We took a holistic approach to manage that implementation. We looked at data the raw materials suppliers and contract manufacturers provide and we sifted through the data and validated it against the quality requirements that Ruby Rockets holds against them,” said Soni. “We worked with those suppliers to make sure the data is sent to us either digitally or via PDF, and then we validated the data and pushed that into the blockchain.” Omnichain uses the data coming out from the distribution channel to get better granularity into its supply chain visibility, and track and trace every single batch of products leaving the manufacturing floor to the retailer and down to the customer. Thus, in the event of an unforeseen incident of contamination in its supply chain, Ruby Rockets will now be able to accurately pinpoint which product batch is affected and contain the problem before it mushrooms. “It is about using that data in a more proactive way to let consumers and brands know sooner and act faster. Blockchain can help create a demand-driven customer-centric supply chain, as we now have the data and can use artificial intelligence and machine learning to drive processes like suggested replenishment, proactive replenishment, and manufacturing planning,” said Soni.

Local police in the nation’s capital, Canberra, say they are about to press charges against an as-yet-unidentified person who allegedly shot down a commercial drone worth about A$500k (US$350k or so). Local media reports say that electricity and gas distributor, Evoenergy, was using drones to carry out surveying work. The company is apparently not answering questions on incident. In its last annual report the company said it would use drones equipped with light detection and ranging technology to inspect power lines among other things. Local community groups have not been happy with the deployment of drones in Canberra. One group, “Bonython Against Drones” – which we mention here simply as an existing protest group and we make no allegations against the group or any of its members – have raised concerns about “noise, privacy, data collection, safety and impact on local birdlife, pets and lack of regulation”. The group has complained of drone deliveries to the wrong address, bird strikes, spilt hot drinks, drones crashing on non-customer driveways, people being followed by drones, and a done flying so low that it nearly caused a resident to drive off the road.   Freight, last-mile delivery and vehicle management tech company, Yojee (ASX: YOJ) has announced that it is picking up a diverse range of international companies as customers. These include freight companies, retail groups and even bus companies. A few days ago, Landmark Group, a major retail and hospitality group active in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and India, picked Yojee as a logistics technology partner following a successful trial in Malaysia “with a view to rolling out in other countries,” Yojee said in a statement. Landmark’s senior manager, supply chain South East Asia, Eric Chua, said, “We chose Yojee to improve our company across B2B and B2C activity and have a single system for tracking purposes. Also, Yojee provides capabilities to grow or expand into other countries and territories… Yojee has available all the systems and modules to fix our business model and can be easily implemented without major customisation. It has also helped to partner with new logistics service providers through the Yojee Network. The system has helped to eliminate manual process such as creating reports and delivery notifications”. Yojee announced back in May 2019 that it had signed a three year software as a service deal with global freight forwarder Geodis. Yojee will provide SaaS logistics and supply chain management technology on a case by case basis for multiple projects across the Asia-Pacific region. As at mid-May one project had begun.   “We… face challenges in cross-border trucking which is solved by Yojee’s enterprise grade solution,” said Geodis South East Asia Road Network Director Dinesh Kenapathy. Yojee also reports that it is attracting interest from outside the traditional freight sector. For instance, the company says it has been approached by a number of bus companies (some of which have up to 5,000 buses) that are looking to use Yojee for planning and scheduling. The software company uses a combination of artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchain technologies to provide its services.   The freight trucking watchdog, the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator, has appointed a joint team of academics and consultants to review fatigue monitoring technology. The joint team will interview 13 companies using a variety of fatigue monitoring tech in the areas of fitness for duty tests; various types of continuous operator monitoring (eye motion measurements and brain waves, among others), performance-based monitoring and vehicle-related tech. “Driver fatigue is still a significant factor in about one-in-ten heavy vehicle crashes,” said the Regulator’s fatigue specialist Andreas Blahous. “Commercial studies suggest that fatigue monitoring technology can help identify and address incidents before they happen. While there is currently limited independent information available on the effectiveness of fatigue monitoring technology, users of this technology in the transport industry tell us that there are practical safety benefits, which warrant further study. [Our] review found that monitoring technology performed best as part of an integrated Fatigue Risk Management System, rather than as a stand alone tool; and this is the focus of the next phase of the Fatigue Monitoring Trial,” Blahous said. The fatigue monitoring trial concludes in June next year.   AP Eagers (ASX: APE) has offered to sell its subsidiary business Kloster Motor Group to help it secure approval from the competition watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, in its takeover bid of rival Automotive Holdings Group (ASX: AHG). APE and AHG are the two largest retailers of new and used cars, trucks and buses, along with associated services, insurance and finance. Kloster is an 85-year old automotive retailer based in the Newcastle and Hunter Valley region. It has a diverse portfolio of major vehicle brands. It employs 410 people and generates about A$420 million (US$295 million) in annual revenue. AP Eagers entered into a “Heads of Agreement” to sell Kloster to the Tony White Group for A$54 million (US$38 million). The sale of Kloster is expected in November 2019, subject to due diligence and conditions such as approval from the competition watchdog. In late June the ACCC said that it had preliminary concerns about APE’s bid for AHG, especially over the impact of competition in the Newcastle / Hunter Valley region of New South Wales. The combined entity would operate 46 percent of new car dealership sites in that region. In the city of Newcastle itself, the combined company would operate 77 percent of dealership sites selling the most popular brands. “We believe that local consumers generally don’t travel beyond the Newcastle/Hunter Valley region to buy new cars, and it is difficult to find out the final price for a car without visiting a dealership,” the ACCC said.   Meanwhile, the target of APE’s takeover, AHG, has advised shareholders that the company has completed the sale of its interest in Motorcycle Distributors Australia to the Austrian company, KTM Sportmotorcycles. AHG formerly owned a 74 percent interest in Motorcycle Distributors Australia, which imports and distributes KTM’s bikes across Australia and New Zealand. KTM already owned 26 percent of the business and will now own 100 percent. MDA had made a loss of about A$1.4 million in the ten months to the end of April 2019. The transaction values the business at A$18 million (US$25.6 million). AP Eagers says that it is “supportive” of AHG’s decision to sell its interest in Motorcycle Distributors Australia. AP Eagers adds that the sale of the motorcycle business will impact AP Eagers’ bid for AHG. Main image: Robotic delivery drone by Eduardofamendes available via Wikimedia.

For some workers in the transportation and logistics sectors Facebook can be a lifeline to what is going on at home. And its messaging apps allow us to speak and even see those waiting for us at home. But soon it could be much more. Recent news provided information about a new blockchain application and cryptocurrency project that Facebook has been working on for about a year. The financial press has been touting it as the breakthrough in blockchain and cryptocurrency technology that we have been waiting for. Doesn’t that sound familiar? Luckily, FreightWaves is here to help make sense of it all and explain why this new tech might actually be a little different. It will open new markets… and new lanes   At the Facebook developers conference in April, Mark Zuckerberg told the audience “I believe it should be as easy to send money to someone as it is to send a photo.” It looks like it soon will be. Facebook announced that dozens of employees have been creating the new blockchain application on which it can run its own cryptocurrency. The project, called Libra, has attracted funding from leading payments and tech industry players such as Uber, Mastercard, Visa and Stripe. The mission of Libra, as gleaned from Mark Zuckerberg’s incorporation of a company called Libra Networks in Switzerland in May, is “investing, payments, financing, identity management, analytics, big data, blockchain and other technologies” according to a report from Reuters. Facebook says that the purpose of the new currency, which according to the BBC will be called GlobalCoin, is to reach areas that the company has penetrated but that do not have access to banking services or where government-backed currencies are volatile. The idea is that anyone in the world who has access to Facebook will now also have access to a medium of exchange that will allow them to participate in the global marketplace.   The crypto token will be available for use on Facebook and just as importantly it will be available through Facebook apps, including Messenger and WhatsApp. These apps, especially WhatsApp, have become the de facto communication systems for some nations. In fact, Messenger and WhatsApp have a combined 2.8 billion users in 180 countries worldwide. WhatsApp is an easy to use platform that allows users to make calls, text and video calls using wi-fi. According to the website Business of Apps, India is the largest market for WhatsApp with up to 300 million users, followed by Brazil with around 120 million users. The U.S. is a relatively small market for WhatsApp due to ubiquitous cell service, but Messenger has around 126 million users. It will work with governments, not around them   While the impetus of the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry has always been to serve as the foil for traditional government-backed fiat currencies, Facebook has been working with governments to gain acceptance of its cryptocurrency. In order to lower barriers for participation, Facebook has been asking countries to waive restrictions such as proof of passport requirements that are normally in place in order to move money in some countries. Furthermore, it is not only online that Facebook is planning to permit access to its cryptocurrency. The company has been talking with merchant services providers around the world, incentivizing them to allow their merchants to accept the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, the company plans on introducing ATMs that allow for the cryptocurrency to be brought into the physical world. Facebook has relinquished complete control over the project and several large firms including Uber and Stripe have paid $10 million each in order purchase a distributed node on the blockchain’s underlying token. The companies will help to run the digital currency and will serve as a foundation for oversight, thus negating any possible criticism of Facebook as over-controlling. The move is meant to bolster Facebook’s pivot to privacy. Recently the company announced it intends to prioritize private communications through methods of encryption. The move to crypto fits in perfectly; blockchains are appealing for their transparency and because each party in the transaction can retain anonymity through the use of code name assignment. Blockchain technology allows for open and honest exchange but with personal data protection, both of which have been issues that Facebook has been accused of playing fast and loose with in the past. Facebook currently has around 2.13 billion users. The formal launch of GlobalCoin is expected in 2020 after a testing phase beginning this year. The official announcement about the cryptocurrency is pending.

At a Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing on June 25 examining the adoption of technology in transportation, Brent Hutto, Chief Relationship Officer at digital load board Truckstop.com testified that connecting transportation freight systems together would be the best way to reduce highway congestion and improve delivery times. “You have an unawareness of the marketplace and what’s going on in metropolitan areas because systems are not connected,” Hutto said. “Certain parts of the truck driving system in North America have access to the system and others don’t, or don’t use it because they’re not connected to what they use every day.” Hutto informed the committee that Truckstop.com has been working on a project since 2017 with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the state of Wisconsin on an “e-credentialing” product, where all the permits a trucker is required to display for roadside safety inspections have been condensed into a smart phone app.   “Our initial conclusion using a test fleet of 157 trucks found that we could reduce the stop time by 20 minutes” that an officer would be exposed to highway traffic while conducting an inspection, Hutto said. “That’s a massive increase in efficiency when it comes to their safety, as well as cost reduction for the fleets.” Patrick Duffy, President of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) testified that such credentialing technology can be an effective use of blockchain technology. “Ensuring that the accuracy around driver credentials, whether that’s health records, insurance, or driving records – that’s high-fidelity data that hasn’t been corrupted through time,” Duffy said. Duffy also explained that supply chain and transportation industry is a notoriously low-margin business, and building trust between counterparties through blockchain technology can go a long way toward capturing that margin. “By leveraging blockchain technology we can increase that trust and allow for collaborative commerce to emerge,” he said. Duffy noted in his testimony that BiTA, whose members represent more than $1 trillion in revenue annually, released its first blockchain industry standard in February and has three more in the pipeline expected to be unveiled later this summer. When asked by Senator John Thune (R-South Dakota) how the standards will help companies integrate blockchain into supply chain management systems, Duffy responded that the industry is reaching a “critical mass” moment.   “Our members represent every transportation mode – air, road, rail, ocean – and are coming together in a collaborative way to agree upon these standards. I think that’s really going to move the ball forward from the experimental to the ecosystem-level adoption” over the next three to five years, he said. Since the FAST Act was signed into law in 2015, automated and connected vehicle technologies have advanced while the percentage of electric vehicles in the market continues to increase. Shailen Bhatt, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Intelligent Transportation Society of America, pointed out the safety benefits incorporating the use of these technologies in the next version of the highway bill. “There’s a broad swath of technologies that are available today, and I’m grateful that this hearing has been convened to inform the next authorization, because every day we delay another 100 people die on our roadways,” Bhatt said.   He added that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that connected vehicle technologies can prevent 80 percent of crashes involving unimpaired drivers. “That’s 1.2 million crashes that can be mitigated every year.”","TAGS":"BiTA, Blockchain in transport alliance, Digital trucking, FAST Act, highway bill reauthorization, Intelligent transportation society of America, ITS America, John Thune, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Senate commerce committee, truckstop.com, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Gallagher","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Legal issues, Trucking, Truckload Indexes, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-06-26T08:00:31-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/automotive-technology-leader-surgere-joins-blockchain-in-transport-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BiTA-Surgere-graphic.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Automotive technology leader Surgere joins Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"Blockchain enhances Surgere’s supply chain solutions by providing automated ledger","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Surgere has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), a member-driven organization that shares a common mission of driving the adoption of emerging blockchain architecture forward. Surgere’s cloud-based software solution – currently delivering unprecedented supply chain visibility and control – will be valuable to the BiTA effort. As an additional layered technology, blockchain will enhance Surgere’s ability to identify and track transactions digitally and share that information through distributed ledgers. “Blockchain enables instant visibility of inventory transactions, captured by Surgere’s extremely accurate RFID solutions, which can be immediately and collectively processed throughout the supply chain,” said Rusty Coleman, Surgere’s Vice President of Digital Transformation. “That visibility can remove artificially created demand patterns and make visible smooth and continuous demand for tiers near real-time. Harnessing that visibility and creating new rules within ERPs can lead to operational efficiencies and reduce lead-time across the supply chain.” Surgere’s collaboration with BiTA to advance blockchain is congruent with a statement made by Bill Wappler, Surgere’s CEO, in February. Wappler said, “Our customers rely on us to be efficient, precise and trustworthy… To us, ‘innovation’ is about thinking scientifically as well as creatively, extending the confines of the technology that exists today. The combined outcome for our clients is reduced cost and increased productivity.” “On behalf of BiTA’s members, I welcome Surgere to the Alliance,” said BiTA President Patrick Duffy. “Surgere’s expertise, particularly in the automotive supply chain, will be valuable as BiTA moves blockchain education forward.”   As Surgere continues to lead supply chain innovation across the automotive industry, it will continue to invigorate its solutions with technological advancements, like blockchain. An example, Surgere’s AutoSphere – a community of automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), suppliers and transportation providers all working together in a single software environment on a shared cloud-based platform – is now onboarding over 1,551 suppliers in 2019. That number will triple in 2020. Each year, the automotive industry loses between 16 and 18 percent of reusable packaging assets, which, according to Wappler, amounts to an enormous “multi-billion-dollar problem. Until now, everyone worked at solving supply chain losses uniquely with non-standard solutions. AutoSphere changes everything.” A recent study from McKinsey Digital found that only about one-sixth of the world’s largest companies adopting IoT report a significant return on investment. Surgere’s supply chain solutions can boost IoT performance by providing 99.9 percent data acquisition accuracy throughout the supply chain. That level of accuracy enables advanced analytics and superior supply chain response. Most of Surgere’s clients experience ROI inception within six months. “Supply chain professionals know it’s important to reduce lead-time and inventory,” said Coleman. “That increases cash flow, improves efficiency, and provides timely available to promise. Blockchain is a tool that should be leveraged to give access to instant and transparent information. Blockchain is the new payback tool to explore and exploit.”   Coleman underscored, “For organizations willing to move forward with advancements, like AutoSphere and blockchain, operating costs will decline, and business will run with greater transparency and efficiency.” About Surgere Founded in 2004, Surgere’s role in the evolving i4.0 supply chain reality is to provide its clients with advanced asset visibility, data analytics and control through each segment of the automotive supply chain – packaging, transportation, yard, finished vehicles, plant and cross-global.

The Trump administration’s protectionist trade policies, especially the tariffs placed on Chinese goods, may be driving the rapid recovery in the value of the most well-known crypto-asset, Bitcoin, over the past six weeks. Bitcoin – and its underlying blockchain technology – was thrust into the media spotlight in the fall of 2017 when the price of the crypto-asset shot up from about $1,200 in April 2017 to $4,500 by September. Asking prices for bitcoin spiked to an all-time high of $20,078 on December 17 before collapsing. After a series of “dead cat bounces,” bitcoin settled in the mid-$6,000 range over the summer of 2018, then fell precipitously to the mid-$3,000 range in late November. Bitcoin bulls in the press and social media fell quiet, interest waned in crypto-assets, and the pace of initial coin offerings by new projects abated.   Quite recently, though, bitcoin has regained its momentum. In the past three months, the crypto-asset’s value has climbed 134 percent, and on the afternoon of Thursday, June 20, it broke through $9,500, setting a new 52-week high. There is reason to believe that the Trump administration’s trade war with China and China’s policy responses have a lot to do with the sudden surge in bitcoin’s price. On May 10, President Trump hiked duties on almost $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent. In the month of April, bitcoin traded between $4,900 and $5,400, slowly rising as trade tensions simmered. Shortly before the new increased tariffs were announced, bitcoin started climbing faster. Over the course of May 10, bitcoin ramped from $6,272 to $6,559, a significant one-day move of 4.5 percent. Why? Chinese retail investors knew what was coming – a further devaluation of China’s currency, the yuan. The Chinese government’s devaluation of its currency, of course, is an old talking point for President Trump, but it’s worth recounting the reason behind it if we’re to understand why Chinese investors could be ditching the yuan for bitcoin.   Imagine that you’re a company that sells Chinese-made goods in the United States. You buy goods in China in the local currency, the yuan, and then sell them in the United States for dollars. If a 10 percent tariff is placed on Chinese exports to the United States, then you are penalized – you have to pay 10 percent of the goods’ value in dollars to the U.S. government before you can bring it on-shore. Now you’re in the position of figuring out where to recover those costs, either by squeezing your suppliers or passing the cost on to your customers. The Chinese government has its own way of lessening the burden tariffs put on its exports – it devalues its currency against the dollar. Remember that importers buy with yuan and sell for dollars. If the yuan falls against the dollar, that means that the importer’s costs go down relative to its revenues. So far this year, China has depreciated the yuan against the dollar by more than 9 percent. Chinese retail investors – and by the way, ‘retail’ doesn’t mean middle-class, it refers to individuals moving their own money – have long used bitcoin as a vehicle to get their wealth out of the yuan and the country. It’s difficult to pin down bitcoin trading volume by country, but it was widely reported that the late 2017 bitcoin bubble was fueled by Chinese retail investors.   In February 2018, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said that it “would block access to all domestic and foreign cryptocurrency exchanges and ICO websites,” and over the course of last year, the PBOC shut down approximately 90 exchanges. Today, there isn’t a reliable, 24/7 way to trade bitcoin in China, but according to a Forbes article from May, bitcoin buyers and sellers have migrated to WeChat groups, where the crypto-asset is traded over-the-counter. Dave Chapman, chairman of OSL, a Hong Kong OTC brokerage that trades more than $1 billion a month, told Forbes that he believed that up to 20 percent of total global crypto trading volume originates in China, even more than a year after the ban. The famous hedge fund investor Paul Tudor Jones said, in a 1987 PBS documentary simply titled Trader, that “the whole world is simply nothing more than a flow chart for capital.” He meant that depending on a variety of factors – an almost innumerable set of variables – people put capital into different assets. These factors include things like macroeconomic conditions from country to country and across the globe, the investor’s appetite for risk and desired returns, as well as adjustments that have to be made due to public policy changes and the behavior of other investors in capital markets. In my view, Jones’ dictum is an excellent insight into the bitcoin price movement. In the crypto media, too often volatile swings in the price of bitcoin are attributed to headlines about crypto-assets themselves – rumors that institutional investors like JP Morgan or Goldman Sachs will begin trading them for clients, or the recent news that Facebook and a consortium of other tech companies are launching a token called Libra. One reason is because there’s a dearth of fundamental data about bitcoin itself. Crypto-asset analysis is dominated by technical analysis and the close examination of supposed patterns in charts. When analysts speak of ‘fundamentals,’ they tend to refer to metrics like trading volume, hash rate, number of miners, and other attributes of the bitcoin network.   But Jones reminds us that movements in the price of an asset might not be based simply on news about the particular asset class itself. The world is a flow chart for capital, he said. In other words, capital moving into bitcoin and bidding it up has to come from somewhere, and it has to come from a place that is less hospitable to capital than bitcoin. Instead of looking at hype around other crypto-assets like Libra, for why bitcoin is surging in value, it makes sense to look at where the money is coming from – at least that is the thesis of analysts who think that Chinese retail investors are getting their wealth out of the sliding yuan and putting it into bitcoin so that it can’t be manipulated by the Chinese government. President Trump has said that he is considering levying tariffs on the remaining portion of Chinese goods that have been so far unaffected; goods worth about $300 billion. If those tariffs go through, the Chinese economy will be under further pressure. Already, GDP growth is slowing, and Fitch Ratings forecasted a few weeks ago that 2019 would see a record number of Chinese corporate bond defaults. New tariffs would put pressure on the PBOC to do further stimulus and protect China’s export economy. If devaluing the yuan is part of that response, expect the price of bitcoin to rise even higher. If the yuan falls against the dollar and bitcoin rises, it would mean more evidence in support of the ‘capital flight from China’ theory. If the yuan falls against the dollar and the price of bitcoin doesn’t move upward significantly, then there could be another explanation for its bull run (although no one is claiming that Chinese investors are solely responsible for the current run-up – if 2017 taught us anything, it’s that bitcoin behaves like a momentum stock and investors rush in as the price rises). If the People’s Bank of China doesn’t adjust the yuan – unlikely but possible – then the theory will be neither confirmed nor denied. Stay tuned.","TAGS":"Bitcoin, China tariffs, cryptocurrency, currency devaluation, President Trump, renminbi, Trade, trade war, Trump administration, U.S.-China trade war, yuan, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Paul Hampstead","CATEGORY":"Asia-Pacific, Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Business, Economics, Finance, International, New Tech, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-06-21T07:00:06-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/without-standardization-blockchain-can-become-a-forgotten-piece-of-code","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Without_standardization_blockchain_1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Without standardization, blockchain can become a forgotten piece of code","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Dean Croke, the chief insights officer at FreightWaves, spoke at the Blockchain Europe Expo, elaborating on the inception of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), the factors that led to its creation, and the need for open and neutral data standards to enable widespread adoption of blockchain. “For many years I drove trucks over long distances in Australia. During those times I spent hours, if not months, waiting for paperwork at the loading docks across most ports. Paper documentation is a major choke point for international trade,” said Croke. “Though my experience is from the 1970s, this is something that still happens today.” Croke pointed out that digitizing paperwork is a key to channeling efficiency within supply chains. This procedure would require unflinching trust over the transaction system, which can be enabled by funneling information through a blockchain-based platform. It is this idea that led to the founding of BiTA, with the aim of creating open blockchain standards for the supply chain ecosystem. Croke mentioned that BiTA was a consortium that was founded by accident, born out of a discussion between FreightWaves and a TMS vendor. One of BiTA founders believed that if blockchain had the potential to solve some of the ubiquitous supply chain problems like transparency and trust, the industry could not afford the mistakes it did with EDI standards adoption, or rather, the lack thereof. Though EDI standards have been available for many decades, the industry never participated en masse, leading to a complete failure in the EDI standardization process.   BiTA’s primary goal is to unite every stakeholder within the logistics landscape under a single umbrella, making sure to double down on the standards that companies can use as a springboard to develop their blockchain platforms. BiTA’s astronomic growth since its inception echoes this sentiment, with the consortium quickly growing to accommodate more than 450 members from across the globe in less than two years of existence. “BiTA is a community in which we have weekly webinars and newsletters, and we connect members to commercialize opportunities. We have no software or investment in any technology, and that’s not our purpose,” said Croke. “Our standards are non-profit; we have a board of directors who are a group of independent people developing standards for the industry in a completely unbiased manner.” Croke pointed out that most of the products people use regularly have standards governing their design and manufacture. For instance, a pair of bluetooth headphones would have to adhere to several standards before it gets to commercial production. “Blockchains are going to be a consumer-to-consumer business model. You don’t really care about blockchain in the background, as you’ll just want to pick up something, scan the barcode, and learn the history of the product.” IBM surveyed stakeholders within the transportation industry on when they believe blockchain would see widespread commercial adoption within the market. Seventy percent of the respondents thought that it would happen by 2020, which reinforces the need to have blockchain standards in place before widespread adoption happens.   “I think the number is a bit aggressive, as I’m not sure if we are there yet with the mass adoption of this technology. Sure, we’ve moved one container at a time in a truck or on a plane via a blockchain platform. But I haven’t seen the technology at a level where we can do it millions of times every day repetitively at scale,” said Croke. BiTA released its first standards a few months ago, which can be accessed by anyone without paying any royalty. Croke mentioned that though BiTA had a stronger presence in the U.S. than it did across the rest of the world, the standards were developed keeping global supply chains in mind, with the view of integrating blockchain applications across the entire planet. “After we rolled out the standards, what we found is that companies which weren’t a part of the consortium were adopting our standards, in the event that one day, they will have to integrate with someone in blockchain and by then, they will already have standards built into their code,” said Croke. “Having a standard code is very important. Developing it is incredibly mundane, but if we all thought about it in the right way, we would finally have interoperability within the ecosystem.”  ","TAGS":"BiTA, BiTA Standards, Blockchain Europe Expo, Blockchain in transport alliance, Digitization, FreightWaves, paperwork, Standards, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, New Tech, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-06-20T16:30:26-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain-provides-trustability-in-the-age-of-mobility-services-and-autonomous-vehicles","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Blockchain_provides_trustability_1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain provides trustability in the age of mobility services and autonomous vehicles","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Harry Behrens, head of the blockchain factory, Daimler Financial Services, spoke at the Blockchain Europe expo in Amsterdam, highlighting the disruption that awaits mobility systems and how blockchain can be leveraged to provide trustability and enable end-to-end real-time financial transactions without manual intervention. “Private ownership is going down, and mobility is going towards a stage where it is delivered as a service. And before fully autonomous vehicles are a reality, we will have semi-autonomous vehicles that will require vehicles and devices to transact on their own,” said Behrens. Mobility services are not about disrupting technology, but rather an evolution of business models, which Behrens explained was made possible by software platforms, giving rise to possibilities like on-demand ridesharing and multi-billion dollar gig economies. “If you look at operators like Uber, they are asset-light – they don’t own vehicles. They don’t have a problem now because they have drivers who bring the fleet with them. However, this is getting split already, as there are fleets where drivers match on-demand. And with autonomous vehicles, there obviously are no more drivers,” said Behrens.   For the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), the ground is quickly sinking beneath their feet. OEMs will need to innovate and move towards on-demand mobility and autonomous vehicles if they want to weather the mobility services storm. Most of the major OEMs are now working to develop self-driving technology and to acquire or spin-off on-demand mobility services. Behrens explained that for this business model to scale, it is essential to phase out human intervention within the ecosystem – be it as drivers or at the back office. “In the future, the mobility ecosystems will evolve from being siloed business models to ones that have several capabilities – like charging, parking, toll collection, rental service – all coming together to deliver a service,” he said. “A customer will only be asked simple things like vehicle type, time of the lease and miles to be traveled. All other things can be settled fully end-to-end in real-time with no human intervention and through software.” It is inevitable that such an ecosystem has trust at its core, because for it to function seamlessly will involve pushing data coming out of the vehicle to the remote processing network – leading to the rise of a true end-to-end scalable business model. “Everyone speaks of smart contracts. To have one, the very least you’d need is the capability for at least two parties to sign the contract. And it is extremely important in mobility to figure out who are your identified parties – the customer that’s being driven and the car that does the driving,” said Behrens.   Identifying a user within a blockchain-powered network is simple – by the address of the person’s digital wallet. Behrens pointed out that the word ‘wallet’ was a misnomer, as its primary use was to recognize a person using its unique address. This helps identify a person and thus can allow the wallet holder to sign transactions without the need for further verification. “All this comes together in a semi-autonomous vehicle. Such vehicles will need to transact on their own. There’s a lot of ticketing involved like parking, charging, fueling, toll collection. If you’re my customer and you’re paying for the service, you aren’t going to pay for all these tickets, as it is something I need to take care of to deliver the service to you,” said Behrens. In the end, the devil is in the details. The numerous B2B transactions that occur within the mobility services ecosystem hinge precariously on the accuracy behind identifying both the vehicle and the person using its mobility services. Blockchain, with its immutable ledger and concrete identification possibilities, offers a solution that is both foolproof and generates trust.

Carrefour began its blockchain project about 2.5 years ago, with the initiative bearing fruit through an elaborate provenance tracking platform that now accounts for several products like chicken, tomatoes, milk, eggs and cheese. “Our blockchain program is displays the trust we’ve built with farmers, intermediaries and people who work in the packing industry. When you buy a product it has a QR code on its packaging, and that directly takes you to the web page where we show the batch number, the order number, shelf life and the like,” said Delerm. For this, Carrefour had to start somewhere, and it did from the poultry industry – quite specifically, with Auvergne free-range chicken. The company connected all the stakeholders in the chicken supply chain, including the farm, the livestock breeders’ union, the feed factory, the vet, the slaughterhouse, and the processing and packaging center through its blockchain platform for seamless relaying of information. The resulting value chain provided consumers a clear understanding of what went into rearing poultry – right from the hatching of the chicken, the place it was bred, the cereal it was fed, and its age at the time of slaughter. These updates, Delerm noted, were very specific to individual chicken, with exact details coming up with every package a consumer picks up at a Carrefour outlet.   “Transparency builds up trust. When you have a community of people who are working to make the best product and have the consumers who wish to engage with those people, blockchain can be of help,” said Delerm. Delerm explained how blockchain can essentially help with “extending the size of the packaging,” and how Carrefour leveraged that to provide much more information on a product than what could be said on the packaging itself. Carrefour has now partnered with IBM Food Trust and Swiss multinational food and beverage company Nestle to explore the potential of exchanging mutually trustworthy data and how that can help both the companies in improving consumer confidence in their products. Providing added information on food products is critical because consumers are increasingly concerned about what they put in their bodies. Delerm mentioned that Carrefour’s data shows that roughly 40 percent of its customers use their smartphones while moving through the store aisles, and the information embedded within QR codes might be vital for a product to be picked – inevitably, affecting its overall sales figures. The wild popularity of smartphone apps that rank products on customer reviews is also causing a shift in the purchasing behavior of consumers. Delerm pointed at apps in France that rate products on a scale of 1 to 100, and will suggest substitutes if the product in question is not great. Such apps have millions of downloads.   If blockchain-based provenance tracking is made mainstream, it can actually help companies create separate product lines based on specific product descriptions – like the place of origin, feed, quality, shelf life and even the length of its supply chain. For instance, product lines like wine can be labeled based on individual farms rather than regions, giving consumers the opportunity to develop loyalties and providing vineyard owners the chance to take credit for their work in the field.","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain technology, Carrefour, Europe, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Europe, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, New Tech, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-06-19T12:28:59-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/commentary-what-role-will-data-standards-organizations-play-in-a-world-powered-by-artificial-intelligence","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Hamburgcargoshipshutterstock.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Commentary: What role will data standards organizations play in a world powered by artificial intelligence?","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"FreightWaves features Market Voices – a forum for market experts with unique knowledge of transportation and logistics sectors, as well as other critical expertise. There was significant excitement in the container shipping industry in April. The reason for this excitement was the formation and public launch of the Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA). DCSA is a standards organization established to create common information technology standards, paving the way for interoperability in the container shipping industry. That got me thinking; in an age when artificial intelligence (AI) could probably be applied to solving some of these problems, what role should a data standards organization play? What is a standards organization? A standards organization is an organization whose primary purpose is to develop technical standards that address a problem common to the organization’s prospective members – in most cases prospective members will be companies within a specific industry. For example, the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) was organized by companies around the world that are in the transportation, logistics and supply chain sectors. DCSA, of course, is another example. Once the standards have been developed, the standards organization encourages their adoption by the industry. Initial announcements indicated that DCSA was formed by MSC, Maersk, Hapag-Lloyd, Ocean Network Express and CMA CGM.    Why does the container shipping industry need a standards organization? Maritime freight shipping insiders complain that there are still too many manual processes reliant on paper and pen. Moreover, a lack of common data standards means that it is very difficult to conduct business across all shipping carriers. Banking transactions between customers of different banks around the world are relatively straightforward because the global banking industry adopted Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) standards to enable transactions between banks on behalf of bank customers. At this time, the shipping industry has no equivalent of SWIFT. The downside of not having industry-wide standards is that it makes it difficult for customers to easily do business with one another if doing so requires the exchange of data and information. It can also impede innovation across the industry since there is never a complete picture of the various issues confronting the industry.   That situation is no longer acceptable to the customers that the shipping industry serves. Well then, what’s the problem? I was a data analyst during the early part of my career. A major part of my responsibilities involved scrubbing data to make it useful for my own analysis. During my time at UBS, one of the databases I relied on had 150,000 rows and 40+ columns, and I experienced, first-hand, what Hugo Browne-Anderson described in the Harvard Business Review article What Data Scientists Really Do, According to 35 Data Scientists: “It has been a common trope that 80 percent of a data scientist’s valuable time is spent simply finding, cleaning and organizing data, leaving only 20 percent to actually perform analysis.”   We can safely assume that data standards organizations seek to materially reduce that 80 percent drag. At the same time, there are many startups today that are building platforms to solve this problem without necessarily relying on standards organizations. Therefore, the question is: In the future, will there be a need for data scientists to spend any time at all on cleaning and preparing data? The answer, from some startup founders is “no,” and data standards will not be necessary. The platforms being built are aptly described in The Business of Platforms by Michael Cusumano, Annabelle Gawer and David Yoffie: Systems that “bring together individuals and organizations so they can innovate or interact in ways not otherwise possible, with the potential for non-linear increases in utility and value.”[1] These platforms would mainly enable innovation, but they would also facilitate transactions between individuals and organizations as well. The real power of such a platform will be around the capabilities it provides for participants in specific industries to more easily collaborate with one another. Such a platform could automate up to 99 percent of the manual data ‘janitorial work’ required of data scientists today by: Industry groups are simply ill-equipped to solve this problem at scale. Industry consortia, like DCSA, are formed with good intentions. However, such good intentions overlook the stark reality that such groups are generally ill-equipped to solve the problems they most desperately need to solve in order to successfully accomplish their purpose and mission. Here are just a few of the problems such groups face:   What should such industry groups focus on? One of the things that has struck me about the shipping industry is the lack of trust that exists among companies in the industry. I have been even more surprised when people who have spent many more years studying the industry have pointed out to me that this acute distrust goes all the way down to the level of individuals in the industry. To paraphrase the words of one person I spoke with about a year ago, someone stole someone else’s girlfriend, or won a promotion the other did not get while they were in the management training program at Maersk, and since then they have been sworn, life-long enemies. The trouble is that no one else knows this history, and so their actions now that they are C-level executives at these big shipping companies do not make much sense to people on the outside. Industry groups and standards organizations need to spend most of their time and energy building trust. I describe this as the ‘Culture Question.’ The culture question is about trust, ethics and how the players within an industry decide to engage with one another – are there areas of close cooperation, distinct from areas of intense competition, or is everything out-and-out cutthroat competition? By comparison the ‘Tech Question’ is easy to solve. The builders of new innovations for supply chain logistics, supply chain finance and supply chain management include within their ranks researchers, academics, engineers, technologists, inventors and entrepreneurs capable of solving the Tech Question. The only people with the capacity to solve the Culture Question are the organizations and people who seek to buy new innovations for the supply chain. That is where standards organizations can be most effective; building trust between people and organizations that have historically had no reason to trust, or cooperate with one another, and establishing areas in which the industry agrees cooperation will create disproportionate value for the industry’s customers and suppliers.   The alternative? Unpleasant competition and potential disruption imposed by digitally savvy attackers, who also have the financial wherewithal to impose pain on industry incumbents.

Blockchain technology is nothing if not utilitarian, with it essentially tackling the two cardinal problems prevalent within supply chains – the lack of visibility and transparency among stakeholders. For centuries, coffee has been one of those commodities that has truly been traded across continents, as coffee plantations invariably were situated around the equatorial belt while the beverage has been enjoyed ubiquitously around the world. Fascinatingly enough, blockchain’s possibilities in the coffee value chain transcend the usual trope of visibility and trustability. Coffee cultivation is still caught up in the clutches of forced and child labor across large swathes of Africa and South America, the likes of which could be brought to light by adopting blockchain. It also can help to reduce the lopsided financial equation of the coffee value chain, as studies show coffee farmers earn as little as 7 percent of the retail price of coffee. Across the world, several blockchain pilots exist within coffee supply chains, mainly to understand its provenance and thereby assure quality to consumers. This March, the Indian government approved the ‘Coffee Blockchain Initiative’ that is expected to help integrate coffee farmers with the markets in a more transparent manner. The government expects blockchain to delete several layers of redundant middlemen and helps bridge the gap between consumers and producers.   “This initiative will help in creating a brand image for Indian Coffee through traceability, by reducing growers dependency on intermediaries and having direct access to buyers for a fair price for their produce,” said the Indian Ministry of Commerce \u0026 Industry in its statement. “Blockchain helps in finding the right coffee suppliers for exporters and within the stipulated time to meet growing demands and in building better trust and long-term relationships.” Halfway across the globe, a Dutch startup called Moyee Coffee is disrupting the African coffee supply chain by using blockchain to guarantee a ‘clean’ coffee value chain. Since November 2017, the company has been running a pilot blockchain project along with Denver-based bext360 and the FairChain Foundation, with the intent to create more value for Ethiopian coffee farmers by increasing their share of dividends. “The bext360 platform gives all its stakeholders – farmers, roasters and consumers – access to data across the entirety of the supply chain. This data enables complete analysis of the supply chain to identify supply chain efficiencies,” said the startup in a writeup. “For consumers, bext360 provides unprecedented levels of transparency around origin and quality; and allowing, for the first time, a coffee drinker in Europe to pull up this data and verify exactly where their coffee was sourced.” Starbucks had been one of the earliest adopters of blockchain within the coffee ecosystem, launching its two-year pilot project across its sourcing farms in Costa Rica, Colombia and Rwanda. Starbucks’ involvement in blockchain is heartening because the company, the world’s largest coffeehouse chain by far, can create a seismic fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) pressure for businesses within the ecosystem to try blockchain out. This May, Starbucks announced that it is partnering with Microsoft’s Azure Blockchain Service to track its coffee shipments and bring real-time traceability to its supply chains.   “For Starbucks, which has long been committed to ethical sourcing, knowing where its coffee comes from is not new. Last year alone, Starbucks worked with more than 380,000 coffee farms,” said the company in its statement. “However, digital, real-time traceability will allow customers to know more about their coffee beans. Perhaps even more important and differentiating are the potential benefits for coffee farmers to know where their beans go after they sell them.”","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain technology, coffee supply chain, logistics, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, New Tech, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-06-14T10:30:58-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/factom-protocol-joins-blockchain-in-transport-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BITA-Factom.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Factom® Protocol Joins Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The Factom® Protocol, an open-source enterprise-grade, developer-friendly blockchain platform utilized by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, announced it has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an organization dedicated to determining best practices and standards for blockchain in the transportation industry.

With more money flowing into the space, more products will hit the market. Some will change how shipping does business. Most will not. To understand the hurdles to maritime software development and what areas tech providers are focusing on, FreightWaves interviewed Evangelos Efstathiou, founder of Boston-based consultancy SkySail Advisors. Prior to launching SkySail, Efstathiou held positions at Marsoft, Veson Nautical, SpecTec Group and Chinsay. For the past two years, he has curated an infographic ‘map’ of the maritime tech landscape spanning three pillars – commercial operations software, vessel management software, and maritime intelligence and analytics. As SkySail’s map has garnered more attention, Efstathiou, through his interactions with tech providers, has gained an insider’s view of the latest developments. Why investor interest is growing   “There has been an acceleration of interest among investors in the last 18 months,” Efstathiou explained. Asked why, he answered, “If you look at the dollar value of the goods moved [at sea], there is a belief that technology investment will grow as carriers try to differentiate themselves in a commoditized market, so the pie should be growing. The amount of money to be spent on software should be growing. “There is also more availability [of software to buyers],” he said. “You can now put up a cloud-based application on Azure or AWS and that software is much more efficiently accessible to a larger number of people. That is very relevant to shipping, because typically your customers are spread across dozens of countries. In fact, some of the cool new tech today is really just improvements over the past migrated to cloud-based solutions to provide new connectivity.” Yet another reason for the focus on maritime software is the increased proliferation of automated identification system (AIS) vessel tracking data. “AIS has blossomed over the last 10 years because there are more satellites,” he said. “This has also created a number of initiatives from people outside of shipping that use AIS – such as for protecting fisheries and reducing greenhouse gas emissions – and once you get beyond shipping, you tap into a much larger pool of people.”   What’s holding software back Despite improved funding access, maritime software developers continue to face several challenges. “The cost of sales is so high that it’s really hard to grow revenues enough to be able to grow and innovate,” said Efstathiou. Customers often aren’t aware of a new software solution until it’s recommended by a business partner. Given that the potential customer base in shipping is thinly stretched and distributed across the globe, cost of sales can be prohibitive.   Another hurdle is the niche nature of ocean shipping. With relatively few potential customers (at least on the vessel interest side of the equation), technology providers “tend towards monopolies because there isn’t enough business to go around, and it can be difficult to launch something new or to innovate if someone has already captured the market,” he said, adding that some software providers in leading positions “would rather build solutions on their own platform than partner up with other vendors.” He believes that such leading players are averse to offering application program interfaces (APIs) that allow data to flow from one software product to another, which can slow progress overall. “The easier software developers make it to integrate with each other versus trying to be ‘the winner’ with the system everyone uses, the more it helps adoption,” he argued. “Today, the concept is to bring technologists to shipping. The danger is that if you don’t understand shipping, you’re going to spin your wheels building software that nobody buys.” The next barrier involves the complicated nature of shipping itself. Shipping operations are highly differentiated – even within the same shipping segment – and “the tools you need and the way you work with a shipping company is very different depending upon how that company matches up ships and cargo.” Efstathiou noted, “A vendor may have a solution that works with its tanker customers and may assume it works with all tanker operators, but that’s not necessarily the case.” Furthermore, from a software developer’s perspective, “shipping know-how is very specific so it’s difficult to scale,” he said. When those with shipping knowledge max out in terms of what they can do on a project, the developer must hire more people with shipping knowledge. “Shipping knowledge is not easily transferable,” he said.   This is a particularly important point given a current shift in the maritime software development business. In the past, software was generally created by people within shipping who were seeking to automate or streamline a process they knew in depth. “They were shipping people first, technologists second,” said Efstathiou. “But today, the concept is to bring technologists into shipping. The danger is that if you don’t understand shipping, you’re going to spin your wheels building software that nobody buys.” Changes on the horizon Efstathiou is optimistic despite the barriers. He told FreightWaves of several areas where he expects new software developments to emerge. The first is blockchain. “People who used to be cautious a few years ago have embraced it,” he said, citing enthusiasm among several very large market participants and predicting blockchain’s implementation in maritime software. Another is digital freight brokerages. He believes physical brokers “will be here for a long time,” but he sees price discovery migrating to digital platforms. Already, Clarksons Cloud has been launched, touting itself as the world’s first end-to-end digital shipping platform. “When you look at Clarksons Cloud, the writing is on the wall. If you’re not a technology-enabled brokerage, you’ll be in big trouble soon,” said Efstathiou.   Big Data and the Internet of Things comprise another software growth area. This will encompass systems for on-board sensors and so-called ‘digital twins’ – digital representations of shipboard systems on land-based computers connected via satellite. Software for ancillary shipping services such as ship finance and insurance could also become more important in the years ahead (this category could compel Efstathiou to revise his landscape infographic and add a fourth pillar). Finally, he highlighted the significant potential for market intelligence and analytics software platforms using AIS data – although he stressed that this will be much more difficult than some market entrants seem to realize. “To do it right you need to pour millions of dollars into building a platform. I see all these startups saying, ‘We bought some AIS data and now we’ll show you what’s happening in world trade.’ But it actually requires a huge amount of capital to do this right.   “There are a large number of players who claim to be doing AIS, and all they’re doing is buying AIS data and creating what they believe to be derivative content, but what they’re essentially selling is AIS data a little bit cheaper than what you’d pay if you went to the satellite guys yourself. If you ask me, those guys aren’t going to be around much longer.” The rise of startups using AIS has led to another inefficiency – a proliferation of ‘geofencing’ (the creation of virtual boundaries to track when vessels enter and leave each area). “You have to geofence the ports and the berths. Every single one of these startups is doing its own geofencing, so you’re creating many different sets of disparate data, with all of them hoping they’re going to win this race. It’s a huge amount of effort to create all these geofences – there’s no open-source geofence list of ports, which would be the smarter way to do it.” Furthermore, just having the AIS ship positioning data itself is not enough. To determine whether a vessel is laden or in ballast, the AIS draft (water depth) data needs to be married with a database of each vessel’s maximum draft. An even more complicated issue is that to analyze a particular company’s fleet position, the AIS system needs to know which ships are in a company’s fleet, which is difficult to automate given that ships are often listed in databases under a different ownership name for tax reasons, and an increasing number of ships are operated under sale-and-leasebacks and are technically owned by leasing houses. “It doesn’t just require a significant amount of capital, it requires a significant amount of understanding to infer the results you’re really looking for,” concluded Efstathiou. “There is a lot of value in shipping market intelligence and analytics. The problem is unlocking it.”","TAGS":"AIS, blockchain shipment, FreightWaves Ocean, Greg Miller, Ocean shipping, Shipping, shipping technology, SkySail, Software, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Greg Miller","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Container Shipping, Maritime, New Tech, News, Shipping, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-06-11T10:30:59-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/transtrategy-partners-hubtek-join-blockchain-in-transport-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/BiTA-Hubtek-Graphic.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"TranStrategy Partners + Hubtek Join Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"With over 16 years of experience developing growth strategies for over 300 companies in the logistics industry in North America, TranStrategy Partners knows how to grow businesses.

Then again, it is also critical to create boundaries around data ownership. Moreover, there are many concerns surrounding privacy. “You see this evolution from companies like Google, Amazon or Facebook holding your data and the privacy issues that come with them trying to protect your data, while giving you the right to hold and share the data with the world when you please. This is important in the context of the world of today and tomorrow, where data is becoming more relevant,” said Markus Levin, co-founder and head of operations at XYO, a crypto-network that anonymously collects and validates geospatial data. Levin contended that dataism had far-reaching consequences in the freight industry, pointing to the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors on trucks that record fertile amounts of data now – reinforcing the need for both data security and data validity. “We call it the truth in data, and a part of what we do at XYO is to tell you if data is true and correct. Let’s say you use a traditional GPS on the truck and thus you aren’t sure if the truck is actually in the said location, or if the temperature within the truck is not above 40 degrees. With our technology, you can verify the data, and we wrap the data in a cryptographically secure way, so that it can’t be tampered,” said Levin.   Levin stressed the need to address data security as IoT devices inherently carry a weak defensive firewall that can be breached by dedicated hackers. Using decentralized ledgers can secure data and every record that passes through the value chain and increase trustability in the system. “Replace trucks with companies like Uber or Lyft, where the system runs based on several ratings and metrics, which helps in understanding driver behavior and traffic flow. We need to make sure our data is attached to the supply chain,” said Levin. For instance, let’s consider an ice cream load that is making its way from the creamery to the warehouse. Temperature conditions inside and outside the truck can be monitored by sensors placed on the vehicle, and this data can be recorded. However, it is equally essential to make sure the database is secure and is not subjected to data falsification by hackers who may alter diverging values. Pushing data to the cloud and storing it in an immutable ledger powered by a decentralized network is essentially a two-act play.   “For brokerages, technology like XYO can help them say with a high degree of certainty that a load is at a specific place. So when a trucker is driving with the load and takes breaks at truck stops, the broker will get to know all that, as we will have our nodes there, more like a checkpoint,” said Levin. “And we can attach this data to other data streams, like how the load is handled, on-time delivery, driver reputation levels and even create a star rating system like in Uber.” Then again, many companies in the freight industry still rely heavily on paper-based operational workflow, leading to a dearth of historical data. Levin explained that XYO could help companies better understand data that is actually of use, set up systems that make data easily mineable, and assist companies to have custody over their data. “Data is not just what you read and put in Excel sheets. There are so many data streams even with small logistics companies that when analyzed, can help them gain insights that get them opportunities in the market pretty easily,” said Levin.

For instance, earlier this week, global container lines CMA CGM and the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) joined TradeLens, the blockchain-based digital shipping platform developed by Maersk and IBM. With this, TradeLens accounts for shipping data of over half the number of container lines that sail across international waters – a remarkable stimulus to the possibilities of blockchain. In April, two economists, Christine McDaniel, trade expert from the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, and Swedish economist Hanna C. Norberg, wrote a research paper on blockchain’s potential to facilitate a more efficient and seamless global trade, arguing blockchain can help expedite customs procedures, reduce expenses and boost both global trade volumes and economic output. “Blockchain technology can be used in any instance where there’s a role for a middleman or an intermediary. As trade economists, we are interested in things that can reduce trade costs, reduce barriers to the flow of information, money, labor, and capital across borders,” said McDaniel. “Blockchain is really exciting as it can facilitate international trade across three areas – trade finance, customs and the provenance of goods.” Though blockchain can be used to render paperwork in freight movement obsolete, McDaniel pointed out that it largely depended on the desire and willingness of government agencies. “Even if you have a company that is ready to utilize blockchain, you still need the relevant government agencies to have the technical infrastructure, the willingness to adapt and a public policy environment that can help fill in the little holes along the way,” she said. “You also can’t just have one company or one government agency to adopt it, but you need enough relevant entities to adopt it. And this doesn’t necessarily happen overnight.”   Nonetheless, the adoption needs to start somewhere, and it can start with creating visibility into logistics operations, by identifying the different stakeholders within a value chain. This can be done through a unique identifier that can be attributed to every stakeholder, thus helping with provenance tracking. McDaniel believed that widespread adoption of blockchain is only possible once the technological infrastructure is built out. “We are talking with Maersk, and they tell us that still over half of their processes are done by hand. A lot of that is just literally checking boxes and confirming shipper identities and cargo content,” she said. “If every container in there had a blockchain code on it, that could be scanned and read into the application of relevant entities, where all the information would be verified as and when it was received, instead of having to go through all those verification steps,” she continued. Aside from being exhaustive, international trade and customs procedures can cause delays in cargo movement, leading to costly detentions. McDaniel stated that the burden of paperwork is not just laborious, but also provides opportunities for corruption. “The hardest part of blockchain is getting it started. The desire to adapt is clearly there, but it needs the government to build up its technological infrastructure, which isn’t trivial,” she said.   When questioned about the need for promoting open blockchain networks within the transportation ecosystem, McDaniel took a more neutral approach, explaining that it is about maximizing the likelihood of people using blockchain rather than reproving proprietary blockchain systems. She trusted that once the technology has found mainstream approval, regulatory bodies could chip in with standards to streamline operations. Nonetheless, open blockchain standards are already being developed. The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), a consortium of over 500 members across the logistics space, has pioneered the development of open blockchain standards that companies can use as a platform for their blockchain needs. “Blockchain is an exciting technology but is at its infancy. There should be no surprise seeing companies starting out with their own proprietary blockchain networks. However, to get the fuller benefits of blockchain, government agencies must enter the discussion and create regulations that will help move forward the interoperability aspect of adopting the technology in international trade,” said McDaniel.

Moller- Maersk (CXE: MAERB) and IBM (NYSE: IBM). TradeLens is an open and neutral blockchain platform that promotes an efficient, transparent and secure exchange of information to improve collaboration between different stakeholders within the supply chain. It has been three years since Maersk and IBM announced TradeLens, developed to create a network of shareholders from within the global commerce space to monitor supply chains end-to-end. Though TradeLens is currently one of the largest logistics blockchain platforms in the world, traction has not come at a pace that the founding companies would have fancied. Industry incumbents have questioned the interests of Maersk and IBM in TradeLens, due to skepticism arising from their “ownership” of a decentralized ledger technology platform. The issue was the lopsided equation of power, with the founding members thought to have a lot more authority over the platform than the rest of the participants. Interestingly, CMA CGM and Hapag-Lloyd criticized the workings of TradeLens in 2018, stating that for a blockchain-based platform to succeed within the industry, it would need to have a common standard.   This probably led CMA CGM to work on creating its own blockchain network, joining ocean liners COSCO Shipping, Evergreen Marine, OOCL and Yang Ming, along with terminal operators DP World, Hutchison Ports, PSA International and the Port of Shanghai, to create the Global Shipping Business Network (GSBN). The GSBN, much like TradeLens, is an open digital platform built over decentralized ledger technology. Nonetheless, with CMA CGM and MSC joining the platform today, TradeLens now accounts for shipping data of over half the number of container lines that sail across international waters. “Digitization is a cornerstone of the CMA CGM Group’s strategy to provide an end-to-end offer tailored to our customers’ needs. We believe that TradeLens, with its commitment to open standards and open governance, is a key platform to help usher in this digital transformation,” said Rajesh Krishnamurthy, Executive Vice President of IT \u0026 Transformations at CMA CGM Group. “TradeLens’ network is already showing that participants from across the supply chain ecosystem can derive significant value.” Though the extent of data that gets shared by CMA CGM and MSC with the TradeLens platform remains to be seen, it can be expected that confidence in the platform has steadily increased since its inception. In an infographic IBM mentioned that the TradeLens platform has published over 500 million discrete shipping events since 2018, and the number is growing by more than 1.5 million every day. Currently, there are over 100 participants in the network, with 20 million containers tracked annually.   “Digital collaboration is key to the evolution of the container shipping industry. The TradeLens platform has enormous potential to spur the industry to digitize the supply chain and build collaboration around common standards,” said André Simha, Chief Digital \u0026 Information Officer, MSC. “We think that the TradeLens Advisory Board, as well as standards bodies such as the Digital Container Shipping Association, will help accelerate that effort.” TradeLens has found good traction lately, with the Saudi customs department successfully sending its first shipment through the platform earlier this month. Maersk and IBM believe that the platform has the potential to improve business models within the industry, and help gain transparency into complex global supply chains. However, for an ideal use case, TradeLens would have to ensure it gets stakeholders from different verticals and nodal points within the supply chain – an exercise that might take time to materialize.

Blockchain’s ability to decentralize information and store it in an immutable ledger accessible by every stakeholder in the value chain can drive industry-wide collaboration and increase supply chain efficiency. The customs department of Saudi Arabia is the latest entrant to the blockchain space, as it successfully piloted its first shipment through TradeLens, a blockchain-based platform developed collaboratively by Maersk and IBM. The shipment departed from the Saudi Arabian port of Damman, setting sail onboard the Maersk Sebarok, and reached the port of Rotterdam, from where it was put on a truck en route to its final destination in Belgium. The relevance of blockchain within international supply chains cannot be stressed enough, because the technology can offer some respite to an industry that traditionally suffers from operational inefficiencies and lack of visibility in cargo movement. Cross-border trade requires shippers and carriers to submit paper documents for customs clearance – a process that takes days or sometimes weeks, based on complexity and load specifications. The paperwork needed to clear import or export goods is exhaustive, leading to businesses scrambling for permits, licenses and declaration statements that need to be submitted to the customs office for their cargo to be cleared. The problem with this process is that the departments that authorize these documents and the ones that verify them work in silos, leading to redundant authentication.   The pilot circumvented this issue by making sure the customer uploaded the commercial invoice and packing list to the TradeLens platform in a structured format, with the export customs broker using the data to submit an export declaration to Saudi customs. Having the shipment information on a verified medium like TradeLens allowed the Saudi customs to access the declaration and register the shipment for clearance. Digitalizing documents and putting them on a decentralized ledger like blockchain will substantially lessen the steps required to push cargo across borders, because it reduces the need for excessive scrutiny at customs as they have greater visibility into the cargo’s provenance and its movement further on. “The shipment was monitored in the TradeLens platform for key shipment events and document milestones. Using blockchain-backed structured documentation, data from the shipment’s documents were analyzed by both the export and import customs authorities and the cargo owners via the platform,” said Saudi customs in a statement. Though the pilot shipment is recent news, the Saudi customs connection to TradeLens materialized at the end of 2018, with the department integrating its electronic data interchange (EDI) system FASAH with TradeLens. FASAH’s objective is to enable seamless data exchange between Saudi customs and exporters and importers.   “To establish the Kingdom as one of the world’s premier logistics hub we needed to create a paradigm shift in the way we handle our shipping processes and explore futuristic approaches with our peer-to-peer business ecosystem worldwide,” said Ahmed Al-Hakbani, Governor of Saudi Customs. “We hope our pilot program will stand the test of time to include other ports as well, and not just the route of exporting, but importing also.

TradeLens is a joint program from Maersk (CXE: MAERB) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) to develop blockchain technology for shipping. The Saudi Customs department announced a shipment left Dammam Port in Saudi Arabia and successfully arrived in Rotterdam on May 13. All the paperwork and data with that shipment was handled by blockchain through TradeLens. “To establish the Kingdom as one of the world’s premier logistics hub we needed to create a paradigm shift in the way we handle our shipping processes and explore futuristic approaches with our peer-to-peer business ecosystem worldwide,” said H.E Mr. Ahmed Al-Hakbani, Governor of Saudi Customs. “We hope our pilot program will stand the test of time to include other ports as well, and not just the route of exporting but importing also.

The shipment’s information was then accessed and used by Saudi Customs to register the clearance. The container was loaded onboard Maersk Sebarok, transshipped in the Port of Tangier and then sent on to Rotterdam, where Dutch Port Community System Portbase provided Dutch Customs release messages and gate-out information directly to the TradeLens platform. Next the container was transported by truck to a location close to Antwerp, Belgium, and its final destination. The entire process was handled through the TradeLens platform using blockchain.

IBM Food Trust is a platform that specifically caters to global food supply chains, leveraging blockchain technology to provide visibility and foster accountability between key stakeholders through an immutable record of food system data. The SSP is a syndicate established in Ecuador, which was created to push the shrimp aquaculture industry to adopt more sustainable means of shrimp farming. This includes better social practices, ensuring higher and uniform product quality, and eliminating the use of antibiotics in shrimp cultivation. Over the last couple of years, the IBM Food Trust has seen considerable success, with several consortiums and large food industry players joining the blockchain network to refine their logistics operations. FreightWaves had an email conversation with Lou Izquierdo, global sales lead at IBM Food Trust, to better understand the partnership between SSP and IBM on shrimp cultivation. “SSP does an incredible job of providing its downstream supply chain partners with traceability data for its shrimp products. By using Food Trust, its members will be doing so in a more distributed, secure and immutable fashion,” said Izquierdo. “For SSP, being able to prove the authenticity of its shrimp products is critical, as Ecuadorian shrimp is renowned for its superior quality and taste.”   Shrimp cultivation is a business that has found new legs in recent times, especially as production can be micromanaged from within aquaculture farms and are not left to the vagaries of marine fishing. Shrimp demand is further fueled by the rise in demand for protein, which is set to double by 2050 with the population expected to hit 9 billion by then. Southeast Asian countries have taken particular interest in shrimp aquaculture, but the shrimps that they produce are often of average quality – an end-product resulting from a market that focuses on commoditizing shrimp and rewarding businesses that prioritize quantity over quality. SSP advocates for a sustainable future of the shrimp industry, with the produce farmed without antibiotics. “It is a premium product recognized throughout the world, and now each batch can prove that quality; which translates to premium price and benefits everyone in the supply chain, all the way back to the farmers,” said Izquierdo. Pamela Nath, director at SSP, stated that the goal of the consortium was to ensure supermarkets and restaurants sell premium quality shrimp, while consumers are assured visibility to the crustaceans’ farming conditions by scanning the QR codes embedded on shrimp packaging. “We want to ensure consumers have confidence in these commitments by providing complete accountability. We believe traceability is the future of responsible aquaculture, and we are keen to pave the way for others to follow,” she said.   In many ways, the partnership between SSP and IBM Food Trust is a crucial step forward in the seafood industry. Izquierdo explained that fraud prevention, traceability and sustainability were three of the biggest challenges that food supply chains contend with, and blockchain technology can provide a way forward in addressing them all. “We expect that SSP’s supply chain partners – and ultimately end consumers – will benefit tremendously from this important initiative,” he said.

At the BiTA Spring Symposium, Agoric CEO Dean Tribble launched into a thorough, fast-paced discussion of the development of and potential for smart contracts in transportation and logistics. Tribble has been working on the automation of business functions and transactions since the late 1980s, especially in the area of secure communications and payments, spending more than nine years at Microsoft as a Principal Architect from 2003 to 2012. The ultimate vision for smart contracts, Tribble said, is to bring the entire economy of the world online.   “A smart contract is a contract-like agreement, expressed in code, where the behavior of the program enforces the terms of the contract,” Tribble said by way of defining the term ‘smart contract.’ The fundamental value proposition of a smart contract is that it reduces the cost of trust, according to Tribble. The documentation and verification and compliance procedures associated with establishing trust between entities who want to do business with each other – think of a freight broker processing bills of lading, rate confirmations, checking carrier safety scores, et cetera – are a pure cost. Establishing trust does not add value, but rather it protects value from being lost, Tribble argued. In the global economy, establishing trust costs about 35 percent of GDP. Automating and decentralizing trust-establishing processes could increase global GDP by 5 percent and grow global trade by 15 percent, Tribble said, citing a recent World Trade Organization analysis. “Blockchains provide high integrity to data and choices,” Tribble said. “A smart contract reduces the cost of creating arrangements with people that you can rely on. That’s the game-changer; that’s one of the reasons why people are so deeply excited about this.”   Transportation-specific use cases for smart contracts include driver credential verification (authentication); chain of custody transitions (data); payment in shipping transactions (currency conversion); automated (partial) payment release; automated accounts receivable loans for completed delivery; and links to associated financial transactions. Those uses cases are interdependent and build on each other, though, Tribble said, so they have to be developed and implemented in a specific sequence. “Until you do chain of custody, you can’t really do automated payment of delivery,” Tribble reasoned.   Trucking transportation is already massively decentralized, with hundreds of thousands of players – the permutations of all their customer and partner relationships quickly reaches astronomically high numbers. That decentralization drives very high costs of trust in trucking and trucking-related logistics services, but at the same time, results in an industry that is already structured to run a blockchain network of distributed nodes. Fortunately, as Tribble pointed out, it’s not ‘all or nothing’ with smart contracts. The industry does not have to choose between total and irreversible automation or archaic, completely manual transaction processes. “In a hybrid smart contract, the arrangement includes both code and prose,” Tribble explained. “The code portions are enforced by the smart contract system, while the prose portions are enforced by people.” In a hypothetical example of a trucking carrier deciding how to route their assets through inclement weather in the Rocky Mountains, Tribble said that a weather ‘oracle’ might make the initial determination about the best route. An oracle is an agent that finds and verifies real-world occurrences and submits the data to the blockchain – it could be an RSS feed of ESPN reporting a basketball game score, or, in this case, a severe winter weather warning issued by the National Weather Service. A smart contract that helps route trucks and ensures that risk and efficiency are being balanced correctly might take an input from a weather oracle, but then also include a hook to a decentralized community of weather experts, one of whom would earn micro-compensation for checking the automated decision and either approving it or modifying it.   “In 99 percent of cases,” Tribble said, “the automated system will make a decision and it will be fine, but in that one case out of 100 where it matters, or where ‘I saw this 20 years ago, what’s really going is this,’ he can make the call as the expert and make an exception. Now all those human audit processes that said the package took longer because John made the wrong call – now we only have to engage that process in one out of 100 shipments instead of all of them.” But Tribble said that blockchain developers have aspirations that go even beyond hooks to individual experts. “I want to go to a worldwide community of 1,000 weather experts, and they’ll vote,” Tribble said. “Now I have no moral hazard” associated with relying on one person’s potentially biased or compromised judgment. Tribble said that the blockchain industry already has projects like that where, for example, risk analysis for loans is crowd-sourced and produces better and less biased results. Tribble ended his talk with a series of axioms about why private blockchains are not the answer: they don’t leveraged shared services and resources; they don’t leverage the reduced cost of trust; and they don’t enable combinatorial growth across industries. “The diverse, vibrant world economy needs high integrity computation, a security model that works for software components, broad scope and interoperability with other chains,” Tribble concluded.

Now the relationship is growing deeper: yesterday, an IBM executive reported on his company’s research into blockchain for transportation to BiTA’s members. BiTA is a member-led industry organization dedicated to building open-source and royalty-free data standards for blockchain in the transportation and logistics industry. At Thursday’s BiTA Spring Symposium, which followed Transparency19 in Atlanta, IBM’s vice president of blockchain initiatives for the supply chain Stephen Rogers spoke to the assembled membership and working groups. IBM has already proven its leadership in the ‘blockchain for the supply chain’ space. FreightWaves reported on TradeLens, IBM and Maersk’s joint project to solve inefficiencies in container shipping last August; at roughly the same time IBM opened up IBM Food Trust, which began as a pilot project to create visibility into Walmart’s leafy green supply chain. “It took a year between the business side and legal side to get here. The legal side kept saying there are risks, there are risks, but we’re here, and that makes me the happiest person in the world,” Rogers began. IBM’s in-house research institute, the Institute of Business Value (IBV), has created a virtual library of research reports on blockchain, many of them pertaining to the supply chain. Rogers presented the results of the IBV’s recent research.   One of the more interesting claims that Rogers made early in the talk concerned the relationship between blockchain and the internet of things (IoT)—he said that distinction would start to blur. “In five years, blockchain will be the operating system for IoT,” Rogers predicted. The transportation industry faces many challenges, but has a long history of resisting all but the most essential innovations, Rogers argued. Those challenges include physical and digital threats in security, inefficiencies in logistics tracking and payment due to intermediaries, uncertainty and volatility resulting in unforeseen circumstances, and first movers and digital giants entering market and challenging the status quo. Then Rogers began outlining the results of a large survey of transportation industry executives. The requirements to be a respondent included the following: respondents were limited to the CFO, COO, CTO, and CIO roles; their organizations must be working with or planning to work with blockchain; and the respondents must be familiar with their organization’s blockchain strategy. The survey results included input from executives from 16 countries, and about a third were based in North America.   Although transportation executives believe that they will begin actively participating in blockchain networks on a slightly later time scale than other industries (2020 rather than 2019, the average of other industries the IBV has studied), more executives in transportation said they would be on the blockchain than any other industry. The first wave of industries studied included banking, financial markets, healthcare, government, and electronics. A little more than half of those executives—53 percent—said that they would be active participants on a blockchain by 2019. But 70 percent of transportation executives said they would be active participants on a blockchain by 2020. Rogers said that he spoke to an executive at a medium-sized trucking company who said “I’m not going to blockchain anybody, but I think there’s a lot of people who want to blockchain me.” In other words, the executive believed that while his company would not necessarily be an agent of change, he felt like other companies would be knocking on his door and trying to get him to join their networks.   When transportation executives were asked which business functions had the highest potential to be improved through blockchain implementation, 26 percent said shipment status or tracking, 21 percent said payment processing, 20 percent said empty container management, and 20 percent said shipment security management. About 15 percent of industry participants are ‘first movers’ in the adoption of any new technology, and transportation is similar: 14 percent considered themselves first movers. A nearly unanimous majority of self-identified first movers in transportation — 97 percent — agreed with the statement that they expect blockchain to help remove transactional inefficiencies from the transportation ecosystem. Rogers identified other potential use cases for blockchain in the supply chain, noting ruefully that the amount of organic food sold in the United States was about twice the amount that was produced in the U.S. or imported. The implication was that immutable ledgers recording the actual conditions under which food was grown, harvested, and transported could reduce fraud. Other topics covered in Rogers’ talk included reducing supply chain waste from empty containers, accelerating payment cycles, and chain of custody verification for high-value shipments like biopharmaceuticals and luxury goods. Rogers ended his talk by outlining three basic pieces of advices for companies who want to explore blockchain technology. “Learn intentionally; invest wisely; disrupt strategically,” Rogers said. ““Leaders will dedicate resources to proven blockchain improvements, but transformation requires enterprise-wide investment in fundamentals, including digitizing and instrumenting transport operations.”  ","TAGS":"BiTA, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Food Trust, IBM, TradeLens, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Paul Hampstead","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, New Tech, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-05-10T07:30:13-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain-research-institute-tells-stories-of-technological-transformation-on-global-scale","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bita-11.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain Research Institute tells stories of transformation on global scale","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The Blockchain Research Institute (BRI) and Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) announced a partnership to support members of both organizations in their efforts to build a collaborative network of leaders in blockchain technology last September. BRI Managing Director Hilary Carter spoke at this week’s BiTA Spring Symposium in Atlanta, offering members insight into how the research institute operates. “To be present at a meeting where organizations, competitors within a single industry, are coming together to create standards is music to my ears, and it is what we have been waiting for for a number of years,” Carter said. “There’s so much skepticism and negativity with the term blockchain, and to see leaders coming together to create new opportunities is fantastic.” Don and Alex Tapscott, authors of internationally-acclaimed, “Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin Is Changing Money, Business, and the World,” founded BRI in 2017. The organization was founded to investigate blockchain transformations.   The organization has already seen blockchain technology come a long way since its inception. “To see the evolution of blockchain turning into a team sport is incredibly satisfying. When the institute was founded, it was an incredible struggle to find real use cases,” Carter said. “There were maybe a dozen, and those who were working with the technology were not exactly willing to talk about it for obvious reasons. A lot of the information was proprietary.” Carter is encouraged by the use cases she has seen popping up across the air and trucking industries more recently. “What we do is take those stories, if you will, and we publish them to a global audience,” she said. “These are deep insights that can help others understand why this technology is so transformational, what efficiencies it creates and friction it helps overcome.”   When BRI begins to research transformations, the institute’s leaders start out by asking serval critical questions like: Why blockchain? How would blockchain technology solve some of the organization’s most pressing problems?   What are the implementation challenges? What are the opportunities? What are the regulatory hurdles we have to overcome? The organization creates reports about blockchain’s impact on transportation, logistics and supply chain management. The reports are meant to help decision makers at various organizations understand the value of investing resources into blockchain technology. “Our reports are designed to help individuals who are non-technical to better understand the opportunities,” Carter said. “When these things are explained in plain language, it makes everyone’s job a little easier.”   Carter was clear that BRI’s focus goes beyond simply exploring how Fortune 500 companies are using blockchain technology to solve problems. “It is one thing for an organization to use blockchain technology to solve certain problems,” she said. “It is another thing to understand who the competitor of the future will be and pinpoint the initiatives that are being built today that will radically change the competitive landscape of tomorrow.” Once blockchain becomes incorporated into an organization’s life, it will reshape it, according to Carter. She believes blockchain technology, along with disrupting industries and enterprises, will also shake up the firms that implement it. The technology could have the power to change everything, from hiring practices to marketing spend. At the heart of blockchain is the ability to source problems quickly, respond instantly and reduce waste in the economy. If companies can figure out how to utilize the technology to do just that, their reshaping may just be inevitable. “We believe that blockchain plays an important role in the fourth industrial revolution,” Carter said. “It will be the underlying platform that underpins all the other technologies.”   ","TAGS":"BiTA, BiTA Spring Symposium 2019, Blockchain, Blockchain Revolution, BRI, Hilary Carter, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ashley Coker Prince","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, New Tech, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-05-10T07:00:08-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/patrick-duffy-named-president-of-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Patrick-Duffy.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Patrick Duffy named President of BiTA","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Patrick Duffy was named the President of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), effective May 3, 2019. BiTA is holding its 2019 Spring Symposium today (May 9) in Atlanta. In a letter to the BiTA Board of Directors, Duffy stated that “BiTA, and particularly the Standards Council Board, represents the most innovative companies operating within the supply chain industry. I’m committed to seeing BiTA enable valuable commercial outcomes for its members through the development and publication of open-source and royalty free data standards.” Duffy continued, “Since its inception, BiTA and its members, have undertaken the audacious task of defining the data standards to govern technology which enables the flow of goods and services powering the world’s economy.”   Duffy deeply believes that the world is a supply chain, and that data standards run civilizations. He joined the BiTA team from the trade publication American Shipper and its sister data company, ComPair Data, where he was Research Director and Senior Consultant, respectively. “I’m so excited to collaborate with our amazing member community to catalyze the digitization of legacy analog processes and accelerate the development and adoption of data standards for supply chain and transportation industries,” Duffy said. Duffy was quick to recognize that BiTA has been a collaborative effort among many individuals. Duffy wanted to recognize the founder and visionary CEO of FreightWaves, Craig Fuller, and Ken Craig, Vice President of Special Projects for McLeod Software, who launched BiTA in 2017; Arlen Stark, the BiTA Chief of Staff, for taking the idea of BiTA and running with it; Chris Burruss, the first BiTA Standards Council President, for laying the groundwork for the acceleration of standards development processes; and Dale Chrystie, the first Chairman of the BiTA Standards Council Board, for his willingness to strategize and take BiTA to the next level; and BiTA’s members, who make all of this possible. “Without their vision and leadership, we could not be embarking on this next phase of BiTA’s journey to redefine interoperability across supply chain and transportation technologies, setting the stage to unlock tremendous value globally,” Duffy concluded.

Hosts Chad Prevost and John Kingston kicked things off from both the SiriusXM studios in Rockefeller Center in downtown Manhattan, and from the Freight Alley studio in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Quotable from Chris Kirchner, CEO and co-founder of Slync.io: “I made 17 trips internationally this past year. I’ve been to Asia, and spent a lot of time in Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and the people that you meet are incredible. Yeah, logistics isn’t one of those industries that you necessarily think about growing up, but once you get into it it’s hard to leave because it’s so dynamic and fascinating, and the challenges and opportunities you have to do pretty cool stuff is just abundant in all ways, shapes and forms.” Quotable from Gary Buchs, driver for Landstar and industry thought leader:   “I don’t follow the norm a lot of times that’s been preached to us: drive more miles and you’ll make more money. I try to work on economic efficiency.” Quotable from Tim Dooner, multimedia specialist at FreightWaves: “It’s not a new story. We’re seeing carriers fail every week. We’re seeing consolidation happen. I mean there’s a countdown to extinction happening for companies that don’t adapt.” Quotable from Preet Sivia, chief business officer and co-founder of Parade.ai:   “We want to make sure that the information is remembered [beyond emails] so that the experience is better every single time.” Quotable from Dean Croke, chief insights officer at FreightWaves: “If you’re a trucker, there’s two seasons, there’s winter and there’s construction.

Though retail businesses working within the food niche like Walmart or Carrefour have shown interest in decentralized solutions (blockchain is a decentralized ledger), this appears to be the first initiative where a company tests a decentralized AI solution. “Our newest transformation effort is occurring in our operations function, where we are automating significant portions of our delivery operations and consolidating our operations centers. SingularityNET’s AI algorithms and services will allow us to explore these efficiencies at scale,” said Ba U Shan-Ting, the CEO of Domino’s Malaysia and Singapore operations, in a statement. Though Shan-Ting did not explicitly mention the use of blockchain or a decentralized ledger in his statement, the connection to the technology comes from SingularityNET’s infrastructure. SingularityNET is a full-stack AI solution that is powered by a decentralized protocol with the goal to provide people the possibility of creating, sharing and monetizing AI services at scale. For now, all that we can deduce from Shan-Ting’s statement is that the company is working to improve its last-mile logistics, but it could be anyone’s guess on the specifics of the “automation.” However, based on Domino’s history of innovation, it is reasonable to expect the company to step beyond technical jargon and bring decentralized AI networks to mainstream attention within the food logistics space.   Domino’s former CEO Patrick Doyle caught the attention of the industry when he insisted that Domino’s was primarily a tech company that sold pizzas. The company understood early on that one of the biggest costs to the business was delivery, and it has consistently attempted to drive down delivery costs while increasing customer satisfaction. For instance, the company introduced Domino’s Delivery Hotspots in the U.S. last year, that allow the company to deliver food to unexpected locations with hard-to-locate addresses – like beaches, parks and parking lots. Customers find nearby drop-off points using their smartphones, where they can coordinate with Domino’s to receive their order. “We know that delivery is all about convenience, and Domino’s Hotspots are all about flexible delivery options,” Russell Weiner, COO and president of Domino’s Americas, said during the feature’s unveiling. The new partnership will help Domino’s leverage SingularityNET’s AI algorithms that can enhance the pizza chain’s operational capabilities and possibly open new frontiers and opportunities for the company to improve customer satisfaction levels in Malaysia and Singapore. The push towards technology is critical to the success of Domino’s as it has continued to surprise investors with remarkable growth. On the back of 30 consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth, Domino’s became the largest pizza chain in terms of annual sales in the U.S., even when second-placed Pizza Hut has about 2,000 more domestic storefront outlets. The company now expects to hit $25 billion in revenue by 2025, which would be more than double what it did in 2017.   “Embracing AI is what every company is going to need to do if they are going to succeed and flourish in the coming period. The projects we are discussing with Domino’s now are envisioned as the start of a long series of creative and transformative AI collaborations. We are proud to embark on a future partnership with Domino’s to achieve their ambition of becoming the leader in pizza delivery and customer brand loyalty by 2020,” said Ben Goertzel, CEO of SingularityNET.

This is a breakthrough discussion. This is a different way to think about how global clearance looks in the future,” said Dale Chrystie, FedEx business strategist and blockchain fellow, during Blockchain Revolution Global conference in Toronto on April 25. Chrystie, also chair of the Blockchain in Transportation Alliance (BiTA) Standards Council, joined Eugene Laney, head of international government affairs for DHL USA and Mahesh Sahasranaman, Principal Architect, UPS Supply Chain Solutions, in a discussion with Don Tapscott, Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute (BRI), which is based in Canada. “This is really happening,” Tapscott said, making light of executives from the rival parcel carriers appearing together.  The three executives agreed that there is a collective interest in embracing uniform standards and getting governments on board with blockchain technology. “This is an issue that must be looked at with a global viewpoint,” Chrystie said. “These dots are going to connect. The question is how are you going to accelerate that process.” Customs clearance is an area where blockchain can play an important role, one that requires making governments part of the conversation. Laney pointed to the long lines of trucks at the U.S.-Mexico border as an example of where blockchain, with the use of digital fingerprints, could improve the backlog. “How can we take all those standards and share the best way we can with each other – and share with governments that are part of that supply chain?” Laney said.  “Blockchain is a team sport; no one company today completes customer supply chain shipments by itself,” Laney remarked after the panel. “As such, there is a real need for an open and standardized version of blockchain to be shared by all shipping participants.” Sahasranaman discussed the need to “wrangle the standards” to avoid fragmentation. “Standards bodies like BiTA and BRI help that conversation, to move it forward,” Sahasranaman said. He continued, “Collaboration to create standards, ensure that standards are agreed upon, and further ensure those can be used as designed on the blockchain platform is essential for a multi-party supply chain environment.” Sahasranaman pointed out after the discussion that “The supply chain panel between UPS, FedEx and DHL should stand out as an example – that organizations regardless of how hard they compete, must seek to collaborate in areas that would maximize benefits from this technology to all supply chain participants.”  Chrystie stressed the need for blockchain standards to be open source. “We don’t think you get to a global supply chain blockchain without doing that [open source standards],” Chrystie said. “We need to come to get to agree how we can do that.” Laney stated after the panel that, “DHL Express has mastered tracking and tracing single supply chain transactions, but it can be challenging for some companies to fully manage their goods from production to final delivery. Along with other key elements, such as IoT and RFID tags attached to packages, blockchain would improve visibility, not only for shippers but also for customers who could watch in real-time as parts move through their manufacturing lifecycle.” Laney also commented on the use of blockchain to solve significant issues. He said, “Governments often ask manufacturers and their supply chain participants to ensure that dangerous and counterfeit goods can be detected and stopped. We see the application of blockchain as a way to help us solve these issues to secure transportation networks and stem the tide of counterfeit goods.” Tapscott applauded the three executives as “wonderful examples how you need to think big, have integrity and be considerate of the interest of the global economy when you set out to embrace new technology.”  Tapscott said after the discussion, “To fully realize the potential of this second era of the internet, companies will need to coordinate and collaborate on a scale they’ve never done before. The BRI’s goal is to bring industry leaders together, inform them and inspire them to work together and achieve this blockchain revolution. I know BiTA shares that goal as well.” Sahasranaman complimented BRI and the panel, stating, “This event was unique starting from the stage layout of the event, the broad topic areas that covered – different industry groups/sectors, governance, standards and technologies and the overall content with engaging discussion.” In summary, Tapscott stated, “Blockchain Revolution Global had many ‘firsts,’ and bringing together UPS, DHL and FedEx on a single panel was one of the most exciting. It really speaks to the leadership and vision of these companies that they can acknowledge this new paradigm, and work together to build a common framework for the future.” ","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Blockchain Research Institute, DHL, FedEx, UPS, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nate Tabak","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Borderlands: Canada, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-04-30T18:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/jj-keller-associates-inc-joins-blockchain-in-transport-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/BiTA-JJKeller.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"J.J.

These include traceability, safety and transparency for all stakeholders within a supply chain. A panel of speakers from the pharmaceutical, food and retail industries at the Blockchain Expo 2019 discussed the feasibility and the need for blockchain within their verticals. Udai Kiran Chilamkurthi, lead architect in the retail \u0026 logistics division at Sainsbury’s, drew on his experience in the supply chain business, mentioning that Sainsbury’s as a company was not looking to innovate in blockchain but rather was interested in consuming a blockchain-based solution that is tailor-made for the enterprise space. He pointed out that companies in the retail landscape were looking to use blockchain, but were struggling to find stakeholders to work with, because the technology still has not gained the trust of its intended users. Raja Sharif, founder \u0026 CEO of FarmaTrust, chipped in saying that the pharmaceutical market was bizarre in its workings. Although the industry was fairly innovative when it came to research on new medical breakthroughs, it did not take well to sharing data and is conservative in its approach to blockchain. The problem is with trust, as pharmaceutical companies are wary about data security even in a tightly regulated environment. Data held within the industry is highly confidential and if leaked, might cause the company legal and/or regulatory problems. Sharif mentioned that FarmaTrust tackled this issue by anchoring data – a process of creating time-stamped proofs of the existence of data through blockchain – convincing customers who were skeptical of maintaining their data confidentiality. Sharif contended that the pharmaceutical industry must look to push for a truly paperless environment. The industry still witnesses manual entries of data and companies within the space collect data individually and operate in a siloed manner. Bringing all of them together would be for the collective good of the industry, because consolidated data could help companies glean more insights towards drug discovery.  Emmanuel Marchal, the managing director at ConsenSys, spoke about how the term decentralization is often misconstrued within the supply chain industry and that blockchain essentially was bringing everyone together and helping share information over a single common ledger. This is especially beneficial for smaller companies within the supply chain, as they can now participate more directly within the system and would have greater visibility within end-to-end operations. Companies are also cautious about putting their data out on a public blockchain, said Leontien Hasselman-Plugge, CEO of SIM Supply Chain Information Management. Businesses need to be shown metrics on how blockchain is worth the effort to switch over, especially when they are in the stage to scale-up operations. Hasselman-Plugge explained how supply chains for different food products are essentially incompatible with the other, and that it is extremely hard to put every single food item on the blockchain. For instance, a supermarket might have thousands of food products that are sourced from all over the world, and in the process of creating a blockchain network, every product would have to have a separate system for itself – a process that is out of reach, at least for the time being. The endgame, Hasselman-Plugge mentioned, was to make sure companies joined a public blockchain as only that could give them true decentralization and benefit all the stakeholders equally. Interoperability is also a key to nourishing the idea of blockchain, as interconnecting networks across different verticals would help create use cases that have never been thought out before.","TAGS":"Blockchain, food chain, logistics, panel discussion, pharmaceutical, Supply chain, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-04-26T21:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/blockchain-expo-2019-interoperability","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shutterstock_407769136.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain Expo 2019 – interoperability is the need of the hour within the blockchain ecosystem","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain has been heavily piloted across the breadth of supply chains over the last couple of years, but one aspect that is still desired is the possibility of interoperability between different blockchain networks. In an ideal world where blockchain has significant mainstream adoption, interoperability would be crucial because it would bring unrelated blockchain networks together, thus making a variety of services and data accessible across several stakeholders. At the Blockchain Expo 2019, a panel discussed the importance of interoperability in the blockchain landscape and the issues that need to be overcome to create interlinked blockchain networks. Dean Croke, chief insights officer at the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), spoke about BiTA’s founding two years ago to foster blockchain adoption within supply chain operations and to create open data standards on which solutions could be built. “BiTA was formed with a view to not repeat the same mistakes the industry made with B2B communication methods,” he said. Though there have been standards developed for B2B communication, they have never had mainstream success. Companies ignored the standards and opted for customized data protocols that could not sync with the way data was collected by competitors in the market, leading to a disconnect between stakeholders, and making it impossible for meaningful data sharing to materialize. Companies working in blockchain today are primarily motivated by the advantages it could potentially bring for the first movers. In many ways, early adoption and experimentation were caused by the fear of missing out (FOMO), which played a vital role in bringing stakeholders to the table to discuss standards and how they could benefit from a streamlined ecosystem. Harry Mylonadis, head of technology \u0026 innovation at ENGIE International Facilities Management, argued that companies want to buy into the premise of blockchain as it helps them get visibility into provenance and the history of a product’s movement across the supply chain. It also helps with trust issues as the data that comes into the system has reliability, which is critical if stakeholders in a value chain are to work together.  “The development of open standards across industries is one of the main goals, and consortiums like BiTA are at the heart of the efforts,” said Matthieu Lux, senior blockchain consultant at Deloitte Ventures’ UK Blockchain Studio. Data governance and standardization is the first step towards creating interoperability between companies across different niches, especially long-time market incumbents that are new to the technology space. Trusting a single blockchain network might be relatively easy for companies, considering the prospect that broader interlinked blockchain networks bring to the table. Lux explained that interoperable blockchains have stakeholders from radically different niches who are providing data and also seeking data – making it a lot more complex to authenticate and certify. Companies fear a breach of trust within the system which could potentially jeopardize their market standing. Croke spoke on how paperwork and the lack of interoperability within existing systems create delays for people and freight moving across borders. He cited the delays that are caused at the ports when paperwork is misplaced or lost. And even without delays caused by unfortunate circumstances, freight still sits at the port for many days, as authorities wait for shipping information and government document approval. Though blockchain does advantages, there are situations within supply chains where it still cannot help. For instance, blockchain has found several use cases within the global food supply chain, but it is still unclear on how technology can help attest to the type of feed a farmer gives to his farm or livestock. Tracking, at the moment, can only go so far in keeping a tab on food produce movement within the supply chain, but is by no means pervasive. That apart, the very real problem that impedes blockchain adoption is convincing companies to work together to create a common and open data standard for blockchain solutions. “This is a challenge, because it is about getting people to think of fixing something that they believe is not broken,” said Croke. Data standard isolation is a problem. Though the railroad, air and maritime industries have developed standards in the past, none of them are interoperable. Croke explained that BiTA was trying to consolidate every standard within the logistics realm, which will drive efficiency and seamless freight movement. He pointed out that this is not an easy venture, nor something that can be achieved in a short time span. “If you think of the evolution of cloud storage, it took about 10 years for companies to move from using ERP to pushing data to the cloud. I think it is going to take time for companies to migrate to blockchain networks, just like with every other major tech development,” he said. “We believe the maturation of this technology will happen by 2025. We see hurdles like lack of involvement, but we know we have a better way and it is about convincing them to come on board.”","TAGS":"BiTA Standards, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, data standards, dean croke, EDI standards, interoperability, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-04-26T14:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/blockchain-expo-2019-blockchain-relevance-in-provenance-tracking","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shutterstock_712558591.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain Expo 2019 – blockchain’s relevance in provenance tracking and operational transparency","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"At the Blockchain Expo Global 2019, a panel discussed blockchain solutions for increasing transparency, profitability and provenance in supply chains across a variety of markets. Nitin Manoharan, head of enterprise architecture \u0026 technology innovation at Philip Morris International, spoke on the importance of looking at the enterprise viability of blockchain. He cited the World Economic Forum’s estimate that 10 percent of the global GDP would be stored on blockchain by 2027. Though Manoharan agreed that the technology had not progressed enough to be adopted by enterprises now, he advocated for the need for companies to experiment with the technology, get key stakeholders on board, and work on pilot programs to see if it could help make their operations leaner and more efficient. Sylvie Gleises, CEO of continental Europe for AXA ART, was generally skeptical about the use of blockchain in the art industry that her company is part of. The art industry is quite small, considering the number of sellers and buyers in the ecosystem, and has typically been against disruption of any kind. Gleises explained that in the art industry there are cases of counterfeit artwork making its way into the market, and companies usually insure their artwork to safeguard themselves from fraud. Gleises hoped that if blockchain could help find a way to address the issue of counterfeit artwork and even the associated money laundering, it would help insurance companies immensely. The problem, though, is not with the technology but with the way it could be implemented on artwork track-and-trace. For instance, if blockchain was used to track the provenance of a $30 million Rembrandt art piece, there would be a need to place a physical tracker on the artwork to make sure it is not replaced by any fraudulent means. However, Gleises was quick to point out that this is impossible, as physical trackers put on artwork would likely damage it, which is a risk that no art agency or potential buyer would be willing to take.  Marc Taverner, global ambassador at Bitfury, a blockchain technology company, substantiated Gleises’ argument, saying that “blockchain just for the sake of blockchain has zero value.” Before a company looks to work on blockchain, it needs to perceive the use case blockchain has for its operations – for instance, helping capture an adjacent market, solving issues with trust and provenance, and even tackling inefficiencies within supply chains. Taverner cited a pilot project that Bitfury successfully worked on with the government of the Republic of Georgia, where land registered within the country was put on the blockchain. Though this was an exercise done primarily to increase trust between citizens and the government, the end result showed a 90 percent reduction in operating costs, and a substantial decrease in time taken to register from many days to 10 minutes. Manoharan debated the idea of working on blockchain just for the sake of it, mentioning that he has worked on a few such projects at Philip Morris that were primarily about finding a solution and then looking for a problem. “The issue is no one understands the full potential of blockchain, as there are multiple layers that you need to understand. I call this technology for technology’s sake,” he said. One of the first blockchain projects undertaken at Philip Morris was two years ago, involving the provenance of electronic devices that had multiple components manufactured and supplied by different stakeholders. In general, when such a device is damaged, it takes about six weeks to do the root cause analysis, as tracking down all the Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers, the specific product batches and the logistics providers is too hard a task. Though blockchain was used in the pilot program, it did not live up to expectations. The technology was not scaled enough for the type of transactions involved in tracking the provenance of electronic goods. But today, blockchain is a more advanced and use cases are cropping up every day within the niche segment, promising accurate provenance tracking.  All of the panel members agreed that one of the primary reasons delaying commercial blockchain adoption is the need to build trust between stakeholders and market competitors – a situation that is especially true within the supply chain industry. If a manufacturer wants to build a blockchain solution for the greater good of the industry, then there is a good chance that other companies in the supply chain opt out of it, as they fear that the data they share might be used to their competitor’s advantage. Taverner pointed out that even if companies work around their differences and create a blockchain solution, there still would be an issue with deciding who gets ownership of the system and the right to intellectual property. Companies are also wary of closed blockchain networks, like the Maersk-owned TradeLens. Maersk and its partner IBM are having trouble inducing stakeholders into the network. Companies dislike the idea of a single organization having greater control over the system than the rest of the participants, and thus would instead opt for an open network. Standardization is the need of the day, and industry incumbents will have to partner with consortiums like the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), to create open standards that can be used universally – creating true transparency and visibility into supply chain operations.","TAGS":"BiTA, BiTA Standards, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-04-25T20:30:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/datapace-is-latest-blockchain-in-transport-alliance-member","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/BiTA-Datapace.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Datapace is latest Blockchain in Transport Alliance member","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Datapace, a blockchain-powered data marketplace with technical and policy-based data verification that has access to a worldwide network of sensors, has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). Datapace is headquartered at Bell Labs in Villarceaux, France. Blockchain technology is game-changing and transformational, benefiting companies and organizations that need accountability, scale, trust and security in their business processes, especially those that involve external collaboration and interaction in the transportation, logistics and supply chain marketplaces. The technology enables users to identify and track transactions digitally as well as share information across a distributed network of computers. For the transportation and logistics industries, blockchain provides the opportunity to more effectively track goods and freight across the supply chain. Blockchain also will allow transportation and logistics companies to operate in a more seamless and transparent manner. It can also help create new revenue streams and value for customers by enabling a system to complete transactions, track shipments and manage fleets. “Datapace is excited to become a member of BiTA,” said Datapace CEO and Co-Founder George Saleh. “BiTA is promoting the value and potential of blockchain and educating the industry about the technology while also harnessing the expertise of its members to develop best practices and standards,” Saleh continued. “We sincerely hope that Datapace will contribute to the BiTA community. As a company, Datapace is dedicated to unlocking the enormous value of data. Datapace has a decentralized marketplace platform, access to precise granular, localized weather data from a dense global network of telecommunication base stations sensors, and blockchain and smart contracts technology that can be utilized to enhance performance across the entire supply chain and transport systems,” Saleh explained.  BiTA President Chris Burruss said, “On behalf of the members of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance, I welcome Datapace into the BiTA community. With its blockchain-powered data marketplace, Datapace provides the secure and automated exchange and monetization of the internet of things (IoT), digital and other kinds of data. The expertise of Datapace’s staff will be welcome as BiTA continues to develop standards and promotes blockchain use cases.” Datapace offers blockchain powered secure transactions and automated smart contracts to sell and buy data streams. The Datapace data marketplace can be used to stream data from any source – IoT devices, physical assets, autonomous cars, drones and many more. It enables companies to integrate third-party data and monetize it through the same marketplace. Datapace was founded in 2017 as a startup at the NOKIA Digital Innovation Accelerator by Saleh and Drasko Draskovic, two Nokia professionals. Datapace is the intersection of their interests, experience, technology preferences and passions. Saleh was working on five continents on telecommunication technologies, while Draskovic was involved in hardware and software open source projects in the IoT domain. Their initiative coincided with the establishment of NOKIA’s sensing-as-a-service platform, providing additional key features and a powerful differentiator for Datapace.

The Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA), comprised of Maersk (Nasdaq OMX: MAER.B), Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), Hapag-Lloyd (XETRA: HLAG), and Ocean Network Express (ONE) said it is officially open after the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission gave its permission to allow the carriers to talk amongst themselves. The DCSA is the official name of an initiative announced last year to help spur digital standards in the ocean freight industry. The earlier project included CMA CGM, which is not listed as a member of the DCSA. But Thomas Bagge, the Chief Executive of DCSA, said the group is open to anyone. Thomas Bagge “We have 50 percent of the world’s container trade represented in the group currently and we have sufficient size to move on,” Bagge said. “But anybody is welcome to join, whether they are in Asia or France.” There is no shortage of new technology initiatives in ocean freight, including Maersk and IBM’s TradeLens blockchain platform and the Ocean Alliance-backed Global Shipping Business Network’s blockchain platform. Outside of the carriers, Dutch bank ABN Amro (Euronext: ABN) is in a joint venture with the software group of Samsung and the Port of Rotterdam for a blockchain project. Freight forwarder Kuehne + Nagel (SIX: KNIN) is also in another blockchain project with Accenture and CMA CGM’s APL subsidiary. Bagge said the group does not aim to pick the winners and losers from these projects. Instead, it wants to help create standards that allow them to work in a uniform way across any carrier or shipper. In the blockchain realm, that can mean something as simple as defining a European or U.S. date standard when transmitting information. “Blockchain, in general, has tremendous potential in the container shipping industry in terms of physical container and documentation visibility,” Bagge said. “What we would like to work on is the underlying standards for the blockchains to work on.” Bagge, who was employed for 12 years at Maersk before moving to DCSA, said the electronic data interchange (EDI) standard that underlies most of the container shipping industry suffers from differing formats among the carriers, along with differing formats in how customers themselves receive data. Even simple information such as vessel arrivals, departures, bookings, and customs clearance for containers can be transmitted in different formats. “That creates enormous complexity on the side of the ocean carriers,” Bagge said. “The message formats can differ tremendously.” Bagge said better standards aim to address the biggest question for shippers — where is my container. The global container ship alliances mean freight booked through one carrier can end up on a ship belonging to another carrier in the alliance. That happens up to 50 percent of time in busy trade lanes such as Asia-to-Europe, Bagge said. The upshot is that customers can lose track of where their container is. “MSC has an Internet-of-Things functionality on some of its containers, which is great, as long as it’s loaded on an MSC ship,” Bagge said. “When MSC loads a container on a partner’s ship, then because the communications protocols are not the same, the customer loses their visibility.” Bagge compares the DCSA’s efforts to what’s been done in international banking through the use of Swift Codes and telecommunications through international roaming. “I remember going to the U.S. fifteen years ago and I had to have a different cell phone back then because of different networks,” Bagge said. “It’s the same with ocean carriers,” he added. “If they can agree of different standards, they will be able to apply a lot of technology that is hard to deploy today.” Zencargo’s recent capital raise adds to the haul going to start-ups in the logistics and freight forwarding industry. The U.K.-based start-up announced it completed a funding round that included German venture capital firm HV Holtzbrinck Ventures, DST Global managing director and Goldman Sachs alum Tom Stafford, and Pentland Ventures. The latest round brings Zencargo’s total funding to $20 million. Chief Executive Alex Hersham said he caught the logistics bug through his prior work at a large private equity firm that helped restructure a European bank’s portfolio of soured loans to the container shipping industry. “When you realize how interesting and complex globalization is and how trade works, that fascinated me,” Hersham said. Instead of dealing with hard assets as he did at his previous firm, Hersham’s new venture is an asset-light freight forwarding and logistics firm. Zencargo helps customers get a better visibility on their supply chains and load planning, all with a view to “minimizing freight spend,” Hersham said. Venture capital funding to shipping start-ups (Source: PitchBook) An optimized supply chain “is becoming a competitive advantage for companies and the forefront of how they succeed,” Hersham said. Venture capital interest in the sector has led to a spike in funding forwarding and supply-chain visibility companies, culminating in the $1billion raised by Flexport earlier this year. Hersham said Zencargo will use its new round to add to its presence in the Far East and Southeast Asia, with a target of overall headcount going from the current level of around 70 to over 100. Most of Zencargo’s current customers come from the U.K’s consumer goods industry, including apparel, furniture and cosmetics. As for the primary mode, ocean freight makes up about 60 percent of the volumes it’s handling with the remainder split between air and road freight. As with the U.S., most of that freight comes from Asia, so the Brexit does not have a direct impact on that trade lane. However the vagaries of the U.K.’s status within the European Union and the resulting impact on England’s economy remain risks that many shippers are trying to navigate. L to R: Zencargo’s founders Richard Fattal, Alex Hersham, and Jan Riethmayer. As did U.S. shippers, Hersham said U.K. firms are double ordering and overstocking in the event of trade disruptions. Likewise, U.K. firms are seeking warehouse space on the European continent due to the unknowns of Brexit. Hersham said the Brexit issue, while not impacting its business directly, has resulted in a “period of uncertainty” for many U.K. firms on planning their supply chain needs. But the need to reduce freight spend will remain regardless. “Some companies are unwilling to change right now until the dust settles, and what their needs will be under a hard or soft Brexit,” Hersham said. “U.K. consumer spending and sentiment is strong, but there has been this pressure on the High Street to be adept and agile in their supply chain due to the Brexit,” he added. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti asked for another 30-day reset in the talks between APM Terminals and the local union representing dock workers at the Port of Los Angeles on how to go forward with APM’s request to install electric charging stations at its Pier 400 location. The charging stations are the first step in adding automated straddle carriers to Pier 400 as it seeks to automate the process of moving containers off its wharf and into container stacking yards for delivery outside the Pier’s gates. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) Local 13 remains opposed the idea on the fear that it will lower labor demand at the biggest North American marine container terminal. But APM, owned by Danish shipping conglomerate Maersk (Nasdaq OMX: MAER.B), sees the project as a way to meet customer demands for container moves that match those of the neighboring automated terminals. Caught between the 8,464 members of the ILWU and Maersk, which pays $70 million per year to lease Pier 400 from the Port of Los Angeles, Garcetti asked for the second delay in a hearing over the ILWU’s appeal against APM’s permit. Invoking both the ILWU’s history in organizing labor at the West Coast ports and its current role alongside Maersk in making Los Angeles “the busiest container port in the Western Hemisphere,” Garcetti asked the Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners for a second delay in deciding on the ILWU’s appeal of the permit. Making the Port of Los Angeles into the main gateway for container goods into the U.S. “has not come without occasional challenges,” Garcetti said. But “working together we have always found a way forward that has benefitted this port, our city, and our economy.” APM Terminals, which hopes to take delivery of the straddle carriers by June, said in a statement: “We appreciate Mayor Garcetti’s leadership on this important matter. After months of delay, we look forward to working expeditiously through the process he’s outlined to make the port competitive.”  Open loop, closed loop, it’s no worry for ships visiting South Africa.

(DMTB), a leading third-party logistics company, has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an organization dedicated to developing best practices and standards for blockchain in the transportation industry. BiTA’s members include McLeod, Daimler, DAT, FedEx, SAP and Trucker Tools, among dozens of other global brands. Blockchain is a technology that enables users to identify and track transactions digitally as well as share information across a distributed network of computers. For the transportation industry, blockchain provides the opportunity to more effectively track goods and freight across the supply chain. Blockchain also will allow transportation and logistics companies to operate in a more seamless and transparent manner. It can also help create new revenue streams and value for customers by enabling a system to complete transactions, track shipments and manage fleets. “By joining the Blockchain in Transport Alliance, DMTB will join other leaders in the supply chain and participate in the development and use of blockchain proficiency. We believe this will be useful in contract management, freight visibility, compliance, fraud prevention, sourcing and compensation,” said Jimmy DeMatteis, President and CEO of Des Moines Truck Brokers, Inc. “We will have the opportunity to participate in the development of standards and context with other industry leaders to promote widespread implementation of this latest digital technology for the supply chain.” “Blockchain technology will transform the supply chain by introducing greater transparency, innovation and efficiency,” said Chris Burruss, President of BiTA. “On behalf of the members of BiTA, I welcome Des Moines Truck Brokers to the Alliance. We look forward to the company’s contributions to our collective efforts.”  “DMTB is committed to its customers and carriers to be an industry leader in technology. Blockchain is coming, and BiTA is at the forefront of setting the standards we will all live by and we want to be actively involved in that planning,” said Eric Davis, Solutions Manager at DMTB. Founded in 1969, Des Moines Truck Brokers, Inc. was one of the first 50 freight brokers in the USA. Today, DMTB is a recognized Top 100 Freight Broker and workplace in an industry that has grown to over 15,000 licensed participants. Family-owned DMTB has a heavy focus on foods and perishable goods.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on April 12 that the recall includes cut cantaloupe, honeydew melon, watermelon and fruit medley products containing melon packaged by Caito Foods LLC. To make matters more confusing, the pre-packaged fruit is sold under various brands or labels at some of the largest food retailers in the United States – Kroger, Target, Trader Joe’s, Walmart and Whole Foods. The pre-packaged fruit was sent to the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Officials from the FDA have advised consumers to check the packaging of any cut-up fruit that they may have at their homes. The FDA urges that if the fruit was packaged or distributed by Caito Foods (no matter how else it might be branded) not to eat it. The regulatory agency also advised retailers to remove all remaining packages from the stores.  According to authorities, to date 93 people have been sickened in nine states, 23 of whom were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported as of this writing. FreightWaves has written repeatedly about the potential of blockchain to help trace food-borne illnesses. On April 11 staff writer Vishnu Rajamanickam wrote an article detailing how Albertsons Companies, the second-largest grocer in the U.S., had joined the IBM Food Trust network. The network runs on a blockchain framework, and is an attempt to increase transparency and visibility into its supply chain. The members’ common interest is to trace food production from farm to the storefronts.  On September 25, 2018, staff writer Maria Baker wrote about Walmart’s (NASDAQ: WMT) announcement to implement blockchain technology in its leafy green supply chain in 2019. Baker also wrote an article on August 2, 2018, in which FreightWaves reported the August 1 announcement that Nestlé (NASDAQ: NSRGF) was partnering with Dole Food Co., Driscoll’s, Golden State Foods, Kroger Co. (NASDAQ: KR), McCormick (NASDAQ: MKC), McLane Co., Tyson Foods (NASDAQ: TSN) and Unilever (NASDAQ: UL) to join the Food Trust. Providing standards for use in transportation, freight and the supply chain is the mission of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). One of BiTA’s members is OriginTrail, a Slovenia-based company that has a particular expertise in the design of blockchain protocols for the food supply chain. These protocols promise unprecedented visibility into chain of custody as well as optimized recalls. It may be impossible to stop outbreaks of food-borne illness. However, using blockchain, regulators, food manufacturers/process, retailers and the public may be able to significantly decrease the harm such outbreaks cause.","TAGS":"food logistics, food recall, food safety, Food Trust, news, Regulations, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Economics, Global Supply Chain, Legal issues, News, Trade and Compliance, Trucking Regulation, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-04-14T16:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/blockchain-can-eradicate-inhumane-working-conditions-in-the-chocolate-industry","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shutterstock_1168417564.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain can eradicate inhumane working conditions in the chocolate industry","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Food supply chains vary in complexity based on the type of produce, its sourcing, and the level of processing it undergoes. Though the phrase “farm-to-fork” sums up the journey of food through its supply chain, it does nothing to shed light on the number of steps or the different stakeholders involved in making that happen. As a general rule of thumb, the more complex and international food supply chain is, the more opaque it gets while trying to trace the quality and the conditions under which the produce was sourced. Apart from benefiting the end consumer, advocating for supply chain visibility might surprisingly help alleviate the working conditions of people toiling away on distant farms. In the context of pushing for supply chain visibility, the multi-billion dollar chocolate industry would be a good place to start. The primary ingredient of chocolate is cocoa, a plant that grows well in hot and humid regions with high precipitation – making West Africa an epicenter for cocoa plantations. The countries of Cameroon, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Nigeria account for 70 percent of the world’s cocoa production, selling their cocoa beans to the large chocolate manufacturers including Hershey, Nestle and Mars. The absence of regulations and worker unions, as well as widespread poverty, have pushed these countries to exploit the workforce in cocoa plantations, which include child labor, forced labor and corporate slavery. Though most of the large corporations do understand the rampant human rights’ violations occurring, they rarely acknowledge the issue or are indifferent to the workers’ plight. In many ways, cocoa production keeps the West African countries afloat. For instance, 60 percent of Ivory Coast’s export revenue comes solely from its cocoa plantations. As the market for chocolate grows in the West, chocolate manufacturers are forced to reduce prices to stay ahead of market competitors, which increases the demand for cheap cocoa. In the end, it is the farmers who are left in the lurch, with figures showing that an average cocoa farmer makes less than $2 per day. Amid issues such as wage disconnect, forced labor and corporate apathy, putting the chocolate supply chain on a blockchain ledger can help make the supply chain more transparent. These are problems that exist under the surface and getting it the attention of end consumers would ultimately help drive better working conditions and pay for the workers.  Amsterdam-based chocolate company Tony’s Chocolonely, is taking the initiative of bringing visibility and transparency to chocolate supply chains via a shared value chain platform called the Beantracker, that digitally records the end-to-end movement of cocoa beans from the field to manufacturing to the final wrapping as a chocolate bar at the chocolate factory. The idea is to create a traceable channel for every stakeholder in the supply chain to understand what goes into a chocolate bar, and essentially put inhumane working conditions in the spotlight. Though the Beantracker is not powered by blockchain, this is a start. The promise of blockchain is not entirely different from the Beantracker, but blockchain’s underlying technology is easier to scale up, especially if the system runs on a universal framework made of open standards. The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) is a consortium that has made this a reality, bringing together hundreds of stakeholders in the supply chain space to create open standards that companies can use as a platform for their blockchain needs. Companies’ blockchain pilots, if successful, can be scaled up across its specific vertical – which in this case is the chocolate supply chain. That said, blockchain cannot be the stand-alone technology that pushes traceability into a supply chain as complex as the chocolate industry. Since food supply chains need to track real physical goods, it is vital for stakeholders to add Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) to cocoa bean shipments to record where they are sourced from. Finally, for blockchain to work seamlessly, it will require stakeholders to come together, train and educate their personnel on data-sharing from the start, as real-time data inflow is critical to the system’s functioning.","TAGS":"Africa, BiTA, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, child labor, chocolate, food chain, food supply chain, forced labor, Supply chain, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-04-12T15:30:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/technology/albertsons-companies-partners-with-ibm-food-trust-network-to-use-blockchain-for-food-supply-chain-traceability","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/shutterstock_367215926.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Albertsons Companies partners with IBM Food Trust network to use blockchain for food supply chain traceability","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Albertsons Companies, the second-largest grocer in the U.S., has announced that it is joining the IBM Food Trust network that runs on a blockchain framework, in an attempt to increase transparency and visibility into its supply chain. The IBM Food Trust network is a consortium that comprises more than 50 food brands from across the world. Their common interest is to trace food production from farm to the storefronts. Ever since blockchain burst into mainstream relevance, IBM has shown a sustained interest in incorporating the technology into its services. It has partnered with a number of its clients to deliver blockchain applications spread across various verticals including retail, finance, supply chain and healthcare. The company is also a member of the Hyperledger platform – an open source, cross-industry collaboration to push the boundaries of blockchain technology and its use cases. With the Food Trust network, IBM and its partners seek to substantiate the applicability of blockchain in food track-and-trace, with an ultimate goal of bringing about a safer and more transparent food supply chain. Albertsons Companies, which has 2,300 stores across the U.S., could gain a great deal from blockchain’s success; it would help reduce contamination-related recalls and generally help improve product quality. The pilot run for the blockchain solution on IBM Food Trust is to trace bulk romaine lettuce from one of Albertsons distribution centers, which if successful, would be expanded to other food categories across its distribution network. Choosing romaine lettuce is understandable. The food product was the center of a major recall last year, with contaminated romaine lettuce carrying the dreaded E.coli bacteria ending up sickening hundreds of people over the course of two months. Apart from the obvious health hazards, contamination is also a significant business risk, because grocery retailers are forced to recall several hundred tons of food products because of the potential pathogen outbreak.  “Blockchain technology has the potential to be transformational for us as we further build differentiation on our fresh brand,” said Anuj Dhanda, chief information officer at Albertsons Companies. “Food safety is a very significant step; blockchain traces the provenance of products. The ability to track every move of a food product – from the farm to the shopping cart – will be very empowering for our customers.” One key advantage of a blockchain system is the data sharing among key stakeholders, which can help glean insights for the supply chain at-large. However, commercial adoption of blockchain is not widespread due to many companies wariness of data-sharing. Several companies have expressed skepticism about sharing data – albeit to a secure and decentralized ledger – because they fear it might lead to a loss of their competitive edge in the market. The future of blockchain is tied to data, and it is consortiums like the Food Trust network that can help expedite the change in perspective. Network members are recommending or mandating that their supply chain partners join the network, which in essence would create complete visibility into the end-to-end food chain operations. “Since first introducing IBM Food Trust, we have met a number of milestones that show the path toward transforming the end-to-end food system,” said Raj Rao, General Manager of the IBM Food Trust. “Today, we are further scaling the network to bring blockchain-based traceability to an even wider cross-section of retailers, suppliers and end consumers. By working with the top retailers all over the world, IBM Food Trust is truly helping to provide a safer and more transparent food system for all.”","TAGS":"Albertsons Companies, Blockchain, contamination, digitalization, food chain, food delivery logistics, IBM, IBM Food Trust, romain lettuce, track and trace, Tracking, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-04-11T14:30:57-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/infographics/benefits-of-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/bitabenefitsnewsletter.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Benefits to Enterprise — BiTA","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"","TAGS":"BiTA, Blockchain, infographics, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Trevor Willingham","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, FreightWaves Infographics, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-04-10T14:38:57-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/mobility/bus-hailing-ramps-up-uber","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Latest_raise_draws_1-3.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Uber, local startups, ramp up investment in bus-hailing services","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Move over ride-hailing. Bus-hailing apps are picking up steam. The momentum is strongest in developing countries, where concerns about pollution and traffic congestion are mounting. Many developing countries also have a long history of mass transit use. This new mobility sector has a long way to go before achieving the scale of its car-hailing predecessor. But a growing number of venture capital-funded start-ups are staking a claim. India is taking the lead. Last week Gurugram-based Shuttl, an early entrant, reported it had landed $7.2 million as part of a Series B funding round, according to DealStreet Asia. Participants included Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed India Partners and Times Internet Ltd., a subsidiary of Indian media house Bennett Coleman and Co. While the dollar figure is small compared to the hundreds of millions being invested in ride-sharing companies, it is notable for being the latest in a series of fund raises Shuttl has completed in the past 12 months. The start-up secured $1.4 million from Trifecta Capital in January, following a round of $11 million led by Amazon India, Amazon Alexa Fund and Dentsu Ventures in July 2018.  Founded in 2015, Shuttl has raised a total of $43.8 million, according to CrunchBase. Big players are circling the market. Last year Uber launched a bus program in Cairo, Egypt as well as Monterrey, Mexico, and the company plans to add staff to its Seattle-based “high capacity vehicles team,” as the Uber bus program is called, GeekWire reported today. “We’re seeing the growth of this product take off faster than UberX did when it launched in [those cities] – really early on, there are signs of product market fit,” said Miraj Rahematpura, a product manager on the high capacity vehicles team, according to GeekWire. “We’re super excited to scale to a lot more cities.” Uber and Shuttl, which is owned by Super Highway Labs, have a shared history stemming from Uber’s recent acquisition of Middle East on-demand cab hailing rival Careem for $3.1 billion. Last fall Careem acquired another Indian bus shuttle service app, Commut, in a deal that brought the latter’s talent and technology under the Careem umbrella, while shifting its customers and drivers to Shuttl, Bloomberg reported. That acquisition helped Shuttl grow services featuring around 700 buses that provide 45,000 rides per day on 130 routes in eight cities. The latest funding round will be used to expand the company’s geographical reach, and serve more consumers across Indian cities.  Also known as microtransit and on-demand buses, bus-hailing startups typically feature private shuttle buses that run multiple routes. Like Shuttl, customers use an app to find and purchase tickets for seats. Co-founder Amit Singh has said his goal is to reduce pollution and traffic in crowded cities like Delhi by encouraging people to take mass transportation. The apportioning of Commut assets is not the only example of a changing market. Ola, Uber’s main competitor in India, shut down its bus unit Ola Shuttle last year. (Ola is now reportedly in talks with Uber to acquire the latter’s operations in India.) Several other bus-hailing startups remain – Shuttl’s competitors include Bengaluru’s ZipGo and Mumbai’s Cityflo. The sector is trickier to crack in the U.S., where most cities lack sufficient urban density and a history of transit ridership. In January, the app-based shuttle service Chariot shut down, two and one-half years after being acquired by Ford for a reported $65 million. Uber shut down a carpool service called UberHOP more than three years ago.

ChainGo Tech’s primary focus is on international trade and transport, such as the maritime shipping. Blockchain is an open, distributed digital ledger that can record and share transactions between two or more parties efficiently, securely and permanently. Blockchain enables transportation companies to more accurately track shipments, routes and transport vehicles (in all modes) while providing a highly secure platform that permits faster processing and payments. Blockchain applications are expanding globally. BiTA and its members are developing best practices and standards for blockchain in transportation/logistics. BiTA is also providing information and educational materials relating to blockchain technologies for the freight, transportation and logistics industries. According to the International Maritime Organization, maritime transport is essential to the world’s economy; over 90 percent of the world’s trade is carried by sea and it is, by far, the most cost-effective way to move goods and raw materials en masse around the world.  However, the maritime industry has a number of key problems, including bureaucratic inefficiency and risk of fraud. Previous efforts to digitize global trade in the maritime sector (and within other transportation modes) have been met with trepidation due to the lack of clear and common objectives and trust between individual actors. Blockchain technology can help avoid these problems. “Our platform is based on blockchain technology that guarantees the realization of verified transactions, transparency and full confidence in the authenticity of documents,” stated ChainGO Tech CEO Andrés Garrido. Blockchain provides transparency and immutability of information and is considered one of the technologies that is expected to disrupt the logistics industry. Garrido added, “Partnering with BiTA, ChainGO Tech want to take part in defining and developing blockchain standards for transportation and logistics. Being involved with leading companies in the sector and emerging technological companies worldwide, all pushing in the same direction, is an incredible opportunity that will help all of us.” Oliver Haines, Vice President-European Region for BiTA, said, “On behalf of BiTA and its members around the world, I welcome ChainGO Tech to the BiTA Community. We look forward to the company’s contributions to the Alliance. ChainGO Tech brings expertise in current supply chain practices, which is important for the establishment of a seamless path into blockchain application.”  “We are grateful to BITA, its staff and membership for this opportunity to offer our know-how,” Garrido said. “ChainGO Tech can make a contribution in this new era of digitalization and transformation.” Based in Madrid and Valencia, ChainGO Tech offers innovative software solutions based on blockchain technology that manage the burdensome transport and cargo documentation process involved in sea, ground and air transportation. ChainGO Freight is the platform the company launched earlier this year. ChainGO Freight connects the many different players in the global supply chain with a safe, secure and efficient process backed by an immutable blockchain. ChainGO Tech offers clients a complete platform dedicated to seamlessly managing and controlling documentation in cargo transport. The company has a novel approach, with an agnostic blockchain solution aimed at providing a high level of customization tailored to the needs of every client. Founded in August 2017, BiTA has quickly grown into the largest commercial blockchain alliance in the world, with nearly 500 members that collectively generate over $1 trillion in revenue annually. BiTA members are primarily from the freight, transportation, logistics and affiliated industries. Alliance members share a common mission to develop a standards framework, educate the market on blockchain applications and encourage the use of those applications. BiTA has offices in Chattanooga, Tennessee (North America Region); Sydney, Australia (Asia-Pacific Region); and London (European Region).

The bacterium under the scanner is Listeria monocytogenes, a microorganism that can cause severe infections in children, those who are immunity-deficient and older people, which could sometimes end up being a fatal affliction.  The company in its statement mentioned that it voluntarily recalled the avocado shipments sold in bulk in retail stores, as a routine government inspection in its California packing facility tested positive for the bacteria. The company has exerted caution in removing the crates off shelves, even though there have been no reported cases of illness caused by consuming avocados from this specific batch. Henry Avocado has recalled its California-grown conventional and organic avocados that were packed in California, from the states of Arizona, California, Florida, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Wisconsin. However, avocados that were imported from Mexico and distributed by the company are not affected and continue to be sold at retail outlets. In a similar incident last week, Arkansas-based Tyson Foods had recalled 69,000 pounds of chicken strips after a couple of consumers reported that they found metal pieces in the product. Though this was an isolated incident, the company had to recall all the items that were produced in a single plant in Rogers, Arkansas, that included 65,313 pounds of Tyson’s fully cooked chicken strips and crispy chicken strips that were sold in 25-ounce bags. The company also recalled 3,780 pounds of fully cooked chicken breast strips that were sold in 20-pound boxes. Though Henry Avocado and Tyson Foods deal with two distinct food products and had completely different reasons for recalling their produce, the extent of the recall cannot be ignored. Discarding hundreds of pounds worth of consumables for a few pounds of contaminated items is highly inefficient and if done frequently, could end up affecting a company’s bottom line. Avoiding a generic recall is possible if companies turn towards blockchain for help. The inherent ability of blockchain to bring visibility into supply chains allows businesses to monitor every step in the journey of its produce from “farm to fork,” helping pinpoint issues as and when they arise.  For example, assume that a supply chain of wine bottles is put through a blockchain-based framework. If a few crates of wine were found to contain contaminants, the management would be able to precisely spot the nodal point within the supply chain when and where the contaminants entered the product, and could swiftly take action to remove the contaminated cases from the supply chain. This would save the winery from a variety of issues, including having to recall wine en masse. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) can be used in track-and-trace, with blockchain acting as the framework that data arising at different intervals from the supply chain gets added in real-time. Technological advancements have shrunk the sizes of IIoT products to smaller than a grain of salt, and thus they can be attached to crates and bags sold in bulk, helping pinpoint items if there is a breach in quality. To make sure there is widespread adoption of blockchain within food supply chains, it is critical to create open standards that can act as a bedrock framework for developing blockchain-based tracking systems. The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) is a consortium that has made this a reality, bringing together hundreds of stakeholders in the supply chain space to create open standards that companies can use as a platform for their blockchain pilots. Companies’ blockchain pilots, if successful, can be scaled up across the breadth of operations. However, within the realm of blockchain, caution still must be exerted. As companies establish a framework for all stakeholders within a food supply chain to adhere to specific regulations and quality control, the system would also need to be exhaustively audited to make sure product track-and-trace works seamlessly.","TAGS":"avocados, BiTA, BiTA Standards, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, food recall, food supply chain, logistics, recall, shipment, Supply chain, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-03-29T19:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/the-possibilities-of-blockchain-in-regulating-marijuana-supply-chains","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Tracking_marijuana_1-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The possibilities of blockchain in regulating marijuana supply chains","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ten states and the District of Columbia have legalized small amounts of marijuana for adult recreational use. As a result marijuana supply chains in the U.S. are starting to take shape, with commercial possibilities following. However, the contradiction between state and federal laws cannot be understated. Federal regulation continues to be a challenge for legal marijuana, which includes logistics from production to consumption. It is crucial to monitor marijuana supply chains end-to-end to ensure no amount of the product slips through unnoticed. FreightWaves spoke with Michael Morey from Franwell about the finer details of marijuana supply chains and the primary concerns and challenges that face the marijuana industry. Franwell is a technology company dedicated to the development of leading- edge products and services with a focus on supply chain solutions and RFID integration “For the monitoring process, we go back to the actual plants on the field. We track the number of plants that are planted by growers and look at the number of plants that survive until the end, as many of them die out. We track the plants through the process of maturation and harvest,” said Morey. “At that point, we will measure the amount of product that is derived from these plants, as well as the amount of waste, so that everything is accounted for.” Precisely measuring the output and the waste is essential, because legal marijuana cultivation is strictly enforced and the measurement statistics need to be precise. Once the output is gauged, it is then distributed via packages, with each package being tagged and inventoried before it goes to a retailer. This way, it is possible to track the genealogy of a marijuana strain – the plant it came from, its geographic origin, the name of the grower, and other specifics. “Generally, marijuana is sold at mom-and-pop shops and the product is transported in small delivery vans, rather than in big trucks. Though the distribution of marijuana is not terribly sophisticated, the issue is with the federal law, because growing and distribution are still not legal under it. This causes problems in terms of banking – reporting the financials and filing taxes is difficult since banks are federally regulated,” said Morey.  It is here that technology like blockchain could help, as it can assist with accounting for each step across the supply chain, and create transparency into the operations of every stakeholder in the chain. One of the problems that faces the marijuana trade is that it remains entrenched in traditional cash transactions, rather than going digital. Then again, pushing the transactions through banks is also not viable because currently that is illegal. “This is a conundrum – as it’s legal in the state and illegal federally. The federal government can’t come into the state and prevent the sale and distribution of marijuana, but it can complicate the management of funds or money derived from the activity because the majority of banks are federally regulated,” said Morey. Blockchain could alleviate the issue to an extent. The technology can help bring the largely underground movement of marijuana above board, and help create a semblance of trust between the stakeholders in the supply chain. The marijuana business is extremely profitable, and thus can generate a number of jobs within its ecosystem. Even with blockchain, it would help the cause of the marijuana industry if there is an open data framework that could be used for companies to develop pilot blockchain programs. Consortiums like the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) are bringing together hundreds of stakeholders in the supply chain space to create open standards that companies can use as a platform for their blockchain pilots. Morey explained that blockchain would help with verification just as credit cards do when they are swiped in supermarkets. “When you use your credit card, the validity of the card is verified, and there is either an approval or rejection of the transaction. This is on a need-to-know basis, and I think this can work here as well,” he said. “For example, in the air cargo industry ground handlers track the freight they handle, generate an invoice to the forwarder or carrier, who in turn has its own data to compare with. This can take out all the discrepancies that arise in the process as everything exists within the same system.” ","TAGS":"BiTA, BiTA Standards, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, federal regulation, legalization, logistics, marijuana, marijuana delivery, marijuana supply chains, pot, state regulation, Supply chain, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-03-22T17:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/blockchain-in-transport-alliance-welcomes-hong-kong-based-tigers","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/BiTA-TigersGraphic.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain in Transport Alliance welcomes Hong Kong-based Tigers","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Tigers, a Hong Kong-based global logistics and transportation company that specializes in technology-enabled supply chain solutions, e-fulfilment and transportation by air, sea, rail and road, has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA).

The Tracking Data Framework Profile is the first foundation document of the council, providing a roadmap for future data component development. The pace at which these accomplishments were achieved is remarkable among data standards organizations. It typically takes about two years for data standards to be created, reviewed, ratified and published. BiTA’s first standard took six months. Scott Friesen, Vice President of Strategic Analytics at Echo Global Logistics and BiTA Standards Council Executive Committee member, commented, “New technology can move at such high speed, and excitement about new technology even faster. However, to produce standards, and the long-term efficiencies they will produce, is more like legislation than writing code. To get this first set of standards out with unanimous support in under a year is a great accomplishment. We look forward to growing, enhancing and supporting the available standards to support the supply chain and blockchain development communities.”  The first BiTA Working Groups were established in August 2018. Impressively, over the past six months, and through the talent and collaborative efforts of members spanning logistics, supply chain and technology companies from around the globe and across all transportation modes, BiTA has accomplished a major feat in its quest to create a data standard for the movement of goods. Following their submission at the end of January, a 30-day review period by the Data Formats Technical Committee commenced; the documents were scrutinized and then submitted to the BiTA Standards Council for ratification and publication.  Pratik Soni, CEO of Omnichain Solutions and the Chair of the Location Data Component Working Group, remarked, “The data standards published provide the initial framework for interoperability across a currently fragmented and siloed ecosystem that reaches across many different enterprises, systems and various protocols.” While industry incumbents see promise in blockchain, up until now there has been no consensus on the framework over which the associated applications could be built. The absence of data standards generates chaos in the ecosystem, and has contributed to the rise of proprietary blockchain networks. Creating a common framework for the global supply chain and transportation industries is a delicate proposition, as different companies have different perspectives on what tracking and visibility entails.  Ben Kothari, Chief Solutions Architect at Ampliflex and Chair of the BiTA Tracking Document Working Group, commented on the challenges associated with standards development, “Defining terms within the standards was a problem we had to solve – some things were quite obvious like defining location tracking, but some others, for example, defining the concept of a shipment, would be a bit more difficult. All these divergent views on definitions also posed a challenge while building standards. Since we are just starting out, and there are not many legacy standards to work with, the scope of these tasks also became an issue.” “The BiTA Standards Council is focused on creating open source and royalty-free standards with a focus and emphasis on data formats and interoperability,” said Patrick Duffy, the director of engagement at BiTA. “While we are working with organizations that are sometimes competitive and run parallel with each other, together BiTA will create a common language or vernacular for global supply chain businesses – driving efficiencies by eliminating red-tape and increasing machine-to-machine processes.” Soni added, “This achievement is largely due to the hard work, motivation and commitment of the BiTA team members. We have individuals from both small and large enterprises collaborating and working together to achieve something phenomenal. The Working Groups agreed to weekly hour-long meetings and hit key deliverables in addition to managing the deliverables for their day jobs. This dedication helped us reduce the typical timeline for standards publication.” The past few weeks have seen an acceleration in production from BiTA and its Standards Council. At the February 27th meeting of its Board of Directors, BiTA also elected its first Standards Council Chair, Dale Chrystie of FedEx, who in conjunction with BiTA members, will seek to drive faster and more comprehensive publication of data standards throughout 2019.  Arlen Stark, BiTA Chief of Staff, commented, “I’m very proud of our membership, who in partnership with the BiTA team and IEEE/ISTO [a federation of member alliance programs that support accelerated technology standards development and market adoption], have accomplished in less than a year what normally takes two or three years.” BiTA was founded in August 2017, and has quickly grown into the largest commercial blockchain alliance in the world. Its membership includes nearly 500 members in more than 25 countries that collectively generate over $1 trillion in revenue annually. BiTA members are primarily from the freight, transportation and logistics industries. The Alliance was formed by experienced technology, transportation and supply chain executives to create a forum for the development of blockchain standards and education for the freight industry.

Several blockchain pilot programs have been initiated across the ecosystem by companies that are looking to improve transparency and visibility in their supply chains – a sign of healthy cynicism to have front-row seats on the blockchain bandwagon. Though this could be assumed to be an extension of the eternal fascination that companies have towards increasing operational efficiency and the decisive fear of missing out (FOMO) factor on futuristic technology, it is essential to define blockchain’s capabilities within the industry, rather than to fall back on bland rhetoric of textbook merits and theoretical possibilities. The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an association comprised of hundreds of stakeholders within the transportation and logistics sectors, was founded to comprehensively answer a simple question that has puzzled the industry for a very long time – “where is my shipment at?” The idea of BiTA is to create a set of open blockchain standards – a framework that would act as a springboard for companies within the industry to develop blockchain-related applications. “Logistics processes are no longer within an enterprise or just within a few partners – they now span a whole network of participants across the transportation and supply chain industry. And the current systems and standards of these networks were never designed for the scenarios or are quite antiquated to cope,” said Ben Kothari, Chair of the BiTA Tracking Document Data Component Working Group. To monitor the real-time movement of a shipment through blockchain, it is critical to define a whole array of components within supply chain entities, while also initiating stable relationships between different parties. Defining the core set of entities and creating contracts that they will work on is instrumental in helping businesses manage operations in a more streamlined and efficient way.  Kothari contended that defining every element within a transaction was critical to see progress, and that BiTA was on track to create deeper and richer definitions for entities over the course of this year. BiTA standards will help businesses understand, at a broader level, what the processes look like, the entities that operate within these processes, and the smart contracts or agreements that are built on top of them – helping companies operate without friction in a network. “Once the definitions emerge, we’ll be able to create a foundation in terms of how these entities help in conducting transportation business, thus eventually answering the question of where a shipment is in real-time. Shipments traverse across multiple carriers, modes and channels, and creating industry standards are integral to addressing the tracking problem” said Kothari. Kothari explained that BiTA standards are relevant to the industry, as it was the first of its kind in the blockchain space, standing alone without banking on antiquated and legacy standards. BiTA has created a niche within the shipment tracking segment by focusing on solving issues related to transportation, rather than making the standards generic to suit every industry. “There are several standards that are very broadly defined, thus ending up losing focus on the specific set of problems that need to be solved. BiTA comes into the picture with a laser-focus on the transportation industry, which makes it distinctive,” said Kothari. Even with tailor-made standards for the transportation industry, there have been differing opinions on the need for “openness” in such standards – such as the proprietary blockchain platforms that the maritime industry is witnessing through TradeLens, a joint venture between Maersk Line and IBM.  Kothari insisted that creating proprietary blockchain-related applications – though are valuable to the blockchain movement at-large, is not solving the issue with transparency across the ecosystem. In the end, a proprietary blockchain network owned by Maersk would be hard pressed to serve the container line’s interest, thus defeating blockchain’s promise of equal ownership and transparency among network stakeholders. “When you restrict participation in a blockchain program, what you essentially have is a distributed or point-to-point messaging platform. That does not add any new value to the system. All you create is another siloed environment that works on integrating and translating different messaging platforms and protocols,” said Kothari. “With proprietary programs, you will not be solving any problem, but will only end up introducing an extra component to the problem.” BiTA’s roadmap this year involves building on the foundation it laid out last week through its blockchain standards. In essence, the overall intention is to progress to the point where the industry would see sense in permanently phasing out legacy EDI systems and depending on blockchain-based solutions for tracking shipments.","TAGS":"BiTA, BiTA Standards, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, blockchain platform, blockchain standards, blockchain tracking, shipment tracking, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-03-13T13:45:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/bumble-bee-foods-is-tracking-seafood-across-global-supply-chains-through-blockchain","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/shutterstock_560078302.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bumble Bee Foods is tracking seafood across global supply chains through blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Bumble Bee Foods, North America’s largest branded shelf-stable seafood company, has announced that it will use the SAP cloud platform blockchain to trace the movement of yellowfin tuna from the Indonesian ocean to the consumer’s cart. The seafood behemoth has traditionally shown interest in understanding the environment from where it sources its fish, with blockchain being its latest tool of choice. In many ways, looking for visibility in supply chains is a valid concern – several small-scale fishing operators catch the tuna off the coast of east Indonesian islands, thus making it vital for the company to take stock of the situation and maintain quality to the very last fish that goes through its supply chain. “We’ve been doing traceability for a long time, and we decided to leverage new technologies to make it even more secure,” said Tony Costa, chief information officer at Bumble Bee. “Quite frankly, we’re just scratching the surface on the capabilities of the technology in our supply chain.” The issues related to the international seafood trade scene is telling. Oceana, a marine conservation non-profit, recently published a U.S.-based report on the extent of seafood fraud. The U.S. is particularly vulnerable as 90 percent of all the seafood consumed within the country gets imported – often from the farthest corners of southeast Asia. What is even more worrying is the scant frequency of fraud inspections – less than one percent of total seafood imports are inspected for fraud/mislabeling. “Despite growing concern about where our food comes from, consumers are frequently served a completely different type of fish than the one they paid for. As Oceana’s nationwide study and others demonstrate, seafood may be mislabeled as often as 26 to 87 percent of the time for commonly swapped fish such as grouper, cod and snapper, disguising fish that are less desirable, cheaper or more readily available,” said Oceana in its report. Oceana concluded that mislabeling was found in 17 of the 46 fish types that it tested, and that 44 percent of the grocery stores, restaurants and sushi venues the non-profit organization visited sold mislabeled seafood. “With more than 1,700 different species of seafood from all over the world available for sale in the U.S., it is unrealistic to expect the American consumer to be able to independently and accurately determine what they are actually eating,” said the report.  Blockchain’s relevance in this logistics quagmire is evident. Not only is the ecosystem extremely opaque with regard to product sourcing, but also is bogged down by labeling errors that could either be genuine or fraudulent. Bumble Bee customers now will be able to readily access the complete origin and history of the company’s yellowfin tuna products by using their smartphones to scan a QR code on the product package. This leads SAP’s blockchain platform to display information about the fish-to-market journey, including the size of the catch, point of capture and the fishing community that caught it, as well as valuable insights to verify authenticity, freshness, safety, fair trade fishing certification and sustainability. This move should help Bumble Bee hold the loyalty of its customers and tighten its supply chain by reducing mislabeling and identifying fish producers who do not meet the company’s quality standards. The retailers who will stock Bumble Bee’s first batch of blockchain-traced tuna include Albertsons, Hy-Vee, Price Chopper and Safeway. It is also interesting to note that Bumble Bee and SAP have collaborated on a private distributed ledger called Multichain, developed at Coin Sciences, a U.K.-based startup. The word ‘private’ is key, as it would mean that unlike the usual trait of blockchain platforms distributing equal ownership across all stakeholders in the network, the Bumble Bee blockchain would allow the seafood company to exert a broader control over the data being transferred. Though such a blockchain platform would be beneficial to Bumble Bee and its customers, it would be better for the blockchain logistics ecosystem to encourage open, decentralized blockchain networks, because that would lead to the development of more blockchain platforms and applications. Pursuing that goal is the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), a consortium that is looking to make open blockchain applications in transportation, freight and logistics a reality. BiTA is doing this by bringing hundreds of stakeholders together to build a framework for open blockchain standards, which it expects will act as a bedrock for the development of several blockchain platforms. Then again, any blockchain platform at the moment is definitely a positive. Use cases like the Bumble Bee tuna-tracking platform will help expand blockchain’s reach and foster the growth of similar solutions in the logistics space.","TAGS":"BiTA, Blockchain, Bumble Bee Foods, Exports, global supply chains, imports, logistics, Maritime, Multichain, SAP, seafood, Supply chains, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-03-12T13:45:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/cargoxs-blockchain-based-smart-bill-of-lading-solution-is-now-on-dexfreights-platform","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CargoX_partners_3.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"CargoX’s blockchain-based smart bill of lading solution is now on dexFreight’s platform","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ever since the buzz around blockchain’s capability to induce transparency into supply chain operations, the technology has in many ways held the collective conscious of the logistics world. Blockchain brings in transparency through its decentralized ledger, that is fully auditable and plain in-view of all the stakeholders in the system. Logistics blockchain companies CargoX and dexFreight announced a partnership today (March 8) to collaborate in providing digital bills of lading (B/L) and cost-effective logistics operations. “The partnership with dexFreight is really exciting because the smart B/L will be offered in a thriving ecosystem that interconnects shippers and carriers using the smart tools of the 21st century that are disrupting the industry. This is a perfect match for the Smart B/L™,” said Stefan Kukman, CEO and founder of CargoX. CargoX is a startup that pioneers in the blockchain-based digital bill of lading solution, and was one of the first startups to commercialize blockchain in the maritime industry. The company’s Smart B/L platform became the first open and neutral blockchain medium in the shipping market, helping container lines and shippers phase out paper B/L documents and go digital. Quite like the other modes of transport, some companies in the maritime industry have also displayed a half-hearted approach to technology, a surprising reality considering the complexities of handling numerous stakeholders, moving goods that predominantly cross international borders, and the sheer volume of cargo hauled. Then again, a great deal has been done in the maritime industry concerning blockchain pilot programs in the recent past, with large container lines like Maersk (CXE: MAERB.C.IX), CMA CGM and Hapag Lloyd leading the way. However, these blockchain projects have been underwhelming for certain reasons. For instance, Maersk’s blockchain platform TradeLens is a proprietary platform that may help Maersk exert a greater influence on the system than other stakeholders – defeating the very purpose of blockchain. When there are issues with trust and unequal ownership within a blockchain platform, the premise of blockchain falls spectacularly flat. However, CargoX believes the issues that prevail over such proprietary blockchain solutions give the startup an edge over the large container lines.  “One of the questions we kept getting while we were developing this platform was why would anyone choose CargoX over platforms like the one developed by IBM and Maersk. I think it all comes down to competition. Because Maersk is a carrier, it is natural that none of its competitors would be using its platform,” he said in an interview with FreightWaves last November. “It is the same with DP World or CMA CGM. It is a closed environment, and they are competitors to DHL, Schenker, Kuehne + Nagel, Agility, etc. – and those companies will not use the platform of a competitor.” The fact that CargoX is a startup that exclusively builds a blockchain-based B/L solution helps it gain customers that were otherwise dubious of the blockchain pilots that container lines initiated. Now with the dexFreight partnership, the CargoX smart B/L solution is integrated within dexFreight’s platform, helping shippers, carriers and consignees replace their paper documents with a digital B/L, reducing total ownership transfer time from 10 days to 20 seconds. dexFreight is a decentralized, blockchain-based logistics company that allows shippers and carriers to post and pick up shipments, negotiate, track and trace freight, and work on payment settlements on its platform. “Our partnership with CargoX will allow users to transfer cargo ownership rights without the hassle of handling paper, having papers notarized, and traditional attestations, while they maintain and track provenance,” said Rajat Rajbhandari, CEO and co-founder of dexFreight. “In addition, they can be factored and/or sold as a tokenized debt instrument in the open market at a much lower cost than traditional financing.”","TAGS":"Blockchain, CargoX, dexFreight, logistics, Maritime, Supply chains, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Logistics, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-03-08T19:40:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/regulation/lawmaker-predicts-2019-year-or-blockchain","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/USRepTomEmmerDCBlockchain3-7-19.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Lawmaker predicts 2019 “the year of blockchain”","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"On the first day of this year’s DC Blockchain Summit in Washington, D.C., concern that a heavy-handed approach from the federal government could stifle blockchain innovation in the United States was lessened by the regulators themselves, who told attendees that they generally support allowing the technology to flourish. That message was reinforced on day two of the conference, when U.S. Representative Tom Emmer (R-Minnesota), a lawmaker who has taken on blockchain as an issue on Capitol Hill. Emmer, who co-chairs the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, predicted that 2019 “stands to be the year of blockchain, the year we separate hype from reality, and begin harnessing blockchain in the right-use cases to lower costs and increase efficiency,” he told attendees on March 7. But he also emphasized the need for coordinated government oversight. “Congress has a clear role: we must insure that regulation is simple and precise,” Emmer said. “If a patchwork of regulations emerges, the industry will suffer, and prove government to be ineffective. This confusion will undoubtedly lead to more regulation, which will only stifle the innovation and potential application of the technology.” The financial stakes were highlighted during the conference when it was noted that there’s $130 billion in value currently being stored in public blockchain networks, and that 10 percent of the world’s GDP is expected to be stored by 2025.  Emmer commended the Chamber of Digital Commerce for releasing its National Action Plan for Blockchain, which calls for a pro-growth regulatory approach to developing blockchain technology in the U.S. The document specifically mentions how the technology is already being applied in supply chain networks for tracking food safety. “The National Action Plan also provides a needed call for clear regulation before enforcement. Although regulators of blockchain and cryptocurrency have been significantly restrained and have allowed innovation in this space to flourish, we’re currently operating under ‘regulation by enforcement.’ Regulators must provide clear rules of the road to ensure that even the smallest start-up with a brilliant idea can become a major enterprise.” Emmer said he’s doing his part to speed the growth of blockchain in the U.S. through his Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, a bill he introduced in January. The legislation ensures that blockchain developers that never take control of consumer funds do not need to register as a money transmitter in the states in which they operate. “Money transmitter laws were enacted to ensure the protection of the consumer entrusting another entity with their funds in order to transmit them. If no funds are being entrusted to another, it should be certain that these regulations do not apply,” he said.  Emmer also gave a favorable outlook for cryptocurrencies – the existence of which is enabled by blockchain technology – despite the surge, and then plunge, of bitcoin value over the past two years. “Many, including those in this town, would like to focus only on blockchain and ignore or criticize cryptocurrency,” he said. “They will tell us the bitcoin is used by criminals, and the blockchain is the real innovation. It’s true there are illicit transactions. But that should not be reason to totally dismiss cryptocurrency.” He pointed out that bitcoins represented the first use of a network open to the public and capable of letting two participants interact with no middleman. “This is the revolutionary aspect of this technology, the idea that we can develop an open network in which we control our own data, while freely interacting with each other, and without having to trust gatekeepers. That idea could be one of the major breakthroughs of our lifetime.”","TAGS":"Bitcoin, Blockchain, Chamber of Digital Commerce, cryptocurrency, DC Blockchain summit, U.S. Representative Tom Emmer, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Gallagher","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Trucking Regulation, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-03-07T22:30:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/asset-balance-solutions-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/BiTANewMemberABS-BiTAlogo.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Asset Balance Solutions joins Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Asset Balance Solutions (ABS), a data strategy and visualization consulting company with strong ties to the transportation industry, recently became a member of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA).

Then again, the maritime market has shown a positive reception to blockchain, with large container lines and related startups looking to create blockchain platforms – primarily for container track-and-trace within its supply chain. Blockchain Labs for Open Collaboration (BLOC) is a startup that is working diligently to provide blockchain-based solutions across different verticals, with the primary goal of bridging the gap between the digital and the physical world. BLOC recently collaborated with mining company BHP, Japanese shipping company NYK, and biofuel company GoodFuels, to deliver sustainable biofuel to the BHP-chartered, NYK-owned bulk carrier – all via BLOC’s blockchain fuels assurance platform. “We are funded by Lloyd’s Register Foundation to build blockchain prototypes in the industry within the area of risk and safety. Together with the industry, we look to build consortiums in each of the areas we are focusing on,” said Deanna MacDonald, the CEO of BLOC. “Our first prototype is in bunker tracing. We are essentially looking into how we can provide quality and quantity metric associated with bunker deliveries before 2020, and also help with traceability and transparency within the supply chain.” The year 2020 is crucial, because next year is when the International Maritime Organization (IMO) sulfur-cap regulation comes into effect. The rule states that the bunker fuel that container lines use must not have a sulfur content that exceeds 0.5 percent – a number that is seven-fold less than the current limit. Biofuel produced by GoodFuels is one of the many ways for container lines to navigate IMO 2020 limits, because the sulfur content in biofuel is under the authorized limit.   By tracing and delivering biofuel through its blockchain platform, BLOC has achieved an industry-first, as information of the whole transaction remains embedded within the system. “While working on the pilot, we had numerous challenges coming in from the industry at-large,” said MacDonald. “We were trying to push forward the boundaries of sustainable fuel sources, and furthermore measuring decisions based more than just on the price trend, but also with regard to compliance.” Supply and demand sustainability of biofuels is critical to keep the transactions flowing, as in its absence the application would fall through the cracks. MacDonald explained that there were challenges with bringing fuel to the terminal and into the container ship – mostly to do with coordination at the terminals, transporting fuel containers to the barge and then transferring it to the vessel operators. “We also had to make sure container lines were willing to restructure their ships to suit biofuel. We trained the personnel who would be utilizing the system, those that are essentially performing the bunker fuel delivery,” said MacDonald. “We have not changed the process of bunker fuel delivery nor have we changed the human processes involved in it. It is just about putting the physical process in a digital form, and also ensuring that the information being put in the system is correct.” Verifying data is difficult, because there can be garbage-in-garbage-out instances where false data can be fed into a blockchain system making it immutable. BLOC had to work on identifying the different information sources and delete results that were riddled with inconsistencies to ensure a seamless end-to-end transaction process.  MacDonald spoke about the need to create a standardized framework for regulating data collection, ensuring its sources have integrity, and also on fixing regulations for the utilization of gathered data. This is a place where the open standards developed by the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) would hold meaning, as the designed framework would act as a bedrock for several blockchain pilots that look to track shipments across different modes of transportation, including the maritime industry. MacDonald contended that standardization was essential to induce trust in the system. This is particularly true in regard to the ability to judge the security of the system and to exchange data and assets across supply chains with unwavering faith. “That being said, I don’t think there will be a standard one-size-fits-all model that we can use to exchange data across the supply chain. Each of the applications that are developed now needs us to dive deep every single time, to define each of the features,” she said.","TAGS":"biofuels, BLOC, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Blockchain Labs for Open Collaboration, blockchain logistics, Blockchain logitics, blockchain supply chain, IMO, startup, startups, sulfur cap, sulfur emissions, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Global Supply Chain, Maritime, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-03-06T13:32:45-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/bita/columbia-transport-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/BiTANewMemberPressReleaseGraphic.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Columbia Transport joins BiTA","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Columbia Transport s.r.l. has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA).

The importance of transparency in supply chains can never be stressed enough, with businesses that deal with cargo movement across international borders particularly interested in having eyes on their freight in real-time. Scanlog, which has been rapidly expanding its global reach, finds relevance in the ShipChain platform, because it can help monitor Scanlog’s trucks – from the pickup point to the destination. ShipChain uses blockchain technology at its core and its flagship solution – the smart contract – helps bring transparency and visibility to supply chains, with the company running a successful pilot trial program partnering alongside Perdue Farms. ShipChain’s software can be fully integrated with most of the transportation management software (TMS) systems in the market, and can seamlessly track freight across any mode of transportation. “Our customers expect us to deliver their physical goods on time and in perfect condition, but this is only one part of our job as international transport specialists. Today the flow of information connected to the physical supply chain is of such magnitude and such importance that it requires advanced process management to deal with it timely and accurately,” said Mattias Ljungberg, the CEO of Scanlog. “Since the inception of Scanlog six years ago it has been focused on using the latest technology to assist our co-workers with this task. The agreement with ShipChain is the newest example of our dedication to using state-of-the-art technology to create customer value, and I am very much looking forward to working closely with ShipChain to deepen our partnership further,” he continued. ShipChain’s location sensors would be stuck to the cab of Scanlog’s participating trucks, sending out real-time encrypted GPS data to Scanlog’s on-site office, generating unique data signatures that would be stored on the Ethereum blockchain. ShipChain’s smart contracts would also be useful, because they will remove the need for a third-party to act as an intermediary for contracts struck between Scanlog and its shipper clients. The blockchain at the heart of these smart contracts etch regulations in code and store them within a blockchain framework, making them immutable and transparent to all stakeholders in a transaction. “ShipChain’s advanced blockchain-based logistics visibility system perfectly fits with Scanlog’s supply chain, providing visibility to Scanlog and its clients along the full journey of a shipment,” said John Monarch, the CEO of ShipChain. “We are excited to be entering the European market, and with Scanlog’s reach and volume of shipments, and our technology, we see the prospects of this collaboration as beneficial all around.” The partnership with ShipChain apart, Scanlog has been busy adding technology to its operations. In October 2018, the company inducted ProcessRobot software from Softomotive to its back office, helping to expedite its order booking process and developing a smarter workflow. The software reduces the time spent by personnel on repetitive tasks, with ProcessRobot automating mundane operations, helping the workforce spend their time on more worthwhile tasks.","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain platform, blockchain technology, Europe, logistics, Scanlog, ShipChain, track and trace, Trucking, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Startups, Technology, Trucking, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-02-27T19:45:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/dexfreight-provides-exclusive-access-for-early-adopters-to-its-blockchain-based-logistics-platform","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DexFreight_1-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"dexFreight provides exclusive access for early adopters to its blockchain-based logistics platform","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Decentralized, blockchain-based logistics platform dexFreight launched the dexFreight Early Adopters Program for the trucking industry, calling out to shippers, carriers, brokers and forwarders to work with the company in molding dexFreight’s platform, which is now in the beta development stage. Rajat Rajbhandari, co-founder and CEO of dexFreight, believes this association would be mutually beneficial, as dexFreight would use the real-world expertise of logistics stakeholders to evaluate new and advanced features of its platform, with early adopters getting exclusive access to the initial release versions. “The idea for the Early Adopters Program is to invite companies to work with us, and to get feedback on what they’re looking for, their pain points, and the features they would like to see in our platform. This program is to get companies involved early in our development stage,” said Rajbhandari. Though dexFreight users can post and pick up shipments, negotiate, track and trace freight, and work on payment settlements on the platform, just like any other digital freight marketplace, Rajbhandari explained that the unique selling proposition of the startup was that it was all done through smart contracts and blockchain technology. “We are not a digital broker because we do not take a commission out of those individual transactions. Users can work on those transactions on their own, and we provide some advanced services for monetizing our platform,” said Rajbhandari. “They include invoice factoring, prediction algorithms, on-demand services and opening up the platform for third-party developers.” Last year, dexFreight completed its first blockchain-based shipment using smart contracts, by moving a 5,320 pound frozen food shipment from Preferred Freezer Services in Medley, Florida to Manny’s Enterprises, Inc, in Sunrise, Florida. The objective of the pilot was to understand the nuances related to moving pallets from point A to point B, and the way this movement interacts with the blockchain. Rajbhandari spoke about the challenges that the startup faced while working on the pilot run. For instance, confirming a delivery is critical, and dexFreight had to work on managing the interaction of the confirmation process with the smart contracts. The team also realized that a mobile application was necessary for a truck driver, because that would be the only way for them to get a proof of delivery confirmation to the smart contract, which in turn could trigger payment. In essence, the initial run helped dexFreight understand how humans would interact with a completely digitalized smart contract. With regard to the Early Adopters Program, about 30 companies have signed up so far, with dexFreight looking to add live transactions to the platform in a couple of months. To foster the growth of blockchain, Rajbhandari contended that open frameworks would help – especially in terms of compatibility and interoperability. “We know for a fact that shippers and carriers use multiple platforms, because they work with different companies. So it’s important that blockchain – whatever we implement it on, should be able to talk with somebody else’s blockchain to see if we need to perform asset verification between blockchains,” he said. “Having an open standard or at least an open definition would help. It is not so much about the infrastructure layer, but the application layer – the definition of data points, which would be very helpful.” The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) would be ideal, as the Alliance brings together players from different nodal points within supply chains, to effect an end-to-end system that would help standardize frameworks and regulate the way blockchain is used in the future. dexFreight is now looking at designing a rewards program for its early adopters, including a free token model that would give companies tokens for early collaboration. Rajbhandari trusted that this could help incentivize adoption and also make sure that the platform is in continuous usage. Called dexMiles, the tokens would enable companies to earn, hold and trade the reward currency, thus helping increase the network value. And as with all cryptocurrencies, the value of dexMiles would increase as its demand exceeds supply.","TAGS":"BiTA, BiTA Standards, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, blockchain platform, dexFreight, logistics, pilot trial, startup, startups, Technology, Trucking, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Startups, Technology, Trucking, Truckload Freight, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-02-27T16:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/technology/technology-is-crucial-for-bringing-transparency-to-cold-supply-chains","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Importance_sensors_1-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Technology is crucial for bringing transparency to cold supply chains","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The logistics ecosystem has left much to be desired in regard to transparency in trucking operations, with the industry still relying heavily on archaic five-decade-old electronic data exchange (EDI) technology that creates burdensome time lags in operations, and prevents businesses from gaining real-time insights into the whereabouts of their cargo while in transit. “Technology like EDI prevents immediacy within the industry. And due to this, drivers and carriers see an incentive in not being transparent, and sometimes in not being honest. During instances where we track trucks with sensors, we have seen EDI messages coming in saying a load has been picked up or dropped off, when in reality, the truck possibly might never have been there,” said Vicki Warker, CMO of Savi Technology. “There could be hours between the time that the vehicle was actually physically present at the pickup or drop off location and the reported time.” Warker spoke on how these issues escalate when the freight that is moved needs cold storage. An example would be the pharmaceutical industry – the supply chain of medicines come under tight scrutiny, especially when they need to be maintained in a specific temperature range while being transported. “It is a highly regulated industry, and the best practices in transportation would be to follow the regulations that have been put forth. I think it is about having a clear view of not just the operational process, but how each piece within the end-to-end operations affects the rest,” said Warker. In pharmaceutical manufacturing plants, there exist many crucial process indicators that ensure appropriate supply of ingredients while adhering to quality standards – such as temperature or humidity. However, most of these critical parameters are tracked in siloed environments. “They are tracked at the manufacturing floor, while being packed, and while in transit. But no one tracks what happens during the handoffs; to see if the products are maintained in the prescribed conditions while sitting for days at a port, or perhaps when they are subject to theft or fraud,” said Warker. “The only way to ensure safety is to make sure that there is some sort of end-to-end visibility.” Though there probably is not a one-stop solution to all the logistics issues that plague the industry, a judicious mix of technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and blockchain traceability could help. Warker insisted that blockchain could be the answer in the future to enable end-to-end visibility, as it can act as a central ledger that traces the movement of pharmaceutical goods from manufacturers to suppliers and then finally to the consumers. “Another solution is using sensors, as they are objective. When you get a GPS read from a sensor associated with a cargo, you know that it was physically there at the specific time and at that specific location. There’s no human intervention there, no latency, and there’s a definitive time-stamp,” said Warker. “If you have an environmental sensor, then you also have verification of what the conditions of the cargo were at that time. I think that pairing sensors with technology like blockchain for end-to-end tracking is an exciting possibility.” Recently, Savi helped one of its pharmaceutical clients to avoid having to destroy medicines due to negligence in controlling the storage temperature while in transit. Savi installed sensors on the truck carrying the precious cargo and had enabled geofencing across corridors to stay in touch throughout its journey from the pickup point to its destination. However, while on the road, the truck broke down. It was a Friday, and the distribution center that had to receive the cargo was closing at 2:00 p.m. The issue was further exacerbated by the sensitivity of the medicines, as they had to be stored in a refrigerated condition at a specific temperature – with any deviation from the threshold effectively rendering the drugs unfit for consumption. Through the sensors and its geofencing system, Savi was able to identify the truck breakdown and spoke with the carrier in question. Meanwhile, the carrier management had dispatched another truck to pick up the load from the spot, assuring that there would be no harm done to the cargo. But based on Savi’s estimated time of arrival (ETA) calculations on the second truck, the pharmaceutical company realized that the cargo would not make it on time to the distribution center, and thus asked the carrier to bring the load back to its origin site, where it would be refrigerated for the weekend before embarking again towards its destination. Warker mentioned that this timely intervention helped save the company medicines worth $15 million. “Even if the medicine would not have gone bad while sitting in a parking lot over the weekend, the company would still have to test the medication as per regulations to make sure the cargo did not exceed the temperature threshold. This test would have cost them $1 million in itself. Thus, at a minimum, our technology helped them save $1 million, if not $15 million,” she said. “And I think it is time the leaders in the supply chain space start using technology to do better in terms of visibility and transparency, and to understand what is going on in transit with their cargo – cold chains or not.”","TAGS":"Blockchain, cold storage, cold supply chains, logistics, reefers, Supply chain, supply chain management, supply chain visibility, Technology, Transparency, visibility, visibility solutions, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-02-26T15:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/blockchain-might-be-the-answer-to-brexits-customs-predicament","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shutterstock_1212808054-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain might be the answer to Brexit’s customs predicament","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"As the speculations surrounding Brexit take center stage in the parliamentary affairs of the United Kingdom, the logistical nightmares that a “no-deal Brexit” would bring forth have to be taken into account. The U.K. ports are arguably at the epicenter of trouble, as customs officials would have to contend with remarkably long queuing at the border, as cross-border shipments will have to produce declarations post-Brexit. Though electronic means of submitting customs declarations are possible even before the cargo touches the U.K. shores, it still would be a crippling burden on the customs department – as concerns erupt on it being understaffed to face the impending documentation tsunami post-Brexit. The lengthened processes could spiral into severe backlogs, as officials would have to check documents for authenticity – even if they are submitted electronically. Several reports have surfaced detailing the issues that customs declaration processes could bring forth, the most important of which are the long waiting times at the border and stressful red-tape procedures. Meg Hillier, a Labour Co-operative politician, was quoted last year that such delays could cause queues that stretch over 112 miles from the port of Dover. However, in the aftermath of a hard-Brexit, there might be hope through blockchain technology. Last July, the U.K. government released a whitepaper about its intent to explore “how machine learning and artificial intelligence could allow traders to automate the collection and submission of data required for customs declarations.” Blockchain’s inherent ability to establish a traceable trail of documents for freight – from its point of origin to its movement through several nodes within the supply chain – is helpful as it would not only smooth the customs process, but would also stop people from evading customs duty. Cross-border smuggling is a ubiquitous problem – for instance, smuggled and counterfeit cigarettes cost the country €10 billion a year in lost revenue. The risk of losing customs revenue is very real, and the U.K. government is leaving no stone unturned to make sure it streamlines payment in a way that is impossible to bypass. This was fairly evident from the cryptically worded mention of a certain “chain of transactions” in its whitepaper – a phrase that has blockchain written all over it. That apart, Philip Hammond, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer, also made a suggestion last year about using blockchain to initiate frictionless trade across the Irish border post-Brexit. To create a bankable documentation system that runs over the blockchain, it is essential to define a framework of open standards within the ecosystem that can be commonly used by every stakeholder. Blockchain in Transportation Alliance (BiTA) is one such consortium that is looking to rope in players from different nodal points within supply chains, to effect an end-to-end system that would help standardize the way blockchain is used in the future. Nonetheless, it is important to not look at blockchain as an all-pervasive solution to every problem that is associated with customs declarations. Though blockchain can hold information that is immutable, the onus is still on the officials to make sure it is appropriately implemented. Bad actors can game the system by switching labels or reusing old labels – something that blockchain could not control. To circumvent such issues, goods that are prone to smuggling could be etched with permanent tracking stamps, making them impossible to tamper with. Internet of Things (IoT) could also be experimented with, as technology has shrunk chips to the size of a grain of salt and therefore they can be stuck to crates and cartons without issue. The U.K. government is not the only entity mulling over a possible blockchain application in trade transactions. Blockchain company Nexus surveyed 200 U.K.-based medium and large businesses, finding that more than half of the companies queried were hoping to adopt blockchain in a post-Brexit environment to combat fraud, cut operational costs and improve supply chain efficiency. “With Brexit on the horizon, it’s abundantly clear that many companies are planning to boost use of blockchain technology to reduce risk and create a more accountable working environment,” said Alex El-Nemer, director at Nexus. “The research also indicates that company leaders see blockchain as a vital tool in preparing for a potentially uncertain economic climate.”","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain logistics, blockchain technology, Brexit, Brexit customs, customs, customs checkpoint, customs regulation, hard Brexit, no-deal Brexit, post-Brexit, UK customs, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-02-21T22:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/simba-chain-raises-pre-seed-funding","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Simba-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"SIMBA Chain raises $500,000 in pre-seed funding","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"SIMBA Chain has raised $500,000 in a pre-seed financing round, according to PR Newswire. Backers of the round include Elevate Ventures, the Notre Dame Pit Road Fund, Tracy Graham (chief executive officer of Data Reality) and Hari Agarwal (chief executive officer of AECI International). SIMBA Chain is a cloud-based, blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) platform which enables users to implement decentralized applications (dapps), which don’t require third-party partners to manage. SIMBA Chain will use the recent round of investment to continue developing its BaaS platform to increase the accessibility of blockchain distributed apps. Agarwal will also be joining SIMBA Chain’s board of directors. SIMBA Chain was founded in 2017 with a grant awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to Indiana Technology and Manufacturing Companies (ITMCO) and the Center for Research Computing at the University of Notre Dame. The purpose of the grant was to create a secure messaging and transaction platform for the U.S. military. SIMBA Chain recently secured a contract with the U.S. Air Force to improve its supply chain capabilities according to PR Newswire. “Using SIMBA you can basically use a user interface to create and model your business application,” Joel Neidig, chief executive officer at SIMBA Chain, told Microsoft for Startups. “You define the assets along with the parameters you need, click go, and it automatically writes a smart contract, which is essentially interfaced to the blockchain. It reduces the development time into the blockchain and it enables very fast prototyping and development as well.” “The [Notre Dame] Pit Road Fund is excited to partner with and invest in SIMBA,” said Bryan Ritchie, general partner at the fund. “Their blockchain technology has the potential to eliminate a significant amount of record-keeping, allowing for significant costs savings and a reduction in burdensome paperwork.”","TAGS":"Air Force, Blockchain, blockchain as a service, DARPA, decentralized, financing, funding round, messaging, Military, SIMBA Chain, Supply chain, Third party logistics, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Military, user interface, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-02-19T18:35:41-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/blockchains-disconnect-between-the-could-be-and-the-has-been","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shutterstock_1129353068-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain’s disconnect between the could-be and the has-been","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Though blockchain has been discussed in great detail across the transportation and logistics marketplace, companies have been remarkably subdued when it comes to commercially implementing the technology into their daily operations. The inconsistencies are quite revealing. Businesses understand the inherent advantage blockchain would bring to key functions, ensuring greater visibility, higher capacity utilization, and possibly helping to drive down costs across the system. But yet, blockchain does not seem to inch past highly advertised pilot programs happening across in the supply chain ecosystem. FreightWaves spoke with Andy Schmahl, partner and managing director at BCG, to understand the dissonance between blockchain’s could-be and the has-been. “The paradox of blockchain’s promise is all about creating trust amongst otherwise untrusting parties. The transportation and logistics industries, in particular, require collaboration and coordination of not just bilateral, but multilateral handoffs,” said Schmahl. “The challenge though is about getting those parties to interact with each other, find a common platform, adopt common standards, and feel like everyone is being treated in a fair way – which is increasingly hard,” he continued. Schmahl remarked that it is difficult to create a platform when it revolves around getting stakeholders with conflicting opinions onboard. BCG’s extensive surveys of its clients revealed that businesses were often found to be waiting for a catalyst that could help them address blockchain. To foster blockchain’s growth on a commercial front, government-driven organizations or industry consortiums like the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) have started dialogues with the incumbents, and are finding ways to socialize and become familiar with each other – something which Schmahl believes is a prerequisite for a change in perception. “I think you also need to have some early success stories, but the blockchain pilots until now have proven to be less-than-transformational. This has maybe created a bit of gun-shyness in the industry on whether this could actually help in increasing revenue,” he said. One of the reasons for a passive approach to blockchain is because companies may not have been ambitious enough with their blockchain aspirations. Mistakes have been made with choosing use cases for pilot programs. Schmahl mentioned that in some cases, trivial and straightforward issues were taken up to be solved through blockchain, which in essence, could have been addressed by existing technologies. That apart, trust has traditionally been an issue within the industry, with data-sharing being looked upon as market suicide in certain aspects. To rise above this, it is critical to help businesses quantify risk, and enable them to confidentially share data that in no way would jeopardize its market standing. “Companies need to recognize that a business built over data opacity would not create the best value. Eventually, shippers are going to insist on lower cost moves and demand more information about where their goods are, because they are going to look at optimizing their supply chains,” said Schmahl. “Once the traditional movement of things from one player to another, with idle time in-between for data transfer and verification becomes untenable, blockchains would not just be a novelty but be a central tool to enable cost reduction and increase in transparency across the board.” Schmahl insisted that it is critical to look beyond surface-level issues and truly analyze how blockchain could create value for businesses. It is essential for even the skeptics to try looking at it again – probably in a different light – just to make sure all the possible use cases are exhausted before they give up on blockchain’s premise. Nonetheless, the intention here is not to slight the advent of other promising technologies in the segment. The overarching goal has always been about making supply chains more efficient – in terms of costs, visibility and capacity utilization. Any technology that helps foster that must be welcomed, and by the looks of it, blockchain does take center stage right now – at least on paper.","TAGS":"BCG, BiTA, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Blockchain logitics, blockchain paradox, blockchain supply chain, logistics, Supply chain, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-02-15T23:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/in-the-blockchain-race-supply-chains-stand-to-gain-the-most","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/In_the_blockchain_1-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"In the blockchain race, supply chains stand to gain the most","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The idea of blockchain started out packaged as a use case that attempted to replace government-regulated fiat currency with cryptocurrency. However, it has expanded dramatically since then, with use cases being identified across a myriad of segments including finance, energy, supply chain and defense. In all likelihood, cryptocurrency could be called a precursor to the potential of blockchain, a use case that made people sit up and take notice about an underlying technology so promising that it could revolutionize the way we look at privacy and digital transparency. Blockchain, by definition, is an immutable distributed ledger. Put in layman terms, blockchain can store and relay information in a secure manner, with its content being distributed and controlled by all the stakeholders in a network. No single stakeholder can claim absolute authority over the network, nor can any single party edit information stored in the system without the explicit consent of every other stakeholder in the system. This ensures visibility and transparency – two vital parameters that have remained elusive across many segments for decades. Though blockchain brings in a reasonable amount of sophistication to different verticals, it makes sense only in scenarios where it can be integrated seamlessly with minimal disruption to everyday operations. A Gartner report analyzed the hiccups that different industries would face while implementing blockchain, and pointed out that 75 percent of public blockchain programs would suffer from “privacy poisoning” – an issue complicated by privacy laws and government regulations. However, even in the midst of such issues, there are only good things to say about blockchain adoption in the transportation and logistics sector. In many ways, blockchain would be a perfect solution to many issues that plague the industry – opacity across network nodes, an extremely fragmented marketplace, multiple stakeholders and mediocre visibility. Take the case of trucking, for instance. Trucking is a massive industry in the U.S., accounting for over $720 billion in annual revenue, representing 81.5 percent of the country’s total freight bill. The sector suffers from severe fragmentation, with 90 percent of the trucking fleets owning six or fewer trucks. These extremes create a situation where shippers lack transparency into available trucking capacity, while truckers log thousands of deadhead miles, missing out on hauling opportunities due to network opacity. Blockchain, if appropriately implemented, would help to bridge this disconnect. To bring this to fruition, it is essential to create blockchain standards for the industry, by working alongside all the stakeholders who take part in the marketplace. A non-profit association, the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), is working to create open blockchain standards for the industry at large, by pooling in hundreds of stakeholders across the world, and constructing a framework over which blockchain applications can be developed. The key here is “open standards” – which essentially means that any company willing to build a blockchain application can do so without worrying about proprietary issues or infringement laws. Despite the efforts of BiTA and others, blockchain implementation does come with its share of complexities. For starters, blockchain can only be effective if all the stakeholders in the ecosystem trust the framework and share information without being suspect of data safety. Much needs to be done to convince businesses to trust blockchain and provide the necessary information; an exercise that could take a while. Companies must also move towards data standardization, wherein all the data that is captured would have the same yardstick of measurement, making it easier for data to be shared and attributed with an intrinsic value. SAP conducted a survey last year, asking its clients about their willingness to work on blockchain-related pilot programs. An overwhelming number of responses were positive, with 84 percent of the queried companies already involved in building use cases around blockchain. Though a large portion of these pilot runs has still not translated into commercial applications, the engagement with blockchain can be taken as a step in the right direction. Supply chains have much to gain from blockchain applications, especially the ones where consumer health is at stake – like those involving the pharmaceutical or food supply chains. Blockchain paired with the industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs) could help prevent bad actors from injecting counterfeit or expired products in the mix. Technological advancement has shrunk some IIoT devices to become smaller than a grain of salt. These devices can be attached to products as they move along the supply chain, helping to identify their origin and the stakeholders it passes through. Storing this information on a blockchain network would help not just with visibility, but also with transparency – reducing the friction between shippers and consumers. The future of blockchain in the freight industry depends heavily on industrial cluster adoption and the reception it gets from each facet of the supply chain. On paper, blockchain does appear to be a technology that is tailor-made for the freight market, but it remains to be seen how effective its translation will be in real-world applications.","TAGS":"BiTA, BiTA Standards, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Blockchain logitics, blockchain standards, blockchain supply chain, blockchain technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Trucking, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-02-08T17:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/technology/canada-cargo-conference-technology","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/lunchpanel-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Consolidation in transportation technology is on the horizon: Vancouver panel","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"On a stage full of market participants who are offering various technology solutions to the transportation sector, there was basic agreement on one thing – big change through consolidation is coming in the structure of the companies now serving the industry. In particular, Devlin Fenton, the CEO of freight matching app Go99, said you need to look no further than other industries to see where things might be headed. There are markets where the key online platforms have been reduced to three players, “and I would imagine this would happen in the transport space,” Fenton told a panel during lunch at the Canadian Cargo conference in Vancouver. (Full disclosure: I was the moderator of the panel.) Scott Shannon, the vice president of North America Surface Transportation for C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW), noted that the consolidation wave already hit the load board industry years ago. “There were hundreds of them and that has been whittled down to a few core high- performing companies,” he said. C.H. Robinson now regularly exchanges information with them, though at one time, he reminded the audience, load boards were going to put companies like C.H. Robinson out of business. Fenton’s company in particular is in a fiercely competitive sector of the trucking and transport world – apps that are used to match carriers and shippers, a market that has a big carrier at its center (J.B. Hunt with its Hunt 360 platform) and numerous other participants, including those at third-party logistics (3PL) companies. Fenton said there has been plenty of investment interest in the field, with millions of dollars flowing into some of the larger companies. “It is a massive space for us to compete in.” Fenton said of the number of other companies seeking market share. But at the same time, the size of the customer base – shippers, carriers and 3PLs who need the applications – ”is inordinately large, in the hundreds of billions of dollars.” But there’s differentiation, he said, pushing back against the moderator’s question regarding whether all the tools did the same basic thing. Fenton wryly noted that in Africa, not all lions think they’re competing with all the other lions. Fenton said Go99 has attempted to differentiate itself by different workflows, specializing in certain types of cargoes as well as certain types of lanes. “What anybody in the space will tell you is if you’re active in a certain type of commodity or certain lanes, you will find those who move in those circles,” he said of the benefits of differentiation. When you’re in a field like that, “you benefit from the entire aggregation rather than just the network you had access to,” according to Fenton. Without going into specifics, Fenton also said the Go99 app is heavily oriented toward “the way we move money. It makes us more of a financial transaction company rather than a freight company,” he said. Another growing area for technology applications in the sector is artificial intelligence (AI), the basis for the platform offered by Teknowlogi. The company’s founder and CEO, Spencer Askew, a member of the panel, described his AI offering as “super neutral and very agnostic” that can work with existing platforms rather than trying to displace them. The lunch panel’s focus was on e-commerce, and Askew described some of the types of things that the AI offering of Teknowlogi can do. He described it as producing a newspaper dated one month in the future. “You need intelligence to predict buyer and seller behavior,” Askew said, so taking AI and laying it on existing transportation management systems (TMS) upgrades that TMS to what he called a “terminal logistics expert system.” And when that happens, Askew said, it allows the entire organization “to start predicting.” Shannon of C.H. Robinson reminded the audience several times that at the end of the process, people remain. And when digitization and automation have displaced more manual labor processes, “it leaves the strategizing to us.” Robinson has numerous freight-matching apps offered through its Navisphere brand, having been in the freight matching business for more than 15 years. “They’re specific for carriers, we have another for drivers and what it does it puts information into the hands of people like you who will be making the decisions,” Shannon said, returning to the theme of people being ultimately at the root of the business. Shannon agreed with the need to connect that information seamlessly into telematics, but made an argument for a bigger company like Robinson being in the best position to do so. “Having the scale to do that is critically important,” he said. With all the apps and new platforms flying around, Dean Croke, chief insight officer at FreightWaves, reminded the audience that technology developments seem to be ignoring one of the most important apps of all: the electronic logging device (ELD). Most drivers are using that as their only technology platform, and if they’ve got an app that asks them to rate the performance of, for example, conditions at the distribution center of a shipper, they’re not likely to engage a second app beyond their ELD. “Everyone is trying to invent the killer app and they won’t be used,” Croke said. “If I was inventing something today, I’d be working with the ELD manufacturers to provide that level of transparency.” Croke also regularly represents’ FreightWaves’ Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) on panels, and this one was no different. BiTA’s primary goal is to help create standards in the industry, and they can be very granular, even down to the level of how dates are entered into spreadsheets that might later be distributed along a blockchain platform. Fenton said that Go99 is working to get “blockchain ready.” That can include things similar to what Croke described. He cited as one example the simple act of how does one save a presentation in PowerPoint or other applications.","TAGS":"Artificial intelligence, BiTA, C.H.

The nomination process opened earlier this month and will close on March 1. There are no restrictions on nominations; a shipper can nominate itself or other shippers, and carriers may also nominate shippers. A shipper is defined as a company that sends or transports goods by sea, land or air. Nominations are an open call via www.freightwaves.com, www.bita.studio, and/or www.truckload.org. There are no restrictions on nominations other than the nomination form must be completed and submitted via one of the three aforementioned websites. “The Shipper of Choice Award will increase transparency and highlight innovative best practices that keep freight moving,” said Craig Fuller, founder and CEO of FreightWaves. “We are very appreciative that Convoy agrees, and has become the sponsor of this award. The phrase ‘shipper of choice’ is often used, but for the first time, industry members will nominate and vote on the best shippers and they will be quantified and ranked.”  Just three years after its founding in Seattle by two former Amazon executives, Convoy has become a powerful nationwide trucking network and platform for both shippers and carriers. The company reached a unicorn valuation and was voted #4 in the 2018 Freight.Tech 25. The idea behind Convoy is relatively simple – automate the time-consuming, error-prone process of matching loads to trucks. Eliminating human intermediaries through its app, Convoy offers the most dynamic services to its shipper customers and passes through more money to its carriers. Its breakthrough app and several services introduced in 2018 help to reinforce Convoy’s mission “to transport the world with endless capacity and zero waste.” “We are thrilled to be working with FreightWaves to recognize forward-looking shippers at a time of profound change and exciting innovation in freight management,” said Dan Lewis, Convoy CEO. “The Shipper of Choice Award highlights shippers who are leading the way, along with best practices that can benefit the industry.” “This award fills a large void in our industry,” TCA President John Lyboldt said. “Too often, industry participants focus on the negative – what’s wrong with our collective supply chains. The Shipper of Choice Award focuses on the positive, and we expect shippers to seek out this recognition. It is complementary to TCA’s work with the Best Fleets to Drive For initiative – recognizing those carriers doing culture-building things for their employees and contractors.” Representatives from FreightWaves, BiTA, TCA and the greater broker community make up a selection committee to narrow nominations down to the Shipper of Choice 100. From there, carrier members in good standing from BiTA and TCA will vote on the Shipper of Choice 25. Arlen Stark, FreightWaves’ Executive Vice President of Research, said, “All three organizations – FreightWaves, BiTA and TCA – are proud to begin this award, and look forward to the announcement of the winners!” Katz, Sapper \u0026 Miller (KSM) will manage the Shipper of Choice vote to ensure a credible and independent process. KSM managed voting for FreightWaves’ Freight.Tech 25 Award in 2018. Tim Almack, partner-in-charge of KSM’s Transportation Services Group, said, “KSM is honored to assist FreightWaves, TCA and BiTA recognize America’s top shippers. The Shipper of Choice Award honors those shippers who not only know what is important to carriers and their drivers, but also bridge the knowing-doing gap and actually take actions to collaboratively work with carriers and drivers to eliminate inefficiencies in the supply chain.” Voting for the Shipper of Choice Award will open on March 10th via www.freightwaves.com, www.bita.studio, and www.truckload.org in conjunction with the 81st Annual TCA Convention in Las Vegas (March 10-13). Voting will close on May 1st, and winners will be announced on May 8th at FreightWaves’ Transparency19. The award reveal in Atlanta will be delivered via a sealed envelope presentation by KSM. To vote, carriers will complete a short five-question survey on each shipper, ranking qualities such as flexibility and detention on a five-star scale, with possible total score of 25 points. The shipper with the highest score will receive first place while runners-up will be awarded based on score. “Each shipper will have shown its commitment to the professional driving force by providing accessible facilities, treating drivers professionally, optimizing a driver’s time by keeping detention to a minimum, and by providing consistent processes for loading/unloading,” Stark explained. “To be a Shipper of Choice, each shipper will have proven to be the best at their part in the supply chain.” Following Transparency19, FreightWaves’ editorial staff will publish a feature article on each Shipper of Choice.","TAGS":"BiTA, Convoy, Shipper of choice, Truckload Carriers Association, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Truck Driver Issues, Trucking, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-02-06T17:04:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/technology/blockchain-as-a-business-startup-inxeption-builds-futuristic-ecommerce-platform","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock_159799598-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain-as-a-business startup Inxeption builds futuristic ecommerce platform","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain has had an impact on logistics businesses looking to work on the edge of technology, as it can bring in transparency and accountability into supply chain operations. Inxeption, a California-based startup has developed an ecommerce platform built over blockchain, allowing business-to-business (B2B) companies to sell products online. “It is an integrated platform that takes you all the way from product definition to the actual transaction, followed up by marketing,” said Farzad Dibachi, CEO and co-founder of Inxeption. Dibachi outlined three different applications that act as the platform’s fulcrum. “The first one is what we call the product ledger. This becomes the system of record for the company to keep the product definition in, while allowing collaboration between the buyer and the seller around the product,” he said. The second element of the software is called the “super cart” – Inxeption’s take on the conventional shopping cart, by adding features to it apart from it acting as a basket for transactions. Dibachi described it to be a cross between a shopping cart and a chat box; something that can communicate and collaborate between stakeholders while also working out the transactions. “The third element of the software is analytics, which provides data on who is buying, what they are buying, and where they are coming from. We combine all the three applications and combine them onto a single platform,” said Dibachi. “It has been 15 months since we founded the company, and we’ve signed up about 125 customers. We are also announcing a partnership with UPS for our logistics services.” In essence, Inxeption’s core competency lies in helping people sell things online, and its recently cemented association with UPS is strategic to its interests as that helps sort out the logistics needs of its clients. “UPS has made an equity investment in Inxeption. We are working with them to make the process of logistics as simple as possible for our customers,” said Dibachi. The idea is to have an ecommerce platform that can dynamically change in real-time. For instance, if a product manager modifies the product definition, it immediately shows up on the ecommerce website, and he can use the analytics to see client movement on the platform – where they are and what they are looking to buy. Using this, businesses can dynamically change prices, making it more likely for consumers to buy the products they view. “All you need to do is bring your product to the table, and we will put all the other services and software pieces together for you to be able to sell that product online. You can think of us like a distribution-in-a-box,” said Dibachi. The product market fit of Inxeption is beyond doubt as the company was borne out of Dibachi’s personal need, when he was running an LED lighting business. “The idea for the software got started when we were trying to take the LED lighting company online. We started writing code for the company, and it turned out to be the precursor to our product definition tool,” he said. Inxeption’s clients range from companies making $500,000 in yearly revenue to multi-billion dollar a year businesses. What pulls them towards Inxeption is the ease at which it removes the internal organizational silos that slow down growth and induce operational redundancy. “If you want to sell a product online, you need a design engineer, manufacturing engineer, people from product management, marketing and sales – everyone needs to be involved before a product is put up. These are silos that slow things down,” said Dibachi. “It takes products a long time to get to the market. With our platform, product managers can directly enter the market and see their customers’ reaction. This is something that is exciting to our customers, as they don’t need intermediaries any longer to make changes.”","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain as a business, blockchain technology, ecommerce, ecommerce platform, Investment, Inxeption, startup, Technology, UPS, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-01-29T14:16:09-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/deringer-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BiTA2BNew2BMember2BPress2BRelease2BGraphic2B281529-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Deringer joins the Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A.N.

However, even though the basic premise behind blockchain is promising, implementation has been a cause for concern. For instance, creating a sustainable blockchain system for supply chain operations would necessitate the participation of all the stakeholders involved – an arduous task in itself. Blockchain-based platforms could act as a springboard for pilot programs that target niche verticals, giving businesses the flexibility to work with the technology, rather than building everything from scratch. In that regard, Citizens Reserve, a California-based high-tech startup has announced a partnership with Smartrac, a leader in radio frequency identification (RFID) products and IoT solutions, in utilizing blockchain technology to make supply chains more efficient, transparent and secure. A few months back, Citizens Reserve launched its SUKU platform, an industry-agnostic ecosystem that was developed to upgrade antiquated supply chain solutions. “SUKU was formed for the supply chain as we know them today – the one that has issues with multiple parties, systems and models,” said Yonathan Lapchik, CIO of Citizens Reserve. “We started with building track and trace solutions that could work for supply chains across various industries – be it vaccines, soybeans or electronics. We created a decentralized marketplace that has an open peer-to-peer market where suppliers, distributors and manufacturers can come and sell with almost no fees.” Citizens Reserve’s partnership with Smartrac allows it to utilize blockchain technology to improve the track and trace of goods from supplier to retailer. Smartrac’s proprietary platform, SmartCosmos, assigns physical items a digital identity that allows them to be traced accurately along the supply chain. This, when paired with SUKU, will not only help businesses with track and trace, but also to store data on an immutable and decentralized ledger. “The idea was to create something like an App Store of services and applications that will help the customer work through supply chains without the need for jumping from one system to another. Supply chains of today are broken, with multiple systems for a single operation. We are looking to integrate all these services and be a unique supply chain channel,” Lapchik said. Lapchik insisted that supply chains struggle with connecting physical assets to a digital identity. “There is a gap between the physical and digital space. If I own a cow, and I’m selling it to someone, he should be able to verify data about that cow. For instance, where the cow is from, was it crop-fed and did its food come from organic sources,” he said. “Through a digital ID that cannot be changed or corrupted, we can always verify the details of the physical asset.” Citizens Reserve does not consider blockchain companies working in the supply chain space to be competitors, but as opportunities to work with and integrate. “No one company can integrate everything within every supply chain. Businesses speak about their value proposition to their clients, but to really solve supply chain problems globally and to transform how commerce is done, you need to embrace services,” said Lapchik. “Many of us at Citizens Reserve come from Deloitte Blockchain and have been working with enterprise and Fortune 500 companies, developing solutions and integrating services. One of our key differentiators is that know-how to integrate. ” The SUKU platform has a layered architecture which Lapchik believes would enable its community and technology partners to develop and integrate to the platform’s features. “If you look at the architecture of our supply chain, you have the infrastructure at the first level, then a blockchain protocol layer, and finally the apps and services that are developed by the community for specific needs,” he explained. Citizens Reserve is gaining momentum quickly, with offices set up across California, as well as in Miami, Naples, Atlanta and Bangalore. Apart from the partnership with Smartrac that it announced today, it has also joined hands with Blockdaemon, a blockchain orchestration platform, to support enterprise adoption of SUKU by allowing customers to easily deploy nodes and connect to their blockchain protocol of choice within minutes.","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain technology, Citizens Reserve, startups, Supply chain, supply chain as a service, Supply chain disruption, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-01-22T18:33:37-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/daseke-joins-bita-announcement","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BiTANewMemberPressReleaseGraphic-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Daseke Joins Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Daseke, Inc., the largest flatbed, specialized transportation and logistics solutions company in North America, has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an industry group working to develop standards and promote the effective use of the emerging technology.

About 60 were BiTA members and 40 were nonmembers. CarrierDirect sponsored the event and led off talking about how technology can improve the supply chain. Their interest in blockchain and technology in general and interoperability. The enthusiasm was infectious. The event ran over the regularly scheduled time with an abundance of questions and interest in the talking points. “BiTA is a great organization to partner with; we’re fortunate to co-host the first BiTA Meet-Up. The fact that we’re seeing competition for blockchain signals adoption which is why we had almost 100 attendees from shippers, 3PLs, carriers, tech companies and others,” said Peter Rentschler, CEO of CarrierDirect. “CarrierDirect’s mission is to modernize transportation. We believe that blockchain technology will enable a more efficient and profitable future for the ecosystem. Practical applications that prove ROI will drive adoption,” added Rentschler. “The questions we heard at the event mirrors what our clients ask us: what is the ROI and when should I care about blockchain?” In many respects those questions were addressed. “While most companies are in the exploratory phase of blockchain, we’re starting to see more and more people taking action on blockchain.” “Blockchain is most impactful when a network of people are participating,” said Rentschler. “While Carriers and 3PLs are exploring and investing in the technology, full scale adoption will likely take shippers and/or regulation unless a significant ROI can be identified.” “While Blockchain is at highest value in a network of participants, there are opportunities to make short-term impact like document verification when freight changes hands or moves across borders,” said Rentschler. “It’s hard to imagine a world in the near future where blockchain isn’t a part of day to day business transaction.” Others FreightWaves reached out to had similar reactions. “The BiTA meetup was a great opportunity to connect with professionals across many different industries, from software companies to shippers. We are all learning more about how blockchain will play a role in our businesses as the technology progresses and it is helpful to have an organization like BiTA to provide guidance,” said Will Jenkins, co-founder and head of people development at MOLO Solutions. “I was fortunate to be able to attend the first local BiTA meetup in its history,” said Scott Harper, CEO of boxbit. “The crowd validated BiTA’s intuition that Chicago would be a good place to start. We had a great sample of 3PLs, Carriers and Shippers, along with technology providers, and plenty of time to mingle and network. Our Carrier Direct hosts did a great job with the venue, the food, and the keynote presentation on the value of blockchain. Many thanks to the BiTA team for coming to Chicago and making a great evening possible.” Brian Jenkins, BusinessBlock director of communications, said, “The BiTA Meet-Up provided a terrific opportunity to meet executives from a variety of logistics companies, all with a common interest: to make the flow of information in the shipping industry — and thereby the flow of goods — more efficient, more transparent and more reliable. The presentation from our hosts at Carrier Direct was informative and concise, allowing time for several questions and then more networking. Well done, BiTA organizers. The evening exceeded my expectations!” “We’re excited to continue the series across the U.S.,” said Lincoln Duff, director of membership engagement of BiTA.","TAGS":"BiTA, BiTA Standards, Blockchain, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-01-18T20:55:10-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/blockchain-could-be-the-answer-to-stopping-child-labor-in-congo-cobalt-mines","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock_180430439.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain could be the answer to stopping child labor in Congo cobalt mines","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Though the concept of blockchain could not be any simpler, the same cannot be said of its adoption, as it requires stakeholders along the supply chain to work together. This has led to numerous trials by companies large and small, some skepticism and few commercial blockchain applications in use at this time. Nonetheless, some situations warrant immediate intervention, as traditional operations fail to provide accountability or are extremely opaque processes that are economically unviable. An example is the sourcing of cobalt, a trace element mined in the depths of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) – a country that has 60 percent of the world’s known cobalt reserves. The focal point of the issues that stem from mining cobalt is not the supply chain complexities. It has more to do with the impact the mining creates on the environment and the appalling human rights violations that exist in what is one of the poorest nations on the planet. Cobalt is an expensive element, and this tempts the impoverished locals to work in mines, often extracting the ore without gloves or masks. Companies in the DRC mining business are also known for employing underaged children, a practice that is vehemently opposed by human rights’ activists, but is covertly done all the same. It is here that blockchain could be used, forcing the mines to come clean on their practices and bringing greater accountability to the cobalt supply chain. Cobalt is a small but necessary “ingredient” in the lithium-ion batteries that power electric vehicles (EVs), making its mining very important to the original equipment manufacturers of EVs. As an increasing number of consumers clamor to replace gasoline-powered cars with their electric counterparts, a consistent and predictable supply of cobalt is critical to satisfying that demand. Ford Motor Company is taking the first steps to increase transparency in the mining process, by using blockchain to trace and validate cobalt production process – a way to curb illegal practices and willful exploitation. Ford is working with Huayou Cobalt, IBM, RCS Global, and LG Chem for this blockchain pilot. The pilot program has been built atop IBM’s blockchain platform powered by Linux’s Hyperledger Fabric and its users are established at every node across the supply chain. “We remain committed to transparency across our global supply chain. By collaborating with other leading industries in this network, our intent is to use state-of-the-art technology to ensure materials produced for our vehicles will help meet our commitment to protecting human rights and the environment,” said Lisa Drake, vice president of global purchasing and powertrain operations at Ford. The pilot will create an immutable ledger that tracks cobalt produced at Huayou’s mine site, which would then move to the smelters of LG Chem in South Korea (cobalt is a by-product of copper production), finally making its way to a Ford production plant in the U.S. The network would follow the sourcing standards developed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The pilot is expected to run for the next few months until mid-2019. Upon successful completion, the program will be expanded to include other battery metals and raw materials, including minerals such as tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold – as many of these elements are sourced from conflict regions or are burdened by the weight of crony capitalism. That said, blockchain is not a solution that would be tailor-made to every supply chain issue that exists. The technology is still nascent and needs to be proven before it can be a viable alternative to the traditional methods of storing and sharing data across supply chains. And it is in this capacity that organizations like the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) would be of use, as it brings together hundreds of companies working in the logistics and transportation space, helping channel efforts and creating open standards for a more seamless blockchain adoption.","TAGS":"Blockchain, child labor, Cobalt, cobalt mines, cobalt mining, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, exploitation, Ford Motor Company, Hyperledger Fabric, IBM, OECD, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-01-18T13:53:57-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/equipment/experiencing-the-detroit-auto-show","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2019_Auto_Show_5_2-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The Detroit Auto Show is all about the “shiny stuff”","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"DETROIT. Not everyone is a Detroit Auto Show veteran, although based on the number of media at the Cobo Center this week for the media preview ahead of the official opening of the show, there are probably very few of us left. Walking the show floor at the Detroit Auto Show is an experience that transforms you from the here and now to visions of the future. My first visit to the show has been both exciting and educational. There have also been a few hiccups along the way, like the fact that no one can drink the water, and it has nothing to do with the Flint water crisis. Seems a water main break occurred in the area and rendered the water undrinkable. Hotels are giving out bottles of water to use for brushing teeth and other uses. A minor inconvenience. As to the show itself, it has been everything I expected an auto show to be – plenty of new vehicles, innovative concept vehicles, and fancy technology to go around. Or, as my wife likes to say, “lots of shiny stuff to distract you.” Inside the show is a section dubbed autoMOBILI-D, sponsored by PlanetM. Companies in this space cross the spectrum from startups like Phoenix Contact to established companies like Eaton Corp. There is a section dedicated to universities and associations. The one thing all these companies and universities have in common is that they are working on innovative technological solutions to the problems of tomorrow, and in some cases, even today. As expected, these include autonomous mobility, electrification, and blockchain. For instance, Phoenix Contact [bs1] is pitching its vehicle charging solutions. Utilizing glycol as a coolant within the charging cord to keep heat down, the company says it can fully charge a vehicle using a 500,000 watt DC charger in about 20 minutes, giving the vehicle a 600-mile effective range. Also in the electric space, GBatteries is working to not only charge vehicles, but to extend the life of the batteries. According to the company, each fast charge of a battery – regardless of size – reduces the battery’s effective life. By providing a fast charge up to a point and then backing down before repeating, the GBatteries solution is able to restore battery life. In an electric vehicle test, it said that a manufacturer verified that a repeated 66 minute fast charge of the vehicle resulted in only 17 cycles of the battery. In its test, GBatteries said it was able to fast charge that same battery in 55 minutes and maintain 110 cycles. The company is now in discussion with several automakers with demonstration tests expected this year with hopes of a working product by 2020. It is scalable up to large commercial vehicle batteries, too. It may be the auto show, but there are companies here with freight solutions as well. Intrepid Control Systems offers a device called the OBD2 Professional. Connecting with Amazon’s Alexa and working over Amazon Web Services, the device provides a low cost way to collect vehicle performance data. Rob Pilat, senior sales engineer, said the platform gives those with basic IT backgrounds (“You don’t need to be a programmer”) the ability to build custom solutions using the data the tool can provide. This could allow fleets to bypass more expensive fleet management systems, he said. There was also a startup competition at the show. Startups pitched their companies to a panel of judges, which selected winners that would be given a chance to meet with investors from Techstars, a large global venture fund. One company that won was Alchemy, which makes coatings for lenses and lights to prevent frost from forming. This is important as sensors and cameras become an integral part of advanced driver-assistance systems. Frost buildup can prevent the systems from working properly. Techstars also hosted a reception one evening, affording startup companies the chance to mingle with each other and potential investors. The Detroit Auto Show has always been about the latest and greatest in new vehicle technology, but it is now also about the latest in innovative solutions that not only are transforming the way we drive, but also the way we connect with each other and our surroundings. And there are still enough shiny things to keep me interested.","TAGS":"autonomous vehicles, Detroit Auto Show, Innovation, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Autonomous Vehicles, Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Trucking Equipment, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-01-16T15:30:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/tracking-company-sees-trust-in-blockchain-solution","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/autopartsshutterstock-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Startup company sees trust in blockchain-based asset tracking solution","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"DETROIT. As industry begins to operate in a world expecting transparency, companies that can deliver that for both assets and individual products – and to do so with absolute trust – have an opportunity to be early leaders in the space. 14bis Supply Tracking is hoping to be that company. Founded by Eleanor Mitch, CEO, and Alexis Dames, CMO, the Houston-based startup is building a tracking solution, putting it on a blockchain, and integrating with back-office systems to remove multiple steps in the process. “We provide the interoperability so you don’t have to pull the information into an Excel document,” Mitch explained to FreightWaves at the company’s booth at the Automobili-D section of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The company got its start in 2017 by building a prototype for the U.S. Air Force. It received its seed funding from Techstars. Mitch said 14bis is now looking for companies looking for data management or parts management solutions to expand testing. The 14bis solution also provides analytics and a visual representation of where the asset/product is and was throughout the process. Mitch said that anything that can be tagged – either digitally or physically – can be tracked. The main difference between existing technologies is the ability to provide the tracking information on blockchain, which offers a trusted and secure method of ensuring that information is correct. “We provide the additional benefits of blockchain,” Mitch said. “We create the middleware and can integrate with blockchain.” Mitch went on to say that the solution can handle both structured and unstructured data and easily pushes the information into any ERP system. Within the freight industry, everything from parcels to pallets to equipment could be tracked. Mitch also noted the billions of dollars of counterfeit auto parts that flow into the supply chain each year – a problem that also permeates the trucking supply chain. “We can provide the security [with blockchain] to help companies protect their identities,” she said. The company’s previous work in the aerospace sector earned it a mention by Insight Success Magazine as one of the 10 Most Innovative Aviation and Aerospace Solution Providers for 2018. In the recent Aviation Blockchain Challenge, sponsored by SAP.IO and Lufthansa, 14bis was named the winner of the supplier challenge.","TAGS":"14bis Tracking Solutions, Blockchain, Counterfeit products, Freight, Manufacturing, Supply chains, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Startups, Technology, Trucking, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-01-15T23:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/blockchains-relevance-in-track-and-trace-across-aviation-and-maritime-industries","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Blockchain_in_aviation-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain’s relevance in track-and-trace across aviation and maritime industries","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Though much of the clamor behind cryptocurrency abated over the last year, the legitimacy of the blockchain technology that fuels the currency is beyond doubt. Blockchain is now in different levels of adoption across various verticals, as businesses run pilot tests to see how well it fits their niche. One such use case would be track-and-trace of ships and aircraft, which has been a long-standing problem in the maritime and aviation industries, particularly in regard to accidents and lost cargo. The World Shipping Council estimated that 568 containers on average were lost at sea each year between 2008 and 2016, excluding catastrophic events. The number balloons to 1,582 containers lost every year when catastrophic events are taken into account. Cargo is not the only thing to be lost forever, with a poignant example being the MH370 aircraft crash into the Indian Ocean in 2014. The debris hunt following the disaster cost the Malaysian government upwards of $70 million, but the elaborate year-long seabed exploration had little to show for it, with the circumstances that led to the crash still inconclusive. MH370’s black box, a device that stores critical flight information at the time of an incident, was never found either. Efforts have been made to let ground stations store information coming in from aircraft, rather than storing them on black boxes – but all in vain. Pilot associations have been vocal against the idea, as storing data in the cloud or transmitting it could mean that the data might be hacked, unlike having it stored in a physical database on the flight which is relatively safer (in that regard). The backlash that resulted led to the idea being dropped altogether. The situation in the maritime industry is no different. The International Maritime Organization mandates all vessels to have a Voyage Data Recorder (VDR) onboard. The VDR is an instrument that continuously records critical information coming from the ship operations, which has a 12-hour window for recording, after which new data coming in is written over the previously stored data. VDRs, much like the aircraft black boxes, are hard to retrieve in case of a major catastrophe, making it hard for monitoring organizations to learn what went wrong. BlocBox, a Singapore-based startup, seeks to solve this problem by using blockchain to collect and encrypt information that is stored locally (on airplanes and ships) – as is the case in black boxes and VDRs – and transmit it to an immutable ledger platform that makes it safe for data storage and retrieval. The real-time data is encrypted and transmitted through satellite infrastructure, with only the office in charge of operations having access to the data being stored. As this process is powered through blockchain, data can be accessed instantly and at a negligible cost, making it easier for risk mitigation teams to process information rapidly in the event of a disaster and hasten to an accident site. Blockchain has made significant inroads in the transportation industry, especially in the maritime industry as it remains fomented in chaos, with hundreds of stakeholders oscillating around in its supply chain. Major container lines like CMA CGM and COSCO Shipping have joined together to form a consortium called the Global Shipping Business Network (GSBN) that would work on creating an open platform based on blockchain’s distributed ledger technology. Maersk has partnered with IBM to introduce TradeLens, a platform that uses blockchain to streamline the global maritime network. Meanwhile, with nearly 500 members from over 25 countries, the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) is at the forefront of open blockchain standards, looking to drive the adoption of distributed ledger technology into mainstream transport operations. Consortiums are key in this framework, because without collaboration the concept of blockchain is meaningless. Different verticals within the transportation industry would need to work hand-in-glove with stakeholders to make seamless track-and-trace a reality – potentially saving the industry millions of dollars and hundreds of man-hours in redundant operations.","TAGS":"aviation, BiTA, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, blockchain technology, international maritime industry, Maritime, maritime industry, startup, Technology, track and trace, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Air Cargo, Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Maritime, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2019-01-11T14:09:55-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/bita-to-use-ieee-standards","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/BiTAISTO-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BiTA appoints IEEE-ISTO for standards","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an organization dedicated to determining best practices and standards for blockchain in the transportation industry, announces that it is working with the IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization (ISTO) to assist the Alliance in its standards activities.

In the supply chain, blockchain enables participants to more effectively track goods and freight and to operate in a more seamless and transparent manner. It can also help to create new revenue streams and value for customers by enabling a system to complete transactions, track shipments, and manage fleets. “Ruan joined BiTA because we are excited to be part of the conversation about the development of blockchain standards in transportation,” said Ruan’s Director of IT Nehru Cheddie. “The possibilities blockchain holds for transparency and visibility, efficiency gains, and reducing auditing needs are truly compelling within such a complex industry.” Ruan’s six-person internal Blockchain Forum meets bi-weekly to educate the membership on blockchain technology. The team is working to deploy a prototype blockchain in 2019 to prove out the technology. “It is our goal to educate our team on the capabilities of blockchain technology and provide our customers with the most efficient, transparent service possible,” said Cheddie. About Ruan Founded in 1932, Ruan is a family-owned transportation management company, providing Dedicated Contract Transportation, Supply Chain Solutions, and Value-added Warehousing to customers across the country.

With an average payment time of 45 days, a faster method of invoicing shippers so trucking companies can “manage their cash flow and continue to pay their truckers, their employees and keep the lights on,” is needed, stated Bill McGraw, president of Northstar Venture Technologies. Enter Northstar’s blockchain solution, Settlement Trust. As demonstrated at MarketWaves 18, McGraw says Settlement Trust records all stages in a contract’s fulfillment so that invoices are generated more rapidly. During the demonstration, Settlement Trust was integrated with order and delivery management software from Routeique. Routeique’s chief executive Mike Allen says his company looked to Northstar “to bring us into the blockchain world without remaking the software and to make us more interoperable – creating that level of trust with others in the market.” Routeique’s software, which is used by large food manufacturers, distributors and retailers, will allow customers to place orders, combine other orders, map delivery routes and even monitor temperatures in real time. Each of those stages in the order fulfillment can now be recorded via a blockchain where any trusted party in the transaction can check where their contract is at in each step. Having those steps recorded and verified instantly means quicker turnaround on invoices. “What we’re really driving toward is for the invoice to be approved as rapidly as possible,” Allen said. Electronic data interchange and application programming interfaces are now used to digitally record supply chain events. But blockchain will allow Routeique to “be more interoperable between systems and work with bigger companies that have multiple systems,” Allen said.

Bryan, co-founder of Keyturn, along with colleague Kari Dwyer, Keyturn’s chief technology officer, demonstrated at MarketWaves 18 in Dallas how their software and accompanying specialized device they plan to launch in 2019 can address problems with data verification that is particularly prevalent, Bryan says, among stakeholders in the construction supply chain. “In the supply chain, data errors can mean the difference in millions of dollars of delayed or inaccurate payments often to vulnerable small businesses, and it happens every day,” Bryan said. “Until we solve the data verification challenge in supply chains, data can be garbage in, and garbage out.” One challenge they kept running into, he told the MarketWaves 18 audience, was the adoption of technology to enable trusted, data acquisition and verification. In 2017, his colleague had witnessed a Fortune 100 company losing money due to shipping products on a truck without updating their inventory records appropriately, because the company wasn’t invoicing its customers for all products being loaded onto trucks. “Everyone is buzzing about blockchain for how it can provide immutable data, but can we really trust the data that is being presented to the blockchain?”, Bryan asked. \u003cbr /\u003e During the product demo, Bryan and Dwyer showed how a portion of their software works in tandem with the new device to load and unload trucks, and how it tracks the order and confirms delivery “with irrefutable proof tied to a contract.” Several methods of order confirmation and verification are used from pickup at a manufacturer to delivery at a construction site, including barcode and RFID scanning, geotagging, and the ability to take a photo directly from the application, which stores it and logs it directly to the order. “You have all the photos associated with the order, which can be a distributed ledger on the blockchain,” he said. Users of the product can then view the order details as they have tracked through the supply chain. Bryan said Keyturn will be seeking transportation industry partnerships “to bring collaborative convergence” to the construction supply chain.

Switzerland-based CargoChain is essentially a platform for more easily and accurately sharing data such as text, video, documents and images between the many different parties in the supply chain during a cargo transport. Blockchain is used to verify that the data is correct and has not been changed in any way. CargoChain can be used in addition to other forms of data transfer such as Electronic Data Interchange. “The high level message is that we are trying to make it easy for all parties to share what info they want, when they want, with who they want. We want to provide opportunities to solve problems without smaller parties needing to build an Enterprise Resource Planning system,” Tony Davis, the chief marketing officer at CargoChain, told FreightWaves in Australia. Multiple parties can post data onto the platform, which can then auto-complete such tasks as providing data that is required by supply chain partners or officials such as customs authorities. Alternatively, customers can write their own mini-programmes to do such jobs. CargoChain offers a variety of tools for writing software to manipulate data. It is envisaged by executives at CargoChain that, ultimately, the user-community will create a variety of its own tools for use on the platform. “The vision is to provide a ‘web-store’ on top of CargoChain so the development community can carry out its own development,” Davis said. The new business has its origins in conversations between Jade Logistics, customers and carriers, about the difficulties in sharing data between supply chain parties. Davis gave two examples of inefficiencies in the supply chain. He told FreightWaves that one of the major maritime carriers tracked a relatively simple origin-to-destination cargo transport. The carrier discovered that over 300 documents were needed to make the shipment happen. “And most of that time the physical cargo was waiting, it was waiting for the administration to catch up,” Davis commented. Another example is in Australia. A large importer of cars to Australia unloads the vehicles dockside where the vehicles must sit until three different sets of service providers have finished their jobs. The importer has to keep all the cars on the dock until all the jobs are done. Only then can all the cars be released, and then all at once. “We are building an app that allows each car to be cleared and released from the dock much more quickly. It saves up to three days – meanwhile real estate at a port is at a premium. The supply chain is quite antiquated on the digital side – it hasn’t kept up with the physical. Also there are so many parties involved. The data goes through so many hands which leads to repetition, data errors and a lack of visibility,” Davis told FreightWaves. Turning to the business side of CargoChain, Davis explained that the new business does not as yet have any paying customers. Davis explained that the strategy is to work with the existing port-operating customers of Jade Logistics, which has terminal operating software deployed in 125 terminals around the world. The market for the new platform is, potentially, the whole of the supply chain. But, narrowing that down a little, Davis said that the management of CargoChain is currently looking at ports and the larger New Zealand shippers. “The typical platform play is to gain core customers and then platform [usage] spreads from there,” David said. Target customers could include maritime carriers, ports, other entities in the supply chain, and landside carriers. “We’re trying to democratise the supply chain and give everyone a voice – everyone from a one-man band up to operators of large fleets.” Davis acknowledges that CargoChain is not the only software on the market aimed at increasing cargo visibility and reducing the burden of data administration. Acknowledging that there has been “an explosion” of systems available on the market in the last two to three years, he argues that CargoChain is trying to be an “enablement platform,” that provides tools and infrastructure rather than be a specific product that solves a specific problem. Davis also says that CargoChain is independent too, arguing that the some of the alternative systems are offered by actors in the supply chain. “We don’t have any skin in the game,” he commented. CargoChain has been in research and development mode in Switzerland, funded from Jade Logistics’ balance sheet, and has been developed using the expertise of domain-experts for the last five years. Accordingly, Davis doesn’t believe that the system is easily imitable by new entrants. “The architecture and so on in CargoChain is not something you could do overnight. There’s a lot of deep domain knowledge. It wouldn’t be easy to replicate and it would take a long time.” Applications are in development for a number of Australian and New Zealand customers and pilots are also underway, according to a statement from CargoChain.","TAGS":"Australia, blockchain-based logistics platform, data, New Zealand, Software, Software as a Service, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-12-24T12:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/block-chain/routeique-newest-in-blockchain-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/BiTA-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Routeique is Newest Member of Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Routeique is pleased to announce it has joined the Blockchain in Transport Association (BiTA).

He noted that companies also tend to maintain their own shipping records on their own ledgers, submitting separate data to the regulatory agencies accordingly. “This creates a duplication of effort, lack of transparency and accountability, and inefficiencies along the supply chain.” Vasan and Beaudine used the example of “Jack,” a hospital worker who wanted to send a hazardous material expedited shipment – in this case, blood – internationally.

Whatever the case, there’s been some media chatter over the past several weeks that blockchain might be either void of value altogether, or at least might be too far ahead of its time. Perhaps the biggest punctuation mark to the negative cycle came at the beginning of the month when a team from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) examined 43 implementations of distributed ledger technology (DLT). The various DLT projects covered a wide variety of tasks, and users included non-governmental organizations (NGOs), contractors, and government agencies. For the record, many expect DLT to replace the term blockchain, perhaps in an effort to distance the technology from cryptocurrencies and the general initial coin offering (ICO) space. Blockchain was originally designed for digital financial transactions, but over the years it has also been found to have a wide variety of applications, including land registries, humanitarian aid disbursement in refugee camps, education subsidies, as well as in the supply chain. International development actors, including government agencies, multilateral organizations, and think tanks, are looking at blockchain to improve effectiveness or efficiency in their work. So with all the energy and enthusiasm in so many areas, why the recent spate of concern? Earlier in the year, a research group called MERL Tech wrote a collaborative piece among three authors. MERL stands for Monitoring, Evaluation, Research, and Learning, and its mission is to examine technologies in the social impact, humanitarian, and international development fields. In this case, the authors reached out to 43 “blockchain use-cases” and came away discouraged by the lack of evidence the firms provided, especially in light of the claims they made. The blog post on the MERL Tech site didn’t indicate the longitude of the study, the different kinds of blockchain companies contacted, what the expectations were of the researchers one way or the other, etc. In other words, many questions came to mind, which questioned the report’s reliability–other than the fact that it was written by a seemingly objective group of researchers with an ethics-based mission. The study was picked up on November 30 by a UK-based media site called The Register “Biting the hand that feeds IT,” with a clickbait-style headline: “Blockchain study finds 0.00% success rate and vendors don’t call back when asked for evidence.” Part of The Register’s agenda seems to be to serve as a watchdog agency against government overspending. It likes to point out quangos (a semipublic administrative body outside the civil service but receiving financial support from the government), and they seem to see a lot of them affiliated with advanced technology, not the least of which falls into the category of blockchain. Fair enough. Clickbait or not, the headline was effective. It made the rounds around the online blockchain news cycle. In one case, Forbes contributor Bernard Marr referred to it in his headline on December 10, “Is This The End of Blockchain?” Marr referred to the MERL study, and also how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have steadily lost value in 2018, asking the question: “Is it time to admit that the great experiment with decentralized, distributed ledgers has failed?” While such questions come across as somewhat hysterical, Marr brings up a couple of discerning points. First, blockchain has been tainted in the minds of many due to overhype, scams, and the cryptocurrency industry from where it originates. He then refers to a recent forecast done by Forresters released November 7, suggesting that blockchain will continue to evolve unless “disillusionment causes a winter.” Principal analyst Martha Bennett actually forecasts that “the visionaries will forge ahead,” while those hoping for immediate industry disruption will give up. The term “winterization” refers to a technology that is so far ahead of its time that it doesn’t receive the widespread adoption that would be transformative to a society due to other often technological, but also cultural, barriers. Charles Babbage’s vision of an “automatic computing engine” was designed between 1833 and 1871. He was about a century ahead of his time. Artificial Intelligence was first conceived and designed by John McCarthy in his Advice Taker proposal as early as 1958. Yet another example is that of “additive manufacturing,” or 3D printing. It was invented in Japan in the early 1980s. However, it is only now that we are seeing the impact of what additive manufacturing can do through companies such as Fast Radius (a partner of UPS and UPS is a minority investor) setting up microfactories near population-dense areas. One of the reasons that 3D printing did not ramp up quickly was that other than prototyping, there were not enough companies adopting the appropriate applications. FreightWaves reached out to John Burg, one of the MERL authors. Among other online writings, he authored, “Blockchain will impact your life…here’s how and what you can do about it,” in late April of this year. Burg is a senior international development professional with over 15 years of cross-cultural and multi-sectoral experience in managing and facilitating international work, including policy and budget formulation, in governmental and non-governmental positions. He has extensive experience in fragile and conflict-affected environments in 16 countries across six global regions. Due to confidentiality agreements, Burg did not want to comment on the MERL blog post other than to express some dismay in the way that it was picked up and used. He did say that he has followed blockchain closely since 2015, and that “I feel that I’m seeing a large feedback loop of smaller interrelated chicken-and-egg binary challenges for enterprise-level blockchain uptake, resulting in some of the less-than-positive headlines these days.” Burg sees plenty of challenges for blockchain. After the initial telephone conversation, here’s what he sent by email as a macro assessment/overview of where things currently stand with blockchain. When crypto boomed, VCs doubled down and pushed investment in the technology with the assumption that branching out into dApps would bring in a handsome ROI. But trying to push the adoption of emerging technology doesn’t do anything if there’s no pull from potential users to adopt it. This results in a lack of equilibrium between the supply and demand, which can result in a solution looking for a problem. This gets to the value-add conundrum. Blockchain adds value as a macro or meta system-of-systems, which is a level nobody is going to pilot at. So there are many small-scale pilots, which is the smart way to pilot. But then the evidence doesn’t translate to enterprise-level scale, so it’s hard to articulate a case, based on evidence, that blockchain would add value at the enterprise scale. And, this gets to the evidence conundrum, which is not specific to enterprise-level applications. Even if a blockchain company did have the kind of evidence that could draw in more new clients, the general public is unlikely to have access to it because the lack of equilibrium in supply/demand means competition for new customers is fierce and the use of non-disclosure agreements is rampant (in order to protect both proprietary and intellectual property, as well as possible embarrassing failures), but we don’t know because good or bad, it’s just not out there. And, complicating these conundrums is that the public conflates the use of blockchain for crypto as opposed to its use for strictly non-financial applications. So, when the crypto markets become volatile, as they currently are, people tend to think blockchain has lost its value, albeit in a financial sense or in an enterprise platform sense – the public is not making that distinction. Of course clickbait headlines bear a great deal of the responsibility for this, as I learned all too well recently! And so the big collective output from all of these binary problems is a larg-scale bifurcation of public messaging. On the one hand blockchain firms and proponents (including myself in the past) have publicly painted rosy pictures about the potential of blockchain, while opponents cite all manner of technological challenges the technology still faces, and the general public don’t know what to think. For blockchain to add value in an enterprise platform role, any adopting organization will need to map what it does to identify and rectify any structural process inefficiencies. This is difficult because often an organizational culture and its business processes are symbiotic, regardless of whether or not there are inefficiencies. So tinkering with processes invariably means tinkering with culture, which individuals tend not to take kindly to as most humans are naturally averse to change (especially in the workplace). Human-centered design principles would advocate for approaching organizational culture change through the iterative and gradual process of individual behavior change, which is a slow and likely expensive process. This runs afoul of what most blockchain firms are looking for in a client—i.e., a quick turnaround engagement. The rise of “blockchain as a service,” or BaaS, might be a sign that blockchain firms are warming to the idea of slower-burn longer-term engagements; however, only time will tell. Nonetheless, there are also significant R\u0026D projects in process. Oil giants BP and Shell have a blockchain project. Maersk and IBM’s global shipping application, and Walmart’s recent requirement for suppliers of fresh vegetables to take part in its IBM blockchain project, are also major enterprise endeavors that will measure the efficacy at scale. The growth of blockchain will see the continuation of blockchain experiments, but breakthroughs may be a little further on the horizon. The overarching factors heading into 2019 are that blockchain is “tricky” technology that doesn’t really add value until you can pilot it at scale—and thus far the results aren’t encouraging in and of themselves because the pilots aren’t happening at scale. Also, from an organizational culture, people are inherently adverse to change. There’s always that confounding human component.","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain supply chain, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-12-14T14:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/rapid-fire-pitch-block-array","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/blockarray-1.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Rapid-fire pitch: Block Array’s Freight Trust","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"\u003cbr /\u003e  The Chattanooga-based team at Block Array have launched a blockchain product they call FreightTrust, legal platform for shipping documents serving as a go-between for carriers, brokers and shippers.

The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent the views of FreightWaves.  Shipping industry corporate executives largely agree that profound transformations are coming. Be it via machine learning, blockchain, or AI, with some IoT mixed in, supply chain innovators are racing to find the proper combination of these technologies to script the end game. However, the story telling us where those transformations will occur first is largely untold. Sure, full digital automation of shipping processes is on its way, but what are the intermediary steps leading us there? Breaking the Myths Surrounding Transportation It’s easy to be impressed by technical publications parading how modern, almost futuristic, transportation has become. Some would make you believe freight can already fly on its own at the stroke of a wand from one place to the other. It’s only when you are confronted with the realities of the field that you realize how low-tech the process still remains. And, even if autonomous systems tend to take center stage, a great portion of the automation may not even come from frontier technologies. What are the pain points we’re trying to solve here? In order to take step 1 towards the promise of this transformation, a company needs to truly live the day to day of how it currently works. At Opus9, we did exactly that – we started shipping freight manually and digging into our own operations. During the time our company operated as a traditional brokerage firm, we witnessed and experienced every broker-sided inefficiency along the customer journey as well as client-sided issues with shipping and trucking of goods. And trust me, there are plenty of them. The Time Factor… Time is money they say, so let’s talk about that first. It takes up to six weeks from a truckload or LTL quote to when payment is processed using the traditional shipping method. One of the main reasons? The key actors in the shipping industry (shippers, carriers, brokers) rely heavily on paperwork. A lot of documents are circulating from one stakeholder to another and through various means. From the initial spreadsheet referencing the types of goods, pick-up and delivery locations and dates to quotes, to the bill of lading, and finally to the proof of delivery, those documents which sometimes only exist as hard copies are emailed at best, faxed at worst, and wasting time and efficiency always. Like the travel industry 10 years ago, shipping is based on intermediaries, brokers, forwarders and agents that negotiate prices verbally (mostly over the phone) with carriers and shippers before sending written confirmations through email or fax. The back and forth between the shipper, brokers, and the different carriers the broker will have contacted, is very time consuming. If we take a look at the traditional booking process, it takes between 12 and 24 hours to obtain a quote from a carrier and between 24 and 48 hours to get an actual booking confirmation. In most cases, once the shipment is on its way, there is no way for the shipper to monitor it. Typically, the broker will ask the carrier company to provide the truck driver’s location as a check call. Check calls are perceived as part of the service but with companies now utilizing GPS tracking systems, and ELD being the norm, manual attempts to solve the issue of real-time tracking should all but disappear. Still a pain point for a large portion of shippers, many companies are being built around this specific focus, but ultimately lose sight of the automation opportunities either side of the simple in-transit status updates and alerts. …Impacting Pricing For All Pricing-wise, the traditional brokerage model tremendously lacks transparency. Accessorial costs (toll fees, extra governmental fees, etc. that can represent sometimes about 20% of the total cost) are not generally mentioned upfront during the negotiation and are likely to appear later. In addition, the broker’s mark-up rationale isn’t always clear, and fees often are tacked on days, or weeks after proof of delivery. Finally, there are the traditional latencies in payment, which makes it hard to understand cash flows for all parties involved. When carrier companies issue an invoice to a broker, terms of payment are usually between 30 to 45 days, and the timing isn’t getting better. Some shippers are now asking for as much as 120 days. How to Bring About Effective Change Across 12 months of operations as a traditional 3PL, we analyzed and discovered which pieces of the puzzle to automate in order to optimize the shipping experience and reduce friction for each stakeholder involved in the process. Since shippers traditionally build a trustworthy relationship with a broker, we built a user-friendly, customer-centric quoting, booking and process flow. We learned to measure the importance of the individual steps in the process, and how each component can play in the industry’s dynamics. Automated notifications, in shipment-chat, and alerts allow shippers to ship freight in an automated manner ‘Lights Out’ end to end and access our operations staff only when critical issues arise. To circle back on the travel industry analogy, people used to love calling a travel agent to plan and book their next exotic trip. Eventually the industry shifted to automation, to a level whereby most of us do not think twice about booking our next travel without any human interaction. As we continue to evolve automation leveraging additional technologies, we will continue to provide a true chapter by chapter story of digital transformation.","TAGS":"3PL, Blockchain, Broker, Opus9, Shipping, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Trucking, Truckload Freight, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-29T15:14:16-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/economics/asian-logistics-and-maritime-conference-hong-kong","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/IMG_1278.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Free trade and Asia’s logistics resurgence – takeaways from Asian Logistics and Maritime Conference","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Free trade promulgation and its relevance in the global economy took center stage in the keynote address of Hong Kong’s Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, at the recently concluded Asian Logistics and Maritime Conference in Hong Kong. Lam spoke about Hong Kong’s bustling trade activity as it projects itself as one of the world’s preeminent logistics and maritime centers, and was borderline critical of the trade spats that have currently held economies in a deadlock. “Free trade is taking something of a thrashing these days, given the rising undercurrent of unilateralism and protectionism,” she said. “For Hong Kong, the primacy of free trade is immutable. It’s thanks to free enterprise and our ability to adapt to the changing market that has made Hong Kong one of the world’s leading trading economies, and a leading international financial and logistics center.” Unlike regular economies, Hong Kong’s GDP has had an inordinate dependence on logistics and trade, with the sector contributing to 22% of the total GDP while employing about 19% of the country’s workforce. This has led to the country’s trade value to stand at nearly $1.06 trillion – a value thrice as big as its GDP. Hong Kong has constantly put its weight behind signing free trade agreements, with Lam reminding that it has been a year since the state signed a free trade and related investment agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which would take effect from January next year. The country has also concluded a free trade agreement negotiation with Australia a few days back. Dato Lim Jock Hoi, the secretary-general of ASEAN spoke about the growing importance of ASEAN countries in the global economic rhetoric, as the region is now the sixth-largest economy in the world, with a combined GDP of $2.8 trillion. Jock Hoi alluded to the need for more investment in the transportation space, pointing out that the challenge lay in expanding ports and bolstering highway and rail networks. “ASEAN is committed to enhancing regional and global connectivity, but we need sustainable solutions to infrastructure to provide greater connectivity,” he said. All through the conference, the U.S.-China trade war found mention, with logistics incumbents largely echoing that its impact would not be as catastrophic as advertised. Karen Reddington, president of Asia-Pacific division of FedEx Express, contended that there might be a few “bumps in the road” due to tariffs, but it would not stem trade flow. Mike Fang, VP and head of Maersk Line’s Greater China region (CXE: MAERB.C.IX) opined that the trade tensions would cause disruptions for its customers in the transpacific, but also mentioned that this would create a spike in demand over the region as shippers rush to get ahead of the tariffs that would be in place by the beginning of next year. Though it is good on the shorter run, he expected a more extended ebb period following the Chinese new year. “In the long term we need to put this in perspective, it impacts about 2% of global trade,” he said. However, the trade spat could inadvertently help boost manufacturing in the ASEAN countries like Indonesia and Vietnam, which are already cashing in and are expecting a jump in exports to the United States. Chinese businesses, with the intention of circumventing the tariffs, are shipping unfinished goods to South-East Asia for assembly and also use these countries as an export base. Fang also spoke about improving connectivity across the land, apart from strengthening maritime transport. The Belt and Road Initiative, for instance, has connected China to the depths of Europe, with rail connections now going as far as France. Railroads are attractive to global supply chains as it is faster than sea freight, and has carbon emissions that are 90% lesser than air freight. Apart from promoting such networks, Maersk has indulged in several digital initiatives of its own that could improve customer service, reduce costs, improve asset productivity and develop new revenue sources, said Fang. As supply chains are increasingly digitized, it makes way for higher transparency and visibility into logistics processes, with the technology of blockchain being an example. Dean Croke, chief analytics officer of Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), spoke about blockchain’s immutable ledger system which could help secure information across complex supply chains, as freight moves through various stakeholders. For this to materialize, Croke advocated for creating industry-wide blockchain standards that would ensure data interoperability. “Blockchain has emerged as a serious topic in the logistics space over the last year, and it is important that we standardize data formats across the supply chain, or it would lead to us spending a disproportionate time in mapping legacy data systems to a standardized data system,” he said. Since its launch last year, BiTA membership has snowballed to over 450 companies, with the likes of UPS, FedEx, Uber Freight and Google getting onboard, as they collectively look to create a common framework and standards from which participants could build DLT and blockchain applications.","TAGS":"ASEAN, Asia, BiTA, BiTA Standards, blockchain standards, conference, Hong Kong, logistics, Maritime, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Economics, Maritime, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-21T15:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/technology/ambrosus-iot-blockchain-supply-chains","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_1155824062-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ambrosus builds decentralized IoT networks for food and pharma supply chains","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain’s relevance in the logistics space is now evident, as the technology could be a way to bring transparency and visibility to a myriad of verticals, especially the ones that involve complex international supply chains. Then again, regardless of blockchain’s irrefutable possibilities, concerns continue to arise as to how feasible is the idea of convincing large businesses to make their sensitive and proprietary data public, albeit them being securely stored. Ambrosus, a blockchain-based startup, believes it can break the data deadlock. “We enable consumers and supply chain stakeholders to have better trust about the products that they are receiving or consuming, and we do this through sensors that communicate to the blockchain,” said Angel Versetti, CEO of Ambrosus. As blockchain is touted as an ultimate instrument of trust, Ambrosus uses it to source data from various sensors. Though most blockchains function in isolated environments and are self-contained making it conducive for fintech use-cases, Ambrosus is enabling real-world data to enter the blockchain which helps it gain perspective into the products being shipped through the system. Versetti spoke about what caused him to rally behind the idea of creating a transparent supply chain network with blockchain as a medium. “I was previously working at the United Nations, and one of the problems we identified was that despite all the technological advancements, there were still a lot of recalls in the food industry and similar problems existed in the medical space as well through counterfeit items,” he said. “In both the sectors, the problem was about inducing transparency and the ability for multiple stakeholders to reduce fraud. And when I was thinking about solving this, I realized that blockchain was a solution.” Ambrosus eyes the pharma and food supply chain industry as its customer base and is working primarily with large businesses in the space, to understand their needs and build a platform that is conducive to large-scale sensor generated transactions. “In general, food and pharma companies are pretty conservative when it comes to technology. In the pharma space, you have a lot of regulations that make it difficult for them to adopt new technologies, as they are very risk averse and want to test everything thoroughly because if something goes wrong with quality assurance, someone can literally die,” said Versetti. And since Ambrosus works on highly sensitive segments, it is critical for its technology to be consistent and scalable – aspects which would not be quite as rigorous in other verticals. Versetti also mentioned about the difficulty in getting stakeholders to the table. “We need to educate them, especially the executives who may not understand what blockchain is, or why it is valuable to them,” said Versetti. “But this year is a bit easier, due to the market hype blockchain created last year, and that helps provide executives trust on data integrity, and they know that blockchain is going to be important for the future of their companies.” Versetti contended that one of the major roadblocks to widespread adoption was about the opacity in regulations, and the hostility shown by countries towards blockchain related technology and cryptocurrency. “But once we go past that and are ready to integrate it, a lot of companies would benefit from the power of blockchain and data integrity offered by it, without really needing to make the data public or transparent,” he said. Such a move would need foundational changes to the design architecture, which Ambrosus is tackling through a hybrid solution that allows companies to store data themselves and supply only the metadata – making it the ‘fingerprint’ of the primary data set, that could be used to verify if data is altered. However, there still runs the risk of companies deleting data, and with blockchain only registering the fingerprint, it would not be possible to pinpoint who actually erased the data. “But this could be solved with zero knowledge proof, and we have been doing that. It is basically a technology that allows you to verify the integrity of the data without being able to see the original data itself,” said Versetti. “It is still pretty early though, and it will take some time for it to be more production ready.” Another challenge to Ambrosus stems from the fact that companies are largely protective of their data, and would be inclined to choose industry incumbents like IBM, which to a risk-averse firm, would seem more tenable for their blockchain pursuits. “But if you look at IBM Hyperledger’s architecture, we guarantee that what they’ve built is not the real blockchain, because it can be controlled by a single party and is developed by a single stakeholder,” said Versetti. At the end of the day, blockchain is about decentralization and companies would see value only if they consent to work with different stakeholders on a level playing field. Versetti mentioned that Ambrosus had built a scalable solution that can process up to 500,000 transactions per second by bundling data together. “Our goal for the next few months would be to roll it out, and make it work in a way that would be acceptable for industrial grade applications and to have adoption amongst several large stakeholders,” he said.","TAGS":"Ambrosus, Blockchain, blockchain logistics, blockchain supply chain, food supply chain, logistics, pharma industry, startups, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-20T15:47:11-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/orange-business-services-joins-the-blockchain-in-transport-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BiTANewMemberPressReleaseGraphic28229-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Orange Business Services joins the Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Orange Business Services, a global digital services provider and carrier-grade integrator, has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA).

Even while their product is still in what is called the minimum viable product stage, so much has happened in that year, it’s a cause for celebration. One such example is completing the first ever truckload shipment using blockchain from end to end. But for all the celebration, they’re also calling for more collaboration. They want the community to realize that blockchain is for them. As FedEx business fellow and blockchain strategist Dale Chrystie frequently asserts, “Blockchain is a team sport.” Hernandez comes from the logistics industry as a broker, “and immediately had all these ideas for how to use blockchain.” He says, “Rajat had the difficult task of explaining blockchain to a lot of people who had no idea what it was.” Rajbhandari laughs. They registered the company just two months later in January 2018, and then spent the next six months writing their whitepaper. Those six months represented the culmination of a shared vision. “One thing is to have the idea, but it’s very challenging to explain the concepts. You have to be technical enough to explain the blockchain to the tech guys,” says Rajbhandari. “It’s also a community. You want to share it with the carriers and shippers,” adds Hernandez. “We also peer-reviewed it with a lot of partners. We even had a Rutgers professor edit it,” says Rajbhandari. That professor now sits on the board. “From the blockchain world we worked with a lot of companies. CoinFabrik in Argentina is working on a proof of concept, and everyone is asking things like how soon can we deploy this stuff,” says Hernandez. “Our mission is about decentralization and collaboration and trust. This is very different from the private blockchains we see,” he says. “You want to store documents in a decentralized environment, and while you might be able to do that other parties are still writing the protocols,” says Rajbhandari. “Our philosophy is not to reinvent the wheel if the protocols are already out there. Like a stable token as a fuel for the platform. Do we build our own or use somebody else’s? The token models have several challenges. The industry doesn’t know anything about it. Then they need to be stable in value.” “So far we’ve got insights from the community, but we still aren’t ready to move with it,” says Hernandez. They finally decided to build it from scratch, and then tested to see what’s best for the community of owners. “There are three models for the token approach, and we’re deciding what the model is,” says Rajbhandari. “We need to make sure whatever we adopt is sustainable. We’ll know through testing. While there may be plenty of interesting tech, it doesn’t mean it will all be adopted. The owners of the platform (shippers, carriers, and brokers) will deliver the proof of concept value.” “We’re looking for decentralized ledgers. Whatever works we’ll adopt. Will it be Ethereum or RSK [Rootstock, which is building a sidechain]? Since all of these technologies are new, they’re also evolving. We’re going for an agnostic ethos,” says Hernandez. In other words, something universal that everyone and anyone can use. “We’re working with asset-based carriers and 3PLS and shippers. What is the role of the 3PL? Will the 3PL be removed? I get asked that question a lot. 3PLS should join very early and learn the model. There are some that can actually create value. They’re not just middlemen. You hear a lot about ‘removing the middleman’ and that’s not necessarily true. I come from a broker background and understand this side of things thoroughly. We also believe in business relations, and that’s what they also provide. Experts on demand is another thing we’re working on. Who manages the mistakes for instance?” says Hernandez. There’s been a lot of learning from the smart code programming aspect of their recent blockchain trucking project. “We learned how the payments work. We learned how people on the floor worked, how they exchanged documents, how they use mobile apps, how they go from door to door. All these little things,” says Rajbhandari. “From the tech side it was making sure we could simplify the process and trigger the smart contract from these external events. From the shipper’s side, it’s simple to use. Blockchain should be working in the background,” he says. Hernandez nods his head in strong agreement. “It’s an invitation to the community not only to be interested, but to participate. Bring your expectations to the table,” says Hernandez. “A lot of companies are wanting to see how it works. We’ll give you a passenger seat to see how it works,” says Rajbhandari. “Or a driver’s seat,” adds Hernandez. They both laugh. The partners have an infectious enthusiasm. “A lot of these private initiatives might not be impactful. The key is collaboration. The value creation is created by the participants themselves,” says Hernandez. “Not just for the smart contracts but also for the spot truckload,” adds Rajbhandari. “We’re working on all the other parts of the supply chain as well. Port of Veracruz—we’re also helping other communities build the blockchain. We can provide the service and insight,” he says.  Stay tuned. As we’ve previously written, it is our belief based upon the emerging research and evidence that some of the most interesting work in the blockchain transport and logistics space is being performed not by incumbents like IBM and Microsoft, but by a diverse group of startups. dexFreight is an emerging leader among them.","TAGS":"BiTA, BiTA Standards, Blockchain, blockchain logistics, blockchain-based logistics platform, collaboration, dexFreight, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-16T13:30:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/hublock-becomes-a-member-of-the-blockchain-in-transport-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BiTANewMemberPressReleaseGraphic28129-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Hublock Becomes a Member of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Hublock, a software solution based on data-sharing layer has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an organization dedicated to determining best practices and standards relating to blockchain in the transportation/logistics/supply chain marketplace. Blockchain helps companies in the transportation, logistics and freight marketplaces digitally identify and track transactions, contracts and shipments as part of a distributed ledger system, making operations more transparent and reliable. Blockchain can help organizations improve customer experiences and create new revenue streams by improving fleet management and other areas. Hublock will apply its deep engineering knowledge and experience in logistics expertise to BiTA in order to help create blockchain solutions for the industry. Finding new uses for blockchain in transportation/ logistics will fit in under Hublock’s focus on using data-sharing to solve industry issues. Hublock uses data to create optimized solutions and automated workflows for logistics companies. It will use technologies such as blockchain with machine learning to enhance business performance. As part of BiTA, Hublock will look for ways to leverage blockchain and data-sharing in areas such as supply chain management. “For more than 20 years I have been managing transport companies in several European countries and during that time, I have encountered various problems in the logistics sector that force our clients to incur unnecessary expenses. These problems are often the result of outdated IT technology that is not adapted to the needs of the market, and consequently our clients do not develop or grow as well as they might,” said Matthias Grimling, CEO and Founder of Hublock. “Together with our partners from the logistics sector and our clients, Hublock seeks to create a system that would enable the use of the latest IT solutions, such as blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). With those tools, Hublock can help meet the needs arising in the dynamically developing B2B and B2C markets. With assistance from Hublock, our clients can be more fully integrated with existing and new IT solutions in the logistics sector.” According to Oliver Haines, Vice President of BiTA-Europe, “On behalf of the members of BiTA, I welcome Hublock to the Alliance. The company’s expertise across the information technology platform will help speed the development of blockchain standards.” Haines continued, “In the supply chain, services like those Hublock provides can help companies create new revenue streams and value by enabling a system to complete transactions, track shipments and manage fleets.” About Hublock.io Hublock is a platform enabling effortless global real-time communication between all participants of logistical processes. Its software solutions allow the company to gather a wide range of data from external partners and logistics companies, allowing them to reduce costs and optimize their own assets using automated workflow customized for each asset (milestone, stage, package, driver, warehouse). At Hublock, we look deeper to help companies make data-based decisions. As a result, logistics companies fully utilize vehicle space, eliminate empty runs, speed up the delivery process and solve the issue of undelivered parcels due to the recipient’s absence. Hublock provides global real-time information about routes and available cargo capacity. The platform also introduces wholly new delivery options, such as car trunk delivery, GPS coordinates delivery or neighborhood point-of-delivery (PoD) network. Hublock’s European locations include: Hamburg, Germany; Cracow, Poland; and Tallinn, Estonia.

BiTA President Chris Burruss opened up the meeting by reflecting on his experience in organization management and commenting on the accelerated timeline BiTA has set for itself vis-a-vis other standards organizations. Burruss compared managing older trade associations to a fixer-upper job—the president looks for holes, throws in spackle, fixes the floors, and tries to get the house square again while preserving its original character. He likened launching a new trade alliance to new construction, saying that some contractors cut corners and things break before they should. “Standards creation is a process that we didn’t want to cut corners with,” Burruss said. “We’ve been in construction, and pardon our mess.” Burruss quoted the standards committee’s purpose statement. “At its core, the ability of blockchain to reduce transactional costs, friction, and opacity will be based on the open exchange of information between parties. The BSC [BiTA Standards Committee] seeks to establish common standards within the global delivery ecosystem and its membership will benefit from standards, references, frameworks, and other guidance that illustrates the improvements.” Typical standards bodies take two to five years to create a standard; BiTA plans to do it in about eight months, having officially adopted its standards model in March 2018. BiTA aims to release the first version of its blockchain standards by the end of 2018. “The goal is not to push something out, but to release standards that means something,” Burruss said. Next, BiTA Chief of Staff Arlen Stark moderated about an hour-long session in which individual BiTA members took the stage to talk about why they joined BiTA, what they were looking for from their membership, and the current state of their company’s blockchain journey. About thirty companies offered their feedback: these companies ranged from blockchain technology companies looking for clients in transport and logistics to very large corporations like BP (NYSE: BP) and Delta (NYSE: DAL) who were interested in buying and building technology. “Delta’s motto is that ‘no one better connects the world.’ We want to move the technology forward and benefit our customers. We’re looking to partner with other organizations, startups or incumbents, as we have with UPS,” said Veneetia Johnson, IT and Strategy Leader at Delta Air Lines. “We joined BiTA to have fun,” said Eric Rempel, CIO at Redwood Logistics. “We’re early in the journey, but we’re having fun with like-minded individuals who wanted to join something so abstract, so early, but could turn into meaningful relationships and new ways of thinking. We’re really looking at this thing from the perspective of how we apply our technology, connectivity, and supply chain management.” “BNSF Railway is interested in B2B data integration. We have a group tracking different technologies and proofs-of-concept with the goal to disrupt before we’re disrupted. Blockchain is the one technology on our list that’s a big networking technology,” a BNSF official said. “We have one of the largest blockchain teams in the world (more than fifty developers), and we’re focused on bringing our expertise to BiTA’s membership,” said Patrick Mutwale from DLT Labs. “To summarize what we heard,” Stark concluded, “one of the biggest differentiators in BiTA is the diversity of our membership—we saw a great sample set of the companies who have come together. I didn’t hear anything on stage about the fear of missing out. We’re not built on fear; we’re built on a promise and a commitment to deliver education, networking, and commercial outcomes.” Wednesday morning, Susan Kearney from The Institutes RiskBlock Alliance announced that the insurance and risk management trade association was partnering with BiTA to share education, offer its industry expertise to BiTA members, and collaborate on blockchain advocacy. The Institutes is a leading risk and insurance knowledge group; the RiskBlock Alliance is an industry-led consortium collaborating to unlock the potential of blockchain across the insurance industry. RiskBlock focuses on accelerating time to market and adoption through real-world applications and impactful blockchain use cases. Members of the RiskBlock Alliance include BB\u0026T, Farmers Insurance, Liberty Mutual, Geico, Nationwide Insurance, StateFarm, USAA, and many others. RiskBlock says that blockchain can grow top-line revenue, realize efficiency gains, accelerate time to market, improve customer satisfaction, save cost, and help mitigate risk in the insurance industry. We found this partnership exciting because of the potential in transportation to use IoT sensors, cameras, and computer vision to generate immutable records of driving behavior, both in and out of the cab. Quantifying risk on a minute-by-minute, granular level will not only lead to better driver coaching and interventions to prevent accidents, and simplify the claims process (i.e., allow a carrier to prove it was not at fault), but should also drive down overall insurance costs for trucking carriers who operate their vehicles safely. Omnitracs’ Brad Taylor leads the BiTA Standards Committee and spoke with BNSF’s June Arnold, Ampliflex’s Ben Korthai, and Pratik Soni from Omnichain about the work that committee has done. Taylor displayed many of the attributes for location and component that will be included in the tracking documents uploaded to the blockchain. Taylor went through the attributes for TrackableEntity, TrackableEvent, and Location, noting grayed-out attributes that were still under discussion. Pratik Soni displayed a diagram of the Location Component, which included attributes for geocoordinates, SPLC, and address. Dale Chrystie, Blockchain Strategist at FedEx (NYSE: FDX), spoke about the interoperability committee, pointing out that “Blockchain is a team sport,” and saying that, “we can’t get from here to there without working for each other. None of us individually can get where we need to go with these things.” Chrystie said that his committee was studying other industry blockchain standards to ensure that BiTA’s standards would be able to mesh with them. Scott Friesen from Echo Global Logistics (NASDAQ: ECHO) spoke about the finance and technical compliance committee, saying that smart contracts must be constructed in such a way that legal teams and auditors can sign off on them. Friesen said that the committee is looking at common language that can be inserted into smart contracts as clauses, for example language for force majeure and indemnity, and that part of the committee’s job was to make sure that that BiTA receives necessary advice regarding jurisdictions and relevant jurisprudence. Finally, the large assembly broke into smaller groups and went to conference rooms to hear a rotation of speakers from the four main think tanks in BiTA who are narrowing down the first use cases that BiTA will tackle and composing white papers. Jake Fields from Platform Science talked about the work done by the Operations and Asset Utilization think tank: the members of the working group have held 34 meetings for more than 300 hours, and conducted eight stakeholder interviews. Fields said that his group looked at three broad areas, including Driver Utilization, Asset Accountancy/Optimization, and Vehicle Health Records; then he explained the decision-making process by which his team decided to focus on building a smart contract for calculating and collecting detention/demurrage fees. Other top priorities for Fields’ team include building an ELD-platform-agnostic HOS driving record on the blockchain and a standard for vehicle health records based on maintenance events, parts replacement servicing, error codes, and leverage those efforts into VMRS, OEMs, and open vehicle code standards. Jamil Dewji from Learning Machine’s think tank is building a PoC for a Universal Driver Passport, that would allow drivers to control all their government and government-mandated driver documents, DOT certifications, medical releases, drug screenings, and CDL in order to make hiring faster and less expensive. Dewji said that his group still had work to do in documenting the entire range of hiring standards across the industry. Dewji said that currently, it’s more time-consuming to verify driver experience than criminal or traffic violations, because of the fragmentation of the trucking industry and the fact that so many small carriers go out of business or sell, so the cryptographic securing of those sorts of records could make a big difference in hiring costs. Jordan Graft from TriumphPay and Melissa Forman from eCapital LLC presented the work of the group working on payments and settlements processes. The think tank began its work on invoice presentment and settlement, but realized that it had to start sooner, at the load tendering and rate confirmation stages of the transaction. “Bringing the invoice approval out of the carrier’s ERP onto the shared ledger is a huge opportunity in terms of back office efficiencies,” Graft said, noting that many phone calls and emails from multiple parties were associated with invoice approval, an opaque process. Joseph Hudicka from Neurored and Eric Rempel from Redwood Logistics spoke about the difficulties of defining a useful scope for their ‘Monitoring’ think tank and asked for more engagement from the membership, who offered ideas during an open discussion. Hudicka spoke about taking spot market bidding onto the blockchain to facilitate an organically generated open-source market index where participants would share bidding information with select masking features.","TAGS":"Ampliflex, BiTA, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, BNSF, BP, data standards, Delta Air Lines, DLT Labs, eCapital, Echo Global Logistics, FedEx, insurance, Learning Machine, Omnichain, Omnitracs, Platform Science, Redwood Logistics, Risk management, RiskBlock, TriumphPay, UPS, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Paul Hampstead","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-15T14:53:55-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/technology/startups/filament-breaks-out-blockchain-enterprise-solution-and-daimler","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shutterstock_1113549104-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Filament breaks out blockchain enterprise solution and Daimler partnership","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"It’s been a big week for Filament. During the same week that they announced their Blocklet TVA product, they did so with a flourish. They both demonstrated their product at the MarketWaves18 Demo Day on Monday, and the following day announced a partnership with Daimler Trucks North America (DTNA) [NYSE: DDAIF]. When it comes to enterprise blockchain solutions from startups in the BiTA community, the hits just keep on coming. First, Filament is a provider of comprehensive enterprise blockchain solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT). Their Blocklet for Trusted Vehicle Applications (TVA) is available as part of Filament’s Blocklet Kit. Blocklet TVA also happens to be the industry’s first end-to-end automotive blockchain platform that allows vehicles to participate directly in blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). Jake Ingman, head of product, and Chris Wood, head of business development, demonstrated Blocklet at Demo Day. They revealed their hardware blockchain wallet, that allows industrial machines and IoT devices to write directly to the blockchain. Filament’s Blocklet has an automotive blockchain application designed for connected vehicles that captures telemetry, safety, and performance data from a vehicle’s diagnostic portal. The technology opens up opportunities for usage-based insurance, dynamic leasing, and peer-to-peer asset rentals. The hardware makes it possible for automotive, freight, and transportation companies to create new, large-scale connected-vehicle services and smart contract applications on top of a trusted blockchain foundation. Then, Tuesday, DTNA, announced its partnership with Filament. Specifically, it plans to establish a peer-to-peer connection platform for remanufactured components using blockchain technology to automate and streamline its aftermarket remanufacturing operations. As a first step in the plan to utilize blockchain to improve commercial vehicle maintenance, DTNA has recently completed a proof of concept project leveraging a proprietary USB device created by Filament. Filament’s Blocklet device will be used to enable transparent and immutable data records, secure transactions, and execute smart contracts within a blockchain. The technology digitalizes distribution of ledger technology for tracing, tracking, and verification of shipping and transaction. “As a leading commercial vehicle manufacturer, DTNA has many parties that need to track and share data concerning the status, condition, timing and more, associated with our vehicles, major components and other spare parts,” said Lori Heino-Royer, director of business development at Daimler Trucks North America. “Our vision is to provide full transparency along our supply chain for faster and more efficient operations. We are working with Filament on this project, because its new Blocklet USB device will save us a lot of time and money since it makes it possible for us to plug into our legacy systems and begin automating and recording the supply chain processes and transactions in a blockchain.” “The Internet of Things and blockchain are a powerful combination. We believe this is especially true in the rapidly changing automotive and transportation landscape,” said Allison Clift-Jennings, CEO of Filament. “Blockchain technology gives connected machines including passenger vehicles, long haul trucks and construction equipment, a voice of immutable truth that goes well beyond data gathering. Blocklet TVA helps corporations with connected vehicles quickly understand and tap into the potential of transparent, edge-authenticated and distributed data which will enable the next generation of intelligent mobility.” To address the specific connectivity, identity, and security requirements of the automotive sector, Blocklet TVA combines the unique features of DLT-enabled connected vehicle applications with its end-to-end blockchain hardware, creating a turnkey product for vehicle integration. As noted, Filament is also a member of BiTA. “Our goal at BiTA is to bring together leading companies that have a vested interest in the development of blockchain technology for the freight industry,” said Chris Burruss, president of BiTA, at the announcement of their membership in March. “Filament’s extensive standards experience and technology expertise is extremely valuable as we work to create transportation-specific blockchain standards that will move the market forward.” As a member of BiTA, Filament brings its strength in developing decentralized protocols and open standards as well as its blockchain-native microchip to help create a common secure blockchain framework, educate the market and form relationships for implementations within the freight industry. Filament’s products incorporate several standard hardware elements such as a dual-core microcontroller with BLE capabilities, GPS, cellular LTE modem, a 9-axis motion fusion sensor and a temperature, humidity, and pressure sensor. As freight organizations seek new ways to compete in the digital world, blockchain makes it possible to streamline and improve operations, addressing many of the industry’s challenges including tracking and verifying shipped goods, resolving disputes, and reducing administration costs. The nascent blockchain technology is gaining maturity with increasing speed.","TAGS":"BiTA, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Daimler Trucks North America, demo day, Filament, marketwaves18, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-14T18:47:13-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/trucking/demo-day-section3-marketwaves","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/redwood-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"MW Demo Day Round 3: blockchain, intermodal and still some paper out there","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Here’s what happened at the third of four presentations at the Demo Day activities as part of Marketwaves 18 near Dallas. ORBCOMM Orbcomm demonstrated the latest version of its FleetManager analytics program. Presented by vice president of North American Sales Chris McDonald and pre-sales engineer Chris Corlee, the demonstration of the front end portal of the system showed the numerous features of FleetManager. The cloud-based analytics program can report on a wide variety of standard data, such as the temperature of a refrigerated trailer to the “breadcrumb trail” of where a truck has been and various data connected with that journey. But it also has the ability to analyze such things as whether a driver is spending too much time in a less-appropriate gear to how long it takes a driver to go from throttle to brake. In its collateral material, ORBCOMM said the use of its software is resulting in a 1.3 miles per gallon improvement for fleets compared to the industry standard. PROJECT44 Project44 presenter David Deutsch had a chatbot at the heart of his presentation. As he noted in his presentation, feedback from customers says the staff of shippers, carriers and 3PLs spend a great deal of time fielding questions and “hunting down information.” But using Watson Artificial Intelligence integrated with APIs from the project44 system, Deutsch demonstrated how a chatbot could provide a customer with the answer to many of those questions without the time-consuming efforts of a staff. His demonstration showed the chatbot answering the questions of a theoretical retail customer waiting for shipments into the network of stores with particular emphasis on an individual city. The system can also provide a weblink to what he called a “dynamic shipment detail page” hosted by project44 that allows better monitoring of the status of the shipment in question. PHILLIPS CONNECT TECHNOLOGIES Cliff Creech and Gerry Mead of Phillips Connect Technologies focused on the rails—in particular, intermodal–in their presentation of their ChassisNet platform. The IoT-based platform combined with satellite technology allows better tracking of assets such as chassis and rail cars. It can also provide information on whether an asset is laden with freight. The first step to generating revenue, they said, “is knowing where your asset is and is it in a state to generate revenue.” If a chassis has made it to a container, “then it can produce revenue.” The question is whether an asset is “healthy.” Once that has been established, PCT systems can also tell if an asset needs repairs that can wait until a trip is completed rather than needing to be pulled off the road immediately. SCROLL NETWORK Scroll Network’s Nathan Pitruzzello and Khashab Khashab presented what amounted to a private blockchain solution for the supply chain. The product, called Aster, allows for the construction of multiple blockchain networks where the individual operator of a particular blockchain can set the standards for that ledger. Once that is set into place, the benefits of blockchain–the immutability of records, the transparency–can be employed. The blockchain under the Aster system would not have the “proof of work” feature of the bitcoin blockchain that proves ownership of an asset. Instead, there would be “proof of authority” that would provide verification to a transaction. But otherwise, “everything stays internal.” REDWOOD LOGISTICS Redwood Logistics’ CIO Eric Rempel presented what he said was the “next generation interface” of the company’s RedwoodConnect tool. Described as “middleware,” Rempel said Redwood Connect “makes the integration really fast,” the integration in question being integrating disparate systems. Redwood Connect creates a “pipeline” that can be used to stream various data sources into an individual company’s data warehouses. “When hou close a deal, your customers need to connect to your beautiful APIs,” he said. With some technologies, that isn’t possible, but the RedwoodConnect integration capabilities allow that. SHIPWELL Jason Traff, the president of Shipwell, pulled out a flip phone to show the audience that not everybody in the market is operating on late-model technology. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning, Traff demonstrated an application where voice recognition allows an automated service to reach out to drivers who might not be using anything more complex than a flip phone to determine the location of a truck, as well as other factors connected to a shipment. The tool will be available later this year but a recent test over a weekend showed that Shipwell was able to cut in half the number of outgoing calls to drivers it needed to make. Instead, the automated tool did the job. SLYNC.IO Raj Patel, the chief product officer of Slync.io, demonstrated where AI can predict delays up and down the supply chain. “We can predict shipment delays from San Francisco to Dallas, crunching millions of data points,” he said in his presentation. Those data points can range from emails read by AI to Excel spreadsheets, also consumed the same way. But what pops out of the Slync system, he said, is not the product of a “black box.” Rather, the user of the Slync system will be notified precisely why the system is predicting such delays, and the customer “can look for this and no longer be reactive” to the problems. The system is designed to allow shippers and carriers to “change a workflow.” PLATFORM SCIENCE Darrin Demchuck of Platform Science reviewed the company’s IoT fleet management program and numerous features, including what he said was an ability to customize it to a specific driver “on the fly.” It provides maximum flexibility. Its features on compliance also include state-by-state provisions to add to the flexibility, so for example, it will reflect California’s unique rules that drivers must abide by. Platform Science also was one of several presenters that effectively reminded the audience that paper is a ways from being out of the trucking compliance system; Demchuck demonstrated the tool’s ability to scan and consume paper documents.","TAGS":"ORBCOMM, Phillips Connect Technologies, Platform Science, project44, Redwood Logistics, Scroll Network, Shipwell, Slync, Slync.io, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Kingston","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Intermodal, News, Railroad, Trucking, Warehouse, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-12T23:49:08-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/technology/marketwaves18-demo-day-part3","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/graphic-3.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Getting ready for Demo Day at MarketWaves, part 3: more companies and what they’ll be showing","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"This is the third in a series previewing companies that will be presenting their technology solutions at Demo Day next week as part of MarketWaves18 near Dallas. You can see our earlier stories here and here. Shipwell is an online freight platform that assists small and medium-sized businesses to leverage data, and helps reduce informational asymmetry by providing them with tools that would make shipping Amazon-sque. Much of Shipwell’s core technology is about creating a seamless customer experience and in driving efficiency through the freight shipping process. At MarketWaves18, the company is showcasing an artificial intelligence powered tool that assists with workflow automation. The AI engine analyzes data produced during the shipment process, with it finding ways to reduce human error through the shipment lifecycle. The tool gathers data points to understand shipments that fall outside normality, for instance, delayed shipments or shipments with variance issues, and looks to evolve the platform to react more proactively and build a positive shipping experience for its customers. This could be about creating geofencing around pickup locations for instantly picking up on trucker data or automating the process of sending out detention notices, in essence, connecting with clients through Shipwell’s native Android and iOS applications, and through regular phone-based tracking. For instance, the tool can detect a truck sitting in detention, and can help the trucker breathe easy by sending out a message mentioning that the tracking enabled on his truck would make him eligible for a detention payout. Though there is nothing to cheer about in getting stuck on detention, Shipwell feels that relaying such messages could show that the company is being proactive about supporting its customers. The AI tool captures around 7500 data points with every shipment, which Shipwell believes would help improve the experience, as it can automate a number of processes, thus doing away with significant manual hours spent on redundant operational touch points. Carrier management platform Trucker Tools is showcasing new features to its existing solution on the demo stage at MarketWaves18. The company mentioned that the enhancements would help brokers to be more sophisticated and work like an asset-based company by putting their weight behind trucks rather than loads. One of the features that Trucker Tools is highlighting is focused on its Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool that can read emails coming into brokers’ inboxes–which generally range in the hundreds–with queries and rates of loads and capacity. The process has largely been manual until now, with company personnel going through every email and responding to them in order. Apart from it being a tedious affair, it would also mean that emails might take hours at a stretch to be responded to, with brokers effectively losing out on a lot of loads due to late replies. The NLP tool would be of tremendous help here, as it would instantly read through the mails, trace back to the broker’s database to match loads, send out an email to the carrier, and revert with a copy back to the broker – all in the span of a few seconds. This would ensure a very high hit rate for the broker, and help seal lasting partnerships with carriers across specific lanes. Next in line is the digital asset negotiation tool that helps brokers to reach out to multiple carriers at the same time, via different mediums like mobile applications, carrier portals, or emails. Once the said carrier responds, the NLP tool picks up on the reply and can answer based on load availability. The third tool being showcased is a mail instrument that understands trucks plying between specific lanes and can predict its movement from location A to B with high accuracy, with it even accounting for freight seasonalities to make matching better. This allows brokers to estimate which trucks to approach when they have a load listing at a particular location. Transportation software solutions provider EBE Technologies will be presenting various applications from its suite of software focused on back-office processes like account receivables and payables, workflow, imaging solution, invoice resolution, and pre-dispatch workflows. Taking center stage will be its innovative mobile capture solution, which comes with various enhancements to make billing a seamless process. In today’s world, once the load is delivered the driver needs to drop the paperwork off at a terminal. Drivers typically use truck stops to scan or take pictures of the documents on their mobile phones before uploading them to the cloud, which is then taken out by the biller. But at this point, the clarity or the completeness of the needed document set is not confirmed, which would only be known when personnel on the desk take it out for billing the client. In the absence of some critical documents or if the images are blurred, the biller would need to set that specific load aside, connect with the driver, communicate issues with the document submission, and wait for the driver to submit the revised paperwork in, making it an arduous process. EBE Technologies’ mobile capture solution takes this redundancy out of the equation by checking on documents in real-time, with the workflow starting out immediately after the paperwork is submitted in by the driver. The software would recognize missing paperwork, move it to the exception queue, automate an alert to the driver about the missing documents, monitor the workflow until the rest of the paperwork comes in, and will finally send the completed documentation to the biller, ready to be invoiced to the client. The application also comes with an enhancement called the “capture wizard,” which would flag inappropriate and sloppy image captures on the part of drivers. The feature would highlight the border of the document in red, and would pop up a message to indicate sloppy handiwork. The feature would also restrict saving or sending improper photos, forcing drivers to retake images until they are clearly shot. EBE Technologies believes that this application in its entirety would help improve visibility for both drivers and carriers, and make cash flow more efficient, while also reducing the amount of labor consumed in the process.

The new consortium, dubbed Global Shipping Business Network, will vie with the blockchain group established this year by Maersk (Nasdaq OMX: MAERB) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) GSBN’s backers include CMA CGM, Cosco Shipping Lines (HK: 517), Evergreen Marine (TPEX: 2603), Orient Overseas Container Line (HK: 316), and Yang Ming (TPEX: 2609). Collectively the companies represent about one-third of global container ship capacity and jointly offer service as the Ocean Alliance. The memorandum of understanding for GSBN also includes major marine terminal owners DP World (FRA: 3DW), Hutchison Ports (SGX: NS8U), PSA International, and Shanghai International Port (SSE: 600018), which account for a similar share of global container throughput. Developing GSBN’s ledger technology is Hong Kong-based CargoSmart, a transportation management software company funded by OOCL. CargoSmart will provide software that aims to connect “carriers, terminal operators, customs agencies, shippers, and logistics service providers to enable collaborative innovation and digital transformation in the supply chain,” “With the vision of a truly open blockchain platform for the industry, the GSBN will be key to the success of establishing a sustainable blockchain ecosystem for all stakeholders in the supply chain,” said Andy Tung, co-chief executive officer of OOCL. The GSBN’s test project will be automating the flow of documents, invoices, and cargo release for the carriage of dangerous goods. The test, with a start date of December 2018, aims to “digitize and organize documents and automatically connect with relevant parties to streamline the approval process.” The new consortium comes four months after the debut of TradeLens, the blockchain joint venture of Maersk and IBM. Thanks to its early jump, TradeLens says it has recorded nearly 200 million transactions related to container shipping, and growing by one million per day. TradeLens has already signed 94 organizations to trial its distributed ledger technology, including port operators, logistics firms and freight forwarders. The latest trials of the TradeLens platform involve the Canadian Border Services Agency and the Port of Montreal.","TAGS":"CMA CGM, COSCO Shipping, IBM, Maersk, OOCL, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Borderlands: Canada, Container Shipping, Maritime, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-06T20:10:27-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/technology/marketwaves-demo-day-part2","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/graphic.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Getting ready for Demo Day at MarketWaves18, part 2: what several more companies are going to show","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Recently, we highlighted several companies who will be exhibiting software solutions at Demo Day, part of MarketWaves18. We continue our review here. Redwood Logistics is a next-generation freight management provider powered by a high-growth strategy, a commitment to forming long-lasting partnerships and an emphasis on maintaining a company culture that stimulates ingenuity and continual improvement. The company provides coast-to-coast coverage and a holistic approach to serving customers that combines expertise in moving freight where it needs to go, managing customer supply chains with flexible engagement and providing technical solutions that unlock the knowledge needed to maximize the value of their businesses. “The foundation of today’s modern supply chain begins with modern connectivity,” Redwood Logistics Senior Innovation Architect John Pattison said. RedwoodConnect is a next-generation cloud native supply chain connectivity platform that rapidly bridges the API gap and centralizes the data integration flow between partners, customers and suppliers. The product delivers the advantage of real-time supply chain visibility and data-driven insight. With highly modular business process orchestration, and scale-on-demand cloud compute capacity, RedwoodConnect ensures the customer’s data supply chain will continue to evolve with the customer’s supply chain ecosystem. Visualizing high-value supply chain metrics in real-time is also a reality with RedwoodInsight. RedwoodInsight utilizes RedwoodConnect’s high-speed, high-throughput data warehousing layer to transform and load data within minutes allowing customers to pull insight from their supply chain as it happens. McLeod is an ERP software company serving transportation providers in the trucking market for North America. The company delivers comprehensive solutions that are built to support the full range of their customers’ operations. “The recent announcements from Walmart confirm the blockchain use case that many have predicted would be one of the early ones,” McLeod Software’s VP of Marketing Mark Cubine said. “We have constructed a prototype of how our customers’ systems might interact with a cold chain custody blockchain for food or pharmaceutical product supply chains. It illustrates the types of likely interactions that transportation providers will need to automate with smart contracts for their shippers and consignees. This is an actual working example with live API’s from McLeod Software systems and a live blockchain.” McLeod Software’s systems architecture with open API’s and FlowLogix Smart Contracts product put customers in a position to easily interact with the whole range of evolving blockchain use cases that transportation providers will see. The company aims to make it easy and relatively inexpensive for McLeod customers. “This prototype demo should help everyone understand why the work of BiTA in standards development is so important,” Cubine said. “The real world use cases like this will be far easier and less expensive to support if the BiTA standards are adopted for the interactions that transportation providers like trucking companies, brokerage and 3PL companies will need to make with shipper supply chains on a daily basis.” Phillips Industries is a leading supplier and manufacturer of parts for the trucking industry, serving both OEMs and the aftermarket across the globe. As part of that innovative mindset, in 2017 Phillips Connect Technologies (PCT) was launched.PCT leverages IoT and uses a combination of software elements that drive asset tracking, location-based services and real-time visibility into asset maintenance conditions and will allow the fleet to more effectively control utilization and improve dispatch and safety factors, significantly reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) of its transportation assets.PCT will be showing its intermodal assets solution product ChassisNet and discussing the benefits of adding GPS tracking and load state sensing, as well as the health monitoring ability of the solution, covering lights, brakes and tire inflation. “We will explain how this will help companies attract and retain drivers by showing how our system can reduce dry runs and provide drivers greater confidence in the health of the trailer or chassis they are picking up, and how our system can help drivers by prepopulating their post-trip inspection report (DVIR) for selected smart sensor technologies,” Phillips Executive Director of Innovation Gerry Mead said. “PCT will show how this can be completed in real-time so that fleets see specific issues to address, and that they have an independent means to confirm that light, brake, and tire repairs are necessary in order to avoid delays.” Leveraging this technology to make predictive decisions can not only help save fleets money, it may also lead the way to autonomous vehicles and be the foundation for an equipment blockchain solution, according to Mead. Citizens Reserve exists to transform businesses and supply chains with blockchain. The company is doing this by building SUKU, a blockchain-based ecosystem that aims to make supply chains more efficient, transparent and collaborative. Citizens Reserve will be showcasing the SUKU Platform and some of its core capabilities for trading partners, which include suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and retailers from a traditional supply chain. “The SUKU Platform leverages the supply-chain-as-a-service paradigm that will transform the way organizations engage with supply chains.” Citizens Reserve Director of Product and Operations Martin Kaczynski said. “Additionally, the supply chain as-a-service model will enable technology partners and service providers to build additional capabilities and services for the SUKU ecosystem.” The company is currently pursuing partnerships with technology and service providers to grow its platform. FreightFriend exists to support the development and growth of collaborative relationships among shippers, logistics companies and asset providers. One of the elements of the company’s software is a carrier relationship management tool for logistics providers and shippers to help them identify and develop transportation partners, and that feeds into a collaborative approach that provides automated matching and sharing of information between established relationships. It does that by allowing a friendship invitation and acceptance process requiring mutual acceptance, then provides full integration with existing systems. “FreightFriend is technology, location and load agnostic, so we support the identification and development of relationships and an automated information sharing tool to connect those relationships once they’re established,” FreightFriend Founder and CEO Noam Frankel said. “We enable the identification and development of collaborative relationships, but we leave the execution of freight movements and the associated margin of savings to our clients. We sell software and expertise rather than trying to steal customers, drivers and the transaction fees and margins associated with those movements.” Frankel said not enough logistics providers develop important carrier relationships, and FreightFriend can offer a solution to the problem by training and enabling the process of developing and identifying those relationships, then foster the expansion of them. Vector was founded with the concept of empowering logistics companies with better tools to help achieve greater operational efficiency and intelligence. Its signature product, LoadDocs, aims to do just that. LoadDocs digitizes workflows and communications into a central platform for enhanced visibility and efficiencies. The document scanning app and workflow management platform works on all iPhones, Android devices and PeopleNet PCTs. The company notes that the solution “fills the industry’s need for impeccable document scans delivered instantly to billing, safety and other departments who rely on bills of lading, accident reports, and other critical docs, along with intelligent workflow management for the back office.” Available today, LoadDocs incorporates computer vision and artificial intelligence to automate otherwise manual work and help reduce clerical errors. Users simply have to upload standard documents for the system to learn which fields to extract data from and integrate that data with their TMS or other software solution. Blockchain technology provider Filament will be demonstrating the company’s Blocklet Solutions for Freight at MarketWaves18. Presented by Filament’s Head of Product, Jake Ingman, and Filament’s Head of Business Development, Chris Wood, the demonstration will show how its solutions enable vehicles to securely interact with a distributed ledger through the J1939 or J1962 connectors and other customized integrations. The products incorporate several standard hardware elements such as a dual-core microcontroller with BLE capabilities, GPS, cellular LTE modem, a 9-axis motion fusion sensor and a temperature, humidity, and pressure sensor. As freight organizations seek new ways to compete in the digital world, blockchain makes it possible to streamline and improve operations, addressing many of the industry’s challenges including tracking and verifying shipped goods, resolving disputes, and reducing administration costs. Filament builds blockchain systems for freight and other industries that rely on Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) equipment. Its hardware, software, and services allow connected vehicles, devices, and machines to securely interact with and transact value against blockchains. By enabling vehicles and machines to transact with each other, freight and logistics organizations can achieve immutable odometer recordings, verify vehicle service records, track parts moving along supply chains, and more. Filament’s work with freight and logistics organizations brings a new level of transparency, trust, and value to data secured from industrial machines. The company’s Blocklet Kit is currently available for proofs of concept and pilots. The blockchain starter kit includes hardware, software, security protocols, training, technical support, and SDK documentation. Filament’s Blocklet Solutions for Freight will be available soon.","TAGS":"Citizens Reserve, demo day, Filament, FreightFriend, marketwaves18, McLeod Software, Phillips Industries, Redwood Logistics, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Intermodal, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-06T18:02:04-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/envista-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/BiTANewMemberPressReleaseGraphic28929-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"enVista Joins Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"enVista, a leading global consulting and software solutions firm, has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an organization dedicated to determining best practices and standards for blockchain in the transportation/logistics/freight marketplace. enVista will bring its deep expertise in providing global freight audit and payment visibility and end-to-end supply chain optimization to the Alliance.

While autonomous and robotics get a lot of hype, such technology is rife with challenges. From regulations to infrastructure to the sheer cost of creating and testing the hardware, billions of dollars are being invested in the space with little to show for it—at least in the short term. Meanwhile, as all these new data applications are in play, we’re still largely centralized in the cloud and remain surprisingly open to cyber hack attacks. That’s where decentralized enterprise blockchain applications are becoming a real thing in the venture capital world. We’re also increasingly at risk simply because of the advancement of technology. Everything’s connected. There are more connected devices, including IoT devices. There are multiple entry points from phishing, to spam, to user passwords, to installing malware, to divulging confidential information to third-party vendors. Speaking at the ATA’s NAFC earlier this summer, Randy Goggan, co-founder and executive VP of ThreatAdvice, said, “There’s a well-known saying: ‘There are only two types of companies: those who have been hacked, and those that will be.’” Goggan added: “Really, to me, it’s ‘and those who don’t know they’ve been hacked.\u0027” “This is organized crime. It’s sophisticated, and they’re after you. So, get prepared,” he said. “It takes an average of 206 days to detect a breach. Most companies we see today pay the ransom. It may not be a lot. It may be like three bitcoins, but when it comes down to it, CEOs want their data back. They usually pay.” In light of such transportation industry concerns, ATA Technology \u0026 Maintenance Council (TMC) and Transportation Security Council (TSC) has developed the Fleet CyWatch supported program. The program assists ﬂeet members in reporting information about trucking-related internet crimes and cyber-attacks, and shares information to ﬂeets about cyber threats that may impact their operations. The new program coordinates with private and federal efforts to provide motor carriers with information and recommendations in the areas of cybersecurity awareness, prevention, and mitigation methods. The program connects industry, federal enforcement, and associations and trade groups specialized in cybersecurity to improve U.S. road transport safety. Major solutions, however, linger on the fringes with the evolution of blockchain technology. Still in its infancy, blockchain is increasingly being adopted by companies seeking data security solutions. One such company that incorporated in October of 2017, and just completed a small seed round, is the Scroll Network. Even while making plans for a Series A they’re focused on developing client engagement and revenue. From the beginning, they’ve been interested in data security and preventing data breaches. Their first product will be SlideDrive. “We encrypt communication between file transfer. If you saved your file that means you care about your file, and you can pull from any location or device and do so safely and easily,” Arielle Telesmanic, director of emerging technologies at Scroll, tells FreightWaves by phone. “We’re excited about getting our first product out in the coming months. It’s outrageously exciting. We’re getting nothing but positive feedback. People are loving a closed network and protecting their information. We just want to provide a decentralized network for everyone while also providing data security,” she adds. One of Scroll’s recent announcements involves their joining the The Linux Foundation and Hyperledger. The fundamental missions of both Hyperledger and the Scroll Network closely align, and the team is excited to be taking the next step in their technological development to better grow their software. Scroll wants to take Blockchain in a completely different direction from their predecessor, and they want the world to be able to utilize blockchain in the most efficient way as soon as possible. “We believe that this cooperation with Hyperledger will be a large step forward in creating new, innovative frameworks for Scroll as we continue to build,” they write on their company blog. “The hyperledger network is still an infant technology,” says Telesmanic. “And while they’ve done a great job building what’s possible, we’re building on top. The ordering network that fabric uses is in a specific order. We’re interested in this specifically. When we’re designing our consensus model, we wanted something that was secure and scalable,” she says. “It’s a peer-to-verified peer consensus model,” adds Khashab Khashab, Scroll’s chief revenue officer. “It’s something that’s hard to crack,” says Telesmanic. “You’re never going to get the 51%. It’s a great format to work on because of their [Hyperledger’s] ordering service. It’s about how we route the transaction priority based on deadlines and PO.” “Hyperledger has many different libraries. There are lots of frameworks for adopting. There’s a lot of people using it as a playground right now,” explains Telesmanic. “We’re focused on storage. We’re working with them to make sure that they can handle our storage needs while still maintaining the security.” Right now, Scroll is working with a supply chain customer in additive manufacturing so that they can develop smart contracts to report on chain. Essentially, the machine code constantly checks the code. The system simply makes sure that the code is always the same. So the company doesn’t have to worry about someone getting in to the vulnerabilities. The machine won’t run if there’s a change made. Right now, the Scroll team’s focus is on risk management, and they start with smaller projects. Their primary goal is to develop a fully integrated data management system, but first they’re working on the smaller learning curves to get things in place. Both inter and intra operations. Scroll is set to demo their forthcoming product at the MarketWaves18 event in Grapevine, Texas this November 12.

The first was at Transparency18 in Atlanta in May; five presenters were deemed “best in show.” A new crop of presenters will be onstage at MarketWaves’ Demo Day. They’ll have just a few minutes each to tell their story. FreightWaves’ editorial staff reached out to the presenters and asked them to share with our readers what they’ll be demonstrating in Dallas. Here’s a summary of some of the presenters and what they’ll be discussing in Dallas; we’ll be adding more as the conference approaches. DLT Labs, a global provider of enterprise data management solutions powered by blockchain, will be presenting its DL Asset Track solution. DL Asset Track is a supply chain management system for the freight and logistics industry that utilizes blockchain technology to increase efficiencies, reduce costs and optimize the flow and tracking of goods, the company said. This solution guarantees the verifiability of carrier claims and accessorial costs, provides real-time shipment traceability, and delivers the highest level of invoice matching and payment assurance for increased payment approvals throughout a supply chain. Used within freight payment management systems, DL Asset Track provides that single reference point of “truth” in a transaction for all participants. In addition to verifying carrier claims and accessorial charges, the solution can eliminate payment delays since shipment tender details are updated in a timely manner and stop duplicate entries in different applications due to a lack of data integration/mirroring between systems. These types of situations lead to higher operational costs due to the time and resources needed to verify costs and reconciling payments. Companies can also eliminate overpayments by shippers and delayed payments to carriers by using DL Asset Track, the company notes. DLT Labs says its DL Asset Track, like all blockchain applications, provides an immutable, single source of truth for all participants; greater traceability and validity of all authorized data entries in the supply chain; instant verification of accessorial costs; real-time update and verifiability of shipment details; and instant payment clearance at a fraction of the transaction cost. Additional benefits include a reduction in less time spent on manual invoice reconciliation; enhanced security, better traceability and invoice matching; faster payment of invoices, resulting in more discounts; and tamper-proof claims. DL Asset Track will enter production in January with a Canadian subsidiary of a major global retailer, DLT Labs says. Spireon, known for its vehicle intelligence solutions, will be presenting a demonstration of its IntelliScan cargo sensing technology at MarketWaves18. IntelliScan, which has been in operation with a select group of Spireon customers, is now generally available. The solution provides accuracy in visualizing cargo load status. Using a unique combination of sensing methods, IntelliScan helps identify how much cargo is actually inside your trailer. “The accuracy of IntelliScan technology is vastly superior to anything on the market today, and the industry has been in dire need of a better solution for cargo monitoring,” said Rick Gruenhagen, chief technology officer at Spireon. “Our new cargo sensor can deliver the precise readings trailer managers need, saving time, reducing detention and maximizing resources to drive bottom line results.” Spireon’s FleetLocate Cargo Sensor with IntelliScan technology avoids the issues that confound ultrasonic detection systems, such as temperature, humidity, cargo type and the sensor’s distance from the cargo, to more accurately identify the load. Materials placed against ultrasonic sensors can block the sonic waves, potentially identifying cargo that isn’t there. IntelliScan uses laser technology and a camera in a single device to provide cargo detection. Combining IntelliScan technology and FleetLocate’s advanced reporting and alerts, trailer operators are able to better monitor cargo, manage detention and improve service to shippers while maximizing trailer utilization and accelerating turns, the company points out. “Inefficient cargo management kills profitability for all fleet managers—truckload, LTL and private fleets alike,” said Roni Taylor, vice president of strategy and business development at Spireon. “We are thrilled to offer our customers ground-breaking IntelliScan technology that will give them a virtual eye inside the trailer to improve detention management and trip planning, both critical for competitiveness in the market.” Trimble Transportation offers a suite of transportation management software and telematics solutions to 2300 customers in the trucking industry. Its next step, as debuted at its annual user conference, focuses on developing a cloud-based enterprise platform, Trimble Cloud Exchange (TCX), to integrate current systems and host new products empowering customers with unparalleled capabilities to meet demanding market needs. At Marketwaves, the company plans to unveil concepts developed using Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum frameworks. Blockchain, using its inherit networking ability, is a true enabler for Trimble as it allows both internal and external parties to communicate with each other with full transparency and visibility. Since TCX is already configured to send shipment and location data from TMS systems to visibility providers like 10-4 and others, it offers a turn-key solution to have the same data in a blockchain network with very little effort, which puts Trimble in a unique position to bring this capability faster to the market. Trimble Transportation’s software products, which include TMW, Peoplenet, 10-4 Systems and ALK Technologies, already communicate to both internal external applications for some basic operations. TCX and blockchain will allow those applications to provide a more integrated view of the multiple transactions involved in the transportation industry. With its blockchain feature, TCX-hosted applications will be able to follow a shipment from order creation to shipment tracking to invoice submission to cash collection. Carriers making bids on freight will also be able to have a wider array of data to call on through the use of blockchain-enabled TMS and telematics software. Project44’s technology network empowers transportation and supply chain executives to execute fast, agile and scalable logistics services that meet the rapidly evolving needs of today’s on-demand consumer. The Chicago-based start-up develops application program interfaces (APIs) that are able to share normalized data with a multimodal network of capacity providers in an automated, real-time manner. Project44 distributes its solution through web service API’s that are integrated into enterprise software applications, including the top commercial transportation management software, enterprise resource planning, and customer service platforms. At MarketWaves18, project44 will demonstrate how its platform integrates into customer service with CRM software platform Salesforce, consignee applications such as mobile tracking, and operations through data visualization software from Tableau. Unlike point-to-point integration solutions typical of electronic data interchange and legacy technology, project44’s one-to-many network provides clients the infrastructure required to quickly go to market, flexibility react to ever-changing requirements and scale without added integration complexity. The company’s capacity provider network eliminates the need for legacy communication tools, while delivering advanced predictive capabilities such as data normalization and enrichment or intelligent routing and mode optimization. Ultimately, enabling project44 clients to make data-driven business decisions at a lower cost and outperform their competition. Full Circle TMS provides web-based Transportation Management System (TMS) designed for progressive trucking companies looking for the latest in transportation technology. Full Circle was founded in 2015 by Stuart Sutton, who designed and built two other TMS products and has been in the industry over 23 years: a full function TMS; a private load board; a built-in mobile app; and integration with outside systems. In the demo, Sutton will focus on how its customers are going paperless and invoicing immediately after the trip empties. The process in the Full Circle tool starts with an order being dispatched to the driver. After each event is done, customers receive emails/text with appropriate trip information. A “customer rate confirmation” is emailed to the shipper and electronically signed. The signed document is automatically returned into the system and indexed to the order to appear with the invoice. The invoice is final rated and emailed directly to the customer. This can be done within minutes of the trip completing. If something changes during the life of the order (detention, redirect, etc.) a new customer rate confirmation” is emailed to the shipper and electronically signed. The signed document is automatically returned into the system and indexed to the order to appear with the invoice. When the order is complete, the appropriate imaged paperwork is tagged to “show with invoice”. The invoice is final rated and emailed directly to the customer. This can be done within minutes of the trip completing.","TAGS":"DLT Labs, Full Circle TMS, project44, Spireon, Trimble, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-10-31T12:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/northern-block-joins-the-blockchain-in-transport-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/BiTANewMemberPressReleaseGraphic28729-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Northern Block joins the Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Northern Block, a Toronto-based blockchain product venture shop, has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an organization dedicated to determining best practices and standards for blockchain in the transportation/logistics/supply chain marketplace. The Alliance seeks to provide more clarity and education around blockchain applications and encourage its adoption through exemplary implementation. Blockchain technology enables transactions to be identified and tracked digitally and shared across a distributed network of computers. In the supply chain, blockchain enables participants to more effectively track goods and freight and to operate in a more seamless and transparent manner. It can also help to create new revenue streams and value for customers by enabling a system to complete transactions, track shipments and manage fleets. “In the transportation and logistics industries, there are many players involved, which results in complexities for tracking the provenance and quality of goods throughout the value chain. This granularity of transparency becomes crucial, especially in strict regulatory and compliance-heavy environments,” said Mathieu Glaude, President and CEO of Northern Block. “If deployed carefully, blockchain applications can solve many of these problems, while unlocking tremendous value for the users in the ecosystem – cost savings, transparency and quality among many more. However, as more and more permissioned blockchain solutions are developed through various consortiums, focusing on proper standards for blockchain technologies becomes important. Imagine the value that can be unlocked when different decentralized networks can talk to each other in a trusted way.” According to BiTA President Chris Burruss, “Blockchain can transform the supply chain by improving transparency and innovation. On behalf of the members of BiTA, I welcome Northern Block into the Alliance. Northern Block’s expertise across multiple industries will help speed the development of blockchain standards.” BiTA’s standards will address the stewardship of smart contracts, freight payments, asset maintenance and ownership history, chain of custody of freight and other issues facing the transportation and logistics industry. “We’re surrounding ourselves with the brightest people who want to change the world. We’re determined to use blockchain technologies to design systems that will ultimately give data ownership back to the end user,” added Glaude. About Northern Block Northern Block has been pioneering the development of decentralized products throughout various industries. Focusing on such a wide range of use cases has allowed the Toronto-based firm to apply learnings from one industry to another. “We’ve learned so much from building products for trucking logistics, but having also built products for agriculture, payments, digital identity and developing tools allows us to define stronger product visions,” said Glaude. “We’re not trying to make a process improvement by deploying a blockchain application, we’re looking to take a step back and think about how they can be leveraged to turn a business model upside down.” About the Blockchain in Transport Alliance Founded in August 2017, BiTA has grown into the largest commercial blockchain alliance in the world, with more than 470 members that collectively generate over $1 trillion in revenue annually. BiTA members are primarily from the freight, transportation, logistics and affiliated industries. Alliance members share a common mission to develop a standards framework, educate the market on blockchain applications and encourage the use of those applications. BiTA has offices in: Chattanooga, Tennessee (USA); Sydney, Australia (Asia-Pacific Region) and London (European Region).

The platform, which envisions an ecosystem of open source protocols, blockchain, and machine-learning technologies, allowed the shipper and carrier to directly connect, negotiate rates, and schedule pickup and delivery. For this first truckload shipment, the 5,320-lb frozen food shipment was hauled from Preferred Freezer Services in Medley, FL to Manny’s Enterprises, Inc, in Sunrise, FL on October 15, 2018. It takes a lot of cooks in the kitchen to make it all happen. dexFreight partnered with Netuno USA, one of the fastest growing seafood wholesalers, Arel Trucking Inc., an asset-based motor carrier with over 180 trucks, and RSK, the first smart contract platform secured by Bitcoin. Funds for the transaction were held in escrow by the smart contract on the integrated RSK platform and were automatically released to the carrier upon delivery. “This is a huge milestone towards an imminent transformation of the logistics industry through the adoption of blockchain technology,” said Rajat Rajbhandari CEO and co-founder of dexFreight. “Our platform aims for a truly decentralized model, open to all the stakeholders, and allowing for a new world of services that will bring much needed optimization and liquidity to this industry.” “With the use of smart contracts, companies like dexFreight can transfer value and assets between parties on our platform,” said Diego Gutierrez, CEO of RSK. “With a defined set of rules, in this case for logistics, all participants know that their business needs will be fulfilled without anyone altering their agreement or changing the rules.” dexFreight, which will deliver unprecedented transparency, accountability and a trust layer that is sorely lacking in today’s logistics process, features an industry-first blockchain-based verified identity and objective reputation system derived from smart contract data and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as on-time pick-up and delivery, on-time payments, loading and unloading times, freight claims, etc. “This is a huge milestone towards an imminent transformation of the logistics industry through the adoption of blockchain technology.” With this data readily available, shippers and third parties can streamline the carrier onboarding process while reducing associated liability risk. With up-to-date profiles in the platform, including all required and relevant documentation such as licensing, insurance, safety and performance records, and credit history, counterparties will be automatically qualified based on unique business requirements, issuing alerts or even preventing transactions when qualifications drop below designated thresholds. “With dexFreight, we have transparency into loads we’re shipping all over the U.S. based on honest and accurate information that is beneficial for our operation and our customers,” said Luciano Bonaldo, president and co-founder of Netuno USA Inc. “dexFreight solves the issue of false documentation by making our transactions with shippers completely transparent, and so we can get paid for the service we provided,” said Robert J. Julia, CFO, Arel Trucking. “This technology is the way of the future for the whole trucking industry.”","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain-based logistics platform, carriers, dexFreight, Netuno USA, RSK, Shippers, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-10-24T18:23:28-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/gtg-technology-group-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/BiTANewMemberPressReleaseGraphic28629-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"GTG Technology Group joins Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an organization dedicated to determining best practices and standards for blockchain in the transportation/logistics/supply chain marketplace, is pleased to announce that GTG Technology Group has joined the Alliance.

The Port of Rotterdam Authority, which operates the largest port in Europe, says the blockchain pilot project will include Netherlands-based bank ABM Amro (Euronext: ABN.A) and the enterprise technology arm of Korea’s Samsung (LSE: SMSN). The project’s goal is “a complete, paperless integration of physical, administrative and financial streams within international distribution chains,” the Port of Rotterdam said in a statement. It said transporting a container can involve up to 28 parties which have to trade paper documentation to move a container. “Currently payments, administration and the physical transportation of containers still take place entirely via separate circuits,” said Paul Smits, the Port of Rotterdam Authority’s chief financial officer. ‘This results in inefficiency as many parties are involved and everything is organised via paper documentation.” BlockLab, a local start-up funded by the Port and the City of Rotterdam, will be developing the project.  Daphne de Kluis, the chief executive of ABN Amro’s commercial banking, says the project aims to integrate workflow management, track and trace, digitization of paper documentation such as waybills and the financing of handled freight or services. “This will make the logistics chain more transparent and efficient, and millions of euros can be saved in the long term,” she said. The pilot involves the transport of a container from a factory in Asia to a location in the Netherlands. In the first instance, the pilot will be implemented by the three parties, but the cooperative network will then become open for other parties to join. The pilot starts in January next year, and the results will be announced in February 2019. The trial project is one of several launched to test blockchain. Last year, the Port of Antwerp started a project with Belgium’s NxtPort. The Port of Antwerp also plans to collaborate with Abu Dhabi’s Maqta Gateway on blockchain solutions for ports. Associated British Ports plans to also test blockchain technology developed by Marine Transport International.","TAGS":"ABN Amro, Port of Rotterdam, Samsung SDS, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-10-19T21:39:34-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/trucking/voters-announced-for-freight-tech-25-awards","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/FreigthTech25_ArticleHeader-1.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"FreightWaves Research Institute announces voting panel for Freight.Tech 25 awards","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The FreightWaves Research Institute has announced the list of 55 voters who will be choosing the inaugural winners of the Freight.Tech 25 awards, to be announced at FreightWaves’ MarketWaves18 conference, being held Nov. 12-13, 2018, at the Gaylord Texan Resort \u0026 Convention Center in Grapevine, Texas. To register for MarketWaves18, visit https://www.freightwaves.com/marketwaves18/. “Taking the opportunity to vote is the best way to show value in the hard work being done to change and improve all aspects of the freight industry by these leaders,” says Lori Heino-Royer, director of business innovation for Daimler, and one of the esteemed panel of voters. The Freight.Tech 25 winners will be chosen from the Freight.Tech 100, which was recently announced. Freight.Tech 100 was chosen by an initial panel of 9 voters from more than 500 nominations. It honors the most innovative companies in the freight business today. Accounting firm Katz, Sapper \u0026 Miller (KSM) will handle the next stage of voting for the Freight.Tech 25. The voters, a who’s who of freight, include top executives and company founders, venture capitalists, sales and marketing executives, digital leaders, deans and directors of some of the top leading supply chain and transportation schools in the country, chief innovation officers, and chief technology officers. Participating voters were chosen to represent a broad array of perspectives from across industry to include not only C-suite, investor and academic representatives, but also those who represent small, mid-sized and large companies as well as start-ups and established businesses. Voters get the opportunity to learn more about these companies and their technologies, something Eric Rempel, CIO of Redwood Logistics, says benefits everyone. “Redwood is super excited to participate in the Freight.Tech 100 because it provides an inside view to promising technologies that cross the competitive divide,” he says. “As a voter, we get this unique opportunity to learn more about the most innovative offerings, and then potentially work with these companies to bring their services and technologies to our customer base.” Among the voters is Jake Medwell, a founding partner of venture capital investment firm 8VC. Medwell points out how the Freight.Tech 100 opens eyes to how much innovation is really taking place in transportation. “The logistics and supply chain industry is so vast and complex that it allows for highly-focused companies working on a single element of the supply chain to create billions in enterprise value,” Medwell says. “It’s been incredible to see all of the entrepreneurial activity in the space, and I continue to be impressed by how many companies are working to optimize these unique and important verticals of the market.” Each voter will review the companies in the Freight.Tech 100 and rank their top 25. KSM will audit the results, assigning a point value for each company based on a sliding scale (first place receives 25 points, second place 24, and so on). The Freight.Tech 25 will be revealed at MarketWaves18. Special recognition will take place for the top 5 companies. “I’m honored to be a voter and to help evaluate some of the leading innovators and thought leaders in the industry,” William Dreigert, director of Uber Freight, remarks.

The Freight.Tech 100 is not all about young upstarts, either. Companies like Cummins (NYSE: CMI) and Daimler AG (OTC: DDAIF) made the cut. Cummins is pushing the envelope with advanced technologies including electrification of commercial powertrains. Daimler AG is among the world’s largest innovators, with electric, autonomous and mobility solutions becoming an ever-greater part of its portfolio. “We’re more than pleased with the caliber of companies nominated,” said Arlen Stark, FreightWaves’ EVP of Research. “We very much appreciate everyone that took the time to nominate their company or another company that they think is innovative. The 9 initial voters looked at several factors, such as the amount of capital raised, Crunchbase ranking, other rankings and recognition received, and whether they are currently having an impact.” More than 500 nominations were received for the Freight.Tech 100, and the winners will now go into a second level of competition to become part of the Freight.Tech 25, which will be announced at the MarketWaves18 conference on Nov. 12–13, 2018 at the Gaylord Texan Resort \u0026 Convention Center in Grapevine, Texas. To register, visit https://www.freightwaves.com/marketwaves18/. The initial vote was a blind vote conducted by the 9 voters. To be named to the Freight.Tech 100, a company had to secure at least 5 votes from the 9. The first round of voting was undertaken by FreightWaves employees. The next round to determine the Freight.Tech 25 will be conducted by 56 independent voters in a process managed by acclaimed accounting firm Katz, Sapper \u0026 Miller (KSM). The voters will use a 1–25 sliding point system (25 points for first, 24 for second, etc.) to rank the companies. The top 5 companies will receive a special recognition at MarketWaves18. The Freight.Tech 100 is designed to recognize the most innovative and disruptive companies in freight. As such, it seeks to recognize those companies that are most disruptive, and few have been as disruptive as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which makes the list. Blockchain and artificial intelligence are prominent technologies for several companies in the Freight.Tech 100, including dexFreight and Fr.8 Network. Learning Machine is another company using blockchain to disrupt. “A leader in the development of blockchain technologies, Learning Machine provides a secure platform to issue records in a format that is tamper proof, recipient owned, and independently verifiable,” noted a comment on the nomination form for the company. Some companies, like Intelligent Audit, received glowing reviews from those that nominated them. “They are on the cutting edge in their space for automation and normalization of carrier data analytics,” said one of the comments on IA’s nomination form. The companies on the list cover all modes of transportation. Traditional freight companies such as J.B. Hunt Transport (NASDAQ: JBHT), which has invested over $500 million in technology in recent years, and Landstar System (NASDAQ: LSTR) are joined on the list by ocean carrier Maersk, which is working with IBM to develop blockchain solutions, showing that innovation doesn’t just come from Silicon Valley. In addition to truck OEMs like Daimler AG, Navistar (NYSE: NAV) and Paccar (NASDAQ: PCAR), startup manufacturers like Nikola Motor Company, which is building a hydrogen fuel-cell tractor, are being honored in the Freight.Tech 100. Companies like Dock411, KeepTruckin’, PEIR Mobile, and Konexial are all working to improve the driver’s experience with their innovative use of technologies and made the list, representing a number of driver-focused companies. Logistics companies such as Echo Global Logistics (NASDAQ: ECHO), Arrive Logistics and BlueGrace Logistics are among the companies that have been hard at work developing innovative solutions to help shippers and carriers more effectively move freight. Even a company like Logistical Labs, which is a tech provider working to help brokerages drive sales and manage margins, shows that innovation can come from many sources. Other technology companies that made the cut include Pegasus Transflo, Platform Science, project44, Spireon, Trimble (NASDAQ: TRMB), and McLeod Software. Other companies of note on the list include Toyota (NYSE: TM), Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Thor, Werner (NASDAQ: WERN), Reliance Partners and C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ: CHRW). The FreightWaves Research Institute focuses on surveys, research, awards and credentialing. The full list (in alphabetical order) of companies appearing on the Freight.Tech 100 follows. Those companies making the Freight.Tech 25 will be announced at MarketWaves18 on Nov. 12–13, 2018 at the Gaylord Texan Resort \u0026 Convention Center in Grapevine, Texas.

The network aims to improve food safety and reduce waste, according to IBM Food Trust Vice President Brigid McDermott. The blockchain-based cloud network offers participating retailers, suppliers, growers and food industry providers data intended to increase traceability, transparency and efficiency. It has completed 18 months of testing, according to an IBM media release. “What we see now as one of the biggest problems in the food industry is the lack of transparency. Everybody really wants to deliver fresh, safe foods that meet consumers’ needs, but because information is sitting in notebooks, the industry itself is not as efficient or as safe as it could be,” McDermott said. “IBM Food Trust leverages new technology, blockchain technology, to provide a trusted system of record, which allows us to take a lot of the investments and advances we’ve made over the years and really start reaping strong benefits from that in terms of, initially, food safety, but also freshness ,waste and sustainability over time.” McDermott said IBM started working on IBM Food Trust with Walmart about two and a half years ago. Since then, IBM has partnered with companies like Dole and Nestlé to test the Food Trust. More recently, French multinational retailer Carrefour announced it will begin utilizing the network with Carrefour-branded products. “Being a founding member of the IBM Food Trust platform is a great opportunity for Carrefour to accelerate and widen the integration of blockchain technology to our products in order to provide our clients with safe and undoubted traceability,” said Laurent Vallée, general secretary of Carrefour in an IBM media release. “This is a decisive step in the roll-out of Act for Food, our global program of concrete initiatives in favor of the food transition.” When many people think of blockchain, they think of cryptocurrency. While IBM leaders consider the Food Trust network a distributed, decentralized ledger, they recognize that the cloud-based food network does not align perfectly with the popular cryptocurrency use case. “The first use case that anybody created happened to be cryptocurrency, the first few instances of which were done in a non-permissioned way. What that basically means is that anybody is allowed to get on, and they don’t have to prove any kind of identity,” McDermott said. “If we think about permissioning as a continuum from that, where it’s completely open and anybody can join to something that would be very closed, what we see is an opportunity to have a permissioned network that is still very open. In working with some of our early adopters and setting our governance model, we said the solution is open to everybody in the food ecosystem but everybody has to identify themselves. That’s because, as a food business, shipping something from one company to another, you want to know you’re doing business with the right person.” In addition to straying away from the anonymity that has become associated with cryptocurrency, IBM Food Trust also takes a different approach to decentralization. With cryptocurrency, like bitcoin, the ledger file is distributed across a multitude of private computers, which represent nodes of the network. With IBM Food Trust, all nodes run on the IBM Cloud, but each node is still controlled by a separate entity. “The network is decentralized. It is based on the notion of trust anchors that provide trust guarantees to the entire IBM Food Trust community. Each trust anchor runs its own blockchain node and all data is fully encrypted,” Hannah Slocum, Global External Communications, IBM Blockchain said. “All the nodes currently run on the IBM Blockchain Platform on the IBM Cloud. The data uploader owns the data and permissions others to see the data. Data you are permissioned to see cannot be shared or sold without consent from the data owner.” As part of its goal to increase product freshness and reduce food waste, IBM Food Trust is aiming to make to supply chain more collaborative and transparent. IBM is working with companies like 3M, Centricity, Trellis and Emerson to contribute important supply chain, provenance, testing and sensor data to the blockchain ecosystem, according to a media release. “The power of IBM Food Trust is in bringing together not only retailers and suppliers but also the rest of the ecosystem touching our food supply,” said Natalie Dyenson, vice president, Food Safety \u0026 Quality, Dole in an IBM media release. “For example, Dole is working with Centricity, a grower-owned partner, to connect audit data to the blockchain by leveraging the Trellis framework as a standard for the produce industry, using existing formats and processes. By simplifying on-farm and front-office reporting and putting data on the blockchain, IBM Food Trust has helped Dole unlock the value of compliance data across our suppliers and partners in a cost-effective way.” All players in the food ecosystem may now begin uploading their own data to IBM Food Trust free of charge. Businesses can purchase the trace or certificate modules, which allow them to utilize the data other businesses are uploading and permissioning them to see.","TAGS":"Blockchain, food safety, IBM, IBM blockchain, IBM Food Trust, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ashley Coker Prince","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-10-15T13:30:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/syfan-logistics-joins-blockchain-in-transport-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/BiTA2BNew2BMember2BPress2BRelease2BGraphic2B28429-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Syfan Logistics joins the Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Syfan Logistics, a third-party logistics and transportation company, has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an organization dedicated to determining best practices and standards for blockchain in the transportation/logistics/supply chain marketplace.

At the epicenter of this project is Kirkenes of Norway, an Arctic Ocean port situated at one of the northernmost points of the hemisphere. Earlier this March, the Finnish Ministry of Transport and Communications had zeroed in on a route between Rovaniemi in Finland to Kirkenes. The railway line once completed could lead to a closer link between the northern, Arctic, and continental Europe – driving in an industrial scene that could flourish at its wake. The estimated cost of the construction has been pegged at $3.3 billion, including $1 billion from the Norwegian government for extending the line into its borders. However, all is not well with the railroad project, as the planned route crisscrosses through reindeer habitats and coincides with the existence of the Sámi tribe – a reindeer herding community that calls the Arctic Circle its home. The ministry did understand this predicament and had scoured the region for different possible courses before finalizing the Rovaniemi-Kirkenes route. According to FreightWaves’ Zach Strickland, at the end of September, the Outbound Tender Volume Index was at 10105 (anything above 10,000 means that the trucking volumes have increased above their March 1, 2018 number). As of Friday, October 5th, the index was sitting at 9434, a 6% drop from the end of the third quarter. The missing piece of the puzzle is currently the automated comparison of freight and available vehicles. In a fully automated supply chain, a product on an Industry 4.0 production line would already be produced with the digital information to book the transport for its own delivery shortly before its completion. —Dr. Gerhard Nowak, Partner at Strategy \u0026 Germany.

(Supply Chain 24/7) Truck drivers have long suspected that the city of Washington D.C. is stealing their hours and keeping them off the road. They now have proof: Washington D.C. and the metropolitan section of the city around Alexandria, Virginia is the least efficient area in the country in terms of efficiency on driver’s hours of service (HOS). Using SONAR’s proprietary HOS11 data-set, we were able to list out the least efficient and most efficient cities in the country. Least efficient refers to the number of hours in a driver’s allocated 11 that are dedicated to driving. A driver in the Washington D.C. market should only expect to get about 4.9 hours a day towards driving, less than half of the permitted 11.

Ready? Blockchain is an “append-only decentralized immutable ledger.” That isn’t so hard, is it? Actually, it is. There’s a lot of complex, abstract, and technical concepts to understand, and many in the supply chain want to know how it applies specifically to their field. Understandably, industry participants want practical applications. They want to know what’s happening, and whether or not it’s an actual solution for their needs. Toward that end, the panel consisted of blockchain experts, Ken Craig, Jordan Graft, and Dale Chrystie. Ken Craig is VP of special projects at McLeod. Jordan Graft is EVP of TriumphPay. Dale Chrystie is business fellow, blockchain strategist for FedEx. Each of the “blockchain rockstars,” or “blockstars” as I referred to them as panel moderator, are on the BiTA (Blockchain in Transport Alliance) Board of Directors. McLeod is a BiTA member as well, and if you haven’t yet heard of BiTA, founded in August of 2017, let’s just say it’s been a busy year. Ken Craig gave an overview of what BiTA is doing. BiTA has 470 members and has received nearly 3,000 applications. It also comes from a diverse array of companies. Law firms, OEMs, service providers, IoT companies, TMS companies, trade associations (such as OOIDA), universities, industry participants such as carriers, shippers, rail, and air cargo companies. There are also insurance companies, brokerages, investment banking companies, consulting and audit services, marketing and recruiting agencies, and pharmaceutical companies. There are, finally, even real live blockchain companies. For a little over a year now, BiTA has been organizing and performing important work with its standards committees: data formats, interoperability, finance, and technical compliance. There are also five BiTA think tanks investigating areas related to risk management, operations and asset utilization, driver marketplace, supply chain, and finance and business administration. About BiTA, Dale Chrystie says that “blockchain is a team sport,” and that BiTA members need to be the “parents in the room” and work collaboratively on how the many points of contact need to come together for the interests of the whole. The panel also addressed the blockchain news of the day, which is Walmart’s [NYSE: WMT] open letter to leafy green suppliers that starting January 31, 2019 they will need to get on the blockchain train and adopt IBM’s [NYSE: IBM] Food Trust blockchain. Generally speaking, it is seen as a positive development for the adoption and fundamental understanding of entering blockchain into the food supply’s mainstream. Certainly, there are big questions such as how does BiTA get the standards in place that affects the big carriers. No one knows yet who will be impacted and to what extent. All we currently have is the letter. We do have other questions, however, such as the proprietary nature of IBM’s blockchain and the pay-to-play aspect. Much like Apple [NYSE: AAPL] co-founder, Steve Wozniak has said in various iterations: “Access to a free internet should be an American principle,” we tend to think of the idea of blockchain’s “decentralization” as an open-source concept. In a sense it is, as Jordan Graft pointed out. Part of IBM’s blockchain is built in the open source Hyperledger Fabric network. Hyperledger Fabric is gaining momentum as the infrastructure for creating trust networks in a wide variety of industries. Dale Chrystie also used the illustration that is now referred to as the “mango pilot.” Last year, Frank Yiannas, Walmart’s VP of food safety, asked his team to trace a package of sliced mangoes back to their source. It took them six days, 18 hours, and 26 minutes. After Walmart used the software developed with IBM to track mangoes from a farm in Mexico to U.S. stores over a 30-day period, the same exercise took 2.2 seconds. Some food safety experts have criticized the application of blockchain in the food supply suggesting that the food is only as safe as the person entering the information. They argue that blockchain is perfect for completely digital assets, but the flaw is when you have a commodity. The panelists spoke briefly to these critiques suggesting that at the very least the reverse logistics of sourcing a bad product or bad player would at least be dramatically more efficient. The panel touched on an array of other topics from smart contracts and how they might be applied, to the idea of protecting your data when companies want to provide “solutions” for what you can do with it, to what kinds of companies actually need blockchain and who could do perfectly well with just a nice IoT solution. They also touched on how cryptocurrencies and the idea of how tokenization still gets in the way for people trying to understand and utilize enterprise applications. Dale Chrystie sees blockchain at about a 3-5 on a scale of 100 in terms of maturity. However, once the leaps start happening “you’ll see it at a 30 then a 70.” In other words, it’s hard to predict how the scalability of blockchain enterprise solutions will mature. Technology tends to grow exponentially. While some in the media seem to think that people are only joining alliances like BiTA due to FOMO (fear of missing out), it’s driven by a much more powerful reality, as difficult as it may be for some to grasp. Now, with Walmart’s most recent dictum, things are getting real (if they weren’t already). Dale Chrystie also offered another tangible illustration for how to assess the blockchain reality. He said, “I don’t know what’s going on inside my car when I’m getting from point A to B. I do know that I’m getting somewhere.” He went on to suggest that explaining how the internal combustion engine works would be hard to explain, but especially when it was in its infancy, no one was exactly sure how it might be used. So, whether or not blockchain becomes “a whole new internet” remains to be seen, but there seems little doubt the dam of applications is breaking. Those who were too cool for school really will miss out—they’re already missing out. In the Q\u0026A afterwards it seemed to all come back to the mango, however. People wanted to know why it took so long to trace that mango back in the first place.

They want to put customers in a position to take advantage of many choices new solutions in their technology architecture. There are many verticals in the markets they serve, and in few cases does a one-size-fits-all solution apply. With the explosion in tech over the past few years in the logistics and transportation industry, it’s increasingly urgent to provide real solutions with systems integration capabilities that let drivers, carriers, managers, and brokers tap into innovation and information. Our customers get to choose the best products in the market for their requirements, because of the open platform we have created. McLeod Software has actively expanded the capabilities and products from their Certified Integration Partners. They accomplish this by supplying and supporting third party partner solution integrations that are typically implemented using their Application Program Interface, or API, for LoadMaster and PowerBroker. In the past year alone, they have added 25 new off-the-shelf integration solutions with partners, including mobile communications, trailer tracking, payment processing systems, among other things. Currently McLeod has supported integration solutions for products and services from 121 different companies, with 9 more companies in the development process. All of these integration solutions work with the same, single platform offering. The McLeod APIs allow two-way access into the LoadMaster and PowerBroker systems and data, while utilizing the same data validations and business rules that are inherent within the systems. This makes building a stable, reliable, and sustainable integration system practical. Furthermore, with the McLeod API module, customers are able to create their own tactical applications using the full suite of available API services. This API capability set allows McLeod customers, with the right technical expertise, to safely and efficiently develop their own external applications for mobile devices, web sites, or their very own “secret sauce” applications that create unique and proprietary advantages for their company. At the same time, they remain free to take advantage of upgrades to their system without any penalty or loss of capability. McLeod customers have been using this API facility to accomplish just that for several years now. We see an increasing number of sophisticated integrations our customers have done on their own using our standard APIs. Technically speaking, the McLeod API is based on a web services approach to building interfaces. The API uses a Representational State Transfer (REST) model for accessing a set of resources through a fixed set of operations. McLeod also co-founded the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) with one goal in mind: to help the transportation industry work toward a set of standards that will make it easier and less costly for carriers and brokers to play the important role needed in shipper supply chains that will employ blockchain technology. We realized that without standards, the adoption of blockchain technology could lead to diverse integration requirements that would impose a huge cost and overhead burden on our customers, without necessarily adding a lot of value for any of the parties involved. BiTA has had a phenomenal first year. The alliance went from 7 initial members to over 470 current members and 2,800 applicants. It is now the largest blockchain consortium in the world. The diverse membership of BiTA portends well for its ability to address all aspects of this standards opportunity. • 35% of the members are asset based carriers (truck, rail, air, ocean, intermodal)\u2028 • 30% are non-asset based logistics and 3PL companies • 20% are technology providers, including other TMS providers, telematics providers, and other\u2028echnology products  • 5% are shippers \u2028/\u003e • 10% are in other categories, including banks, law firms, CPA’s or consultants, and other service \u2028poiders \u2028BiAis well down the road on organizing and performing the important work with its standards committees. These include Data Formats, Interoperability, Finance, \u0026 Technical Compliance. The Data Formats technology committee has formed two working groups, Location Component and Tracking Document Working Groups. The first will look at location data to determine what data points need to be included in a standard specification. The second will explore documents like BOL and POD in order to identify the key data points needed for a standard specification. There are also 5 BiTA study groups \u2028  Ken Craig says the mission to educate people about blockchain remains important. It’s a complex technology, and people are quick to label it as something that it really isn’t. Still others, by contrast, think it’s a solution when it’s not even necessary. There’s plenty of ways to use your data that doesn’t need to be immutable and encrypted, for instance. “It’s perfect for food traceability and pharmaceuticals,” he adds. Whether it’s working on open-source protocols for blockchain solutions, or developing programs for open integrating for software solutions up and down the supply chain, McLeod’s User Conference 2018 showcases some of the finest and most elegant tech solutions available today.

With regard to transportation, the argument put forth is about facing urban transit demands in overflowing cities, and in addressing carbon footprint milestones through zero-emission transport. But to get this to fruition, it is imperative to develop a transportation setup which involves better utilization of data, running machine learning models that could provide predictive analytics, and bridging stakeholders through a safe and immutable channel for data sharing. “A smart city is many things to many people. Yes, there are clearly instances of technology being able to help, but we have a situation where we need to see what the citizens feel would be useful, how we engage with them, and the impact of technology on them,” said Carl Rodrigues, head of partnerships at Streamr, a data exchange platform. Rodrigues spoke about the immensity of data being generated every minute across cities, and the endless possibilities of data analytics which could bolster transportation networks. “People often talk about physical and data infrastructure. The physical infrastructure of a city could be anything from traffic lights to road signs. What data infrastructure does is show where congestion is in the city and insights on what is happening in real time,” he said. “We can gather data about the state of roads – maybe cracks and potholes via sensors in cars and combine the broad data with some AI models to help do predictive maintenance judgments,” said Rodrigues. “We can look at particular cracks that are more prone to becoming bigger problems, and the ones that might develop into potholes.” Rodrigues created an analogy between oil and data. Like oil, data needs to be refined to make it useful and valuable – the absence of which would make it harder to derive insights. For a city, acquiring quality data is a struggle as it routinely procures data from telecom companies, which could give it an estimate on the movement of people inside a city – helping it to develop traffic models and subsequent town planning. Data could also be gathered by fitting sensors over street lights for instance, which could effectively monitor the number of people moving past specific locations, and even about how fast they move. “If you have street lights that would be able to identify a lot of people running very fast, you might be able to have analytics to understand the problem, say an accident,” said Rodrigues. However, data generation also needs to be looked at from an ethical standpoint, as it is critical to not meddle with personal freedom and the privacy of citizens. To stop a handful of companies from taking advantage of consumer data, Streamr has created a platform that would bring different businesses, people, and organizations together to share data and more importantly, get rewarded monetarily based on the value generated by the stakeholder. “We are more interested in a decentralized marketplace where you have peer to peer buying and selling with no middlemen. We don’t take any transaction fees in the marketplace, because we are trying to break this idea of particular companies gathering data and not sharing it with anyone else,” said Rodrigues. “This way, the city saves money, gets a better traffic model, and citizens get a better quality of life because there is less congestion in the city.” The need for data security led the company to look at blockchain, as the technology held everyone accountable and could handle data transparently. “With real-time data, it is important to deliver that data at scale, as you get it from thousands of different devices with only about 1% of IoT data being analyzed,” said Rodrigues. “Now is the stage where the city needs smart contracts to be involved. When you have two organizations coming into an agreement about data access, you would need to codify that into a smart contract that can enable automatic decisions and subscriptions to happen,” he said. “This is something we put in blockchain – contracts, subscriptions, ability to set subscription costs, length of the subscription, and the possibility of monetizing data. All this can be codified into smart contracts.” China is surging ahead in this race, with many of its cities running advanced IT systems and initiatives that help local city councils to improve town infrastructure and also mitigate energy wastage. Though data privacy concerns are significantly higher in the West, it is high time for countries to look at an easier way to share anonymized data, as weaponizing data analytics could be the best way to combat urban traffic of the future.

What’s also indisputable is that organizations are hesitant to adopt blockchain because of a lack of trust—in the technology, with potential collaborators, and in the evolving regulatory environment. What’s ironic is that blockchain, by its very definition, should engender trust because encryption and a single source of transaction truth, among other things, make blockchain essentially unhackable. In the latest BiTA webinar, we reviewed the state of blockchain with industry experts. Mitch Hixon, Executive Vice President of Membership Engagement, BiTA spoke with Rachel Parker Sealy, Partner, PwC Advisory and Kris Kersey, Director, PwC Advisory, providing insights from PwC’s 2018 Global Blockchain Survey of 600 executives from 15 territories. PwC analyzed 250+ technologies to find out which advancements are having the biggest business impact right now. The result? What PwC refers to as the essential 8: artificial intelligence, augmented reality, blockchain, drones, Internet of Things, robotics, virtual reality, and 3D printing. “What’s become really exciting as we start to explore blockchain and have its use case across industry sectors, it’s really the convergence of these technologies, and that’s exciting when you think of having blockchain in the toolkit.” As things stand, “nobody wants to be left behind,” PwC stated. In speaking to the “tremendous potential” of blockchain, Kersey noted that in 2030, blockchain could generate $3 trillion in business value. The results of the 2018 Global Blockchain Survey revealed that 84% of executives have at least some involvement–with 15% having a live project, pilot, or proof of concept. And that’s just the beginning. “Companies must confront blockchain’s trust paradox–a technology designed to foster trust is being held back by trust issues,” PwC found. “What is going to be the regulatory response to blockchain ecosystems being stood up” Kersey asked. While the trust in the technology itself is still building, the challenge of bringing counter parties to work together also arose in the results of the survey. “How do I engender the trust of the people sitting at the table even before we do anything?” “In the freight business, you serve almost every industry, so that presents somewhat of a challenge,” Sealy admitted. In analyzing the results of the survey, PwC developed four strategies for blockchain implementation in the transportation industry: Make the business case by committing to new ways of working, starting small, and scaling out. Build an ecosystem by focusing on a cooperative few, broadening your network, and working across the value chain. Design deliberately and determine the rules of engagement in confronting risks early, considering privacy applications, and investing in data and processes. Navigate regulatory uncertainty by watching and not waiting to shape the trusted tech decision, monitor evolving regulation, and using existing regulation as a guide. “It’s wise to be plugged into consortiums like the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) to understand what direction the ecosystem and the industry is moving towards as decisions are being made,” encouraging listeners to work regulators into the ecosystem and give them a place at the table. BiTA was formed by experienced tech and transportation executives to create a forum for the development of blockchain standards and education for the freight industry. Founded in August 2017, BiTA has quickly grown into the largest commercial blockchain alliance in the world, with more than 450 members that collectively generate over $1 trillion in revenue annually. BiTA members are primarily from the freight, transportation and logistics industries. Alliance members share a common mission to develop a standards framework, educate the market on blockchain applications and encourage the use of those applications. “Blockchain is rewiring commerce,” Sealy concluded. “Whether you lead or follow, start now.” For more information about BiTA, click here.

FreightWaves reported the August 1 announcement that Nestlé (NASDAQ: NSRGF) partnered with Dole Food Co., Driscoll’s, Golden State Foods, Kroger Co. (NASDAQ: KR), McCormick (NASDAQ: MKC), McLane Co., Tyson Foods (NASDAQ: TSN) and Unilever (NASDAQ: UL). Supported by IBM (NASDAQ: IBM), the companies belong to Food Trust, IBM’s “collaborative network of growers, processors, wholesalers, distributors, manufacturers, retailers and others enhancing visibility and accountability in each step of the food supply.” Thus far, Food Trust has helped to process 350,000 food data transactions, bringing traceback test timing from seven days to a remarkable 2.2 seconds. Now, according to an open letter from Walmart to its leafy green suppliers, the company will forge ahead in blockchain development as part of the Food Trust. Direct suppliers are required to conform to one-step back traceability on the blockchain network by Jan 31, 2019, and thereafter, suppliers are expected to work within their vertical systems or with their suppliers to enable end-to-end traceability back to farm by September 30, 2019. “Walmart believes the current one-step up and one-step back model of food traceability is outdated for the 21st century and that by, working together, we can do better,” the letter states, going on to say that “there is no question that there is a strong public-health and business-case for enhanced food traceability.” “By quickly tracing leafy greens back to source during an outbreak using recent advances in new and emerging technologies, impacts to human health can be minimized, health officials can conduct rapid and more thorough root cause analysis to inform future prevention efforts, and the implication and associated-losses of unaffected products that are inaccurately linked to an outbreak can be avoided,” the letter continues. “Using the IBM Food Trust network that relies on blockchain technology, we have shown that we can reduce the amount of time it takes to track a food item from a Walmart Store back to source in seconds,” the statement concludes. “Blockchain can and should be used to promote transparency around food safety,” said Natalie Dyenson, vice president of food safety and quality at Dole, a charter member of Food Trust. “I often describe that as food traceability at the speed of thought—as quickly as you can think it, we can know it,” said Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety for Walmart, as quoted by FreightWaves. Chris Burruss, president of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) notes the importance of the security of blockchain, nothing the technology’s ability to create transparency: “What do you have now? You have a centralized system, which are prone to data breaches. We’ve seen it time and again, if not daily, they’re a part of a normal occurrence. Blockchain seeks to create greater security. It’s not necessarily impossible, but it’s highly improbable [to break it]. It’s a shared copy of the truth as opposed to a centralized system, which is one version of the truth.” Today, when an outbreak or recall occurs, each participant must disclose their product’s path one step forward and one step back. Regulatory bodies and retailers must take that data and piece it together manually to determine the source of the issue. The process can take days or weeks. In some cases, the source may not be known. But blockchain’s traceability gives users the ability to pinpoint outbreaks before they, well, break out. “When it comes to safety, this is not a competitive issue,” Yiannas said. “We all win or lose together.” ","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, food safety, Food Trust, IBM, IBM blockchain, lettuce, outbreak, traceability, Walmart, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-09-25T16:22:51-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/r2-logistics-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/BiTANewMemberPressReleaseGraphic28229-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"R2 Logistics joins the Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"R2 Logistics, Inc., a customer-focused third-party logistics (3PL) service provider, is the latest member of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). New and improved technology continues to rapidly bring changes to the transportation and logistics marketplaces. In May 2017, Deloitte predicted that 10 percent of global GDP would be built on top of blockchain applications. For logistics and transportation, blockchain technology may have an even bigger impact, promising to revolutionize this $8 trillion global industry. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that provides consensus, provenance, finality and immutable business transactions and digital assets. These characteristics enable participants in a blockchain ecosystem to benefit from increased trust, greater transparency and reduced friction. Therefore, blockchain technology promises to transform the supply chain; it will help connect participants – and information – across the transportation transaction. Companies that were previously only competitors will have the opportunity to use this technology to communicate and share information without assuming security risks. BiTA, a neutral organization, provides the platform where all these discussions and inter-member cooperation can occur. R2 Logistics is exploring the innovative uses of blockchain technology within the supply chain. “At R2 we are constantly looking for ways to improve efficiency, add visibility and find ways to deliver value to our customers. We see a tremendous amount of potential in this technology to add transparency and eliminate waste from the supply chain. Our industry needs to develop standards to allow us to maximize the potential of this technology,” said Frank Dreischarf, R2 Logistics’ Vice President of Supply Chain Solutions. “R2 Logistics is a cutting-edge leader in logistics solutions that sees the true value in blockchain’s capabilities. We are proud to have them as a member of BITA,” said Chris Burruss, BiTA President. “Not only is R2 Logistics a leader in the industry, it has made the commitment to help the industry move blockchain forward. I commend R2 Logistics for recognizing the value that BiTA brings to it and the industry.”  About R2 Logistics, Inc.

Last year, the Port of Shanghai handled 40 million twenty-foot equivalent (TEU) of cargo, while the total value of import and export conducted by the ports of Shanghai and Guangdong ports was estimated to be around $1.532 trillion. ‘We will integrate business data from various partners, establishing a risk control model in cooperation with a single window to provide risk control services for regulatory authorities and enterprises,’ said Bruno Wu, Chairman and Co-CEO of Ideanomics in statement to the exchange. Ideanomics says that its Joint venture with APMEN will employ blockchain to extend connectivity to include the final buyers and sellers, rather than just from port to port, and custom to custom, bringing banks as financial institutions as lenders and customers under one roof as well as establishing and increasing asset-backed securitisation from the operation by securing high yield assets.

Beyond the common goal of complete denuclearization and a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, the agreement also promises economic cooperation and increased trade between the two countries. Since South Korea is effectively land-locked by the DMZ , access to new markets via road and rail through North Korea opens up all sorts of additional trade and tourism opportunities. For South Koreans in the logistics industry, connecting North and South Korean railways to form a freight corridor allows them to ship freight direct to markets as far away as Europe. China is particularly invested in the Moon-Kim peace agreement as South and North Korea are an integral part of what many consider to be China’s project of the century – the “One Belt, One Road” trade network initiative linking railroads and shipping lanes with 70 countries across Asia, Africa, Europe, and Oceania. The “Belt” part seeks to recreate the famous Silk Road trade route and the “Road” refers to ocean shipping lanes. This ambitious project has already begun operation with the first train completing a 12,000km/7,500 mile 18-day journey between London and Yiwu in China’s Zhejiang province in April this year. This historic Moon-Kim agreement also coincides with what’s known in the west as Korean Thanksgiving or Chuseok locally, translated as “Autumn Eve” which occurs on September 24th this year. Similar to the American Thanksgiving, Chuseok is a major harvest festival and three-day holiday where family members come together to give thanks. According to the Center for Global Education at Asia Society Korea’s annual thanksgiving holiday, “is one of the biggest migration events in modern Korea. Over half of the population of 52 million visits families and ancestral graves”, and with 83% the population living in urban areas and cities, massive traffic jams are a common occurrence on freeways throughout the country. For logistics companies it is also their business period of the year forcing them to increase staff levels by as much as 30% as residents send gifts to relatives all over the country. So busy in fact, Korea Post ships so much freight this time of year their normal distribution and cross-docking facilities are unable to cope with peak demand. This week in Seoul, postal delivery riders created curbside cross-docking operations taking thousands of parcels delivered by truck and stacking them into delivery routes on the sidewalk of Seoul’s busiest downtown streets. Lunchtime shoppers and workers passed by as if it’s a normal daily occurrence. Inner-city parcel deliveries in Seoul are mostly undertaken by motorbike and as drivers are out on their final-mile runs, the remaining parcels sit curbside safe but unattended until around 6pm when they’ve all been delivered. The Korea Herald reports CJ Logistics, Korea’s largest logistics company, “expects to see about 25 percent more parcel volume year-on-year during the Chuseok holiday according to a CJ Logistics official”. Along with Lotte Global Logistics, CJ Logistics recently joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) and is preparing to provide an innovative logistics solution by utilizing blockchain technologies. Joining BiTA will allow the company to cooperate on the development of standards for blockchain framework in Asia. In conjunction with BiTA’s Singapore-based team, BiTA was also in Seoul this week presenting at the Real Estate Blockchain Expo to discuss global blockchain standards in the warehousing, final mile and home delivery sectors of the global supply chain. The CJ Logistics operation includes 8,000 staff, 5,000 vehicles, 102 warehouses operating in 22 countries enabling the company to set a record delivering of 1.05 billion parcels in 2017. It was the first time any company in the parcel delivery industry delivered over 1 billion parcel boxes. CJ Logistics are also heavily invested in China’s “One Belt, One Road” mega-project having commenced their international “Iron Silk Road” intermodal transport service between Europe and Asia on May 2nd, 2018. According to CJ Logistics, “Utilizing Trans China Railway (TCR) to Europe will be 20% cheaper than air transport and will be three times faster than sea transport”. In addition to its current routes, “CJ Logistics plans to expand its rail freight network to 52 routes between China and Europe and 74 routes from Europe to China. Future plans also include sea transport with CJ Logistics’ plans to provide a new integrated multimodal transportation service connecting Eurasia, Indochina and India”, according to the company. CJ Logistics also state, “the rail freight transport market between Europe and China is showing an annual growth rate of 10 to 20%”. South Korea is an economic powerhouse and according to the World Shipping Council, nine of the world’s ten most busiest ports are in Asia with South Korea’s city of Busan ranking number five. This week’s events including the Moon-Kim denuclearization peace summit cannot be understated, especially with the possibility of the road and rail link being opened between north and south. The combination of the two countries makes for a Korean peninsula population of around 77 million people which is more than the populations of strong economies including France and the United Kingdom, placing it firmly in the top 10 world GDP rankings.

And is blockchain the right technology to achieve such vision? We all know blockchain technology’s still at its very nascent stage and mainstream adoption are still miles away, what do you see as the key challenges? For the transportation/ supply industry, some observations were that blockchain will optimize a paper intensive slow error/fraud-prone current process. The adaption will take a while and we may very well see initial developments in the trucking industry emerge before we see full international logistics solutions. The major challenges are mindset in an ancient well-founded maritime industry, differences in customs regulations in the various countries, and a lack of standards on which to base solutions in the blockchain space.

ABP, which owns 21 ports in England and Scotland, signed a memorandum of understanding with digital logistics enabler Marine Transport International (MTI) for the project. ABP says the project is “one of Europe’s first” to examine blockchain use cases to improve port connectivity. ABP’s head of communications Andrew Dunn says the group has been working for a while on how to deploy blockchain at its marine terminals. ABP’s ports handles 1.4 million containers annually, along with vehicles and other cargo. “In the maritime industry, the supply chain is global and very extensive,” Dunn said. “What we are investigating is what blockchain can do for the speed at which that chain operates,” Dunn said. He declined to say what specific use cases or services that ABP and MTI hope to automate through blockchain. But he says the source of goods coming through ABP’s ports will be one area that the MTI blockchain solution hopes to smooth. “The provenance of cargo is of increasing importance,” Dunn said. “Hopefully, blockchain can improve the speed and efficacy of our operations.” In a statement, ABP says the disparate information systems used by shippers and haulers “do not all talk to each other efficiently.” With a distributed ledger built with MTI’s technology, ABP wants “to securely link these disparate ways of working and could bridge the silos to reduce time spent on manually re-entering data, ensuring a single version of the truth. MTI, a member of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance, says it plans to make interoperability with existing information systems a key part of the pilot program.

But its value as a technology investment remains unclear with enterprises in a “trough of disillusionment” according to one blockchain expert. A survey done by consulting firm Greenwich Associates shows that annual spending by financial services firms on blockchain rose 70% this year to $1.7 billion. “The technology is demonstrating value and gaining traction,” said Greenwich Associates vice president Richard Johnson, who presented the results at a blockchain conference sponsored by the CFA Society of New York. But the spending levels vary widely. Most firms are spending less $500,000 on blockchain, but about 11% of the survey’s respondents were spending $10 million or more.  Blockchain, which is the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, is being mostly taken up by the financial services industry, thanks to its promise of greater efficiency and reducing operating costs. Johnson says blockchain, which is in effect a distributed ledger, “reduces errors and streamlines operations because everyone is looking at the same numbers.” Likewise, blockchain promises to ease other financial services such syndicating banks loans, which Johnson says still uses fax machines. In additional to global payments, trade finance tied for first place in potential blockchain uses, Johnson says. He cites the work of Maersk (Nasdaq OMX: MAERB) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) on the Tradelens blockchain platform, which aims to make container shipping more efficient, as one example of a blockchain’s use in easing trade. “There’s a lot of complexity in facilitating global trade flows,’ Johnson said. “A manufacturer in one country may get a purchase order, then take that order to a bank to get a loan until the order is shipped. A lot of this document tracking can be done through blockchain.” The increasing spending coincides with greater realization over the difficulties of using blockchain for many enterprises. Johnson says 57% of survey respondents found it more difficult than they originally thought to use blockchain in their business. Despite the challenges, At least two-thirds of the survey respondents expect blockchain to deliver “meaningful change” in one area of their business within two years with nearly all seeing change coming in five years. As with other technologies, blockchain “starts off slowly, ramps up with tons of press, then you come to the trough of disillusionment where things don’t move as quickly as possible,” Johnson said. “But after that usually comes a plateau where everything starts to click.” Among business implementations of blockchain, JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM) is using the blockchain platform that underlies the Ethereum cryptocurrency. Johnson says Ethereum stands apart for its “smart contracts” feature which allows for greater automation than available in other blockchain platforms. “Ethereum has one foot in the private enterprise space and one in the public network space,” Johnson said. “That can offer advantages when developing applications.” Christine Moy, executive director of JP Morgan’s blockchain platform, says the problem facing many banks is that most blockchains, such as Bitcoin’s, were built to have all data shared among the users.  Public blockchains “don’t have the data privacy needed for banking transactions,” Moy said. “JP Morgan sought to solve the problem by taking the Ethereum blockchain and segregating our private data.” In addition to blockchain’s use in back-office administration, cryptocurrencies are gaining more attention from businesses. Todd McDonald, a co-founder of enterprise blockchain firm R3, says cryptocurrencies offer “a new way for companies to raise money.” He cites the example of online retailer Overstock’s (Nasdaq: OSTK) launch of coin offering, tZero, which raised money to develop a cryptocurrency trading exchange. Online storage company Filecoin also raised $25 million through offering a coin that it will use for payment of online storage services.” “This is peer-to-peer capital formation,” McDonald said. “The distinction between public and private markets goes away.”","TAGS":"Blockchain, IBM, Maersk, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-09-20T01:03:17-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/able-freight-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/BiTANewMemberPressReleaseGraphic-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Able Freight joins the Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Able Freight Services, a leading global cold chain logistics provider with 25 years in business, today announced it has joined the Blockchain in Transportation Alliance (BiTA), an organization dedicated to determining best practices and standards for blockchain in the transportation industry.

Blockchain’s ability to transparently record complicated transactions, track goods, and reduce fraud makes it desirable for industry-wide adoption. Initial coin offerings (ICOs) allow companies to transform the ownership of assets or other rights into blockchain-enabled digital, tradable tokens. These are frequently sold upfront to finance investments. ICOs, however, have their share of drawbacks. One of the big ones is the issue of regulation. For instance, companies located in countries subject to international sanctions can use ICOs to work around restrictions and tap into international funding. This does not make regulators happy. Yet creating and operating systems that recognize both tokens and conventional currencies in order to settle trades will be expensive and complex. Also, ICOs still need to prove they are a cheaper and better choice than other funding options for large industrial-scale commodity projects. The relationship between regulators and ICOs is—not surprisingly—tense. On the one hand, the very spirit of ICOs is anti-regulation, separate from asset-based securities and commodities, an independent valuation that has nothing to do with traditional, centralized currencies (at least in its incipient form). On the other hand, many see regulation as not only inevitable, but desirable. Regulation will give recognition and, among other things, credibility. This past Tuesday, a New York federal judge addressed the issue. The ruling from U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie in Brooklyn allows federal prosecutors to pursue their case against Maksim Zaslavskiy. The Brooklyn resident was arrested in November on charges that he defrauded investors in two cryptocurrencies, violating the federal Securities Exchange Act. Prosecutors said that Zaslavskiy last year raised at least $300,000 from investors in a cryptocurrency called REcoin, which he claimed was backed by real estate, and another called Diamond, which he claimed was backed by diamonds. No real estate or diamonds was backed by the virtual currencies, according to the prosecution. In March, Zaslavskiy’s lawyers asked Dearie to dismiss the charges, arguing that REcoin and Diamond were currencies, not securities, and therefore not covered by the Securities Exchange Act. That argument was rejected by Dearie who said there is more flexibility in regulatory interpretation. Therefore, U.S. securities laws can be applied to fraud cases involving cryptocurrency offerings. Thus, we may have seen one of the most important legal decisions in the short life of cryptocurrencies. “That is a first,” says Ian King, senior analyst for Banyan Hill Research. King uncovers companies ripe for innovation in this sector and investigates new uses for blockchain technology. “In this particular case, the judge ruled that cryptocurrency ICOs should be regulated as securities. For this ICO, the defendant claimed that the cryptocurrency offering was backed by real estate and diamonds. In other words, you were buying something that represented ownership in a real world asset,” King writes to FreightWaves. Cryptocurrencies can be separated into two classes: utility tokens and securities tokens. The latter comprises issuances such as the one in the court case, a token that represents something else of value. Utility tokens, on the other hand, can be redeemed for something of digital value. There are cryptocurrencies that represent cloud storage or network bandwidth. The SEC head Jay Clayton has likened them to tokens at a laundromat. The result of the ruling now incorporates the Howey test. The Howey test is what regulators have used to determine whether or not something is a security. These questions boil down to two points: 1. Does the token have value primarily as an investment or as a useful item? 2. Is there a single issuer backing up that value or is the value resulting from a network of unaffiliated participants in an industry and market? “In this case, it is clear that cryptocurrency was issued as a security, but the jury is still out on the utility token asset class,” writes King. Regulation of virtual currencies is still in its early stages, and Congress has not passed any laws addressing it directly. In March, another federal judge in Brooklyn ruled that cryptocurrencies could be regulated as commodities by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Getting participants to join the supply chain is “the number one challenge by far,” says Piscini. “We’ve created the platform to incentivize players across the industry.” “We’ve designed it to be completely open. You have technology providers who want to come onto the platform such as IoT companies and we say, ‘Sure, come on board.’ From onboarding to placing orders to using services. We have a very unique approach,” he adds. With today’s businesses often working with myriad partners on a global scale, the challenges presented by supply chain management are increasingly vast. Whether locating a Chinese supplier, or finding a carrier to haul products from LA to Toronto, these challenges are amplified by the lack of one global governing body or a set of standards to ensure end-to-end visibility. SUKU’s unique “supply chain-as-a-service” concept expects to eradicate the three primary obstacles in supply-chain by providing visibility of products, access to capital and innovation, and engagement between stakeholders. In order to bring greater visibility to the supply chain, SUKU aims to display the precise location and status of goods in real-time, which is essential in ensuring that all parties can act proactively, instead of reactively when an issue arises. The platform anticipates to provide companies with access to new marketplaces and technologies, and better connect suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. “We’ve created the platform to incentivize players across the industry.” From farming, to pharmaceuticals, to electrical goods, the SUKU platform anticipates the use of two blockchains, Ethereum and Quorum, to maximize the benefits of both networks. The public Ethereum blockchain, used extensively for smart contract deployments, is expected to handle supply chain payments. The permissioned Quorum blockchain aims to facilitate transactions such as bids and offers, where confidentiality is critical. SUKU’s native token is necessary to incentivize and reward partners of the platform. The platform’s built-in transparency and auditability also project to empower more socially-responsible practices amongst trading partners by providing greater awareness about the provenance and origin of goods, as well as the values of the organizations they work with. “We want a blockchain that supports everything that we want to do. We’ve created a bridge between the two blockchains. We need the public for better records, but we also need the efficiency of the Quorum. It’s a solution we’ve created. We’re working on that today,” says Piscini. “The technology market for blockchain is moving very fast. There’s new applications made every week. We’ve left it open to make adjustments in the future if there are better solutions in the future.” The platform didn’t necessarily think of every single application for version 1.0. It will, for instance, be better prepared for issues like returns and reverse logistics in the supply chain as more players participate and the network itself improves. For now, its focus is on being a B2B marketplace with track and trace capability. “Every time the blockchain network is used the players are rewarded, and the network improves,” says Piscini. The company has raised enough in early stage funding to employ 45 people to date, but as far as the SUKU token goes, it doesn’t yet exist. The company plans on release by the end of the year or early next. “We don’t want to release the token too quickly, because we want to make sure we have something valuable first. Also, there are some regulatory limitations we’re dealing with before we can release. It’s something that’s very important to us. There are a lot of bad actors in the space, and we know who they are, and they may not be going away, so we want to be the highest quality program we can be before moving in that direction, doing the right thing from the very beginning so that we can be around ten years from now. We’re a long-term play here and not a short term,” says Piscini.

The Swiss freight forwarding giant says “blockchain technology” has been applied to its verified gross mass (VGM) portal. The move “allows for using native blockchain interfaces for data exchange with third parties, removing the need for additional off-chain communication channels,” the company said. Kuehne + Nagel says it is recording 800,000 transactions through its blockchain-enabled VGM portal. The International Maritime Organisation, the main regulatory body for shipping, introduced VGM just over two years ago. The rule requires that the weight of loaded containers must be verified before being placed on a ship. It was put into effect after several marine accidents were believed to have stemmed from mislabeled container weights and cargo shifting during voyages. In 2013, the Mitsui O.S.K. Lines-owned MOL Comfort suffered a crack that eventually led to a fire and the ship’s sinking, along with the loss of over 4,000 containers. Container weights were said to have been a factor in the casualty.  Blockchain’s use in the maritime supply chain is an area of growing interest and hype. Maersk and IBM made a splash this summer by unveiling TradeLens, a blockchain initiative to reduce the many paper-based transactions involved in container shipping. France’s CMA CGM and Korea’s Hyundai Merchant Marine have also tested blockchain’s use in container shipping. But actual usage of blockchain is still rare as ocean shipping tries to find applications for its use, says Martin Kolbe, chief Information Officer for Kuehne + Nagel, “The list of promises related to the use of blockchain in the logistics industry is long, but actual real-world applications are hard to find,” Kolbe said. He says the blockchain-enabled VGM portal “allows us to get a true hands-on experience with blockchain technology in an on-premise production environment and with a high number of transactions.” The VGM rule might be a perfect testbed for blockchain. Indeed, the introduction of VGM was fraught with challenges for how to accurately transmit data between the various parties that can touch an ocean container. As originally written, the IMO says the shipper can tell the ocean carrier directly a container’s weight or the shipper can tell the marine terminal, which then has to transmit the verified weight to the ship in port. The shipper can either weigh the loaded container or add the weight of items in the container to the container’s weight. But many shippers complained about the difficulty of weighing containers and the logistical challenge of transmitting those weights to ocean carriers. Many shippers complained about the fees ranging from $15 to $25 per container that freight forwarders charged for implementing VGM rules. Cargo owners were also concerned that marine terminals would charge yet another fee for certifying the VGM. In June 2016, the Federal Maritime Commission says certifying the VGM should be the responsibility of the terminal operator, who them sends data to the shipping line.","TAGS":"Kuehne + Nagel, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Maritime, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-09-10T19:35:08-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/fr8-network-reverse-logistics","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shutterstock_550518862-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Fr8 Network: blockchain’s powerful potential for reverse logistics","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The push-pull of technological innovations in transport and communications is nothing new. It’s all a matter of how the technology is adapted and brought into the current marketplace’s way of doing business. The pull of trade generates a push in both markets to invest in the newest transportation developments. This results in what transportation economists call the “double-stimulus” of trade. The growth of the freight industry in the 19th century is such an example. As railway lines extended into undeveloped locations, farming opportunities emerged that were previously uneconomic. This encouraged trade and settlement that made demand for the railways self-perpetuating. Sometimes, too, you have to move backward in order to move ahead. What’s fascinating about product life-cycles is that innovations first must go through an introductory stage before reaching a tipping point. The tipping point perpetuates the newly established technology (whether it’s a product or a system or both), and then emerges a growth period before maturity establishes, and then, inevitably a decline. Over the past two centuries, these cycles tend to run in about 35 year lifetimes. One current example that fits this exact timeline is the case of 3D printing. We’ve had the technology for “just in time” manufacturing for the past 30 years, but up until the past couple of years it’s been used almost exclusively for prototyping. Now, with breakthroughs in industrial grade applications, we’re suddenly able to apply the making of goods to—well, just about anything. Now, the challenge is to educate and implement. The technology, in other words, has hit a tipping point and the only lag now is understanding how to design and utilize what we don’t even know we’re capable of. Similarly, trucking is in the midst of a digital transformation, with revolutionary changes from all ends of the logistical supply chain. And with such a transformation comes the need for real-time data so freight efficiency across a range of metrics can be maximized. Nowhere is the potential more evident—and challenging—than through the application of blockchain technology across the fragmented supply chain. As Fr8 Network writes in their white paper, “Coordinating logistics is the art of managing critical and valuable cargo at an incredibly fast pace through dozens of antiquated communication systems, all while pushing and pulling data with shippers, receivers, distribution centers, rail, truck, and air carriers, insurance companies, financiers, and government agencies. The complexity is more intense than a nonindustry participant would imagine. It is the premise of Fr8 Network that each leg of the journey and every stakeholder could benefit from the transparency and efficiency the Fr8 Protocol can offer.” One of the more powerful, if unheralded, potentials of this transparency and efficiency is through what consumers think of as returns, and industry participants refer to as reverse logistics. We tend to hear about reverse logistics the most during the month of January when all of those e-commerce Christmas purchases that looked so good in November and December are returned. Reverse logistics is a year-round challenge, however, and it often takes shape in the form of damage control. The costs of reverse logistics are estimated to be in the range of $750 billion per year, and the demand for reverse logistics has risen in recent years with the rise of e-commerce. According to Stacy Rudolph of Business to Community, up to 30% of all products ordered online become returns, placing an enormous burden on reverse logistics. Using a reverse logistics blockchain strategy can help alleviate costs, increase efficiency, and also document responsibility. Take food as an example. According to Bloomberg, three problems in the food value chain that blockchain could help solve are: (1) traceability and food safety, (2) price discovery, and (3) food waste reduction. Because of its ability to improve traceability, blockchain lends itself to improving food safety both from a preventive standpoint as well as drastically reducing reaction time in the case of a recall. Using blockchain, digital ledger tech locking in shipment data, that process could be improved upon from days to mere seconds. Data captured, stored, transferred, and accounted for at each point in the supply path in real-time. Track items or transactions using a shared digital ledger significantly more efficient than any current method for logging and sharing information. Blockchain is also a big selling point for the global food industry to identify food fraud by identifying fraudulent ingredients and to trace the source of contamination during product recalls, such as the mysterious case of this year’s very bad, no good romaine lettuce. Speaking of fraud, startup Bonafi is working on a solution on a global trade problem worth nearly half a trillion dollars a year. It comes in the form of brand counterfeiting. The U.S. is hit the hardest for the simple reason that it is the largest of all consumer markets, and also the richest in intellectual property. Whether it’s pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, electronics, auto parts, hygiene and cosmetics, even fashion goods and toys, virtually any commodity is at risk. Pharmaceuticals alone account for an estimated $200 billion in illegally copied goods. It could be a health or safety-related scam, or it could just be consumers thinking they have purchased an authentic brand name product like Nike, Coach, Gucci, etc. and have no way of checking if the product is genuine or a fake. “The issue with counterfeited goods is that people find out after the fact,” Steve Kuh, founder and CEO says. Kuh notes that a lot of small companies could use blockchain as a solution, especially companies that use IP and hold the patent. “They produce a product and yet they have this influx of product coming from overseas. The counterfeiters make it so close to the real thing, and it’s really hard to tell until you possess the item. There’s lots of industrial applications for this as well in terms of recall of parts. It’s really good with damages.” Yet another major example is for industrial recall. Think product defects. How much time and money could Toyota, for instance, have saved had they been able to pinpoint the person, part and/or location of the supply chain when they suffered their accelerator scandal? Between 2009 and 2011 there were numerous recalls due to floor mats causing pedal entrapment, and the accelerator sticking and overriding the anti-lock software. Had blockchain been in place, the company might have been able to swiftly monitor supply quality and identify the partners who were most responsible for the defects. The ledger of blockchain allows records to update in real-time for all members of the supply chain, and that includes the relationships between engineering, procurement, and suppliers. Sometimes you have to reverse engineer in order to move forward. It’s not about evolution right now, it’s about revolution backwards and forwards.

It comes in the form of brand counterfeiting. It’s a gigantic black market, and originates most often from China—about 85% according to the OECD, an organization for the promotion of economic and social well-being of people around the world. The U.S. is hit the hardest for the simple reason that it is the largest of all consumer markets, and also the richest in intellectual property. Whether it’s pharmaceuticals, food and beverages, electronics, auto parts, hygiene and cosmetics, even fashion goods and toys, virtually any commodity is at risk.

It could be a health or safety-related scam, or it could just be consumers thinking they have purchased an authentic brand name product like Nike, Coach, Gucci, etc. and have no way of checking if the product is genuine or a fake. Is there a way to protect consumers in this multi-billion dollar market? Steve Kuh, founder and CEO of upstart Bonafi, has a solution. Bonafi has created a way to protect consumers by using blockchain. “The issue with counterfeited goods is that people find out after the fact,” Kuh tells FreightWaves. “Especially with Amazon. Turns out they don’t have the responsibility so anything is good there. There can be fire hazards, and safety. You name it.” “A lot of small companies could use this too, especially companies that use IP and hold the patent,” Kuh explains. “They produce a product and yet they have this influx of product coming from overseas. The counterfeiters make it so close to the real thing, and it’s really hard to tell until you possess the item. There’s lots of industrial applications for this as well in terms of recall of parts. It’s really good with damages.” Bonafi (think bonafide) is a young Blockchain company based in Los Angeles that began at the top of 2018. They are dedicated to solving the problem of counterfeit products plaguing the global economy. By integrating the CryptoTag technology and mobile application with blockchain technology, they empower brands, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and ultimately consumers to fight against counterfeit products. Bonafi’s team so far is comprised of nine members, and on average they have 18 years of experience in the industry. Their profiles can be found on LinkedIn, and it’s impressive indeed. The team is not a gaggle of tech-heads who think they have all answers and that it’ll be fun to do something with blockchain. They’re a highly-skilled team with what appears to be the right expertise. It begins with a token, but it doesn’t end there. “Bona tokens are our vehicle to raise funds and run the platform,” says Kuh. “It’s one of the ways we raise funds. Fundraising begins next week and it runs for a year. The way the token works, during the ICO, we are selling the ICO to raise funds. They call it the SEC 506c. It’s one of the regulatory ways that we’re allowed to raise funds, exempted securities. We’re minting the coin and getting it ready. It’s a part of the authentication process.” How does it work? Manufacturers insert the tag to whatever the product may be. When consumers get it, they use the phone app to scan it. The consumer scans the app with a Bona token. They can either buy the token, or receive it as a reward from the manufacturer. Customers of Bonafi could get rewards through product registration, customer reviews, their buying patterns, and other means. This increases engagement between customer and manufacturer. Manufacturers, for their part, will be naturally motivated to supply necessary authentication. Bonafi’s patented CryptoTag is a piece of hardware, an encrypted tag that will be attached to each item. A physical RF (radio frequency) tag that is placed into product. It then can record the data through the tags that are encrypted through the blockchain all along the supply chain from manufacturer to distributor to wholesaler to retailer to customer. The CryptoTag is protected against duplication through a public cryptography algorithm and renders copying impractical. There are no QR codes, bar codes, or regular NFC tags, such as some of the larger players in the space currently use. Their biggest competitor is probably VeChain, which is valued at $762 million. WaBi, valued at $6.7, is another. BlockVerify is another startup in the space. “With the CryptoTag every single tag is uniquely coded,” says Kuh. Also, Bonafi plans to build an online version of the physical CryptoTag, and you can get a lot of that supply chain information ahead of time. For more detailed information about Bonafi than can be provided in an article, here’s a link to their whitepaper.

The maritime freight industry still uses paper bills of lading that take up to ten days to transfer ownership of cargo and settle payments—the equivalent of 400,000 trees worth of paper every year. Using blockchain to accelerate the transfer of asset ownership makes perfect sense, because the very first blockchain, bitcoin, was designed to do just that: keep track of assets, solve the double-spend problem, and enable censorship-resistant transactions. CargoX’s shipment had four parties on its smart contract BoL: the Chinese exporter, the maritime carrier/logistics provider, the consignee in Slovenia, and the release agent. The CargoX ERC20 utility token (ticker: CXO) was used to power the computations on the Ethereum network. Although CXO is traded on secondary exchanges and has basically tracked the fluctuations of the larger crypto market—making it potentially undesirable as a medium of exchange for maritime shipping—the CargoX platform allows the use of fiat currencies as payments while relying on CXO to power computation. Ethereum’s scaling problems have been much-discussed in blockchain media. Two major solutions have emerged: Casper, a scheme to move the network from the expensive, computing-intensive Proof-of-Work consensus algorithms to Proof-of-Stake, and Plasma, Ethereum’s sharding solution that divides the blockchain into sidechains in order to reduce the number of nodes required for consensus. Notably, Casper has been recently delayed by 12 months. What’s fascinating about CargoX’s smart contract BoL is that the team does not have to wait for Ethereum to dramatically increase its network throughput in order to reach scale. Bills-of-lading are actually some of the lowest hanging fruit for blockchain use cases in transportation and logistics. Unlike Visa transactions, which are extremely fast and extremely high volume, paper-based bills-of-lading take up to ten days to transfer back and forth between the NVOCC, exporter, and consignee, and transaction volumes are in the hundreds per hour rather than millions per hour. FreightWaves spoke to Stefan Kukman, the CEO of CargoX, by phone. “What we wanted to do with the shipment is gather user feedback,” Kukman said, “because we’re developing a platform for other people—their voice and opinions are really important. In China I was sitting with the exporter, and the first thing he said was ‘why don’t you have this in Chinese?’ I had assumed they spoke English, and they did, but they made the point that if they wanted to transfer the bill of lading to a local 3PL, they could find a cheaper solution if it was in Chinese.” The biggest surprise for CargoX, Kukman said, were the implications for the importer’s liquidity. The importer realized that it could have held onto its final payment for the shipment for another ten days without incurring any demurrage fees, because the transaction, once started, executed so quickly. “On January 24, we raised 7,000 Ethereum in our ICO in seven minutes and forty seconds, and ever since then, we’ve been ahead of schedule,” Kukman said. CargoX plans to take its platform live toward the end of this month, said Kukman, and so far, unlike many transport blockchain startups, the team is delivering ahead of the timeline outlined in its white paper. “I would be happy 100-300 bills of lading per day by the end of this year,” said Kukman. “And considering the partners we’re signing with, that shouldn’t be hard.” We also talked about the network capacity required by CargoX’s smart contract BoLs. “We don’t need something really fast like Ripple,” explained Kukman. “In our business, the standard is 2-10 days, so if we do it four minutes, or even an hour, we’re doing great.” The next step for CargoX, after opening its platform to the public, is putting Letters of Credit on a smart contract. Letters of Credit are commitments issued by banks to exporters at the request of the importer that payment be made.

Since the boom of ecommerce, delivery times have gotten tighter, with options like next-day and same-day delivery an anticipated reality – a situation unforeseeable a decade back. “Last-mile delivery has gotten a lot more digitalized now. When there is a promise of same-day delivery, the interaction between different parties – from the ecommerce side that receives the customer order to the goods provider to the warehouse and finally the last-mile delivery driver – there are many parties involved and these events are distributed in real time,” said Ricardo Gomez-Ulmke, VP of IoT at Solace. The incredibly short delivery spans mean that businesses cannot afford to process products in batches anymore, thus leading to the need for visibility and traceability in the supply chain. “We need to tightly monitor the entire chain to enable fast delivery times. In particular when something goes astray, maybe when there is heavy traffic, you would want to involve the customer and tell them that the delivery is going to be at the door in 20 minutes, so there is no waiting time associated,” said Gomez-Ulmke. Solace is now working with Daimler on a connected cars project, that would potentially let the latter to monitor the location of their cars real-time. What makes this interesting is that such a system would require an event fabric that is globally distributed, as Daimler sells its vehicles across Europe, North America, and Asia. “Coming back to the parcel delivery, you can use this feature to send remote commands to each individual cars if you wish – simple commands like “open door” or “open trunk.” So through a mobile application, if you have the access rights, you can open the trunk of a Mercedes,” said Gomez-Ulmke. “Tying that to delivery, this means that if you order something on Amazon, and you won’t be home to receive it, the parcel can be delivered to the trunk of your car.” This could be a breakthrough in parcel delivery, as consumers are not necessitated to be present to receive products. Nonetheless, this seemingly easy solution has a lot to balance – tracking the location of the car and the driver in real-time, understanding where both are with relation to each other, and giving access to commands of opening up the trunk at a specific time – a federation of events that need to run tight. Gomez-Ulmke contended that it is crucial for different stakeholders in the ecosystem to work together, as a single party can not moderate the supply chain. “What they have to do is work very closely together via APIs, which need to be real-time in order to facilitate these new business processes,” he said. And to create visibility, IoT could come in handy. The devices could be stuck to containers, and the product journey from the warehouse to the customer’s door can be monitored real-time. “With a lot of our customers and partners, it is not just about where the package is at any point in time, but also about monitoring the quality of the supply chain,” said Gomez-Ulmke. “Let us take the example of goods that require certain conditions during transport – be it medicines, chemicals, food or even food ingredients. We would need to know not just its location, but also the temperature, light exposure, and humidity. So if a medicine has a requirement to be between 10 to 12 degrees (celsius), then we have to monitor the temperature at every point in the supply chain.” This helps with precise monitoring and in identifying who the custodian is at focal points along the supply chain. Full quality monitoring would allow businesses to be cognizant of issues with shipment damage, even before the product delivery is due. For instance, if a food processing factory needs 10 ingredients to create an end product, and if it can deduce from monitoring its supply chain that one of the ingredients’ crate was spoilt due to an overt exposure to sunlight, it can start looking for an alternate supplier before the spoilt ingredient is received at its location. This would lead to a more seamless and optimized supply chain, with real-time data across different networks allowing businesses to be well prepared for logistics adversities. Gomez-Ulmke spoke about how the farm-to-fork concept is now increasingly relevant, and that blockchain could be the answer to unifying data and maintaining a neutral stronghold over it. “When we talk with our partners about creating a system that is encompassing all the other partners that we have, they always say that they don’t work with one customer, but with hundreds of them,” he said. “In the end, people say that they need to integrate with a hundred of my customer systems, but I also am a customer to many different suppliers, making integration a huge task. What we need is a neutral party, potentially based on blockchain where everybody can integrate – so that the integration point is easier.” ","TAGS":"Digitization, global supply chains, IoT, Last mile, Last mile delivery, logistics, Solace, Supply chain, Supply chain disruption, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Warehouse, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-08-31T15:27:31-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/the-business-of-blockchain-with-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Blockchain_Article_Image-1.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The business of blockchain with BiTA","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"On August 27, PricewaterhouseCoopers released the results of their 2018 Global Blockchain Survey, and their message is loud and clear: “Blockchain is here. What’s your next move?” According to PwC, 84% of respondents are actively involved in blockchain. As things stand, “nobody wants to be left behind,” PwC states. The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) could be the industry’s answer to the ever-pressing question of standardization—after all, 45% of the survey’s respondents believe that the issue of trust could delay blockchain. BiTA was formed by experienced tech and transportation executives to create a forum for the development of blockchain standards and education for the freight industry. Founded in August 2017, BiTA has quickly grown into the largest commercial blockchain alliance in the world, with more than 450 members that collectively generate over $1 trillion in revenue annually. BiTA members are primarily from the freight, transportation and logistics industries. Alliance members share a common mission to develop a standards framework, educate the market on blockchain applications and encourage the use of those applications. FreightWaves spoke with Chris Burruss, President of BiTA, as well as Mitch Hixon, BiTA’s EVP of Membership Engagement about where BiTA’s been and where it’s headed. “I joined BiTA on May 1, 2018 with a goal and objective of assembling the collective community membership towards engagement activities which would yield positive outcomes More specifically, the opportunity was to attract expertise to discuss, breakdown, and move forward with outcomes which would attack the many pain points across the supply chain,” Hixon explained. From this came the construction of five think tank working groups: Risk Management, Operations/Asset Utilization, Driver Marketplace, Finance \u0026 Business Administration, and Supply Chain. Hixon said, “when the call went out for membership participation, membership overwhelmingly answered the call to volunteer their time and expertise.” Today BiTA has over 120 active participants who make up the who’s who of thought leadership within the supply chain ecosystem. The cadence for group calls is every thirty days, and there is also a leadership chair call that occurs once a month. Leadership calls focus on sharing best practices and the sharing of ideas for effective progress. “The amount of ground covered since the first introductory call for each group is to be commended,” Hixon noted. This fall marks the launch of the BiTA Acceleration Program (BAP). “BAP represents the formalizing of a program that we’ve successfully deployed on a number of occasions—it simply utilizes the expertise, and resources of BiTA staff members for the advancement of our members companies,” said Hixon. “This can come in the form of formal consulting arrangements, or less formal expertise or advice. We can also provide introductions to other member companies where there is an identified opportunity to benchmark, or a strategic and/or business opportunity. Where mutually determined, commercial outcomes will result from these discussions and interactions.” Burruss was quick to point out that time is always of the essence—particularly with blockchain standards. “This means that we have to make the best use of your time while ensuring any specifications we intend to publish are sound and fully vetted,” Burruss stated. In December, the initial board of the BiTA Standards Council (BSC) was formed to begin the buildout of the new organization. “This involved defining who we are and defining our purpose as well as developing bylaws, membership agreement and our Intellectual Property Rights Policy (IPR),” said Burruss. In April, the board officially assumed control of BSC and began working on the formation of the technical committees and working groups. Since that time, three technical committees have been formed: Data Formats, Interoperability and Finance \u0026 Compliance. All of these committees are meeting twice per month to discuss the formation of working groups and provide direction to them. The technical committees will be announcing open calls for participation in several working groups within the next two weeks. BiTA intends to publish specifications by the end of the calendar year, if not sooner. “To do this, we will need to be running on all cylinders. I am confident that with the quality of BiTA’s members, we’ll be successful.” “Being a member of BiTA is exciting enough, but the real reward is in being a member of a team whose ideas and potential outcomes might transform an industry,” Hixon concluded. Make plans to attend the BiTA Fall Symposium being held Nov. 14th at the Gaylord Texan Resort \u0026 Convention Center immediately following MarketWaves18 presented at this same venue Nov. 12-13th. The focus of the agenda for BiTA Symposium is to deliver “Updates \u0026 Outcomes” to membership. Each of the 3 Technical Standards committees \u0026 working groups will provide updates, along with all of the chairs from each of the 5 think tank groups. Related outcomes will be presented along with presentations on some very interesting use cases. You’ll also hear from some member companies who are deploying blockchain solutions, and from BiTA associates on a menu of offerings adding value to the BiTA Community.

From a logistics perspective, fragmentation makes it hard for the industry to drive efficiency – an issue that LaneAxis, a company based out of California is looking to address through blockchain. “We are providing an automated system on blockchain that allows a shipper to connect directly to a carrier down to the driver level through our mobile application, eliminating the need for a broker or a 3PL company,” said Rick Burnett, CEO of LaneAxis. Burnett has been around the transportation industry most of his career in the brokerage business, running white glove services for UPS. It was during this time that he was exposed to the frustration of outdated loadboards that was a perennial pain point being a broker. “We had drivers sitting at various truck stops, as they could not find loads because the loads didn’t exist,” said Burnett. “Brokers and 3PLs post them, and it’s a bait and switch type of thing.” LaneAxis advocates for creating a direct model which has now become mainstream in different domains like the flight industry or banking. “You don’t need to go to the bank anymore to deposit money. You can take a picture of the cheque and send it, which automatically gets deposited,” said Burnett. “In transportation, it is a bit complicated right now, but with blockchain, it would be easier for the network to grow as it brings in trustability.” Burnett insists that the blockchain platform that LaneAxis has created would be a comprehensive solution for the transportation industry – providing insurance for carriers, geofencing locations to perceive accurate pickup and delivery schedules, drawing up delivery confirmations, and even offering to take in electronic proof of delivery. The idea is to build a community base within the driver force, which LaneAxis believes would create more visibility in the network. “We would then push the freight into the blockchain, allowing the ability to connect immediately to the carrier and assign a load with the mobile app down at the driver level,” said Burnett. “We are focussed on the industry as a whole and not just white-labeling the solution to different people. We want to eliminate the millions of trucks that are moving down the road empty every day, as that would reduce wear and tear on the roads and also regulate traffic flow. We are focussed on efficiency inside the network and not just pushing a subset of data into the blockchain.” Before materializing the blockchain platform, LaneAxis has been in the business of transporting loads for larges businesses, having run for the Big Three OEMs in Detroit and Walmart in Arkansas. This has given the company enough data to understand the market, and the problems faced by shippers and carriers in the ecosystem. “If you are a shipper moving thousands of loads every day, you can imagine the labor-intensive process it would take to manage that load level. They need contracts and insurance, and when you give them a load, you would have to find out who is on the load and if he has picked it up, and follow up on problems like when he gets in an accident, or if the truck breaks down,” said Burnett. “He also has paperwork to be done and process payments inside a system. LaneAxis simplifies this by using blockchain and enables people to seamlessly integrate directly to the carrier.” For doing this, LaneAxis is intent on the tokenization of the ecosystem and would be going public through a token sale. The company plans to use the capital raised to build out its infrastructure in phases. That being said, Burnett remarked that the biggest challenge in the space is to get people to understand the complexity of the industry and how held back it is from using technology for visibility. “People never understand that Walmart or UPS have no idea about where a certain amount of their loads are on a day-to-day basis,” he said. “People don’t get this because when they order something, they get an email and can track their package on its way to their house. So it is hard for them to believe that in a massive industry not everything is tracked. This is a fragmented marketplace with over 700,000 trucking companies, and there is no true network visibility in transportation.” Burnett contended that the technology of blockchain is here to stay, and that tokenization of data sets is a way to streamline the industry. “It is an opportunity to go out and build the network on a global scale. This could help the industry be more efficient,” he said.

All campaign and impression-related data is written to the Ethereum blockchain on an hourly basis using a blockchain product developed by Kiip called “single ledger,” which makes the data accessible to anyone with the encryption key. Kiip calls it a significant innovation for application of the blockchain technology for two reasons. “It makes brand content more relevant to consumers, and is an advance in fostering transparency within the mobile ad supply chain. The campaign is built around Kiip’s moments-targeting technology, which is being leveraged by AB InBev to break free of traditional interruptive advertising techniques to better connect with consumers in engaging, meaningful ways,” according to a statement. “We’re building a company to last for the next 100 plus years and that can only be done by disrupting existing paradigms through innovation and putting consumers at the heart of everything we do,” said Lucas Herscovici, AB InBev’s global marketing VP of consumer connections, insights and innovation. “As the world’s largest brewer and brand builders, we take our responsibility for the stewardship of the category seriously through our approach to advertising and the ways we create meaningful experiences for consumers with our brand content. This campaign will increase transparency in programmatic ad buying and support the ways our brands earn consumers attention.” Because the data is only written to the blockchain once an hour, latency isn’t an issue, said Brian Wong, CEO and co-founder of Kiip. “It’s a commonly repeated misconception that blockchain is too slow for any type of advertising use case,” he said. “In this case, you don’t have to clear every impression in real time. It can be done in batches and be just as efficient.” “When we started digging into blockchain’s potential impact on our business, we began to realize very simply that if Kiip was started today, it would be built on blockchain technology. As this realization started dawning on us, we began to architect what we would do to begin rolling this out,” Wong wrote on the company’s blog. Wong also observed that there is a lot of misinformation and confusion about the technology. “We realized that the best way to show the potential impact was to show real use cases, and to publicly explain our roll out plan in clear English so that people would believe blockchain’s immediate impact, and trust our ability to bring the technology, as it develops at lightning speed, to the broader market.” Wong also wrote that they are writing the campaign data of their campaigns with AB InBev to the Ethereum blockchain, and are “providing keys to the DSPs, agency, and client to audit the campaign data. We have functionality that allows the DSP, SSP, and other players to also write data to the same blockchain and to enable automatic reconciliation occur in future campaigns through smart contracts. In short, we’re helping solve the core issue of everyone agreeing on what to pay each other for through a private-public blockchain. All the campaign data is encrypted and only accessible to those with the keys.” It’s not that AB InBev’s data scientists mind putting in the time and effort, said Andy Chang, AB InBev’s global head of media and content. “It’s just really frustrating when we can’t validate benchmarks or create learnings because we’re not confident in the data behind them.” Using blockchain creates an immutable place for this data to live and the ability to set up a smart contract that spits out a definitive count at the end. AB InBev can also see where all media runs by brand and publisher. The campaign is still ongoing, but AB InBev is pleased with the visibility it’s getting, and it doesn’t consider this experiment a one-off. “We’re a big organization, and we’re driven by validated pilots that drive validated learnings,” Chang said. “The pilots we’re seeking with platforms to drive accountability in the media ecosystem is for sure something we’ll continue to do. It’s a long-term trend for us.” “Blockchain technology has been overhyped with very loose and frankly lightweight use cases,” Wong said. “But it’s also something that can have an immediate impact on a real problem in our industry – something any CMO can relate to and immediately activate.” AB InBev is a part of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance. BiTA was formed by experienced tech and transportation executives to create a forum for the development of blockchain standards and education for the freight industry. Their goal is to bring together leading companies in the freight technology industries that have a vested interest in the development of blockchain technology.

Focused on innovation in this area, Salesforce has joined BiTA – the Blockchain in Transport Alliance – to improve the supply chain experience for our customers, including shippers, transportation logistics providers, and their end consumers. BiTA was founded in 2017 and serves as a forum for the development and adoption of blockchain applications in the trucking, transportation, and global delivery ecosystem. BiTA has already attracted more than 420 members and its board includes companies like UPS, FedEx, ECHO, J.B. Hunt, SAP, TMW Systems, and McLeod. Salesforce is proud to join the board. Transportation and logistics (T\u0026L) has historically innovated at a much slower pace than other sectors. In the words of Peter Emahiser, CEO of Tadmore Transportation (min 31:59), “If shipping were pizza, no one would get a hot pizza.” As a BiTA board member, we’re eager to propel the transportation industry forward by spurring blockchain technology development and standardizing industry uses of blockchain applications. Blockchain is changing transportation in profound ways. It is a data democratizer, providing transparency and ensuring fairness among all participants. IDC forecasts that corporate spending on blockchain software, services, and hardware will more than double this year, from $945 million to $2.1 billion. The rise of the Internet moved us – consumers and companies – from local to global. The advent of the cloud accelerated our computing power and ushered in smarter connected devices. Similarly, blockchain is becoming a new standard for trading information, impacting consumers, companies, and governments. The technology to support blockchain is more available than ever before. With Salesforce, shippers, carriers, and T\u0026L providers can bring key functions together. They can facilitate enhanced collaboration between customers and companies by leveraging blockchain technology (with a single trusted ledger) to create a seamless supply chain experience. The T\u0026L industry is hungry for change. Salesforce is honored to sit at the BiTA table with industry innovators. Leading these conversations with future-thinking peers helps us gain a better understanding of what our customers need and what the industry is looking for. Through collaboration and trust, together we will develop blockchain standards and technologies that will bring value to shippers, carriers, and their customers. Coming to Dreamforce 2018?

The title of the patent is “Autonomous services selection system and distributed transportation database(s).” The concept involves storing a multitude of various types of data within a distributed ledger network, including information about a given package’s destination, its movement and transportation plans for shipment units. The patent also describes storing data from point of origin, to destination, as well as shipment parameters, generating a transportation plan, tracking and completion of the shipment, including payment, and even using blockchain technology. UPS suggests using more than one distributed ledger in an effort to track a range of orders, “each providing varying information/data regarding respective asset types (e.g., shipment units and/or associated shipment units).” “Thus, certain embodiments enable tracking of a first set of shipment units and a second set of shipment units associated with the first set of shipment units separately, thereby enabling the use of various smart contracts relating to shipping services and shipment unit handling in a bifurcated manner,” the company wrote in a release. The patent explains that as consumers demand faster, cheaper shipping while also demanding more visibility into the path of their shipments, new tools are necessary to track international shipments that involve multiple carriers. This is in the spirit of the blockchain standards organization that UPS joined in November of 2017, Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). BiTA was formed by experienced tech and transportation executives to create a forum for the development of blockchain standards and education for the freight industry. The goal of the organization is to bring together leading companies in the freight technology industries that have a vested interest in the development of blockchain technology. “Blockchain has multiple applications in the logistics industry, especially related to supply chains, insurance, payments, audits and customs brokerage,” Linda Weakland, UPS director of enterprise architecture and innovation, said in November. “The technology has the potential to increase transparency and efficiency among shippers, carriers, brokers, consumers, vendors and other supply chain stakeholders.” A key phrase to note in the patent application is “automated determination.” UPS intends for the software not only to track a package through multiple countries and carriers on a blockchain-based infrastructure, but it will also determine the optimal route for each package, and the idea is all this happens without human intervention. It’s totally automatic. The idea is that as a package is tracked, necessary payments are triggered throughout each step. A major benefit of blockchain technology is the ability to immutably link delivery and payment on a decentralized ledger, allowing for instantaneous transactions triggered by the delivery itself and not a secondary action by the carrier. And for the foreseeable future blockchain remains inextricably linked to cryptocurrency. The patent also mentions that “virtual currencies” such as Bitcoin may be acceptable forms of payment in this system. UPS shipped more than 5 billion packages and documents last year, according to its website, earning $54 billion in revenue.

Pay them!","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Rightly or wrongly, the transportation industry has a reputation for being slow to adopt new technology. American trucking in particular is highly fragmented, leading to wide differentiation in access to computing hardware, software licenses, and data professionals. Even large, well-capitalized carriers have trouble operationalizing their data due to cultural issues and incumbent executives relying on instinct. Trucking’s reputation has made industry insiders skeptical of how the the sector will adapt to one of the most cutting edge, new technologies with the potential to fundamentally transform transportation and logistics: blockchain. How can tech companies developing blockchain solutions drive adoption of a technology that many people still don’t understand and have misconceptions about? There are at least two solutions to the (perceived) problem of blockchain adoption. The simplest way to get people on the blockchain will, unfortunately, probably take some time to execute: bring the software applications that shippers, carriers, and brokers are already using onto the blockchain invisibly. Just like most people who send email have no idea whether the protocol their client is using is POP3 or IMAP, a carrier accepting a load from a shipper’s EDI does not have to know the details of the cryptographic ledger recording the attributes of the shipment. Once blockchain emerges from its infancy and is implemented by large software incumbents, users will reap the benefits of being on the blockchain without having to be aware of it. In the meantime, though, blockchain startups are still reaching for market share and trying to attract users. Fr8 Network, in particular, has found a way to leverage its protocol’s tokenized economy to drive adoption: issuing micropayments in the Fr8 token to supply chain participants who upload data to the blockchain. “If P\u0026G wants to link its TMS to the Fr8 Protocol, the fee for linking a new shipment contract will be directly tied to the amount of data gathering they want to incentivize,” according to Fr8 Network’s white paper. “For example, a truck driver receives a micropayment for using an electronic bill of lading instead of the traditional one, or an IoT provider receives micropayments for the temperature and location updates they provide. Updates every 10 minutes would amount to more micropayments than updates every 4 hours.” But there’s more than one way to incentivize the use of the Fr8 Protocol. Another angle was inspired by the airports’ special CLEAR lanes, which allow passengers to skip to the front of security lines because their travel documents and identities are pre-verified. By managing those documents on a blockchain, where ownership can be cryptographically secured, cross-border freight traffic could be expedited and wait times nearly eliminated. “A carrier’s time is a precious commodity within the regulated logistics space as they can only drive so many hours in a 24-hour period before mandatory rest,” Fr8 Network pointed out. “Waiting in line for inspections or clearances creates inefficiency and increases the cost of transportation and trade. Currently, goods entering the US at a land border crossing suffer wait times on average of 2.75 hours for inspection. Through a simple application, the Fr8 Protocol can expedite processes for inspection, clearance, and land border crossing by leveraging the attributes of blockchain-enabled transparency, immutability, and digital identity.” Although the implementation of blockchain-powered smart contracts is expected to greatly reduce disputes arising from missing and incomplete paperwork, there still have to be conflict resolution and governance procedures built into the Fr8 Protocol. The arbitrators will also be directly compensated with Fr8 tokens, further incentivizing participation in the network. The tokenized economics of the blockchain have the potential to change industry participants’ calculus when it comes to new software and technology adoption. Many transportation companies are hampered by decade-old systems built for a previous generation of information technology, but are discouraged from switching to newer software because of the prohibitive costs associated with maintaining operations in the middle of an upgrade, importing old data into a new system, and quickly re-training employees. With the Fr8 Protocol, adoption will be a revenue generator instead of a cost center, potentially accelerating the technology adoption cycle and moving transportation into the future faster than anyone would have expected.

Christian Ferri, president and CEO of BlockStar, believes blockchain technology has an answer. Ferri believes blockchain technology will allow consumers and users to submit their data, be more transparent with brands and ad executives, and allow users the choice to opt-in and out of ads. This could be one of the most practical ways blockchain could reach the masses. The concept of using blockchain for non-financial transactions is a difficult one, largely because it takes a decentralized network of thousands people running powerful software to create and maintain the blockchain. Running that software comes at a cost. Whatever the blockchain application, how do companies that don’t also offer an ICO (whether it’s in the food industry or healthcare or social media) strategize to grow their platforms from an enterprise perspective? It’s also a rough time for ad tech startups. Venture capital money going into ad tech startups is falling sharply, helping push a wave of consolidation. Financing reached a high of $2.92 billion in 2015, but this year, it’s on pace to be less than half that, according to CB Insights. And the number of independent ad tech companies has fallen 21% since 2013, to 185 as of the second quarter of 2018, according to LUMA Partners, which analyzes digital media and marketing. Some fear that the contraction could also mean a slowdown in innovation. Advertising has long been an attractive area for startups. During the last 10 years, the ease of forming companies and the availability of cheap venture capital led to a flood of ad tech startups, pushing boundaries on where and how ads were delivered. They introduced technologies like the automation of ad buying, and header bidding, in which many ad exchanges bid on publishers’ space simultaneously, according to the New York Times. “From a blockchain network we’ll see change in a couple of ways,” Ferri points out. “One is the speed. Right now we’re at like 1,000 transactions per second.” Compared to the 24,000 per second that Visa is capable of handling, this is considered infantile. In terms of blockchain innovation, however, it’s an exciting time for many pioneers. “Sidechains are like a 2.0. There’s even some 3.0 solutions. It’s all still in beta. You’re going to see bidding for digital transactions, and the costs are going to go down. You’re going to see a better price. A second thing that is equally or more important [with blockchain] is the transparency,” says Ferri. “If an advertiser says they’re going to hit 20,000 impressions, they’re going to hit it, and you can see it. Right now we have click through rate, or cost per impression. Are those organic searches? Or are those paid? Can we separate the two for instance? 50/50 or 70/30? You’ll get a better, more accurate report, and also in turn create more trust from the ad industry.” A sidechain is a separate blockchain that is attached to its parent blockchain using a two-way peg. The two-way peg enables interchangeability of assets at a predetermined rate between the parent blockchain and the sidechain. The original blockchain is usually referred to as the main chain and all additional blockchains are referred to as sidechains. As far as sidechains are concerned, Ferri says, “It’s like Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. They have to be debugged, secure, to create the foundation of trust, and that’s when you’re going to see the big results.” A company that BlockStar consults for, Sapien, seeks to create a social news platform that gives users control of their data, but you have to use a SPO token in order to access and use the platform. “Blockchain and crypto are hard to separate right now,” Ferri agrees. There are plenty of other platforms using blockchain to create a whole new social media news platform like Steemit, Sola, Indorse, onG.social, PROPS Project, among others. Should the Facebooks and Twitters of the world should be responding? “Yes, I think so,” says Ferri. “I think there’s a connection there from multiple aspects. Identity management, you are who you say you are. Ownership of the data, and you permission company or individuals.” One of the perennial issues that continues to dog blockchain technology, however—especially as it reaches into enterprise solutions—is distinguishing between the technology and cryptocurrency. Muddying the waters, many of these blockchain social media platforms require a token in order to use. “We’re keen in the space, and we’ve been in it for several years now. We’ve been working with medium-to-small size companies. We’re helping to consult as former consultants that understand the complexities of business that can help companies enter the blockchain-era. Our services, in turn, help democratize the world and the future customers. We help the company’s tokenize.” Why? According to Ferri, companies have “dormant areas.” Maybe it’s a patent that nobody’s using, or an empty building. You can tokenize it. You might get some cash flow from it, but also a buy in from the community. It can help a company be seen as caring about the community and others. Ferri admits that crypto can be a pain right now. “It’s like the early days of using money to pay for a phone. It sure wasn’t an iPhone. Part of the evolution is the technology,” he says. So, with Bitcoin and other cryptos going down and (for the time being at least) staying down, how are such companies supposed to get people excited about purchasing virtually unknown tokens? “The early adopters are going to have to drive it. These companies are depending on the pioneers,” says Ferri. “You can tokenize virtually anything. You need to appeal to the pioneers that are looking for something new and exciting, and it needs to be easy enough, and they can become the champions of this new movement. I see this movement taking off pretty soon. Think about every company right now that has to go through this regulatory bottleneck.” “The power is to the people at first. We tend to group up. It’s human behavior. It’s a wide open time right now for digital advertising. 10 years down the road we’ll tend toward the regulatory,” says Ferri. For now, the consolidation in the venture capital world may be a necessary contraction, but once blockchain technology reaches a tipping point—with or without tokens—there should be another infusion of funding and, as a result, innovation.

Irrespective of the vertical, logistics is a complex process that suffers from transparency and visibility owes, which leads to service providers gaming the system to improve margins at the expense of the end-consumer. Serve.io, a last-mile logistics startup is looking to set the record straight by removing middle-men from the supply chain equation and create transparency in its working. “We are creating a global economy by allowing users, service providers, and business to work without middle-men,” said Roman Tsarovsky, CTO at Serve.io. “We focus on last-mile logistics and have developed technology for big logistics players like UPS and GrubHub that allow for managing and dispatching order management.” Tsarovsky spoke about the numerous platforms that exist in the logistics space that take commissions in excess of 30%, which he felt were unfair to the end users. “Platforms upcharge businesses, who do it to the service provider delivering it, by levying a service and processing fee, which finally is combined and ends up on the consumer who pays for it all,” he said. It is here that Serve.io sees the potential of blockchain. Tsarovsky had an elegant example to go with explaining why – “A pizza store making $11 pizza will at the end receive a net $8.20, a service provider who is delivering wants $4 but is upcharged by $2.10. The user would have to pay for the platform fees, delivery, and customer service which brings it to $24 for an $11 pizza.” It shows that in a $24 transaction, the pizza store ends up gaining just over $8 for the pizza, with platforms charging nearly 40% of the final value as fees. Tsarovsky insisted that with a global service economy running on blockchain, this practice would drastically reduce. Serve.io has built out its technology and is leveraging its experience in the logistics space to create a global marketing campaign that can help launch its solution worldwide. “We have worked with a lot of big players in the industry, and we are using the feedback we get from them to solve logistics issues and hurdles,” said Tsarovsky. Tsarovsky felt that the biggest obstacle to traction would be about educating businesses on the impact of blockchain over supply chains of the future. Bad publicity over the meteoric rise of cryptocurrency and its subsequent fall has created skepticism over blockchain, especially with companies that did not have a formal initiation towards the technology. “Explaining to businesses about our blockchain protocols and onboarding them to establish a global service economy is our main focus,” said Tsarovsky. “Because each individual business will be branded in themselves and we are essentially the engine that powers the technology, they will advertise themselves, and we gain customers that way.” Blockchain can work wonders for consumers, who are being fed misleading information about products and brands through advertisements, as businesses increasingly concentrate on marketing themselves right, rather than making the right products. For instance, blockchain and the transparency it brings, can essentially weed out fake reviews given to products and companies. Blockchain being the supply chain artery would mean that users can order a certain product from a specific store, and be confident of its quality, know the stakeholders handling the product, and also be informed of the exact time of the product’s arrival. At the end of the day, the idea behind Serve.io is to create a perfect delivery experience for the end-users. “There are a lot of things that are broken in the current state of logistics, where businesses focus on their profits and try to maximize it at every opportunity. Though they do care about their customers, it happens that customers always come last. We feel the customer should be the priority and that everything should be done with regard to that,” said Tsarovsky.

From what we can tell, the conversation around TradeLens has been encouraged not so much by any breakthrough that TradeLens represents—after all, it’s essentially a bespoke, customized version of HyperLedger Fabric—but rather by IBM’s massive public relations machine. A critical look at the information that has been published about TradeLens so far generates some interesting questions. The first question has to do with the apparent reluctance the maritime transportation and logistics community has to adopt the technology. The now-famous IBM-Maersk joint study that tracked a refrigerated container of flowers from Kenya to Rotterdam and evaluated how much documentation and changes-of-hand were required was conducted way back in 2014, a lifetime ago in blockchain-years. That Maersk and IBM were developing a blockchain solution together was announced in the spring of 2017. Although this project has now been under development for years, few major players in maritime have joined on. IBM’s press release trumpets the participation of Hamburg Süd, for instance, which happens to be a container line owned by Maersk. The majority of the other participants are terminal operators or customs authorities. The second question has to do with the details of the technology, which, to be frank, have not been particularly forthcoming. One thing we do know, from the TradeLens website, is that “the platform is delivered by the IBM Cloud to members around the world.” TradeLens insists, however, that “Blockchain is the core technology that powers TradeLens, ensuring that the data remain secured, permissioned, and distributed.” Anyone with a passing familiarity with blockchain would immediately wonder how TradeLens’ data can possibly be described as ‘distributed’ if in fact the blockchain resides on the IBM Cloud. If TradeLens lives on IBM’s servers, then IBM can alter the blockchain, withhold data, censor transactions, mine information, etc. Therefore, some of the key advantages of blockchain—simultaneously enhancing security and removing costs by using decentralization eliminating trusted intermediaries—can never be realized by TradeLens. We actually think that some of the most interesting work in the blockchain/transport and logistics space is being performed not by incumbents like IBM and Microsoft, but by a diverse group of startups. Companies like dexFreight, Fr8 Network, Block Array, Slync, and ShipChain—all members of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance—are experimenting with a range of technology tradeoffs, business problems, and go-to-market strategies. In the interplay between these startups, industry observers and tech enthusiasts can evaluate the choices being made and the reasons behind them, and watch the industry evolve much faster than it does inside of a decades-old corporation. Slync, for instance, has a team of developers from Salesforce’s Einstein AI project, and focuses on reducing costs by automating workflows. Blockchain is only 5-10% of what Slync does, according to CEO Chris Kirchner, but the company is actively piloting permissioned blockchain solutions that tend to have a small number of nodes enabling a group of five or six companies to collaborate. Block Array, on the other hand, built its technology on top of the public, permissionless Ethereum network, and has already released a product called Freight Trust that replaces paper bills of lading with smart contracts. Another company, Block Shipping, has a similar scope in that it’s building a project with a particular niche. The Danish startup wants to create a global container ID and they’re claiming that each container will have a globally unique ID and that will be helpful in tokenizing those containers as assets. There is also a range of funding models for startups working in the space. Slync raised money from venture capitalists and large investors just like a traditional tech startup, while ShipChain did a token pre-sale, bringing in $30M in exchange for SHIP tokens. dexFreight completed a friends and family-led angel round to get started, and hopes to do an STO (‘security token offering’) in the next few months, once the Securities Exchange Commission finds an STO model they like and approves it. A security token represents common stock, or equity in a company, and would be separate from the utility token that powers the network, settles payments, and incentivizes participation. STOs could be the best of both worlds, allowing a startup to raise capital in an efficient way unburdened by the compliance costs of IPOs, while still protecting the utility token running the network from the volatility that comes from being traded on secondary markets. FreightWaves spoke to Rajat Rajbhandari, CEO and cofounder of dexFreight, by phone. Rajbhandri explained that one of the basic differentiators between blockchain startups are the enterprise blockchain companies that want to help transport and logistics incumbents create efficiencies in their existing business models, and the companies who want actually decentralize logistics. “Companies like Blockshipping, Fr8, Block Array, and dexFreight are not so much in the enterprise blockchain world but in decentralized logistics, creating their own ecosystem. I don’t see a competition between those spaces, at least not yet,” said Rajbhandari. The dexFreight CEO said that while those companies shared commonalities, dexFreight wants to change the way the entire industry works. Rajbhandari said his co-founder Hector Hernandez is a Miami-based freight broker, and dexFreight tends to approach transport and logistics from a broker’s perspective. “The end goal for ShipChain, Fr8 and us is very similar: bring down cost through high automation with blockchain. How the three companies execute it is slightly different, though. We come from more of the broker perspective—we look more at workflow, because if the tech is going to drive middlemen away it needs to be able to do everything a typical broker does,” said Rajbhandari. “What we ultimately want to do is have companies transact directly without the platform at all: they’ll be running their own nodes in a truly decentralized way.” “We’re building a platform so we can open it up to third party developers like insurance providers, telematics companies… we just need to build the core interaction between shippers and carriers and then open up the platform for third parties to come in and provide the services, which can be paid for by token, fiat, crypto, credit card, whatever,” Rajbhandari explained. dexFreight is still weighing its options for financing (the SEC has yet to approve any security token offering applications), but already has several partner agreements in place. “We have a couple letters of intent. We’re working with a company called CoinFabric, a smart contract development company out of Argentina. We’re partnered with Rootstock, who’s building a side chain called RSK on top of Bitcoin that can run decentralized applications. We have a memorandum of understanding with the FedEx Institute of Technology and an MOU with a Canadian company, and we’re exploring other tech providers, like MakerDAO, which is building a stable token,” said Rajbhandari. dexFreight will deliver its minimum viable product in September or October, Rajbhandari said, and then work with developers on applications that will run on its platform.

Over a third (35%) of Brits say they would not trust an organization using the technology with their personal information, and that they are not fully aware of what blockchain actually is. The research, conducted by OnePulse, found that 11% of those who were familiar with blockchain said they would not trust a business using it, meaning that overall nearly half of the public would avoid organizations using blockchain technology. 28% said that they would not trust an organization using any technology they don’t understand, highlighting that businesses need to be careful on what new tools and services they are pushing into the public domain. As businesses double down on their security in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) age, many are considering how they can use Blockchain to provide an additional layer of security, in part due to the technology’s “incorruptible” nature. Overall, 53% of the survey respondents had never heard of blockchain before, with only 18% able to correctly identify what the technology actually is. The research was carried out at the recent IP Expo Europe trade show, and it found that even those who do know what blockchain actually is are wary of the technology. The news comes despite blockchain being touted as the “next big thing” in a wide variety of industries, with the technology cited as a breakthrough in work ranging from security to healthcare. “Blockchain is a technology that many people in the industry are still struggling to wrap their head around, so it’s of no surprise that it’s also causing plenty of confusion for the general public,” said Andy Steed, director of content for IP Expo Europe. “Businesses need to make sure they are not only deploying new technology like blockchain in a way that will have a meaningful impact, but that they are taking the time to explain what the technology is in easy to understand language to their customers instead of simply stating that they are using it.” In response to the study’s results, Chris Burruss, president of BiTA (Blockchain in Transport Alliance), tells FreightWaves, “I don’t think people in general can separate crypto from blockchain, but it’s almost like saying Facebook and the internet are the same thing. The internet continues to exist without Facebook, and blockchain can exist without cryptos. People have to learn to separate them and learn what the technology is.” As to the idea of not trusting the technology, Burruss says, “What you’re doing is creating transparency and you’re creating security. What do you have now? You have a centralized system, which are prone to data breaches. We’ve seen it time and again, if not daily, they’re a part of a normal occurrence. Blockchain seeks to create greater security. It’s not necessarily impossible, but it’s highly improbable [to break it]. The decentralized—every node having a same copy of the data—it’s a shared copy of the truth. As opposed to a centralized, which is one version of the truth.” Burruss adds that it’s natural for the general public to be suspect, “but right now I think we’re somewhere between the hype and reality.” While blockchain is certainly not a solution for everything, companies have to look at whether it’s for them or not. “It’s a decision tree,” says Burruss. BiTA was formed by experienced tech and transportation executives to create a forum for the development of blockchain standards and education for the freight industry. Their goal is to bring together leading companies in the freight technology industries that have a vested interest in the development of blockchain technology.

After announcing the joint project eight months ago, the world’s largest shipping company and information technology giant the new blockchain platform, TradeLens, has captured more than 154 million events. TradeLens aims “to promote more efficient and secure global trade, bringing together various parties to support information sharing and transparency, and spur industry-wide innovation.” The announcement also includes a host of other shippers, terminal owners, freight forwarders and customs authorities that will be using the TradeLens, which it says is built on open standards. Among other shipping participants are Pacific International Lines and Hamburg Sud. Maersk’s own APM Terminals subsidiary will also be using the TradeLens platform, along with other terminal operators, representing a total of 234 marine gateways. Freight forwarders, transportation and logistics companies including Agility, CEVA Logistics, DAMCO, Kotahi, PLH Trucking Company, Ancotrans and WorldWide Alliance are also currently participating. TradeLens allows the participants to establish “a single shared view of a transaction without compromising details, privacy or confidentiality. “Shippers, shipping lines, freight forwarders, port and terminal operators, inland transportation and customs authorities can interact more efficiently through real-time access to shipping data ad shipping documents, including IoT and sensor data ranging from temperature control to container weight,” the company said in a release. Trade documents are available under a beta program called ClearWay, allows customs brokers and government agencies to collaborate in cross-organizational business processes and information exchanges, all backed by a secure, non-repudiable audit trail. Maersk and IBM said one TradeLens trial reduced the transit time of a shipment of packaging materials to a production line in the United States by 40%. More than 154 million shipping events have been captured on the platform, including data such as arrival times of vessels and container “gate-in”, and documents such as customs releases, commercial invoices and bills of lading. This data is growing at a rate of close to one million events per day. “We believe blockchain can play an important role in digitizing global shipping, an area of the global economy that moves four trillion dollars of goods every year,” Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president, IBM Global Industries, Solutions and Blockchain. “ IBM and Maersk are now soliciting additional partners for the project through standards discussions with openshipping.org and work to align the TradeLens APIs with UN/CEFACT standards is in progress. The TradeLens APIs are open and available for developer access and feedback from participants in the platform. The TradeLens solution is available today through the Early Adopter Program. TradeLens is expected to be fully commercially available by the end of this year.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Maritime, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-08-09T11:48:15-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/omnichain-joins-blockchain-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/BiTAOmnichain-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Omnichain Solutions joins fellow supply chain leaders in the Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Omnichain Solutions (Omnichain), a supply chain technology startup that leverages the power of Blockchain, announces it has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA).

Blockchain technology has the potential significantly upend the logistics and supply chains and by joining BiTA, Tranzport is joining with like-minded companies interested in developing open-sourced standards and collaborating with these leading companies in advancing blockchain technology. BiTA has over 400 member companies from all areas of the supply chain. Tranzport also announces the launch of its smart freight management platform that reduces complexity, manual tasks and vacuums of knowledge that have been prevalent in the logistics industry. Tranzport operates two service divisions: Tranzport Concierge and Tranzport Cloud. With Tranzport, shippers and carriers have multiple ways of booking loads, complying with regulations, maintaining quality standards, and keeping all of their data in one place. Tranzport Concierge is a managed-services freight and logistics provider that allows shippers the ability to have a personalized shipping experience. Servicing shippers and carriers with traditional brokerage services, the Tranzport Concierge team is comprised of industry-veteran logistics experts who leverage the Tranzport Cloud platform to enhance productivity and provide levels of service that are rare in traditional brokerages. Tranzport Cloud is a software enabling its shippers and carriers to book and manage loads, communicate with counterparties, gain visibility into facilities and locations, collaborate with team-members, and retain institutional memory. Shippers gain access to over 250,000 carriers and brokers vetted and verified in real time. The platform is optimized for full truckload (FTL) shippers that ship over 750 truckloads per year. Compliance, verification, business management, and private labeling functions come standard with Tranzport. This feature set has won the business of several large volume shippers including some Fortune 500 clients. With it, they are easily shipping, tracking, and complying more efficiently. The company has positioned its offerings as a feed for smart contracts. It believes that blockchain will create efficiencies and new best practices in the industry. The Tranzport Cloud platform enables users to collect metadata to keep a record of activities that happen throughout the lifecycle of a shipment. Through Tranzport Cloud, shippers and carriers receive an Enhanced Bill of Lading (EBL) – a metadata-rich document that stores images, geotags, and other tamper-proof information to help shippers and logistics providers have full visibility into a shipment’s chain of events. EBL’s will eventually be used to enforce smart contracts. As blockchain becomes mainstream, Tranzport will be able to commit EBL data to an indelible public ledger visible only to the parties involved in the transaction. Tranzport Co-Founder and President David Woldenberg says, “we founded Tranzport to make shipping easier, more affordable and more transparent. We give you a hassle-free way to ship, track, and comply. By giving you insight, actionable options and real time tools, we offer you online, to on truck, to on site solutions.” The company’s founder is also enthusiastic about artificial intelligence. “The future is here. Much of the difficulty and cumbersome processes logistics professionals have to navigate through are being vastly reduced and companies like ours are at the forefront of that innovation. We have already developed algorithms that create ‘tours’ – lanes created by algorithms that consolidate multiple shorter FTLs that enable a carrier to move continuously, minimizing deadhead miles.” Contact Tranzport at [email protected] to schedule a live demo or for more information.

Cross-border trade is now more relevant than ever, as shipping lines keep adding more capacity to their fleet to accommodate the burgeoning growth in international trade. This leads to a fresh infusion of stakeholders in the market, complicating logistics further. Various maritime management solutions are cropping up in the industry and help connect shippers, maritime carriers, and their affiliated partners, improving efficiency and visibility across the supply chain. Regardless of this, the industry continues to be bogged down by red tape and as the number of parties involved in a single transaction increase, stepping up the need for accountability is vital. At the crossroads of transparency and efficiency lies blockchain, a technology that if applied right, could revolutionize the way logistics processes are run. FreightWaves spoke with Martin Gnass, Managing Director of IT at Hapag-Lloyd, to get a hold of how the company views the current maritime scenario and the prospects of blockchain in the industry. “Within shipping, the level of standardization, harmonization of processes, data and documentation is generally low. This causes inefficiencies in the collaboration between carriers and all the stakeholders involved in the shipping supply chain, including customers and vendors. This is the inefficiency that we have to tackle,” said Gnass. Hapag-Lloyd has generally been critical of companies creating proprietary blockchain solutions in the industry. It is disapproving of, for example, the pilot program that is being tested by Maersk and IBM. Maersk’s solution is expected to not be a standard or a common platform for the maritime industry, but rather serve its own interests – a stand that Hapag-Lloyd is against. “We have to ensure that once we produce new technologies like blockchain for digital collaboration and secure handling of business documents, it has open interconnectivity,” said Gnass. “We should not have a closed proprietary environment of solutions which would not be able to interlock or connect to each other.” Gnass insisted that situations that advance a technological monopoly should be actively discouraged, and that initiatives should look to establish an interconnectivity ecosystem based on an open consortium governance model. “We have to ensure that these kinds of digital ecosystems are open for partners and stakeholders to join and has a certain level of openness that influences the stakeholders that have a stake in the governance structure,” he said. That being said, it is also critical for companies to test the waters by introducing blockchain into the market and perceive the reception the technology has in the industry. “There are currently several projects running, which are still in the early phase. But as far as Proof of Concept (PoC) and validation of pilots are concerned, there are different kinds of use cases and initiatives that are being analyzed,” said Gnass. Gnass contended that once use cases are validated, it is essential for them to be successfully launched in the industry because the stakeholders would have to connect and be part of an open ecosystem for such a technology to foster. “I believe it would be reasonable to establish a governance structure like the IATA, which is placed in the airline industry for decades. It could be a role model to be adopted in our industry to simplify the processes, for digital standardizations and improvements with regard to supply chain management and efficiency of the market,” said Gnass. It is evident from the activity around blockchain that the technology is here to stay. Nonetheless, navigating through regulatory hurdles and getting stakeholders to agree on common standards that would lead blockchain to be adopted mainstream is by far the biggest challenge that awaits it.

Yesterday, the AG’s office entered a new order vacating, or canceling, the previous cease and desist order. The initial cease and desist order alleged that ShipChain was acting as an unlicensed securities broker to South Carolina residents. ShipChain argued a lack of jurisdiction in a two pronged argument: the company maintained throughout the dispute that it did not believe its SHIP tokens were securities, and also said that the cryptocurrency was not marketed to or purchased by any South Carolina residents. “Earlier today, the Office of the South Carolina Securities Commissioner concluded its inquiry into allegations that it had received against ShipChain regarding its token, and vacated its cease-and-desist order of May 21, 2018. The company fully cooperated with the inquiry. ShipChain is gratified by the Commissioner’s decision and looks forward to continuing to build its transformative global-logistics industry platform and its network of partnerships with the participants in that industry,” ShipChain wrote in a statement. It appears that the cease and desist order was a rapid response to complaints—which turned out to be baseless—about ShipChain’s activities in South Carolina. “In our regulatory function, we’re charged with proactively keeping the state’s securities markets as fair, safe, and efficient as possible,” the South Carolina AG’s office wrote to FreightWaves in an email. “To accomplish that mandate, the Securities Division often needs to act quickly and on the basis of activities which look a certain way. In this case, they saw activities which caused concern. They began investigating and, based on information uncovered, were concerned enough to issue an order to the company requesting they cease doing securities business in South Carolina until they came in and addressed our concerns. The company came in, provided the information we requested that satisfied our concerns, and the Division vacated the order.” “We vacated the cease and desist order because good cause was shown,” wrote the South Carolina Attorney General’s office. The cease and desist order was vacated without prejudice, meaning that no decision has been made about whether the SHIP token is a security or not. Genesis Mining, a cloud-based cryptocurrency mining platform, also had a cease and desist order vacated by the Securities Division of the South Carolina AG’s office.

This shift could have far-reaching impact on retailers, consumer goods companies, manufacturers, and more.” With this important industry in mind, CB Insights hosted a July 24 webinar to “explore how shipping companies and global ports are utilizing automation and blockchain technology to revolutionize the shipping industry,” taking a look at various aspects of the supply chain along the way. Natan Reddy, an intelligence analyst at CB Insights who specializes in retail, supply chain, logistics, and ecommerce, led the conversation on innovation in the realm of maritime shipping. “While people often talk about technology and last mile delivery, we don’t often talk about the first mile, which is another word for the global trade supply chain, which transports goods from manufacturers and growers to businesses around the globe,” Reddy explained. This webinar, while touching on trends in maritime shipping, also reiterated the importance of ocean shipping innovation. “Over 90% of goods in the world that are shipped internationally are shipped by ocean,” Reddy noted, acknowledging the broader supply chain that includes manufacturers, warehouses, freight forwarders. “A major issue in maritime shipping—and in the global supply chain—is a lack of general visibility for those looking to ship,” citing the 2016 Hanjin collapse in which “many of their ships were shut out of various ports around the world, causing thousands of containers of cargo to be stranded at sea.” Reddy noticed an uptick in maritime innovation news media mentions in 2016, attributing the “greater attention to maritime innovation and the real necessity for visibility in the space” to the disruption caused by Hanjin. “Beyond a lack of visibility, there are issues surrounding cyber security as well as general supply chain management and flexibility given recent tariff developments that have taken place. Over the last few years, we’ve actually seen an increase in news and media buzz surrounding maritime supply chain and innovation,” according to Reddy. Reddy drew attention to three major trends that have rippled across the industry, particularly from start-ups in the field: an increase in visibility, connectivity, and automation, “helping supply chain players gain better oversight and understanding of their operations.” In reference to the rise in blockchain technology, Reddy noted the importance of standardization. “If blockchain is going to be successful in shipping, everyone will have to be on the same platform, or the platforms that are being developed will need to be interoperable” Reddy stated. “If that is achieved, we could see an increase in the efficiency of global trade, a decrease in fraud, and an improvement in the overall tracking and transparency of goods.” Autonomous shipping has also become an important aspect of the supply chain. As Reddy said, “While full autonomous shipping might be further out, we are seeing startups taking baby steps in that direction.” Reddy counts “greater operational safety of ships, a reduction in overhead costs, and energy efficiency” among the benefits of autonomous shipping. Reddy also pointed to ports for their history of being “a driving force behind automation and technology integration in maritime shipping,” specifically discussing the Port of Rotterdam, “which has automated much of its operations already,” as FreightWaves’ Craig Fuller covered in June. As the webinar concluded, CB Insights presented their findings on the effects of maritime shipping and supply chain innovation, ranging from near-term to long-term impacts in port automation, freight booking digitalization, fuel efficiency technology, blockchain shipping, and autonomous shipping. Benefits include port efficiency that “helps cut down on delays for truckers” and blockchain standardization that could help “all players involved in shipping goods save money on paperwork, decrease shipping delays, and avoiding fraud.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain, CB Insights, Efficiency, Maritime, Shipping, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Container Shipping, Cybersecurity, Maritime, News, Warehouse, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-07-25T15:57:09-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/daily-pickup-dat-rates-july24","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dailypickuptruck.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Today’s pickup: DAT rates show a decline for the second consecutive week","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The latest DAT report shows a second week of rates pulling back.

Spot reefer rates have declined to $2.65 from $2.77 two weeks ago. The load-to-truck ratio is also down for all three of those categories. Compared to a year ago, on a monthly basis for June, vans are up 29%, flatbeds are up 31% and reefers are up 27%.

The number is astonishingly smaller: four. It’s why Rhode Island’s truck tolls have made about $27,000 more than expected, according to the state. According to this news story, the data is somewhat preliminary, accounting for only two tolls, with numerous more to follow. But in the first month alone at those two stops, almost 189,000 trucks were tolled, and the estimate was 177,000 trucks. The funds are to go for road repairs. It could be that the cost-benefit of avoiding tolls weighs those savings against an already pressed time limitation enhanced by ELDs, offset in part by rising freight rates. And the conclusion?

On Friday afternoon, George Abernathy, the Chief Revenue Officer of FreightWaves, moderated a panel on the Internet of Things. Panelists included Slync CEO Chris Kirchner, Redwood Logistics CIO Eric Rempel, Kylen McClintock of Flux IoT, and Zaki Manian, Executive Director of the Trusted IoT Alliance. The panelists began by introducing themselves. Manian said that the Trusted IoT Alliance is composed of about 50 companies, all of which are under two years old, and that the goal of the alliance is to provide some level of support and guidance to finding the entry point solution for IoT and blockchain. Manian said that the wedge into the market for blockchain-enabled IoT has been somewhat elusive, and he’s working with young companies, some of which have promising use cases and no money, and some that have funding but are still searching for their identity. Kirchner said, “Slync started a little differently than a lot of software companies. People are trying to find a way to fit blockchain into a problem—we started the other way around and spent six months just talking to customers. Every enterprise has a list of the 10 things that suck in their business, so we had a lot of frank conversations with people, not selling them anything, just playing therapist, and then going from there. We aren’t searching for a problem, we started with a problem and are building a solution.” Kirchner explained that while Slync offers businesses supply chain digitization and automation, he doesn’t lead his pitch with blockchain, noting that it’s just a small piece of the technology that helps Slync’s customers. Rempel spoke about the work that still has to be done for blockchain to actually improve the transportation and logistics industry: “The industry itself—specifically logistics and supply chain—is so fragmented, so broken apart, that you have everything from companies with IoT sensors in their tires measuring pressure and predicting accidents to companies being run off Excel spreadsheets. People in the blockchain space don’t know a damn thing about supply chain, and people in the supply chain space don’t know a damned thing about blockchain. There is much intellectual property on both sides that has yet to mesh—we’re still embryonic here.” Flux Protocol, said McClintock, focuses on the intersection of agriculture, blockchain, and IoT. Flux wants to marry the two technologies to be able to prove fair trade and organic status, localize food supply chains, and help growers make decisions like “what seed should you plant in a quickly drying sub-Saharan region that also regenerates topsoil?” In other words, Flux’s work is on the first part of the agricultural supply chain—establishing the provenance, quality, and other attributes of the ag product before it goes on a truck. In response to Manian’s statement the Trusted IoT Alliance was making slow progress in finding go-to-market strategies for blockchain-powered IoT devices, Kirchner drew on his experience sounding out enterprise customers and executives tasked with making technology investments. “My feelings are all driven by what I hear from customers,” said Kirchner. “I’m hearing the problem is that the solutions being presented are great theoretically, but they’re not grounded with operational knowledge of what’s realistic or possible in a business. The biggest thing that factors into any buying decision is if I’m in ‘Company X’ and I’m looking to buy software I have two criteria: is this going to get me promoted, or is this gonna get me fired? When you look at a nascent, unestablished technology with unproven ROI, you have to ask yourself ‘is this worth my career?’” Rempel agreed with Kirchner and spoke from the perspective of an innovation officer determined to integrate the aging, disparate systems being used in the transportation industry. “The value of IoT is there if you can connect, but we’re in an industry where EDI is dominant,” said Rempel. :There aren’t standards around how these big dumb businesses can consume this data. They’re waiting for a single document they’re going to accept and their IT doesn’t have the slightest clue where to integrate the data into their value proposition. These companies have to change how they look at technology and how to implement it without risk.” Manian, looking to advise his alliance’s partners, asked the other panelists a question: “What are the signals going to be that this is the time [for the adoption of a new technology]?” Kirchner pointed out that the simple existence of a better technology did not mean that it would become widely adopted. “A lot of people are still using Microsoft Excel,” Kirchner lamented. “How long have better systems been out than Excel? Blockchain has sparked interest and started the conversation to talk about these things, the first signal that the time is coming—we’re having these conversations.” Eric Rempel also responded to Manian’s question: “My answer is shrinking margins. When you find out in the boardroom that your competitor has a device that increases their margins by 10%, then you get it, then someone else does, then eventually it can reach a tipping point.” McClintock thought that a first mover in supply chain transparency would be enough to create a new consumer expectation. “Once someone opens up their supply chain and becomes transparent, that will become the gold standard,” McClintock said. Rempel was skeptical. “Who’s gonna be the first business to open the kimono? Most of these companies don’t have good enough dashboards to see inside their own businesses. They aren’t data-driven yet, so they don’t even know what’s gonna be exposed.” Manian wrapped up the dialogue by offering an answer to his own question: consumer education. Until people know what’s possible, they will never expect the level of supply chain transparency that blockchain and IoT together can bring. “Consumer education is a potential wedge into this space. You know, some of the members of the alliance have these massive warchests to deploy, and that might be one of the ways they do this, to move the market. It does continue to feel like we’re on the cusp of something big happening, but we’re still just on the cusp.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Distributed, Flux Protocol, Redwood Logistics, Slync, Trusted IoT Alliance, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Paul Hampstead","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-07-23T12:30:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/bitmex-ceo-what-traders-want-what-traders-need","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/04-Bitmex-widgets-1024x468-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BitMEX CEO: what a trader wants, what a trader needs","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"FreightWaves attended Distributed 2018: Unlocking the Global Power of Decentralized Business, the leading enterprise blockchain conference, last week in San Francisco. Arthur Hayes, the charismatic cofounder and CEO of BitMEX, opened Friday’s agenda with a provocative keynote attacking the core premises of decentralized exchanges. BitMEX is the world’s largest and most liquid cryptocurrency exchange. BitMEX is also centralized, meaning that the trading platform and funds deposited are controlled by a corporation; recently, some decentralized exchanges have emerged, controlled by no one in particular, and Hayes questioned whether the problems they purport to solve are issues that crypto traders actually care about. First, a bit of background on Arthur Hayes: he graduated from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania with a BA in Economics in 2008, then moved to Hong Kong to trade equities and derivatives for Deutsche Bank and Citigroup for five years. Hayes is an experienced futures, forwards, and swaps trader, which makes his comments on the ‘first principles’ of trading applicable to many kinds of financial instruments (for example, freight futures). “What are the problems that decentralized exchanges purport to solve, and are these problems things that the market actually cares about?” Hayes began. Hayes went through what he called “the trader’s hierarchy of needs”: first is liquidity, then leverage, then ease of use, then security. Regarding the first and most important need, liquidity, Hayes recalled the early days of his exchange and an early bear run, when the price of bitcoin dropped from about $600 to about $300. “The number one concern was liquidity,” said Hayes. “[Traders asked] how can I get in and out of a position and how much does it cost, and how many people are playing in the sandbox where I am? The number thing people complained about our platform was ‘where is the liquidity?’” Then Hayes discussed how new exchanges trying to compete with incumbents are already at a disadvantage when it comes to liquidity. “If you look at the top 10 [crypto] exchanges, most of them have been around for three to four years,” said Hayes. “Even now, it’s difficult for a new exchange to become successful because of liquidity—if you want to trade, and other exchanges already exist, you don’t think of the #20-1,000 exchanges that claim to have better technology or claim to be more secure; [you think] ‘this exchange moves $1B a day, this one moves $1k a day, where am I gonna go trade?’ The number one concern of traders is liquidity—if you don’t have it you’re already at a massive disadvantage.” “The next thing that a trader cares about is leverage,” Hayes noted. “The most successful exchanges are ones that offer people leverage—whether it’s margin trading or in a derivatives market (futures contracts where we set the initial margin and the maintenance margin). All of the exchanges in the top five have some kind of margin or leverage trading. If you don’t have the two Ls, liquidity and leverage, there’s practically no chance you’ll be successful.” Hayes went on to briefly discuss ease of use, including user interface and user experience, pointing out that the easier it is to acquire volume and trade, the more liquid the exchange will be. Security was really the last thing that traders cared about—no one is going to deposit money into an exchange with very low trading volumes and liquidity even if it supposedly offers superior technology and security. Because security is the last of the trader’s hierarchy of needs, Hayes suggested, traders only have the luxury of caring about security after their liquidity, leverage, and ease of use needs have already been met. Then Hayes turned his attention to emergent decentralized exchanges, called ‘DEXs’ for short. One of the most popular DEXs is IDEX, but there are several, and there’s even a protocol—essentially a primary layer blockchain akin to bitcoin or Ethereum—called 0x designed specifically for decentralized exchanges. “The DEX value proposition,” Hayes said, “is, 1. clients maintain custody of their own funds at all times; 2. all trades happen on a public blockchain and are 100% transparent; and 3. the exchange is decentralized, so in theory it cannot be shut down.” Hayes questioned whether people actually want the responsibility to maintain the integrity of their own wallets and perform due diligence on wallet software, but said that DEXs offer it anyway. Then he said that “some people are uncomfortable with the idea that a centralized exchange maintains control over the record of all the trades, but this has pros and cons… all the public blockchains at the moment are extremely slow compared to a centralized exchange.” “Do traders want slow but transparent trading or fast and centralized trading? They don’t care about the back end as long as their trades get matched, and they own the asset they want to own,” claimed Hayes. Hayes also attacked the notion that decentralized exchanges could not be shut down because they have no one ‘in control’ of the protocol, pointing out that even completely decentralized projects have teams of developers and public faces. “If I’m a regulator and I see there’s people representing themselves on the internet as developers of a particular protocol and people trust them, and that there are these three dudes or gals that I can harass on Twitter or Slack to do something, who are the regulators gonna f—k? These guys—the notion that a decentralized exchange can do whatever they like and escape the wrath of regulators is totally naive,” Hayes alleged. Finally, Hayes disputed the idea that crypto traders are motivated by some kind of crypto-anarchist philosophy and would pursue decentralization for the sake of decentralization. “Most traders don’t give a flying f—-k about the underlying asset they’re trading,” Hayes said as his audience laughed. “Why do people actually want to trade crypto? Volatility—unlike most assets, crypto moves aggressively. Access—holding and trading isn’t only for the wealthy or institutional investors. 24/7 trading—the markets never sleep and you can trade whenever and wherever you like.” Hayes concluded his keynote by saying that at the moment, decentralized exchanges are a novelty and won’t be important for at least five to ten years because in the short and medium term, the problems that DEXs try to solve aren’t problems that traders actually care about.

Meat consumption this year is expected to hit a record, with the U.S. Department of Agriculture expecting an average American to eat 222.2 pounds of red meat and poultry in 2018. As consumption keeps pushing up the ceiling, the technology of growing meat in petri-dishes seems to have gained significant interest. Investors pour in millions into startups working on artificially growing meat, buoyed with the hope of creating a parallel meat economy where food is produced in laboratories rather than farms. Regardless of the storm it is kicking up, lab-grown meat is not commercially available yet, but startups like Just is confident of putting it out in the market by the end of this year. The problem though is the philosophical double take on what till date has never been a problem – the definition of meat. The farm industry that rears animals the traditional way is quite expectedly against lab-grown meat, as it believes that artificially cultured meat cannot be categorized under standardized meat. The tension is palpable in the livestock rearing circle, as the rise of lab-grown meat would quite possibly eat into their market share. In an FDA public meeting last week, the group supporting the cause of farm meat insisted on differentiating it from its lab-grown counterpart, by comparing it to soy-milk produce and the fact that it isn’t equated to regular dairy milk. The caveat in this argument though is that lab-grown meat is considered to look and taste exactly like that of the farm-reared meat, with startups in the space insisting that the nutritional value of the lab-grown meat also cuts parallels with the traditional one. However, to be fair to the consumers, regulations must be set in place for companies to explicitly mention the meat source on the label – laboratory or otherwise – and for restaurants to suggest the same on its menu. Though there is little to worry on the logistics side of the equation with regard to lab-grown meat, there would come a time when the price of cultured meat would be less than that of farm grown meat. And in such a situation, monitoring the supply chain would become critical – especially with meat that is sourced internationally, as businesses could look towards replacing conventional meat sources with laboratories and choose not to put it on the label. Blockchain in food supply chains could be a way through which transparency and visibility are brought into the industry. Blockchain has the potential to account for every party in the meat supply chain and thus can act as an effective deterrent to unacceptable practices. Walmart for instance, has been trying its hand in different blockchain projects which could help it accurately trace products as they cross through different stakeholders in the supply chain before hitting its shelves. FreightWaves recently covered the impact of cultured meat on the transportation industry, which stands to lose out on a bulk of its freight once this becomes a reality. The Transportation Research Board claims that agricultural products account for 31% of the total ton-miles of freight moved. While livestock and poultry do not account for all of the farm products that are hauled on the American highways, it still is a sizeable portion as 95% of the livestock being transported are via trucks. One of the advantages with lab-grown meat is that it can be utilized completely, unlike the meat derived from livestock, where more than half the mass of the slaughtered animal goes to landfill. Then again, the technological advancement in the cultured meat space only allows for the growth of a mass of flesh that is devoid of shape and bone, thus drastically reducing the cuisine variants that could use it as a replacement for farm-grown meat. For instance, grilled ribs made out of lab-grown meat is impossible at the moment, and it could possibly take years for science to figure out a way to grow one. But even then, industries churning out meat en masse in the future is a thought that the transportation industry needs to contend with. If industries could produce readily consumable meat, it would gradually lead to them setting up centers close to cities that consume it in large quantities – leading to a drastic reduction in the miles hauled. Also since lab-grown meat would have next-to-nothing wastage, the load being hauled would also be considerably lesser in the future. This could mean that over the next decade, the freight industry could have a face-off against two adversaries – the rise of autonomous vehicles, and the scope of lab-grown meat.

In yet another example of a blockchain application, which allows secure and immediate, time-stamped distribution of information, this helps with Memphis-based Good Shepherd’s initiatives. Their mission is to retrieve unused medications from cancer patients and make them available to the disadvantaged. “In Tennessee alone, over $10 million worth of perfectly good prescription medication gets flushed down the toilet every year,” Phil Baker, Good Shepherd Pharmacy’s CEO, said. “Blockchain is the solution for that problem. The REMEDI project (REclaiming MEDicine) will divert valuable medication into the hands of patients who would not otherwise use it.” Part of the effort involves the FedEx Institute hosting an community event called Blockchain 901, which specializes in expanding Memphis’ technology workforce. The event that happened last week offered blockchain enthusiasts and professionals the opportunity to connect and discuss the challenges of Good Shepherd’s blockchain resource development program. “One of the most valuable resources universities can provide to the innovation ecosystem is the space to explore new ideas and opportunities in an unrestrained environment,” said Cody Behles, FedEx Institute’s Innovation and Research Support’s assistant director. “Memphis is attracting next-wave startups that recognize that setting up shop in traditional renovation markets like San Francisco is not always the best business decision. We are here to cultivate collaboration through aligned partnerships and amplification or opportunity.” The U of M-FedEx venture is designed to provide well-paying, part-time jobs that give students real-world professional experience. It’s also viewed as a selling point for the U of M’s graduate programs in STEM disciplines and a channel for growing the region’s technology workforce. Dr. Jasbir Dhaliwal, chief innovation officer and graduate school dean at U of M, said in a release: “This initiative is designed to help the University recruit world-class talent from around the nation to its master’s and doctoral programs in the STEM disciplines, which will help grow the regional technical workforce in computer science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analytics and real-time IT algorithms.” Dhaliwal added, “Given the global shortage of talent in these technical areas, these common efforts provide a significant advantage in attracting industries of the future to our region.” University president M. David Rudd said, “We are very thankful for FedEx’s continued overwhelming support and presence on our campuses. The FedEx IT Command Center provides another wonderful venue for our graduate students to not only gain valuable work experience but to earn wages to help make college more affordable.” UMRF Ventures chief executive Tom Kadien added, “This is yet another example of FedEx making a positive difference on our campus and in our community. “These graduate students will have a terrific work experience alongside FedEx professionals, and it will help them secure better jobs in the future.” FreightWaves has covered use cases for blockchain application from tracing food in the complicated supply chain, to the low-tech world of small farmers, to the types of businesses that the future of blockchain will thrive with, to smart contracts and the power of instant settlement, to blockchain’s role in smoothing trade across borders.

To achieve this, the company works closely with the governments and transport associations to implement better policies and technologies by removing regulatory and economic barriers to it. “We have developed software platforms for designing and assessing truck and trailers. In Australia, we have the scheme where we can get vehicle concepts on the road – which are practically longer, heavier truck and trailer combinations outside of prescribed limits,” said Marcus Coleman, Managing Director of Tiger Spider. Tiger Global sets up a performance standard that can be used to assess the vehicle by initially propping up a virtual prototype through computer simulations. The vehicle is modeled by a series of tests to see if the vehicle can navigate traffic effectively, if there is a lower risk of rolling over, and if the vehicle is dynamically stable in the event of it having multiple trailers. In the process of developing the software platform, Tiger Global engages with various manufacturers and component suppliers like axle and suspension, and engine transmission parts – systems that can supply and share their data with truck and trailer OEMs. “These companies would want to protect their IT while being able to share technical information more conveniently which leads to our interest in blockchain,” said Coleman. Coleman contended that blockchain’s possibility of creating an immutable record would be critical to recording and assessing data, making it a vital resource in the development of Tiger Spider’s application. “Another use case that creates a lot of interest in Australia, particularly with the brake system suppliers, is the idea of having genuine replacement parts,” he said. “There are a whole lot of counterfeit parts that are traded and imported from overseas, which can be a safety issue. Customers cannot be aware that they are not buying genuine products – whether it is a brake pad lining or wheel bearing – or any sort of component that you could put on a truck. So, it is interesting to try and stop that using blockchain.” Blockchain as a technology could prove useful across different verticals, believed Coleman. “If you are paying $200 for a kilo of steak in Australia, you would want to get the right thing and not a cheaper version of the Chinese steak. There is motivation there for the purchaser – scan the QR code, check it against the web base and say it is a kosher product for example,” he said. Data standardization is a topic that is making waves across the transportation world, and it is not an exception down under. “In Australia, we get trucks and trailers from all over the world. We have got quite a mixture – we get trucks imported from Europe, U.S., and Japan. I think we are really unique because I think in the U.S., they mainly have U.S. trucks and not too many European manufactured trucks, and the same is true in Europe,” said Coleman. This could lead to issues with different data standards. For example, with data loggers, third-party systems’ interoperability, fleet management systems or telematics, and even with some of the more advanced IT technologies. “You have got a different interpolation with every manufacturing, as there isn’t good consistency between European, American and Japanese trucks,” said Coleman. The idea here is not to reinvent the wheel, but to develop standards that can align well across transportation networks in different countries. Coleman insisted that though standards that are developed in the U.S. and Europe are different, there fundamentally were more similarities than differences. Then again, importing the latest technology to fit on the truck might not be currently feasible in Australia, as the country is in need of certain requirements that could only be met by local suppliers, which ends up rising costs. The answer is to have standards that are consistent and flexible to the local environments, concluded Coleman. “I think we do have very efficient vehicles in Australia and we can help export some of that knowledge to the rest of the world. Having standards in its consistent form and providing flexibility in some of the stuff we do over here, can hopefully open up a similar sort of thinking in other parts of the world,” he said.

BiTA was set up to create a platform for members to discuss and set standards across these projects and the industry. “CargoX has successfully raised significant capital supporting the development of solid ideas into business cases for the documentation in shipping which has eluded the industry for decades and we are proud to welcome them as a member of BiTA,” said Soeren Duvier, managing director of BiTA in Asia. “It is great to see CargoX recognizing the value that BiTA brings to the global transportation industry as well as our increasing community in Asia and expect CargoX to concentrate more activities in the region over time”. CargoX recognized this long before deciding to become part of BiTA, as the company has moved further ahead – their first specialized product, the blockchain-based Smart Bill of Lading (Smart B/L), is production ready, and they receive a lot of interest from each and every segment of the logistics and supply chain industry. The company developed a decentralized platform based on the Ethereum network, and it has a pipeline of future products for the supply chain industry in place to be developed rapidly. Together with insurance companies and banks, CargoX is already actively developing an equivalent to the Letter of Credit and they are also working on Switch Bill of Lading for the conventional cargo shipping industry. They will be building an ecosystem where companies can offer their logistics services freely and accept payment in USD or cryptocurrency equally. Increased levels of trust and historic transaction traceability, based on the nature on blockchain itself, support the vision of such a future for logistics services. “We want to discuss with other partakers how to set standards and jointly revolutionize the logistics and supply chain industry and move forward with the digitalization of the most global industry on the planet, which would benefit all participants in the business ecosystem. “Our CargoX Smart B/L solution is production ready and we are already developing new blockchain-based products for business users. We find the Bill of Lading to be of unrivalled importance in the shipping and logistics industry, which is why we brought the solution to the market with lightning speed. The B/L as a document of title carries the value of the goods shipped; it must be processed safely, quickly, and at the best price possible, without damage or loss, ever – and so do other important documents in the business. This is the vision that we offer to our business customers and partners, and we are focused on proactively building the digital future of logistics,” said Stefan Kukman, CEO and founder of CargoX and someone who has served in the logistics industry for over a decade. Forwarders, NVOCCs, exporters/importers, platforms providing solutions for logistics \u0026 supply chain industries, forwarder alliances and networks, and all companies where sending important documents is part of their workflows will benefit greatly from solutions such as the CargoX Smart B/L. Benefits of the CargoX Smart B/L blockchain solution include, among other things, the highest level of security, as they cannot get lost and are encrypted and securely stored on the blockchain, accessible only with the B/L parties’ private keys. Decentralized storage is resilient to attacks by hackers; costs will be much lower than today, as documents will not be printed and sent with couriers around the globe; documents will be transferred with high speed, as they can be delivered in a matter of minutes, not days or weeks, as currently through courier services; and the whole solution will be much more eco-friendly, as the process is completely paperless and digital. Last, but not least, tracking and storage will be vastly improved. Every transaction of the value-carrying document is traceable on the blockchain and the sequence of events is clearly defined and written on the blockchain. About CargoX Founded in January 2018, CargoX is an independent supplier of digital solutions for logistics and supply chain industries, based on the public blockchain ledger. The company is currently in the phase of launching to the market its Smart Bill of Lading solution for an extremely fast, safe, reliable, and cost-effective way to process Bills of Lading anywhere in the world. The Smart B/L solution utilises the public blockchain for maximum reliability and unmatched trustworthiness to avoid the hassle of issuing and transferring paper documents around the globe, while vastly improving over the existing archaic processes.

On July 3, the Hyperledger project released Hyperledger Fabric 1.2, a new version of the permissioned blockchain infrastructure. Fabric is essentially a software development kit for companies who want to build enterprise blockchains—it doesn’t come with a user-facing component but is meant to be integrated with existing systems. ‘Private data collections’, which were an experimental feature in the 1.1 release, have been made official in this latest Fabric version. Companies participating in a blockchain project based on previous versions of Fabric had to share everything or nothing with their peer nodes. For example, say that a large digital brokerage operates a blockchain network (or ‘channel’, in Fabric’s terminology), with all of its shipper customers, a large number of carriers, and a large number of customers all participating. For any given shipment, the shipper, broker, carrier, and customer all need to be able to see the location of the load. But the broker doesn’t want the carrier to see how much he’s getting to move the shipper’s freight, and the broker also doesn’t want the shipper to see how much he’s paying the carrier. So, while some attributes like geolocation, status, contents, accessorials, etc, might need to be transparent to all parties, crucial details like pricing have to be private to the parties directly involved. Under previous versions of Hyperledger, the broker wouldn’t be able to make some parts of a transaction private and some parts public—he’d either have to share everything with the entire channel or would have to create separate channels for each shipper and carrier so that they would only see the pricing information meant for them. It’s not just about brokers’ margins, although that’s one of the simplest scenarios where some, but not all, details of a transaction need to be shared by multiple parties. Carriers worry about their shipper accounts being taken from them by competing carriers who could see their rates and volumes and undercut them; shippers might be leery of their competitors reverse-engineering their networks and operations based on their truckload contracts. “At every event where I’ve spoken about blockchain,” said Daniel Pickett, FreightWaves’ chief data scientist, “privacy and competitive intelligence was a top concern. There were awkward, kludgey workarounds to these issues before, but the 1.2 release’s private data collections are a simple, elegant solution to this problem. Privacy and competitive intelligence should be much less of an stumbling block for companies wanting to share data on a need-to-know basis, via blockchain.” So when should you use a separate channel and when should you use a private data collection? The Hyperledger 1.2 notes explain: “Use channels when entire transactions (and ledgers) must be kept confidential within a set of organizations that are members of the channel. Use collections when transactions (and ledgers) must be shared among a set of organizations, but when only a subset of those organizations should have access to some (or all) of the data within a transaction. Additionally, since private data is disseminated peer-to-peer rather than via blocks, use private data collections when transaction data must be kept confidential from ordering service nodes.” While the Hyperledger family of blockchain projects was started by the Linux Foundation as an open-source community, large companies like Intel and IBM have devoted significant resources to helping build its tools. IBM has around 60 developers working on Hyperledger projects, a figure that’s grown over time. As interest in blockchain has blossomed over the past few years, hordes of coders have joined in, so IBM’s percentage of contribution relative to the community has actually gone down. FreightWaves spoke to Kathryn Harrison, Director of IBM Blockchain, and Jordan Graft, VP of Payments at TriumphPay, one of the original seven members of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), by phone. “In all our conversations with BiTA members, in the think tanks and working groups, this was the number one issue we saw,” said Graft. “How do you have a truly unmanaged network while still keeping the data private and without having thousands of channels? The IBM-Maersk model did not really have a chance of working in the trucking industry—we don’t have that kind of consolidation. It was really exciting to see this private data collection in the 1.2 release. In our opinion, it’s a huge development. IBM is responding to people and pushing this thing forward. We had lost some faith in an unmanaged blockchain network, but this really opens up that door again,” Graft said. “What we’ve found is that previously in [Fabric] 1.0 and 1.1,” said Harrison, “you had to set up channels for peer to peer interactions, and there were many companies for whom this made sense in order to organize their data. But now, in 1.2, for private interactions, you can actually share data by sharing only the hashes on the blockchain. You can still create channels, you can still have a private ledger, but private data collections just gives you another privacy option depending on each case and how you’re wanting to interact. It is still helping keep data off-chain,” said Harrison. Graft said that IBM’s ground game in encouraging the Fabric community through meet-ups, and developing tools like Composer that make it possible for relatively unsophisticated developers to quickly build blockchain business networks. “We don’t have a multi-million dollar budget for prototyping,” Graft admitted, “so to have this available on Composer is a huge win for us to start working on a prototype.” Harrison said that IBM was laser-focused on simplifying blockchain technology so that businesses could easily implement it. “We’re focused on making Fabric a lot simpler, first and foremost—it gives you a lot more flexibility. Blockchain for enterprise requires a pluggable and modular system in order to work,” Harrison said.

The application which was filed in December 2017 and released by the U.S. Patent \u0026 Trademark Office last week, discusses methods for implementing a distributed ledger system into additive manufacturing, more commonly known as 3D printing. Since time immemorial, manufacturing has largely remained a process that requires copious amount of resources – financial, land, and human capital. But with the concept of 3D printing coming into mainstream contention, manufacturing is no longer a process exclusively reserved to the select few. 3D printers cost a fraction of what conventional machines cost, but still can create molds with high precision and detail. This has led to a situation where anyone with a 3D printer and a design blueprint could turn out products en masse and release it into the market. As the industry does not currently have a certification body that could regulate the quality of products being sold, it gets incredibly hard to handpick the good ones from the rest. The significance of the situation grows when the products in question need to be used as replacement parts in industries. In a well-oiled mechanical process, sabotaging the quality of even a single moving replacement part would bring the whole industry to a halt. GE lists this problem to be one of its primary motives for the patent. “Current systems for additive manufacturing lack verification and validation systems for ensuring that objects produced by the process are appropriately certified. If, for example, a replacement part for an industrial asset is possible to produce via an additive manufacturing process, any user with access to an appropriately configured additive manufacturing device can reproduce the part,” it said in the patent application. “End users who purchase or otherwise receive such a part [have] no way of verifying that a replacement part manufactured in this way was produced using a correct build file, using correct manufacturing media, and on a properly configured additive manufacturing device.” GE proposes to solve this with the help of blockchain and the distributed ledger system, which would keep a record of the historical data on the additive manufacturing process with proper verification and validation of the devices used for 3D printing and the stakeholders who push the product along in the supply chain. GE believes that a tighter leash on the manufacturing process would help reduce counterfeit products and also introduce more transparency and visibility. Then again, the 3D printing world is a pandora’s box waiting to be opened, and the GE patent would serve not just with the validation of mechanical parts, but also with niche manufacturing in segments like healthcare and food. In healthcare, 3D printing is being used to print out bone replacement pieces and even intricate body parts like blood vessels. The food industry is also taking up technology on its kitchen table, using 3D printing as a way to create attractive looking food – looking to appeal both gastronomically and visually to its patrons. This patent has far-reaching consequences and gives GE a headstart into the world of blockchain. So far, the company has been calculated in its approach towards this technology, having filed various blockchain-related patents concerning the aviation industry and has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) – a blockchain consortium looking to create open standards in the transportation and logistics industry.

Moderating the panel was Craig Fuller, the Managing Director of Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), with participants including Simon Kiilerich Vedel, the Digital Product Manager at A.P. Moller – Maersk, Dr. Michael Kuperberg, the Lead Blockchain Architect at Deutsche Bahn AG, and Logan Ryan Golema, CTO at Hercules SEZC. Fuller initiated the conversation by explaining the relevance of transportation in the supply chain, and brought to light the fact that in the Western Hemisphere, 44% of employees in the product business are associated with supply chain and transportation. Nudging the topic of cryptocurrency into the discussion, Fuller brought in the idea of “crypto as a tradable currency” and its ability to proliferate the transportation industry over the next couple of years. “I think from a purely corporate perspective, not much is going on,” said Kiilerich Vedel. “It is fair to say that Maersk is a fairly conservative company. One of our core values is constant care, so that goes into making sure we don’t mess up things for our business. And I think a lot of ideas concern about the maturity or the lack of maturity for the whole infrastructure around crypto. Crypto as such is interesting, and I think there are a lot of opportunities and possibilities for a company like Maersk, but for now, it is not something that we are exploring.” Kiilerich Vedel continued with mentioning the need for established incumbents in the industry to have a startup-like approach to blockchain and the necessity to gauge opportunities with the risks involved on an equal footing. Kuperberg stepped in, explaining the hassles of using cryptocurrency over defined FIAT currencies. “The problem with fluid tradable cryptocurrency system is that it fluctuates with the normal FIAT currency, and so if you are doing real business, you are at risk and could lose money just because the exchange is different from what you planned for,” he said. “However if you look at the essence, it could easily mean that we have a token that is not really tradable but is widely accepted.” Kuperberg went ahead by providing a use case for the Deutsche Bahn to work on by utilizing blockchain – the public transport ticketing system. In Germany, commuters are given the option of buying a day ticket with an option of taking up the tram, S-Bahn, U-Bahn, or the bus to reach their destinations. As different transportation providers run each of these networks, it gets difficult for splitting incomes as these tickets do not record which transportation services were used more often than the others. Deutsche Bahn’s cross-collaboration with IBM on the Hyperledger technology addresses this problem to provide a fair distribution of income, solving a real need through blockchain. On its end Maersk has been collaborating with IBM on a blockchain pilot over a couple of years, trying to reduce some of the barriers to global trade. The shipping major did a field study of how containers with avocado from Kenya were shipped to Europe by micro-monitoring the container movement. The observations gleaned from the study were funneled into the collaborative effort with IBM, which could help fix pain points. “Along the way, we also realized that there are things that we didn’t factor at the beginning – about growing a network, having a network effect, getting the right participants on board – something that is important for us,” said Kiilerich Vedel. “Another thing was to get regulators on board. What we have done so far is that we have a solution in production – it is an API structure that enables all the different participants to integrate their data into a joint data platform [allowing them] access to the data that they submit or somebody else submits within that trade lane.” Kuperberg contended that getting data agreements is essential to the system and he felt it would be complicated in the transportation industry. “The moment you share the data, you also share the data definition, which becomes quite challenging especially if your network is growing. The moment you want to migrate, then it is the usual integration problem, and you need to migrate data in the larger scale,” he said. After largely allowing the conversation to run its course, Fuller interjected by asking Kuperberg if they had worked with Maersk before, to which Kuperberg explained how Deutsche Bahn was different as a company from Maersk and that they probably would not be working together as they do not cut parallels or compete against each other. As the conversation concluded amidst the discussion about companies and their foray into blockchain, one thing did stand out in common – that blockchain as a technology has captivated the collective interests of the transportation ecosystem and that it is here to stay for good.

Armstrong heads the bureau’s virtual-currency initiative, which is about three years old. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer a different set of pros and cons to criminals, when compared with traditional fiat currencies. Incoming and outgoing payments are tied to an ‘address’, which is really just a string of characters and not necessarily to a specific person’s identity, so transactions are more anonymous than a traditional ACH bank transfer. However, compared to physical cash, bitcoin transactions are easily traceable—this is due to the transparency of the distributed ledger the transactions are stored on. This means that while it’s relatively easy to create a map of bitcoin transactions to various addresses, and see how the addresses are interacting with each other, it’s difficult to link up a specific address with a real person or organization. In January of this year, Elliptic and the Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Center on Sanctions \u0026 Illicit Finance released a memorandum titled “Bitcoin Laundering: An Analysis of Illicit Flows into Digital Currency Services.” “While legal opinions differ on whether bitcoins technically constitute money, we assume in this study that when an individual moves bitcoins from an address associated with illicit activity to a new address, in a way that obscures the original source of funds, or cashes out to fiat currency, it indicates the intent to ‘cleanse’ the bitcoins from their illegal origins,” the memo’s authors, Yaya J. Fanusie and Tom Robinson, wrote. “Illicit activity originated overwhelmingly from darknet marketplaces… examples of darknet marketplaces, which became popular sites to buy and sell illegal drugs and a multitude of other illicit items and services, are Silk Road, shut down in 2013, and AlphaBay, shut down in July 2017,” wrote Fanusie and Robinson. Services like cryptocurrency tumblers, or mixers, layer illicit bitcoin transactions with others to obscure the trail back to the funds’ original source. The cryptocurrency Monero actually trades transparency for extreme privacy, seeking to comply with two principles outlined in its white paper: “untraceability: for each incoming transaction all possible senders are equiprobable” and “unlinkability: for any two outgoing transactions it is impossible to prove they were sent to the same person.” Increasingly, criminals are turning to Monero because of the crypto’s unique properties enabling extreme privacy. Bloomberg reported that “the criminal underworld is dropping Bitcoin for another cryptocurrency,” citing a Dec. 18 hack where hundreds of thousands of WordPress sites were hacked and held hostage until the hackers were paid off in Monero. According to the Crypto Pro app, today Monero is the twelfth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization ($2.128B) and traders moved $34.39M worth of the currency during the past 24 hours. Monero also makes “crypto-jacking” more viable, which is a form of theft of computing power. Hackers can use malware to surreptitiously seize control of a computer or group of computers and use them to mine cryptocurrencies without the owner’s permission. Earlier this year, hackers discovered that a particular console controlling access to Tesla’s Amazon Web Services-based cloud was not password protected; they installed scripts based on a popular bitcoin mining protocol, and soon enough Tesla was inadvertently paying to mine bitcoin for hackers. The popular web development application Jenkins had its servers crypto-jacked, and the attackers netted about $3M worth of Monero. Although it might appear that the FBI is beginning a large crackdown on cryptocurrency-related crime, the bureau’s 130 open cases are only a tiny sliver of the investigations currently being pursued. The most popular currency among criminals is still the U.S. dollar, and it’s still hard to compete with cash in terms of untraceability and anonymity.

The industry is bogged down with numerous stakeholders across the system, creating chaos and bringing in standardization would generate immense economic benefits to the country. “Blockchain is going to be the core technology of the logistics and transportation industry in the future – especially replacing EDI, which is now widely used across this industry,” said Dale Huang, CTO of COSCO Network e-Logistics. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is a process that is ubiquitously used across the industry to communicate information electronically, mostly with regard to bill-of-lading and other invoices. Huang added that though EDI is a common standard across the ecosystem, used by shipping companies like COSCO, it is an inefficient and a difficult-to-handle technology. “I believe blockchain is the future for coordination between all the parties in the supply chain industry. This could be used between partners, including the customs officers and the service providers in logistics and shipping, while also using it with customers, receivers, consignees, shippers, and other similar parties,” he said. Huang supported the need for data openness and that parties involved should have a common understanding of the data that can be shared over blockchain. “Data like the container number, the bill of lading number, also the information of the customs officers going through these documents would be useful,” he said. “We need to have a cooperation between the big carriers and the logistics service providers like DHL, FedEx, and Maersk.” The wheels are already in motion. Maersk in association with IBM is pioneering a proof of concept (PoC) in the shipping business and building a platform using blockchain. “Companies have already raised a discussion that suggests the 5-7 biggest shipping carriers work together on a common standardization through blockchain,” said Huang. That being said, Huang believed that blockchain adoption still has a long way to go, and that it is largely in the demonstration and testing stage at the moment. Also as intermodal freight transport hubs increase, he suggested that the standardization should go beyond the shipping industry and venture into the railroads and highways ecosystem. Huang contended that blockchain in logistics should work in phases, with him listing a four-pronged approach. The first stage forms the bedrock to a successful integration of blockchain in the industry – creating a panel which helps with coordination and data sharing, while slowly inching away from complex and inefficient methods like EDI. The second step is about bringing all the processes in the supply chain under the umbrella of blockchain, making track-and-trace easier. “The processes start even before the cargo moves from the origin. The cargo is prepared first, the product that is shipped is understood to make sure there is quality control and to avoid counterfeit products or cargo loss,” said Huang. Having an unfaltering eye on the end-to-end process helps keep the ecosystem clean from bad actors, which has been a persistent problem with delicate supply chains like the food and pharma industry. Once tracing is standardized, the next phase would be to look into insurance. “We need to ensure that the whole process is safe. There might be instances of winds or bad weather where the vessel could face trouble, and we need to ensure that insurance for the cargo lost can be claimed,” said Huang. The final phase is regulating payment processes. Blockchain can vitalize the concept of smart contract to ensure direct payment. This would require connecting with the banking systems and financial organizations, and possibly a revamp of how traditional supply chain financials work. Huang mentioned that COSCO is serious in its blockchain endeavors and is planning to work together with the different arms of the company – like COSCO Shipping Lines and COSCO Logistics – to create a smart shipping project that includes big data and blockchain. All said and done, regulating the path of blockchain in the logistics industry should be a collective responsibility. While blockchain is being pushed as a solution to the data incompatibility issues in the industry, it is crucial to understand the harm that proprietary systems could create – the need is not just about creating data standards, but also to make sure it remains open to everyone.

Companies have scurried across creating altcoins – the alternatives to Bitcoin – in a mad race to capture the digital currency market, which to an extent looks like the 21st century California Gold Rush. As blockchain started captivating the attention of potential investors, businesses started to branch out from initial public offerings (IPOs) to creating initial coin offerings (ICOs) doling out tokens which acted as the stock of the company. ICOs work quite like the IPOs, but instead of public stocks, it creates cryptocurrency tokens, that would be sold to investors in return for a FIAT currency or an established virtual currency (like Bitcoin). Companies creating an ICO campaign would initially publish a white paper, listing what the project is about, and the amount to be raised to complete the project. There has been a lot of confusion with regard to regulations on ICOs, and Jay Clayton, the chairman of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) went on CNBC to insist that the selling of security-like tokens in an ICO must obey the rule of law. “If you have an ICO or a stock, and you want to sell it in a private placement, follow the private placement rules,” he said. “If you want to do any IPO with a token, come see us, file financial statements, file disclosure, take the responsibility that our laws require, and we are happy to help you do that public offering.” But the definitions surrounding a token is still hazy, as it is not very clear when a cryptocurrency token would be considered a security. Clayton cleared it up by explaining what constitutes a token that acts as security. “A token, a digital asset, where I give you my money and you go off and make a venture, and in return for giving you my money I say ‘you can get a return’ that is a security and we regulate that,” he said. “We regulate the offering of that security and regulate the trading of that security.” Thus in the eyes of the SEC, this would mean that a lot of ICOs would fall under the realm of securities. Then again, Clayton refused to comment on specific crypto assets like XRP of Ripple Labs or Ether of Ethereum, if they would count as security. What he kept insisting though was that the SEC would not go against the tide and try changing the traditional definition of securities to suit the cryptocurrency debate. But as the cryptocurrency market is seeing a growth explosion every year, it is imperative to clearly see the divide on the type of coins that fall under securities. For instance, Ripple Labs has been under fire lately, being sued by an investor who claims to have incurred losses while trading XRP coins – the cryptocurrency token offering of Ripple Labs – accusing the company of violating federal and state securities laws. In defense, Ripple Labs argues that the XRP should not be classified under security, but also maintains that the SEC should be the final authority on the decision. The solution to this predicament rests in the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, that outline the government’s view towards financial regulation. The “Howey Test” of 1946 constituted by the U.S. Supreme Court has been used to determine the type of transaction that can be considered as an investment contract. It classifies a security as an investment of money in a common enterprise in which the investor expects profits mainly from the efforts of others. Though the SEC is treading carefully on the cryptocurrency turf, it does not plan to ban the ICO method of fundraising, which was clarified by Robert Jackson, the Commissioner of SEC. The agency is wary of pump-and-dump schemes that are particularly common in ICOs, and declaring every ICO as a security would help dissuade bad actors from taking advantage of what still remains to be a largely unregulated system.

The trouble lies in figuring out an exact process through which blockchain could be adopted without causing a splash in the organizational setup in place. A recent SAP study showed that 92% of all its survey respondents held a favorable view towards blockchain, but a measly 3% of them were actually using blockchain in production today. The gap between the ‘interested’ and the ‘doers’ is ostensible, and to bridge the divide requires a precise definition of the value blockchain could bring to a business – possibly in terms of growth, visibility, and transparency. In light of this, SAP announced today that it plans to expand its SAP Leonardo Blockchain solutions to create immediate business value for its customers. “When it comes to blockchain, there are a few things to consider. One is technology, which helps us to create blockchain related applications. The other thing that we need to consider, and what is often overlooked, is the existing co-application that the company already has,” said Torsten Zube, VP and Head of Blockchain at SAP. “It doesn’t make sense to create something when the company has existing processes, applications and solutions already in place.” SAP looks to provide its customers an environment where they can innovate and brainstorm ideas on how they would like to participate in a business network, and what would be required from their side to expand the existing applications. “It is not just about sharing data on blockchain, but you would also have to connect it to the real world businesses,” said Zube. The SAP Cloud Platform Blockchain is a blockchain-as-a-service, which empowers its clients and partners to make blockchain actionable and beneficial to their business. “We have introduced a blockchain co-innovation program with 65 customers participating in it, where we leverage the ecosystem to identify certain interests they have – the sweet spots – and try adding value to it,” said Zube. This has led to businesses to use blockchain across different segments of manufacturing and supply chain, in industries like transportation, food, and pharmaceuticals. In a move without precedence, U.S. sausage maker Johnsonville LLC is using blockchain to trace the origin of products across the supply chain, increasing transparency and providing visibility from farm-to-fork. The company is now equipping its customers with enterprise related blockchain consortiums Hyperledger Fabric and MultiChain, which would let customers “tailor their blockchain solutions to their specific business needs,” according to Zube. “We deeply believe in a technology-agnostic approach and therefore plan to provide even more blockchain technologies on SAP Cloud Platform Blockchain in the future to ensure our offering always meets our customers’ changing requirements.” SAP has launched the SAP HANA Blockchain service, which makes data management easy by providing a unified view on all transactional enterprise data, irrespective of where the data resides – be it in the core systems or in the blockchain itself. This allows businesses to develop applications on top of the database technology, without worrying about the underlying complexities that come with creating multiple blockchain based systems and networks. Zube spoke about three steps to cementing blockchain in the mainstream rhetoric – developing technology to enable the ecosystem to leverage blockchain capability, a clear commitment to working as a group and extending blockchain capability, and finally to innovate together by creating a consortium and further helping develop blockchain use-cases. In this regard, SAP has launched a global blockchain consortium with Airbus, Amkor, FLEX, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Intel Corporation, and UPS being the initial founding members. The consortium looks to push for open industry standards, drive technology-agnostic business networks, and lead the conversation on topics like data sharing governance and approaches for specific industry.

By late April, FreightWaves covered the outbreak update considering the issue through the lens of how blockchain technology could help tackle the complex “farm to table,” supply chain issue. Turns out, of blockchain’s many potential (and developing) applications, few could be as game-changing as what it would mean for the food industry. The FDA is investigating a multistate outbreak of E. coli O157:H7 illnesses linked to romaine lettuce sourced from the winter growing areas in and around the Yuma growing region. The product is no longer being harvested or distributed from this area, and it is unlikely that any romaine lettuce from the Yuma growing region is still available in stores or restaurants due to its 21-day shelf life. The CDC reports that 172 people in 32 states became ill. These people reported becoming ill in the time period of March 13, 2018 to May 2, 2018. There were 75 reported hospitalizations and one death.  The FDA has identified Harrison Farms of Yuma, Arizona, as the grower and sole source of the whole-head romaine lettuce that sickened several people in an Alaskan correctional facility, but has not determined where in the supply chain the contamination occurred. One of the main issues is that the traceback investigation indicates this outbreak cannot be explained by a single grower, harvester, processor, or distributor. While traceback continues, the FDA will focus on trying to identify factors that contributed to contamination of romaine across multiple supply chains. The agency is examining all possibilities, including that contamination may have occurred at any point along the growing, harvesting, packaging, and distribution chain before reaching consumers. The FDA says it is continuing to investigate the outbreak and will share more information as it becomes available. It’s only a matter of time before the next outbreak occurs. There was another similar (but not related outbreak last November that lasted through December 2017) also linked to leafy greens consumption. These are only the bigger ones that the media widely reports on. According to the L.A. Times’ Geoffrey Mohan, food-borne illnesses break out around 900 times a year. “Each time, investigators have to work their way backward, one link at a time, from victims to fields, tracing multiple paths across separate companies and sometimes across international borders,” he writes. Also, if safety issues don’t get our unilateral attention, perhaps simple economics will. The Pew Charitable Trust research center reports that acute foodborne illnesses cost the United States an estimated $152 billion per year in healthcare, workplace and other economic losses, according to a report published today by the Produce Safety Project (PSP). First, the need for a breakthrough technology in the food supply chain space is urgent enough for health reasons, but it also meets all five of Paul Brody’s criteria for blockchain viability. Brody of Ernst and Young (EY) has been working on blockchain since the very earliest IBM development in 1995. If you answer “yes” to only three of the criteria, you could probably use a blockchain solution: (1) Are there multiple parties in this ecosystem? (2) Is it establishing trust between all the parties and issue? (3) Are we securing the ownership or management of a finite resource? (4) Do all the parties need to work with shared, complex business logic? (5) Does the process depend on an extended business network? The need is there, but is the technology ready? Brody suggests it’s closer than we may think. People think we’re in the early stages of blockchain, Brody says, but we’re past that stage. We’re entering the beginnings of adoption and maturity. “Today there are private blockchains and solutions, tactical ROI, driven by industry leaders and evolving ecosystems. Tomorrow is going to be public networks, general purpose transactions, open to all with dynamic ecosystems,” he says, speaking at the Transparency18 event in Atlanta last week. After our article last month, FreightWaves spoke with a number of blockchain startups, and the general message is that providing solutions in the food supply chain space is its very complexity—ironically part of the very reason for a blockchain solution. It seems that a number of smaller players are in the game of developing smaller, private blockchains where the data points (or nodes) are important and necessary, but also far less complex. Often, too, these companies may work with an IoT company to deepen their coordination and bolster their scalability. They’re just nowhere near being able to handle the potential dozens and, even in some cases, hundreds, of transaction points. So, it seems for now it’s the biggest players who are breaking the most ground. “I often describe that as food traceability at the speed of thought—as quickly as you can think it, we can know it,” said Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety for Walmart, which is scaling up an IBM-driven pilot blockchain that already includes top suppliers such as Unilever, Nestle and Danone. Not long ago, Yiannas, who is in charge of the integrity of food in Walmart’s $280-billion grocery empire, would have brushed off the notion of an instantly “knowable” and verifiable food chain as fantasy. Walmart brought blockchain technology to the forefront now two times. First, by conducting the pork trial in China in 2016, and second with sliced mangoes in 2017 with IBM, Dole, and Driscoll. It has now formed the Blockchain Food Safety Alliance with IBM, JD.com and the Tsinghu University National Engineering Laboratory for E-Commerce to develop standards and partnerships to enable a food safety ecosystem, and to create a standards-based method of collecting data about the origin, safety and authenticity of food. Farm origination details, batch numbers, factory and processing data, expiration dates, and shipping details are digitally connecte–within at least two seconds–to food items and entered into the blockchain at each step. Cargill will soon offer consumers Honeysuckle White turkeys produced by family farmers. In select markets, consumers will be able to text or enter an on-package code to access the farm’s location (by state and county), view the family farm story, see photos from the farm, and read a message from the farmer, according to Meat + Poultry. In other words, “it’s all happening.” Just maybe not as fast as everyone hopes. While blockchain runs the gambit from enthusiasts who believe their digital crypotech is going to take over the world to finding some 187 things blockchain is supposed to fix, it also has plenty of skeptics who just refuse to believe the hype. It’s easy to get lost in the hype, no doubt. At the same time, however, there are sober, driven, productive teams all over the world proactively seeking real solutions in some of the most viable spaces that desperately need the transformation. From the 35,000-foot view, few spaces are more ripe for innovation than the trade and logistics one. It just takes a slightly closer look to see how much more productive, efficient, and, yes, safe, our food industry will be once a widely accepted public blockchain is among us. \u003cbr /\u003e Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain, blockchain standards, Cargill, food, food safety, food supply chain, Walmart, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-30T18:46:08-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/tranzlogix-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tranzlogixbitamember-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Tranzlogix joins BiTA","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Tranzlogix has reshaped the way companies can leverage telematics and IoT (Internet of Things) towards transportation visibility and related optimization. Tranzlogix is leading the digital transformation around “track and trace” into responsive logistics for the stakeholders by leveraging the power of seamless integration and connectivity. Tranzlogix’s roadmap starts with the US footprint and later will expand through the Middle East, Asia Pacific, India and beyond. The company announced it has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance. Currently Tranzlogix Solutions (TLX) specializes in provisioning ELD (electronic logging device) through its unique marketplace. With the ELD mandate now law, Tranzlogix is utilizing the opportunity to engage stakeholders starting within the highly fragmented transport carriers segment towards IoT-based asset tracking, integration and maintenance services. Tranzlogix was founded in 2012 by four industry veterans supported by executive board members and advisors having more than 3 decades of running commercial trucking companies as well as 3PL operations. It believes its integrated ELD marketplace (www.eldmarketplace.com), with its unique positioning, is a natural fit to bring the fragmented transport carriers together with the objective to reduce the dwell time of trucking companies that directly contributes to the top line revenue. Tranzlogix Solutions, LLC is incorporated in the state of Georgia, USA. www.tranzlogix.com There is value in consensus-driven, distributed databases in terms of accountability, corporate social responsibility and above all process efficacy for shippers, carriers, brokers and technology integrators in Tranzlogix solutions both in the US and worldwide. The company has been integrators of technology since its inception and sees a lot of opportunities that blockchain would provide to the stakeholders of the transportation and logistics industry. As the global economy is predominantly debt-based, Tranzlogix solutions would provide exciting possibilities to introduce avenues for existing and new debt instruments (letter of credit, discounting invoices, factoring etc) thereby playing a valued role in the revival of the economy globally. “We are excited to welcome Tranzlogix Solutions into the Blockchain in Transport Alliance,” said Chris Burruss, President of BiTA. “The goals of BiTA to develop market standards for blockchain use and create a community forum for discussions around cross-industry technology standards will only be achieved through the diverse membership of the Alliance working together. That includes brokers, carriers, shippers and technology providers as well as leading companies such as Tranzlogix Solutions whose Integrated Internet of Things (IIoT) tools help make business transactions run smoothly on a regular basis. We look forward to learning from the expertise Tranzlogix Solutions can offer the members of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance.” “With a decade long experience gained in running a boutique trucking company connecting major backbone routes and five states in South India all the way from Kanyakumari to Gujarat over a decade, as well as with the opportunity to be part of similar operation in the USA for an year, made me think to do something to change the hardship of the transportation community,” said Justifus Asir, CEO of Tranzlogix, which led his long journey of building strong integration in handling massive complex event processing engines for Insurance sector, Oil and Gas and fresh produce domain. He sees massive opportunities for distributed computing from his experience in Data integration with agnostic devices (location, engine diagnostics, fuel, temperature, audio, video stream etc.) Tranzlogix Solutions joins the ranks of leading logistics and technology players such as United Postal Service (UPS), FedEx, and SAP within the BiTA. About BiTA Founded in August of 2017, BiTA promotes the development and adoption of blockchain applications in the trucking, transportation and logistics industries, including establishing industry-wide standards.

The Transparency18 panel in Atlanta was focused on what was called the “micro-carrier.” Kenny Long, the president of Patriot Star—a carrier and broker who said he generated a great deal of his business off Facebook trucking connections–said he finds himself “between a rock and a hard place.” Patriot is a 20-truck fleet. Long said there are software companies that specialize in fleets with 1-5 trucks, with fleet-wide systems covering bigger companies. But for his size firm, it’s a challenge. A recent switch in transportation management software began with quotes from suppliers of $100,000, while others said, “great, perfect, we work with startup companies” and would quote a system for $5,000. “We did find a system,” Long said, but it is cloud-based and, as he said, “lacks some options.” “The software options become limited for the money,” he said. “What is happening is that you get multiple little systems and they all do different tasks.” Without these systems speaking to each other, it creates extra work to drive efficiencies out of them. Long on two occasions during the panel noted the prospect of blockchain technology as a way of bridging that gap. “There is still not a perfect solution out there, but I found the best solution for me at this time,” Long said. “I hope that in 3-5 years, there will be a better solution.” Peter Emahiser, the CEO of Tadmore Transportation, a freight brokerage company based in Toledo, said technical progress can be made, but it won’t have its most extensive impact “until we help the little guy.” Rod Nofziger, the COO of independent driver trade group OOIDA, and the moderator of the panel, said the companies developing software are a factor in the development of such products. “I get calls from software companies whose knowledge of the industry comes from bigger companies,” Nofziger said. The companies supplying information to the software developers have “needs that are going to be dramatically different” from the micro carriers. There was a clear discomfort among the panelists for brokerage-like solutions that automatically match driver and load. There was skepticism whether these applications would ever truly launch; Chad Boblett, a panel member and the owner of Boblett Brothers LLC, said the “pattern I see with technology is that it never seems to get off the ground.” Emahiser worried about such solutions employing surge pricing, like that sound on Uber, where an algorithm can survey supply and demand and suddenly set a higher price. “Can you imagine going to your customer when the price is suddenly two and a half times higher than it was?” he said. “An app is a great idea when you have an abundance of freight, but what about when there aren’t enough trucks?” As a driver, Boblett said he is not impressed with load boards based strictly on their volume. “I want to see what has happened in the last 30 minutes,” he said. “I want to see the first 30 loads the broker has.” Boblett sketched out an app that would allow a broker like Emahiser to see his preferred drivers, rather than just pull from the universe of everybody using the app in a certain geographic area. “He doesn’t want to show it to 300 people in the area,” Boblett said. But that isn’t a putdown of technology, Boblett indicated. “That is where point and click comes into play,” he said. “I hope load boards become smarter.” Long said in his brokerage business, he tries to steer drivers away from load boards that are attractive just by sheer dint of big volume. “If you don’t know the market, you can’t get the most competitive price on loads,” Long said. “It’s the rate information, it’s the lane information, it’s the hot markets and all the other stuff you should consider before you start looking at the loads. Because if you don’t know what the market is, you can’t give a competitive price.” And that information is not likely to come just from a digital brokerage app with no human input, Long suggested. Emahiser spoke about an incident immediately after Christmas where his company rolled up their sleeves and met the needs of some shippers trying to move product with snow as an issue. “That sort of relationship is what you should trust first,” he said, questioning conventional wisdom on how fast the transition from human input to app-driven brokerage would take to complete.","TAGS":"OOIDA, Small fleets, Transparency, Trucking technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Kingston","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-26T05:08:13-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/shipchain-cease-and-desist","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_764004589.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain and logistics startup ShipChain hit with cease-and-desist order","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The blockchain and logistics startup ShipChain received a cease-and-desist order from the South Carolina Office of the Attorney General, Securities Division. The order was signed on May 21 by Assistant Attorney General Taylor Faw, who requested its issue and is working under the authority of Alan Wilson, the state’s Attorney General and Securities Commissioner. ShipChain promised a fully integrated end-to-end logistics platform that offers realtime visibility into shipments federated in “trustless, transparent blockchain contracts” powered by SHIP cryptocurrency tokens. The cease-and-desist order relates to ShipChain’s failure to register as a security broker in South Carolina and its issuance of SHIP tokens. ShipChain had planned an initial coin offering (ICO), but sold out its $30M offering of SHIP tokens by January 6, 2018, when the pre-sale to accredited investors ended. While ShipChain is a Delaware-based corporation, CEO John Monarch graduated from Clemson University, founded previous logistics businesses in South Carolina, and allegedly pitched SHIP as an investment opportunity to South Carolina residents at events in the state. ShipChain responded to the order in an official statement: “The order refers to ShipChain’s issuance of its “SHIP” tokens. SHIPs are blockchain tokens that are one means of enabling transactions on ShipChain’s award-winning, innovative logistics platform. ShipChain does not believe that the tokens are securities.” There have been inklings that all was not as it seemed at ShipChain. Reddit users YoungGentilhomme and waynekenoff1234 said they were banned from ShipChain’s Telegram for asking questions about the company’s revenue model. The ShipChain subreddit appears to be moderated in a somewhat heavy-handed fashion: redditors who asked questions about the company’s elaborate, intrusive know-your-customer requirements—which, as they pointed out, could be monetized by the company’s team of former online marketers—were berated and systematically downvoted. In a statement to FreightWaves, Shipchain wrote, “ShipChain strongly believes in protecting the privacy of its contributors and has never—and will never—sell or monetize user information. ShipChain requests extensive information about contributors in order to verify their identities and meet the most stringent security standards.” Even as /r/ShipChain mods, including shipchain_sam (Sami Rusani, the Chief Revenue Officer, an LA-based talent manager), sought to carefully control any critical conversations about the ShipChain project, the company tolerated misinformation on its subreddit, as long as it was favorable. Pro-ShipChain accounts made comments claiming that a multi-million dollar South Carolina defamation suit against ShipChain CEO John Monarch was already settled, but the case’s docket, searchable on the Greeneville County Court’s website, is still open. The last filing was on May 18th. FreightWaves spoke by phone to Richard Gorman, the plaintiff in the case, who says he expects to go to trial this summer. The defamation suit against Monarch stems from allegations that he and a former business partner launched a systematic internet whisper campaign against their competitor in the online marketing space, Richard Gorman, which included directing Gorman’s customers to pseudonymous internet posts accusing Gorman of sex crimes against minors. The case has been pending for years. Gorman’s suit alleges that Monarch demanded Gorman pay him $500,000 worth of bitcoin to remove the material; after a court entered a $3.1M judgment against Monarch’s co-defendant Karl Steinborn, Steinborn committed suicide in a Las Vegas hotel. Monarch’s other less-than-admirable business practices include a South Carolina ‘logistics company’ called Direct Outbound that participated in shady ‘free trial’ marketing and shipped samples of skin creams to women, charging their credit cards hundreds of dollars in some cases if the samples weren’t promptly returned. Monarch also built up a for-hire chargeback dispute business in order to tie up his customers’ numerous refund requests.

Tapscott is the co-founder and executive chairman at the Blockchain Research Institute and the author of The Blockchain Revolution: how the technology behind bitcoin is changing money, business, and the world (2017, 2nd ed. 2018), as well as many other books about technology and business. Tapscott began his talk with a nod to the theme of the conference. “Transparency is a powerful new force for good; sunlight is the best disinfectant. You want to get naked as a company, and when you’re naked, well, fitness is no longer optional,” he said. “We noticed that when you open up supply chains and make things more transparent, a lot of good things happen: you reduce the number of lawyers, you speed up the metabolism of the supply chain, and you reduce the error rate,” Tapscott continued. Freight logistics and supply chains are about to undergo a fundamental, technology-driven transformation, Tapscott claimed. He said that the industry has already applied several layers of technology, from EDIs to the internet, but these have really just automated existing processes without changing the underlying structure of companies or the way they operate. Tapscott called for the advent of the ‘fourth industrial revolution,’ which builds on the digital advances of the past few decades to further integrate technology into human societies and bodies. “Technologies of the fourth industrial revolution include machine learning, animating the physical world, autonomous vehicles, distributed energy, technology in our bodies, virtual reality, and drones and robotics,” Tapscott said. “But the foundational technology of the fourth industrial revolution is the technology underlying cryptocurrency: blockchain.” “So far, we’ve had the internet of information and been able to share things like photos, websites, .pdf files, documents, PowerPoint slides, and voice recordings. But on the internet of information, we aren’t sharing things in themselves, but copies. We’re going to transition to an internet of value, where we’re moving actual assets around, like money, coupons, loyalty points, carbon credits, intellectual property, art, bonds, stocks, and even things like votes and our very identities,” Tapscott forecasted. But how will this fundamentally change businesses? Tapscott said that the largest, wealthiest corporations in the world have grown in size and power due to the asymmetric capturing of information—Facebook knows more about your personality and habits than you do; your bank knows where you spend money; if you have a GPS-enabled iPhone, Apple knows exactly where you go every single day. A blockchain-driven economy has the potential to return the control, management, and monetization of that data back into the hands of the entities that create it, whether they’re individual people or small businesses. “We think blockchain is leading to a change in the nature of the firm, in its deep architecture: by moving assets around in this decentralized way, companies and industries are going to look more like networks, and that has profound implications or this audience,” said Tapscott. Even the nature of corporate competition may change, as enterprises realize they have more to gain from distributing data and encouraging the flow of digital assets than siloing and hoarding them. Tapscott said that Turing-complete smart contracts will even allow machines to interact with each other, identifying opportunities, negotiating contracts, and settling payments. “When that lightbulb over there purchases power from a distributed electrical grid, its reputation as trusted lightbulb will be enhanced,” Tapscott prophesied. But to truly realize the potential of blockchain, corporate leaders will have to rise to the occasion. “Paradigm shifts involve dislocation, conflict, confusion, uncertainty. New paradigms are nearly always received with coolness, even mockery or hostility. Those with vested interests fight the change. The shift demands such a different view of things that established leaders are often last to be won over, if at all,” Tapscott concluded.

The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.” The future economy will be much more decentralized, emphasized Bettina Warburg at her keynote address at Transparency18 in Atlanta on Wednesday. “The stories of the possibilities of the future are amazing, but what they fail to do is to understand what is happening underneath. What is happening with our economies basic infrastructure,” said Warburg. From our early days, our value of exchange was one-to-one because our societies were much smaller. It gave us more certainty in our transactions. But with the rising uncertainty in our transactions, we invented institutions. Rules and protocols to allow us to do business with each other at greater scale and with trust. Eventually, we’ve created these online institutions to help us scale the transactions. Now, with blockchain we can scale in a whole new way while lowering uncertainty even more. “Lowering uncertainty expands our ability to trade,” said Warburg. “We hear a lot about blockchain, but it’s hard to visualize,” she said. Warburg likes to compare it to a checkbook for a visual aid. You keeping up with your transactions in the back of your own checkbook. A record of a chain of transactions. We’re basically holding it in a peer-to-peer network now. It’s decentralized, and we’re able to record transactions over time. How did the internet evolve? “First, we had all these intranets. We’re sort of seeing the same thing happen in the blockchain space. We have the Ethereum network and public blockchains, but we have a lot of scoped private blockchains,” said Warburg. As blockchain’s evolved we’ve seen it expand beyond Bitcoin. We’re starting to see it as an internet of blockchains. Blockchains that can interconnect. Modern-day blockchains are global, decentralized, virtual computers. “That’s what I’m wanting you to really focus on here today,” she said. Blockchain is really quite different than the traditional triangle application. Part of the reason why it’s different is the idea of a smart contract. The transaction revolves both ways. What’s innovative in terms of smart contracts is to automate business logic and therefore governance. The rules can be executed by computers. “Lowering uncertainty expands our ability to trade.” All of this may sound way off in the future, so Warburg takes us a level deeper. Everything has a supply chain if you think about it. How we make, design, and deliver is changing. All of the products through supply chains are facing these decentralized changes. “At Animal Ventures we believe we’re entering a golden age of supply chain innovation,” she said. “It’s this story of trade that’s going to change the most.” We’re already getting better with our smart algorithms. We have a lot more data. We’re gathering from machines things like maintaining our network state, automated, executed, and intelligent decision-making. Actually, the weakest element is the foundation of these three things: maintaining the shared reality, and that’s what blockchain will do. “We need an autonomous network state. It will enable what we can ‘machine trust.\u0027” We’re literally inventing an infrastructure to write rules for machines and execute them for protocols. “So how do we get from survive to thrive?” What are some of the inevitabilities of some of the technologies we’re seeing? “To us, it means how do humans, machines, and organizational forms work together. What will drive value creation in the future?” “We all need to be a little more like Leonardo da Vinci who was an artist and a scientist,” she said. “Like his flying machine. We need to use technologies to design faster. We can simulate our supply chains and test and learn from them. That should be each and every one of our goals.” After her talk, Warburg invited Slync CEO, Chris Kirchner, on stage for a further conversation. One of the aspects they discussed is how companies need to see themselves in a cooperative way even while being in competition. Also, they touched on the challenge of discussing blockchain when it’s such a non-visual thing, and on how there needs to be space for the crypto zealots, as well as for auditing and governance issues. In terms of a timeline, and how long we’re looking at when blockchain will be a big part of our lives? Warburg began with a quote. It’s called Amara’s Law. “We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.” She followed by saying, “It’s a ten-year horizon. There’s issues and constraints that need to be solved for us.” She also quoted Steve Jobs who once said, “Technology should either be beautiful or invisible.” And that’s likely how blockchain will be.

Demo Day featured 4 sessions of 7-minute presentations by companies with new or innovative products to offer. The final session featured a blockchain solution as well a smart trailer platform and innovative freight matching offering. Companies presenting in the final session were Logistics Exchange, Lanehub, Fleet Locate by Spireon, OnCommand Connection, Phillip Connect Technologies, HCL, Intelligent Audit, Big Road Freight by Fleet Complete, Transflo and CargoChain. Logistics Exchange Logistics Exchange kicked off the session, showing how it was working to identify contract freight and connect carriers and shippers along lanes. Using machine learning, the Logistics Exchange platform helps find contract loads along lanes and identify a baseline of loads that move along that lane. It then matches those loads with carriers, helping connect shippers to possible carrier partners. The shipper and carrier can enter into a contract. As many know, contracts are often broken, but in the case of Logistics Exchange’s platform, that is not a problem. In fact, the platform makes it easy break that contract by developing “trading rules” which govern the exchange. When that happens, the load or capacity is entered back into the freight marketplace where it can be scooped up by another carrier or shipper. The company says that this kind of forward-looking solution that shows contract freight visibility can help identify rates and potential capacity along a lane. It can also help identify backhaul opportunities that open up. Lane Hub Lane Hub says it is not a spot market platform, but rather focused on matching contract lanes. The platform aims to identify how a carrier’s lane matches with other carriers hauling along that lane. It pairs potential matches along that lane that can help a carrier fill their trailer. Those matches help identify freight that is moving along the lane and can tell a carrier whether that freight might be available to move by partnering with another carrier or shipper. It can be especially useful for a private or dedicated operation that may be looking for backhaul or trihaul opportunities to boost revenue and reduce empty miles. Fleets can visit a partner page that displays potential opportunities, including lanes, type of load and volume. A carrier’s information is private until it makes a partner. There is also a “matches” page that allows a carrier to enter their own information and compare it to a benchmark. Also, volume and cost savings potential through partnerships are displayed. Fleet Locate by Spireon Fleet Locate by Spireon is a relatively new offering to the industry. The trailer and asset intelligence company will be offering a new Intelliscan cargo sensor solution in the next 60 days that uses lasers mounted 30 inches off the floor of the trailer to identify trailer capacity. The laser array, combined with a camera, can offer 99.9% accuracy of whether there is any cargo in the trailer. It can also provide a capacity percentage of the trailer to help LTL carriers identify available space to pickup additional cargo, or to adjust their linehaul rates. Spireon now has 200,000 trailers running its intelligence solutions, which started initially as a trailer mileage program 7 years ago. OnCommand Connection OnCommand Connection is an open-sourced vehicle diagnostics platform that currently features over 470,000 active vehicles. The dashboard provides a scorecard that offers trending analysis on items such as idle miles, braking, acceleration events and fault code warnings. Other data points can allow a fleet manager to search by vehicle type, make or model. Because it is open-source, OnCommand Connection can be used on any vehicle. Also included is a Fault Code Action Plan solutions that provides a summary of fault codes, recommended actions, whether parts are needed and which dealership may be best to take the vehicle to based on parts availability and location of the vehicle. Phillips Connect Technologies Phillips Connect Technologies has brought to market an innovative “smart trailer system.” The system is based on universal sensors that can collect data from virtually any sensor located on a trailer. The result is a wealth of data previously unavailable to fleets. The Phillip system collects information such as dwell time, utilization (including average loaded miles, miles and operating hours per day), and availability of trailers within the fleet. Overlaid on maps and through a dashboard, fleet managers can make more informed decisions regarding trailer usage. The system is GPS accurate within 2 feet said Gerry Mead, executive director of innovation. It can also collect data and report on loaded/unloaded, idle time, coupled and uncoupled, reported issues and maintenance issues with the trailer. There is even the ability for it to utilize sensors to test brakes and lights and report on tire conditions, all among the most common CSA violations. Alerts can be sent directly to managers. “We’re a lot more than a telematics company, we’re a smart trailer company,” Mead said. HCL HCL is a blockchain-based supply chain track and trace company that turns shipping documents into digital documents that it helps usher through the blockchain. The company presented a video showing a basic example of a food product moving through the supply chain and how its CoTrust technology assists in that process. CoTrust can recommend APIs and apps to use based on the transactions entered into the blockchain. It also will translate EDI data into a common language that is accessible through the blockchain. Once a shipment is initiative, CoTrust will send alerts to parties that need to be involved with the transaction and offer those participants the opportunity to build their own resources to manage the process or use shared resources. All the data is captured and searchable and because it is recorded in blockchain, it offers irrefutable proof of the integrity of the process. Intelligent Audit Intelligent Audit offers freight audit and payment solutions, with a key function the ability to standardize data so manager can compare apples to apples. It’s dashboard and platform offer several tabs that allows managers to drill down into more details on transactions. These categories include shipping performance, a shipping heat map, billing charges, billing summary, delivery exceptions and a claims center. The company has just introduced a nee Intellichain tab that provides detailed and audited invoice data on the hyperledger blockchain. This information includes how many days invoices are outstanding and how many days each party involved in the transaction has the invoice all while allowing all users to see what is happening in the process. Within a smart contract, the system will also automatically execute changes to the contract, such as rate changes, and notify all parties to receive approval. There is also a Rating dashboard that helps identify disputes and what may be causing them. Big Road Freight by Fleet Complete Big Road Freight is Fleet Complete’s load finding solution that is embedded within its ELD app. The system will notify shippers of the five best drivers based on availability, location and how many hours they have left to drive and will then send out their load to those drivers for consideration. Drivers can input data such as revenue per mile that will filter out loads that do not meet their expected rate. A driver has the option of accepting the load or making a counteroffer. They can also search the app to look for loads and plan a trip along with their rate per mile and let the solution find loads that match the criteria along the route. Shippers can post their loads manually or have them pulled in via an API. Transflo Transflo showed off part of its “door-to-door” initiative, which is designed to help drivers deliver goods and safely and efficiently navigate themselves through the process of the next load. Using the Transflo Mobile app, a driver simply chooses their status – on duty – and finds the scheduled load. A map shows the route, it shows fuel stops along the way and offers navigation through ALK CoPilot. It also is integrated with Drivewyze so weigh station bypass is an option. In turn, the system will provide exact drop or delivery location and will prompt drivers to scan necessary documents or generate workflows. It also will notify drivers of payment or settlement and allows them to see pay stub details. Transflo is also working on a solution called Command Center which will offer load details, driver availability and proximity to other loads and breadcrumb tracking. CargoChain CargoChain is a Swiss-based startup working to integrate blockchain into the supply chain. Its global platform collects load information and stores it on a public blockchain that begins with a profile of the shipper. APIs allow the data to be shared seamlessly without the limitations commonly associated with EDI. CargoChain supports both structured and unstructured data, so participants can manually enter their own cargo information, and can track all the way down to the piece level when equipped with QR codes or barcodes. Restrictions can be placed in the blockchain so a carrier, for instance, can see down to the pallet level but not inside the boxes on that pallet. However, the end customer might be able to see the individual product inside those boxes. Along the way, images can be added to the profile to document condition of the cargo. Once the cargo is picked up, a smart contract with all the details is executed and tracked through the blockchain. CargoChain can track items across multiple modes and provides full visibility of its transit.","TAGS":"Big Road Freight, Cargochain, Fleet Complete, FleetLocate, HCL, Intelligent Audit, Lanehub, Navistar, OnCommand Connection, Phillips Connect Technologies, Spireon, Tracking, Transflo, Transparency18, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-23T11:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/technology/ledger-technology-dominates-demo-session","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Triumphdemo-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Demo Session 2: Focus on improving the supply chain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"If there was one obvious theme of the second demo period at FreightWaves’ Transparency18 event on Tuesday, it was blockchain. Six of the nine presenters in the session demonstrated solutions that involved blockchain technology. From Vnomics’ fuel modeling program to TriumphPay’s shared ledger platform, the 7-minute long, quick-hitting demonstrations held the audience’s attention during the 1-hour, 15-minute session. Presenting companies in the block included Vnomics, TriumphPay, PEIR, Redwood Logistics, Authenticiti, Orbcomm, FreightWaves Sonar, Fr8 Network, and Riskpulse. FreightWaves’ Michael Vincent and Ben Murphy demonstrated the company’s new Sonar data platform. You can read more about that innovative solution here: FreightWaves launches Sonar data platform. Vnomics The morning session kicked with Vnomics showing its fuel management platform, which involves using tokens on the Ethereum network to coordinate pay for drivers. With over 23,000 drivers in its network, Vnomics built a fuel modeling platform that rewards drivers for saving fuel. The Vnomics system records a driver’s actual mpg and their potential mpg along a route, providing an efficiency score. The model will identify how much fuel is used and how much was projected to be used on a trip-by-trip basis. It then will identify a cause for the fuel waste, such as speeding, for instance. Now, with a Vnomics Fuel Token, drivers can be rewarded for saving gallons of fuel. One token equals a one gallon of fuel, so for each gallon saved, a token will be transferred on a blockchain to the driver. The driver can then exchange tokens for cash, but because the token is in the driver’s wallet, he can see how much is being earned with each trip. TriumphPay TriumphPay followed Vnomics to the stage, showcasing a payment platform that it believes could change the industry. “We believe [blockchain] should be used to improve on system integration on existing APIs,” said Jordan Graft, EVP of payment solutions. Triumph’s demonstration utilized a spot load and tracked it through blockchain to end payment. Built to work on any TMS system, the blockchain collects data from the original tender, any accessorials that need to be added, and the delivery, and once approved executes the specifics of the contract, including giving the driver/fleet the ability to choose QuickPay. All that information is loaded on to the blockchain ledger in a standardized format that speeds the entire process, including payment. “We have the ability to fundamentally change the payments industry,” Graft said. “We waste hundreds of billons of dollars doing this manually.” PEIR PEIR is an interesting company that has taken a simple process – image documentation – and incorporated it into a blockchain to provide irrefutable proof of a container’s condition during its journey. PEIR – which stands for Photo Equipment Interchange Receipt – utilizes a simple app and smartphone camera to allow a driver or anyone involved in the process of moving containers to snap pictures of the condition during an inspection period upon arrival or just before departure or any other time that is warranted. That image is then entered into a blockchain through the mobile app, which records and documents the condition of the container. According to the company, the blockchain records the condition, the time and location. The platform, available for both web and mobile, is written on top of existing APIs and can integrate with TMS systems. Users can also drill down through the dashboard to get more detailed information on any event. Redwood Logistics Redwood Logistics describes itself as a brokerage, 3PL and 4PL that provides data-driven supply chain solutions. During its Demo Day slot, Redwood’s Eric Rempel showed what he said was a Business to Blockchain (B2BC) platform. The Redwood Connect Blockchain is a distributed, secure, searchable database that collects objects such as ELD and other data points, gives them a hash and adds them to a blockchain. The company said the blockchain uses a public key for the nodes, allowing the data to be entered, but offers the owners of the data a private key so they maintain control of their data and who sees it. Offering transparency, governance and scale at a controllable cost, the Redwood Connect Blockchain serves as a middleware solution for shippers and app developers to connect without building out their own infrastructure. Authenticiti Authenticiti founder Andrew Yang walked the Demo Day audience through a sample of how his blockchain framework allows companies to focus on developing products and not on building blockchain infrastructure. Using GE Aviation as an example, Yang showed how a transaction is published onto the blockchain network using a hash to start the process, in this case Yang was showing how a product could be delivered and the associated purchase order could be transferred to a financial institution for payment. Once a purchase order is received, GE Aviation then could transfer the PO with supporting documents that are added to the transaction, to the financial institution. It could also share information related to the transaction with the customer, who could only see the information allowed through the hash. Both the customer and financial institution could see different details of the same transaction. Orbcomm Orbcomm is one of the largest service provides in the world with over 2 million subscribers to its tracking solutions, including 1.2 million in transportation. Orbcomm holds 70% market share of the refrigerated telematics industry, it claims. The company recently moved into a new arena with in-cab telematics offerings, including its new fleet management platform. The platform offers 4 modules – dispatch, HOS, vehicle exceptions and reporting, and temperature. Each module collects dozens of data points and organizes that information into useful data for managers. Some of that data might include trailer temperature, doors open and close, driver detention time, driving hours, vehicle reports that incorporate DVIR information, fuel compliance, idle time and even the time it takes a driver to shift his foot from the gas pedal to the brake. All the data is exportable and feeds through APIs and the system meets all ELD requirements. FR8 Network FR8 Network has been working on a protocol for standards for using blockchain and demonstrated its first development in that area. Developed using an Ethereum smart contract, the product integrates with Salesforce to usher a purchase through to final payment of the driver. In the solution, an order begins as soon as a customer hits purchase in online checkout. That generates a purchase order delivered to Salesforce and a shipping order, both entered into the blockchain. The shipping order begins a smart contract that, upon entering basic information through an add-on pop up, begins the shipping process. Along the way, the smart contract only executives those parts of the contract that have met the criteria, sending the information along to the customer, shipper or carrier. The driver then is involved and upon making delivery, receives a code from the customer and after entering that code, the remained of the smart contract is executed, transferring tokens to the driver’s/fleet’s account for payment. Riskpulse Cementing itself as a predictive supply chain disruption company, Riskpulse showed off its predictive capabilities, which it said can help predict disruption to shipments up to 2 weeks in advance. To illustrate, the company explained that it uses its analytics capabilities to assign a risk score between 1 and 25 to an area or lane. For instance, in the demonstration, Chicago had a risk score of 16, indicating that temperature in the area would be under 50 degrees for nine days, potentially putting shipments in that area affected by cold at risk. The company said its algorithms look at weather data along lanes at 10-mile intervals. That information is collected and inputted into a database that can be pulled into Excel. That information not only includes the risk score, but it also advises whether shipments should be moved, i.e. picked up a day or two early as a result.","TAGS":"Authenticiti, Fr8 Network, FreightWaves, ORBCOMM, PEIR, Redwood Logistics, Riskpulse, Technology, Transparency18, TriumphPay, Vnomics, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-22T21:03:13-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/hcl-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/HCLBita-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"HCL Technologies joins BiTA","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"HCL Technologies, a leading global technology company, today announced it has joined the Blockchain in Transportation Alliance (BiTA), an organization dedicated to determining best practices and standards for blockchain in the transportation industry. BiTA’s members include Descartes, Daimler, FedEx, SAP and Uber Freight among dozens of other global brands.

The company sees many advantages of blockchain technology for freight forwarding and logistics operations in general, but also for specific areas such as perishables in particular. Panalpina has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), bringing over a century of experience in the freight forwarding business into the development of blockchain technology, which has the potential to disrupt the sector. BiTA is a forum of leading tech and transportation companies for the development and implementation of blockchain standards. Members aim to educate the market on blockchain applications and encourage their use through implementation. Blockchain creates a digital record of every transaction made in a decentralized and secure way using cryptography. BiTA standards will address how the technology will impact contracts, freight payments, asset maintenance and ownership history, chain of custody of freight, and other issues facing the industry. “Our goal is to bring together leading companies in the freight and technology industries that have a vested interest in the development of blockchain technology. As an asset-light company with a very long history in the freight forwarding and logistics industry, Panalpina’s contribution will be very valuable,” says BiTA president Chris Burruss. Blockchain use in freight forwarding and logistics is still in the early adoption phase, but Panalpina is already being approached by vendors, partners and customers inquiring about it. Twofold approach to integrating blockchain technology “It is likely that many blockchain clusters will emerge, for example centered around ports and customs authorities, carrier groupings, as well as third-party logistics providers and regional logistics networks. When it comes to using blockchain applications and managing and interacting with all these different clusters, we have chosen a twofold approach that will be coordinated by a new digital innovation unit,” says Ralf Morawietz, chief information officer at Panalpina. “On the one hand, we will look at ways to integrate blockchain technology in complex core systems in the long-run. Here the focus is clearly on reliability, standardization and partnerships with bigger, established companies. We will also take part in the wider industry discussion in this context,” explains Luca Graf, Panalpina’s head of digital innovation. “On the other hand, we will run pilots and trials using blockchain, likely together with start-ups. The focus here lies on exploration and specific market and customer needs.” Blockchain benefits Panalpina sees many advantages of blockchain technology for freight forwarding and logistics operations. One advantage is the better tracking of orders and assets. Because of the decentralized nature of a blockchain, no single entity is in control of the tracking process, which will increase transparency in the supply chain and ultimately improve consumer trust. In the area of perishables, for example, blockchain technology can be used to reliably track products from farms to grocery stores, which allows for very precise and quick reports or recalls. Other benefits range from better scalability of operations to optimized capacity monitoring and pricing, fewer errors in payment processing and auditing, improved compliance, easier identification of attempted fraud, theft prevention, ease of building trust and gaining real-time feedback from customers.

Duboe noted that this rush to fund projects has led to more data than ever before, but that there is still a problem with getting clean, usable data. “[Current data] is not flexible, it can’t change in real time and it can’t adapt,” he said. The answer to this is likely blockchain. Duboe participated on a panel titled, “Utilizing Data for Freight Visibility,” during the BiTA event. Also on the panel was Tim Leonard, senior vice president and general manager of TMW Systems, and Priya Rajagopalan, chief product officer for Four Kites. The panel was moderated by Dean Croke, chief analytics officer for FreightWaves. Duboe pointed out that with all the data the industry is generating, there are still questions that need to be answered. “Blockchain is being developed on top of APIs…[but] how do you get data in and out of the blockchain? How do you ensure it is accurate,” he asked. “How do you start connecting those discrete technologies [generating the data].” Duboe noted how TMW System’s “Project Harmony” is showing real use cases for blockchain and demonstrating that “it’s [now] the art of possible.” Project Harmony is a four-year effort by TMW that is only in its first year, Leonard said. It is designed to create an ecosystem for carriers, shippers and brokers that empower them to manage goods movement on the blockchain. “The aspects of Harmony is focused on two major initiatives: productivity and visibility,” Leonard said, that will eventually lead to a “forward balancing” of networks. “We believe that some of these technologies that we will introduce on top of the blockchain in the next few years will fundamentally change freight [movement],” he said. Rajagopalan emphasized that blockchain is a technology for carriers of all sizes. With 80% of the over-the-road trucking industry controlled by 500,000 carriers, the industry remains comprised of mostly smaller carriers. Some 90% own fewer than 6 trucks, she said, “so their entire IT system is on the Dell laptop they’ve bought.” But, like all IT systems regardless of fleet size, it depends on the quality of the data and how quickly it can be incorporated into the system and turned into actionable data, said Duboe. The piles of data are also changing the way businesses seek that data. “The amount of data they are requesting is increasing,” Leonard said. “The shippers are now getting hungrier. Shippers are wanting data, but they don’t want silos of data, they want consolidated data.” Going back to the Amazon effect, Duboe said that it led to a large investment in IT purchases among companies, but those purchases, in many cases, were made in a vacuum that is now leading these companies to seek help in organizing and connecting the data in meaningful ways. Duboe said one of his clients solved 86% of their data problems by anonymizing the data upstream. Things as simple as lift gates that may be referred to by different names by different companies, he said, require time to create a common language, something that blockchain can help solve. “Blockchain has amazing [possibilities] from a consensus perspective,” Duboe said. Despite the technological promise of blockchain, Leonard advised that humans will still be involved. “There is a human element we can do with blockchain,” he said. “One of the things a shipper can do is physically look into the truck. The driver could be required to measure the temperature to verify what the sensors are saying.” This both keeps the driver engaged and verifies that the initial information entered into the blockchain by sensors is accurate. Blockchain also doesn’t have to be expensive, Leonard said, noting that third-party companies could host a blockchain solution. “If I’m a small coffee company, I can have a hosted [solution] where I just pay a monthly hosting fee,” he said. The design of the system – how it will move goods and other attributes of a smart contract – can be done in house and that solution can be created and hosted onto a third-party platform, saving potentially thousands from having to hire data scientists or to build APIs. When it comes to freight visibility, it all starts with the data and the ability of blockchain to create visibility into that data, but as Leonard said, “we can’t leave out the human intervention.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Four Kites, Project 44, Supply chain, Technology, TMW System, Transparency, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-22T12:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/the-future-is-already-here-its-just-not-evenly-distributed","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_1012700278-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"The future is already here: EY’s Paul Brody","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Paul Brody, speaking at the BiTA Symposium, has been in the blockchain practice for about five years now. He was part of building the first blockchain with IBM. “We’re not just in the early days anymore,” he says. Brody is currently responsible for driving Ernst and Young’s (EY’s) initiatives and investments in blockchain technology acrossconsulting, audit, and tax business lines. Brody says there’s an industrialization, but no revolution just yet. There’s a lot happening and EY shows several ways that they’re already gaining major traction in various industries. Consumers don’t care what’s on the back end of these situations, says Brody. He believes that blockchain is probably more of a B2B solution, not a B2C. Currently, in terms of major limitations, it’s not at scale and there are not complex transactions. What’s the test of a blockchain? These are the five point test questions for viability in terms of using blockchain: (1) Are there multiple parties in this ecosystem? (2) Is it establishing trust between all the parties and issue? (3) Are we securing the ownership or management of a finite resource? (4) Do all the parties need to work with shared, complex business logic? (5) Does the process depend on an extended business network? If you have yes to at least three of these questions, you could probably use a blockchain solution. Don’t fix something that’s not broken. Blockchains aren’t always that useful. Blockchain won’t replace Visa and Mastercard, for instance, because that’s not a problem. Blockchains will do for networks of enterprises and business ecosystems what ERP did for the single company. Let’s all have the same set of facts and work from the same information. So where to next? Brody see four majors transitions on the horizon. A shift from private blockchains to public ones. The current web of private blockchains is unsustainable as large companies seek to build overlapping, parallel networks. The current model of siloed and parallel private networks is unsustainable. Instead, a future of large, regional or sector-specific networks that are public is more likely. The future of blockchain kind of looks like the future of email. Open system for all users. No central parties control. No walled gardens preventing interoperability. Long term prototocol stability. An ecosystem of providers have emerged to address issues: spam filtering, cloud data, and storage. Brody sees the evolution moving from notarization to synchronization to tokenization. Many blockchain implementations are still about time stamping and synchronizing information. It’s a dead end. Tokenization is more demanding than notarization. It forces reconciliation across the network, preventing the disappearance or double counting of assets. It means that inventory moves between locations and are handled with the same precision as bank transfers. It is possible to represent entire complex business and operational networks in a blockchain. You can have accuracy and reconciliation across the entire process. The shift from cryptocurrencies to tokenized fiat currency is coming. The future of business fiat across blockchain platforms is crypto. Tokens of all kinds will be used. Multiple companies are already in the process of tokenizing fiat currencies onto public blockchains. The most enduring new coins being issued are the ones that can be used to move value on public networks. But they will be asset-backed liquid coins. We believe fiat currencies will come to dominate these transactions. Finally, shifting from a parallel separate system toward integration with existing laws and regulations. All of this can happen through sophisticated smart contracts, convertibility, and audit controls. Central banks and government authorities are starting to develop regulatory framework that will enable these transactions legally. “We don’t see any real regulatory barriers that will stop this from happening in the next year or two,” says Brody. “The future is already here. It’s just not evenly distributed.” It tends to take about a decade for full transitions to occur in an industrialized space, Brody says. “Just think of 2006 when Amazon Web Services launched. It wasn’t until 2017 that the majority of ERP installs shifted to the cloud. The future may be longer in coming than we realize. Part of it has to do with ‘Who is willing to be first?\u0027” Today there are private blockchains and solutions, tactical ROI, driven by industry leaders and evolving ecosystems. Tomorrow is going to be public networks, general purpose transactions, open to all with dynamic ecosystems. Finally, cue the skeptics, says Brody. “Right on schedule. There’s a group of people, I call them the cryptocrazies. They’re not right. But on the other hand there are the skeptics that just don’t see it happening in their lifetime. Look, we are ten years into the blockchain cycle. It’s not early days. Today it’s about scalability.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, private blockchain, public blockchain, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-22T11:44:09-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/technology-success-depends-on-cooperation","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Georgepanel-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Cooperation needed to make blockchain a win-win for everyone","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"As blockchain technology works its way into the transportation ecosystem, there is remains plenty to learn about its potential, but its success will depend on multiple parties working together, concurred a panel of leading transportation experts on Monday at the Blockchain in Transport Alliance’s (BiTA) Spring Symposium. “If I were to create a bumper sticker right now, it would be ‘blockchain: A team sport,’” said Dale Chrystie, vice president of strategic planning \u0026 support for FedEx Freight. Chrystie was joined on the panel, entitled “End User Perspectives on Blockchain Technology, by Craig Harper, COO of J.B. Hunt and Ron Piwetz, enterprise architect, BNSF. The panel was moderated by George Abernathy, chief revenue officer for FreightWaves. Chrystie noted that everyone is still learning about blockchain and its potential uses, but that as an industry, we need to move past the current mindset that limits innovation. “Currently, people think of things as win-lose,” he said. “We’re all competitive [but] we need to get to the point where it’s win-win. “I don’t know if we’ve reached the point where we [can acknowledge] that working together on blockchain accelerates it for all of us and gets us to that win-win,” Chrystie added. “We are going to find a way to work together.” Harper echoed those thoughts. J.B. Hunt already collaborates with BNSF on intermodal operations, but Harper pointed out that to truly benefit from all that blockchain can provide, parties will have to work together. The ability to move products from “shore to store” means those products move on various modes, and without cooperation, blockchain will be less effective. The strength of the blockchain is in its overall collective, Piwetz said, “when you have companies pooling their data.” BNSF has developed a blockchain lab to help business partners develop smart contracts and work on other blockchain projects. J.B. Hunt and FedEx also have significant blockchain-related projects or groups working on the technology. Harper, for one, is “very excited” about what blockchain might deliver. “We don’t have the perfect use case yet,” he said. “Some people say it’s a solution in search of a problem. I don’t believe that. I believe there are going to be some great use cases.” One possible solution might be in dispute resolution, said Chrystie. To illustrate, he noted that at FedEx a common problem is when a delivery is made and something is missing. It becomes difficult to track what happened because each party speaks a different language, he said. The shipper may track the shipment by billing number while the end customer may identify it by PO number. A common language is needed, Chrystie said, and that may be the SKU. All three panelists believe efficiency and cost reduction will be among the early benefits of blockchain. “We’re still faxing papers to [some] people to get approvals,” Harper related. “With all the cool things going on, why can’t we have [a solution].” Harper also suggested that blockchain will eliminate the unnecessary “rework” to recreate paperwork or redo contracts “because you don’t have one version.” Still, all three continually noted that blockchain development is still in the early stages. “We may be at step 3 of 100,” Chrystie said. “We view blockchain as the Internet was in 1995,” Piwetz noted. “Back in 1995, you couldn’t imagine Uber or AirBnB … and 20 years from now, we’ll be amazed [at what blockchain delivers].” “When you start reaching out to folks, you’ll find out that everyone is still very early in the game,” Harper added. For now, early stage blockchain solutions may be as much about looking back as looking forward. “We all spend a lot of time looking at what happened last week, last month, and I think that will be the early days of blockchain,” Chrystie told the audience. “And then we’ll move into the windshield” and start looking forward. Companies should not wait for a total solution but should start looking for “small victories that can lead to larger victories,” Harper said. “Don’t wait for best, do better,” Chrystie added.

Most people who have just started learning about blockchain come to the subject through the notoriety of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which rose 1,200% last year and then crashed to less than half of its value. But blockchain applications far more interesting and technologically sophisticated than cryptocurrencies have already been developed, spurring a deeper, and potentially more productive wave of interest from industry. Graft explained why cryptocurrencies were unlikely to be used as payments in transportation and logistics: the biggest reason is how the IRS treats cryptocurrencies for the purposes of taxes. “IRS tax treatment considers the transfer of a cryptocurrency an asset sale,” said Graft. “Now, accountants are normally not violent people, but if you tell them that you’re generating thousands and thousands of asset sales, you’ll see them get violent,” joked Graft. Other barriers to the use of cryptocurrencies as payments include privacy and the volatility in price. Smart contracts are run on a more advanced blockchain platform than bitcoin, because rather than simply executing peer to peer transactions, the blocks use a Turing-complete language, which is a fancy way of saying that a user can in theory program them to do anything a computer can do. Smart contract technology allows developers to build decentralized applications—software that runs on a decentralized network of computers (think of cloud computing, but instead of being controlled by one company like Amazon, it’s on a peer-to-peer network of nodes). The most famous example is the Ethereum network, where nodes that run decentralized applications (“dapps”) are rewarded with the cryptocurrency Ether. Because smart contracts are so much more flexible and robust than simple cryptocurrencies, they can answer more potential use cases, especially in the transportation and logistics industries. Graft’s talk, “Smart contracts in finance and blockchain,” took a look at some of the most promising of these areas. Graft started off by talking about what blockchain is and isn’t, or what it can and can’t do. No, blockchain will not solve the world’s problems, and it probably won’t even enable instant payments from shippers to brokers or carriers. Graft pointed out that ‘net zero’ payment cycles require a much more intensive use of capital than longer payment cycles, and the simple addition of smart contracts won’t generate the hundreds of billions of dollars needed to capitalize net zero cycles out of thin air. In Graft’s example, a publicly traded 3PL with a net thirty payment cycle could have a 19.7% return on invested capital, where a net zero cycle would only yield 8%, making the logistics company much less attractive to shareholders and potential investors. According to Graft, the main ways that blockchain and smart contracts will impact the financing of transportation companies and receivables factoring is by finding back office efficiencies, streamlining processes, increasing systems integration, and allowing banks to lower their rates even further. Graft pointed out that receivables financing is an expensive product: both for the customers (a 2% fee on a thirty day billing cycle equates to a 24% APR, equivalent to a personal credit card) and the banks (because factoring transportation receivables is very time-consuming and labor-intensive compared to servicing other kinds of debt, like a home mortgage). “Blockchain will not change the underlying working capital requirements of the industry,” said Graft. “Factoring is an expensive credit product to operate, but increased systems integration will reduce the cost of factoring and drive down rates, and will likely attract larger financial institutions and banks to the market.” Technology has already driven factoring rates down from about 5% to around 2%, and Graft says that blockchain, and especially the systems integration from common data standards, has the potential to move that number even lower. “Instead of 3 guys in a garage charging 5 percent, you’ll see rates come down in a dramatic way,” said Graft. Graft demonstrated Triumph’s blockchain prototype by taking the audience through an entire workflow from invoice presentment; approval and payment on a shared ledger; rate confirmation; load pickup; load tracking; load delivery; invoice presentment; adjustments; invoice approval; assignment; and payment. Graft stressed that “the mobile app we’ve built is nothing special; it’s generic… this interface isn’t what’s important. What’s important is the systems integration: if we get the standards right, we can build interfaces that work with multiple systems at once [EDI and API].” John Shields, the CTO of Triumph Business Capital, said that blockchain represented a potential step change and value proposition over traditional integrations. One respondent from the audience pointed out that in the highly fragmented trucking industry, technological adoption is slow and uneven, and blockchain by its very nature depends on a kind of network effect to gain momentum (i.e., as more people adopt the technology, it works better and offers better returns on investment). Graft agreed that it was an issue for the industry, but reminded the audience that small carriers and owner-operators who don’t have the computing hardware, software licenses, or data professionals to invest heavily in technology already use large 3PLs like Echo and XPO as proxies to outsource their technology needs. “Larger tech-enabled 3PLs are gonna look more like technology companies,” said Graft, “and this is going to continue that trend.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, smart contracts, Triumph Business Capital, TriumphPay, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Paul Hampstead","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-21T19:41:19-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/crytopcurrencies","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_580981639-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Cryptocurrencies are a thing, but should you invest and, if so, how much?","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"At the BiTA Symposium in Atlanta today, Matthew May, Co-founder of Acuity led a session on cryptocurrency accounting. Self-described blockchain enthusiast and cryptocurrency skeptic, May is a CPA on a mission to help entrepreneurs build scalable accounting processes for growing businesses. He is co-founder of Acuity, a firm that does back office accounting for people and businesses working with and in cryptocurrencies. Their customers tend to be hedgefunds, crytopcurrency miners, and the largest amount are the ERC utility token holders. May sees blockchain as being the bigger solution, but there’s a lot to learn in the speculative realm of cryptocurency. Cryptocurrency is just this one thing that blockchains work well with, although the two are often conflated. There are essentially four different kinds of cryptos, as May defines them. Dash or Bitcoin cash are trying to be a currency. Maybe a crypto could hold value over time much like gold or silver? What if Bitcoin is like gold and Litecoin is like silver? Some say it could happen. What Ripple is doing is different. They’re trying to replace the bank system. Ethereum tries to be a little bit of everything. They have a utility token. It’s just revenue you might get in the future somehow. Much like this cooler. Ethereum has built this network that’s created a utitliy token. Most of the practical applications will be in the form of prepaid revenue like the Ethereum model. Is cryptocurrency an investment? Until the volumes of the transactions of the utility tokens shifts from crypto to crypto and entering into the main public exchanges, there will be volatility and its hard to say what the practical applications will be. But the top managers in the space are acknowledging that it’s a thing, but you shouldn’t put more than 1 percent of your net wealth into them. Put less than 1 percent in crypto versus fiat currency. If you’re going to invest you should find out who is in charge. Is it a foundation, a for profit company, or are they coin holders themselves? If you’re a business, do you want to accept crypto? It could be “no” and that’s the end of discussion. If yes, you could have Bitpay or Quickbooks to have no volatility. Or if you say yes and really accept it into a drive, refer back to the “less than 1 percent” idea. May says he does think it’s coming. In light of that, there are four main risks. The first is well-covered: volatility. Everyone seems to have a sense of this. Another one that isn’t talked about much: Bitcoin transactions fees have skyrocketed to $28 per transaction. It’s essentially undermining the value of the coin for making small transactions. “This is probably one of the bigger risks that people are dealing with,” says May. Another is liquidity. There are three main buckets of liquidity, crypto you can get to fiat like Gemini and Coinbase. Ethereum and Bitcoin are the main four that do this. Then there are the Crypto Exchanges of which there are about 150, ones like Bittrex, Binance, Shapeshift, etc. and you can convert these into the top four. These are considered the intermediaries. Then there is the bottom thousand, which May calls the “good luck” category. Counterparty risk is probably the least talked about, but perhaps the most important for business. There’s little to no regulation, rules, and therefore recourse for these exchanges. Regulators are really trying to catch up. So, it’s possible that a place could go bankrupt and just shut their doors. Cryptos aren’t your keys, aren’t your coins. May says this is something you should be able to control. Only use exchanges for their express purpose, go crypto to crypto, or crypto to fiat. For tax issues, the IRS is saying that they’re treating it like property. The accounting is almost identical to day trading stocks (just a different form). There are three tools that are leading the pack for business applications. Verady, Balanc3, and Libra are platforms that help people get the transactions into legacy systems. Tax forms 1099-K (a money transmitter form) and Form 8949. The US Regulatory environment is May’s “favorite” topic. We have four different regulatory agencies saying four different things. The SEC is calling it a security. The IRS is calling it a property. CFCT is calling it a commodity, and FinCen scared everyone by calling it a currency. The FinCen letter really got knee jerk reactions to discourage people. We all want to see enforcement, especially on the dregs, the people that aren’t trying to make a difference, and from everything we’ve heard from the regulators that’s where the direction is going. The IRS you’ve got to stay compliant with, as the SEC and FinCen gets some clarity, let’s comply there, says May. Be mindful and try to do the best you can and go with the spirit of the law because the letter of the law is absent.

The announcement of the Think Tanks was part of an Alliance update provided by Chris Burruss, president of BiTA, and Mitch Hixon, vice president of membership engagement, during the opening session of the BiTA Spring Symposium, being held on Monday at the Georgia International Conference Center in Atlanta. “Now is our time, [but] who is our?” Hixon asked the 371 registered attendees. “It’s not BiTA, but the industry, collectively.” Hixon repeatedly emphasized that BiTA works for its members and the new Think Tanks would follow that same path. “I can’t lead and influence, I can only moderate,” he said, adding that the concept behind the Think Tanks is to “identify and further identify the pain points.” “I’ve never seen in my lifetime, and I’ve spent my entire career in the industry, a wave like we’re seeing today [with blockchain],” Hixon, who has spent 40 years in the industry, noted. Hixon said the Think Tanks will work closely with the BiTA Standards Council as they work through the industry pain points. Each Think Tank will have 9 participants “to define issues for potential blockchain solutions.” “The success of the groups will come from us, from you,” he told the audience. Topics the Think Tanks may address are smart payments, insurance, detention, driver marketplace/universal driver ID/passport, freight billing and load tender/compliance. The 5 Think Tanks are: The risk management and finance/business administration Think Tanks will kick off on June 1; the supply chain marketplace Think Tank will begin on June 8 and the remaining two will start on June 15. Hixon said there are still opportunities for BiTA members interested in joining one of the Think Tanks to get involved. “We’re coming to the end of Phase 1 [of BiTA], which was the establishment of the organization,” he said. “We’re moving into Phase 2, which is turning it over [to members].” Before Hixon took the stage, Burruss provided a quick update on BiTA and announced the official launch of the BiTA Standards Council. “Standards are important because if industry doesn’t set the stage for success, what happens?” he asked. “Government gets involved and that’s something we don’t want to happen.” In response to a pointed question about government involvement later in the session, Burruss noted he didn’t think Washington would regulate blockchain in the industry. “If we are successful in getting standards to sort of regulate ourselves, I’d say no [to government involvement],” he said. The development of a separate Standards organization is part of the goal to ensure BiTA meets member needs, Burruss noted. “One thing that is clear to me [from my career experience] is that standards get lost in the larger organization,” the veteran association leader said. “We don’t want to see that happen to BiTA.” The Standards Council will work to: BiTA announced earlier this year that BiTA Standards will be open and free to use for anyone interested. There will be no licensing fee or any other requirement for their use. There should be some standards published before the end of the year, Burruss said, probably focused on the data side initially. Burruss said the second phase that BiTA is entering is about developing more member engagement, and Hixon’s addition to the Alliance is part of that. To date, BiTA has received over 2,000 applications for membership with 400 paid members representing a variety of industry demographics, from asset-based carriers to 3PLs, technology partners and industry participants such as law firms, insurance and finance companies. There has also been interest from other blockchain organizations and government such as the Department of Defense and FEMA, which is interested in how blockchain could assist in relief operations. “I view us as the mechanics of the bus,” Burruss said of member engagement. “You guys are the bus drivers.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"BiTA Standards, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Freight, Supply chain, Technology, Transparency, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-21T15:54:13-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/bisca-forms-for-supply-chain-participants","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BrianReed-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BiSCA formed to focus on supply chain participants","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The minds behind the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) announced a new endeavor focused on supply chain participants on Monday during the opening session of the Blockchain in Transport Spring Symposium, being held at the Georgia International Conference Center in Atlanta. The new Blockchain in Supply Chain Alliance (BiSCA) is designed to meet the needs of supply chain participants, focusing on many of the same goals as BiTA. Like BiTA, BiSCA will feature a community side and a standards organization, explained Brian Reed, managing director of BiSCA and EVP of supply chain and global strategy for FreightWaves. “The idea is to get as close to a single source of truth on standards” as we can, he told the 350-plus Symposium attendees. BiSCA will also feature technical committees and working groups that develop outcomes and investigate blockchain solutions geared to those who purchase freight solutions. Reed explained that BiSCA, which will be governed by a Board of Directors that is currently being developed, sees the supply chain as focusing on four key pillars: BiSCA and BiTA will have some overlap, Reed said, and some companies may choose to be involved in both Alliances. BiTA will remain focused on transportation solutions while BiSCA will encompass the remaining three pillars – procurement, planning and warehousing. Reed added that use cases within the BiSCA realm could include smart contracts, purchase history, manufacturing visibility, raw goods/finished goods traceability, data sharing (EDI, VMI), document sharing (Customs, Pos), and supply chain finance. The BiSCA board will include 13 members – 9 permanent members and 4 rotating seats in 2- or 3-year terms, likely, Reed said. The group is attempting to create as diverse a board as possible with members coming from all modes of transportation and from across the globe. These may include members from shippers, service providers, technology and academia as well as high tech, CPG, retail and resource industries. It won’t be limited to these, though, he noted. “We are seeking global participation,” Reed said. “We’re going to do our best to get as much representation across (our industries) as we can.” Reed also announced the first two members of BiSCA – the University of Denver and the U.S. Air Force. “It’s a good launch and I think it’s going to be very complementary to BiTA,” he said. Reed took several questions from the audience, including what would fall under BiTA and what under BiSCA. In general, he answered, “if the core of collaboration or development of standards is transportation, it would fall under BiTA.” There will be some overlap, Reed said, using cobalt as an example. Cobalt is mined and then transferred through several parties throughout its supply chain life, eventually becoming an entirely different product that is part of electric cars among other uses. Individual member companies along cobalt’s journey may fall under either BiTA or BiSCA, but the entire process would be under BiSCA’s purview, as it’s about the overall visibility and transparency of the entire journey. With that, Reed noted that some companies may want to participate in both BiTA and BiSCA. “We’d encourage people to be part of both,” he said, adding that “we believe valuable information can come from both sides.” Like BiTA, which announced earlier this year it would provide open standards, BiSCA standards will also be open sourced. In response to a question on why there is a need for a separate Alliance for supply chain professionals, Reed said it was “mainly due to score and structural organization.” Craig Fuller, managing director of BiTA and CEO of FreightWaves, further explained the reasoning behind BiSCA. In surveying BiTA members, Fuller said, there are only about 20 members who identified themselves as shippers (not including 3PLs and 4PLs). “The feedback we got was this is an organization (BiTA) that is run by transportation [groups] and they didn’t know if this would address the issues of the [shippers].” BiSCA has been set up to give those in the supply chain the chance to have an equal voice in the development of blockchain standards, and to do so alongside BiTA. BiTA and BiSCA will host a joint Fall Symposium on Nov. 12, 2018, in Dallas. On Nov. 13-14, also in Dallas, FreightWaves will present MarketWaves18. The BiSCA website is available at bisca.studio.

IA will launch Intellichain, an auditors’ blockchain-powered universal billing system that systematically validates that all data points and contract terms are correctly applied before approving invoices for shippers to pay. A member of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance, Intelligent Audit is active collaborating with a variety of industry participants on blockchain data standards in transportation and logistics. Intellichain connects shippers, carriers, warehouse management systems, transportation execution systems, and freight auditors together to deliver a more robust, end-to-end solution to all parties, and ensures carriers are paid faster, shippers pay less with less billing discrepancies for all. IA customers using Intellichain will be able to create four immutable ledgers securely recording the details of carrier agreements, shipment transit, invoice billing activity, and load tendering. IA joins a number of other companies developing enterprise-level blockchain solutions. IBM and Maersk have a well-known collaboration, and JP Morgan and Microsoft are teaming up in the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Founded in 1996, Intelligent Audit helps customers reduce transportation spend with its audit solution and reporting engine, which uncovers additional opportunities for cost reduction and supply chain process improvements. With more than 2,500 clients representing more than $9B in aggregate transportation spend across all modes and geographies, Intelligent Audit provides insights that help customers ship smarter. Blockchain promises to fundamentally change the manual, telephone, and email processes behind the movement of freight globally because it allows parties who don’t know or necessarily trust each other to build mutually shared databases that can’t be altered after the fact. Since the telematics revolution in the transportation industry—which has only been accelerated by the ELD mandate—shippers, carriers and customers seemingly have more data than they know what to do with, but it’s often inaccessible, in company-specific silos. “Blockchains will alter more than how we store and record information; they will also alter what we can do with that information,” said Yosie Lebovich, IA’s founder and CEO. It’s not just about the audit process; it’s also about the management and utility of a dynamic, accretive record. With Intellichain, each party touching a shipment will have a transparent record of events which will lead to enhanced visibility, real-time status updates used to proactively address issues, and faster payments with better clarity on disputed amounts. Intellichain’s smart contract scorecards the quality of data received, allowing for all parties to continuously improve their data gathering and communication ability. “Intelligent Audit has always strived to bring new and innovative solutions to our clients and we are focused on blockchain because we believe it’s the next frontier for logistics technology,” said Lebovich. “As a freight auditor, we have a prime vantage point because we monitor each shipment as it flows through the entire transportation network from origin to delivery and, ultimately, carrier payment. We see the value that consensus-driven, distributed databases will provide in terms of transparency, accountability, and efficiency – particularly with respect to billing and payment.” See Intelligent Audit in action at Transparency18 where they will be demonstrating their solution on Tuesday, May 22nd.","TAGS":"audit, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Intelligent Audit, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Paul Hampstead","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Warehouse, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-21T13:21:37-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/scroll-network-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BiTAScrollrelease-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Scroll Network joins BiTA","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Scroll Network announced its affiliation with the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). “Disruptive and transformational technologies are quite rare,” says Nathan Pitruzzello, CEO and co-founder of Scroll Network. “Blockchain is truly one of those and we are happy to join BiTA and its members in their efforts.” The membership with BiTA will allow Scroll Network to provide innovative and proprietary software solutions to the transport industry which can allow them to take better advantage of the many benefits of blockchain technology. Transportation, trucking, rail, shipping, air freight, and supply chain providers share a common need for comprehensive, accurate, timely, and secure records along with related data storage. The transformational nature of blockchain technology can allow this to be done more effectively and reliably than ever before. Personnel records, maintenance records, chain of custody records, payment invoices, contractual agreements, performance documentation, and legal compliance are just a few of the ongoing activities that require safe and efficient software solutions. Scroll Network seeks early adoption clients to work with in building specific blockchain applications for their own operations. We also look forward to the opportunity to share in the development of prudent and structured industry standards that provide consistency in bringing the transformational potential of blockchain to the transport sector. Having already raised funding through a cryptocurrency token sale, Scroll Network additionally can provide consultative services to other members of BiTA that may be considering funding alternatives in that area. In that respect, Scoll Network is in the final testing stages of its own Main Net that solves known problems with previous platforms such as Bitcoin and Ethereum that have, up to now, prevented viable enterprise blockchain software solutions. About Scroll Network Scroll Network is a subsidiary of SoluTech which was founded in October of 2016. We have successfully developed and implemented The Diamond Standard of Blockchain Data. The four facets of our diamond are Low Cost, High Speed, Broad Scalability, and Strong Security. Until the Scroll Network, no one else had one solution that could provide peak performance in all four of these crucial areas of data management, transfer, and storage. We have already reduced our transaction costs to fractions of a cent. We have achieved record breaking speed in transactions per second (TPS). Our software scales automatically as the user base or number of applications grows, and we are confident it will quickly set the bar for blockchain scalability. Regarding security, our solutions provide a dramatically higher level than existing 3rd party cloud services.

It’s the idea that the various distributed ledgers that will be adopted throughout the economy will need to be able to speak to one another. Otherwise, a ledger in one sector will have limited ability to interact with others, and the many types of moving parts needed to have a transaction completed by blockchain technology won’t all be at the table. Jordan Graft, the executive vice president of payment solutions at TriumphPay, a financial services company that provides factoring services to trucking companies, called it something else: systems integration. He did so at a joint webinar this past week sponsored by Freightwaves and FleetLocate by Spireon. “Blockchain is not going to be the cure for everything,” Graft said on the webinar. “It won’t end all disputes. But it is a tool that we can use in how we have our systems integrated in the industry, and it’s really an opportunity for us to create savings in the back office.” Gratf’s company, TriumphPay, is a major provider of factoring services, which essentially is a cash advance on expected payment later. It’s the sort of activity that would expect to be impacted by distributed ledger technology, where numerous middle-level participants would be distinermediated. Graft said a $100 million factoring portfolio takes 50-100 people to operate. The similar-sized portfolio of commercial real estate wouldn’t take even one. “What this can so is reduce the amount of operation overhead to run a factoring company,” he said. Graft focused heavily on how blockchain-driven networks would be structured. A fully public blockchain, like the bitcoin blockchain, has no role for sharing the sort of data that would be needed to bring greater efficiencies to the back-office process that now—inefficiently—processes invoices. A private blockchain controlled by a single entity “is not interesting to us,” Graft said, because such a network would need a single administrator, “and that is not what we’re trying to achieve, to make the network administrator powerful.”  What Graft envisions would be a series of networks, possibly each of them controlled by a major player in the market—he mentioned C.H. Robinson and Echo logistics as examples—but with system integration allowing those networks to interact with each other. Companies like that would act as “bridges.” The 3PLs would become “more like technology companies and less like a broker,” Graft said. “Blockchain will continue that evolution, in our minds, of making brokers more tech-enabled.” And given the technology-knowledge of many of the industry’s smaller players, that is going to be needed. The trucking market is marked by many carriers that have 10 trucks or less, Graft said, whose technological sophistication might be so far down the curve that they don’t even have a modern transportation management system. Assisting those companies into a more complicated blockchain world will be a new business need for such companies, according to Graft. But even if the industry moves to the model of multiple ledgers communicating with each other, they need to speak the same language. Graft talked about Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) systems as a primary communications tool in the trucking market, but one which has significant limitations. It only goes point-to-point, so it can’t pull in data from other sources or be shared. “There’s no shared source of truth,” Graft said, using truth in the blockchain sense, where the sharing of data on the ledger, throughout many individual “nodes,” provides the assurance that a transaction has been done and the ownership of a unit has been established. The standards needed to run EDI, Graft said, are “massive” and “difficult to upgrade.” They are also old, and do not reflect “decades of innovation in the industry.” Graft talked about a base for the standards that would be written for a ledger-based substitute for EDI by referring to the ERC20 token on Ethereum, which is the basis for the vast majority of tokens in Initial Coin Offerings. The standards for that are one page, and flexible enough that most of the universe of tokens can be written while adhering to those standards. Something similar could be developed by an organization such as the Blockchain in Transport Alliance or a similar group, Graft said. They can develop the standards that serve as a base like the ERC20 token standards, and individual ledgers can be crafted off that base. “Brokers in the industry think about invoices differently,” Graft said. “So us being able to set a standard for how all brokers do things is not realistic. But if we can go about setting a minimum required field, and a minimum required function for an invoice, then we have something to work with.” Although Graft may have used the ERC20 token protocol as an example, he was consistent in arguing that he does not see the sort of ledger-based tool to displace existing legacy systems using a token to get transactions completed. This is one of the great divides in the blockchain world: the view that a token is not necessary to gain the advantages that a distributed ledger provides, versus a view that interaction with the banking system can only slow a ledger down significantly, and that an agreed-upon token will allow the speed of distributed ledger technology to fully take root.

Coli outbreak and how the recall issue is causing the world to rethink “farm to table” and shedding light on the supply chain. From that outbreak alone, over 100 people fell ill due to a contamination that federal agencies couldn’t pinpoint. As traceability becomes more imperative, blockchain has emerged as a potential solution. The problem with equipping an entire industry, however, is a major stumbling block toward making the real kind of change needed. In light of that, we spoke with Chris Kirchner, CEO and co-founder of blockchain provider Slync, to share his experiences on not just the blockchain hype-machine and what it can do—but also what it currently is doing. Slync offers a blockchain-based platform for shippers, carriers, freight forwarders and other supply chain participants that creates an immutable audit record of any series of events within a supply chain, specifically focused on domestic and international shipment transactions. “Scalability is a problem for the entire industry. There’s nothing done at large scale today. That’s just not reality. There’s still more questions there than answers. We are doing some things which could get us ahead of our competitors but it’s all theories right now,” says Kirchner. “Instead of this winner take all approach, we’re working with an anchor customer and their smaller networks. Where you can work with four or five companies to cooperate. It’s much more of a doable thing, much more realistic. We’re finding very tangible outcomes in those limited partnerships. That’s the pathway to success for blockchain as far as I’m concerned.” Slync logs bill of lading, IoT data and associated costs, and provides a collaborative system of record for business partners, which among other things, reduces disputes. Currently, Slync operates in the logistics, precious metals, pharmaceuticals, wine, luxury goods, FMCG and food industries. But food is hard. “One of the main barriers to connecting all the parties into blockchain is if a party doesn’t want to be in chain,” says Kirchner. “There’s what I would call ‘light touch’ for their documentation to be put in even without direct participation. That’s one of the challenges that blockchain faces. You have to have levels of cooperation. Those issues make it a tough nut to crack honestly.” “The other challenge is the business model challenge of getting multiple businesses to cooperate at the same time,” he says. “I don’t know how well that’s going to work to be frank. It’s hard to get just a few businesses to cooperate, but entire industries? Everyone has their own agendas.” Currently Kirchner says Slync is more focused more on international logistics and high value goods. “Those are our sweet spots. You have all little more structure. There are still multiple parties in the chain. You take out some of the levels of 30-35 points. A box of tomatoes, those things go to a produce market and you don’t know who those intermediaries are in many of those cases. You could have potentially hundreds of points that need to be on your blockchain.” Another important point of contact is the partnership of IoT and blockchain. “They very much go hand in hand,” says Kirchner. “They’re technologies that can benefit each other, and can launch companies that want to implement solutions.” “Instead of this winner take all approach, we’re working with…smaller networks. Where you can work with four or five companies to cooperate. It’s much more of a doable thing, much more realistic.” “At first I considered hardware for Slync, but then we decided to stick with software and partner with companies like Roambee. From what we’re doing with them we can things like change of custody and the immutability of blockchain helps so that it can’t be tampered with. There’s a natural interconnect with those technologies,” Kirchner says. “We’ve made blockchain simple. You don’t need to know any code. You pick your sources, and you put it in an API invoice. Our speed is another differentiator. We’re a little more agile and can get into operations faster than anyone else on the market. Most of our founding team came from salesforce. We know how to take other companies interfaces with an easy to use interface.” Slync’s membership in the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) will drive blockchain implementation in the freight industry, in partnership with leading logistics players, including UPS, Fedex and Penske. Slync will also present a live demo at Transparency18 in Atlanta May 22-23. The demo will showcase how Slync streamlines international transactions in the supply chain with blockchain.

FreightWaves spoke to Brad Taylor, VP of Data and IoT Solutions at Omnitracs, by phone on Friday afternoon. “Obviously we’re a participant in BiTA,” began Taylor, “and we feel like when we’re talking about that organization in general, the guiding concepts were that it’s a participatory effort with an industry focus and a mandate around common standards, which is important.” “We believe that while there’ll be some private blockchain and distributed ledger initiatives, we think it’s important to have an open blockchain and structure,” Taylor continued. Taylor was referring to the difference between public and closed—or ‘permissioned’—blockchains. Permissioned blockchains would function as a private system, with verifying nodes tasked and authorized by a central authority, instead of completely open to the public. Nikolai Hampton wrote in Computerworld that “many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases.” Taylor said that Omnitracs realizes that the best way to add value up and down the supply chain is with a public—or semi-public, ‘consortium’ blockchain—with diverse participants. Omnitracs thinks that even with an open network, managing privacy will be fairly easy. Taylor spoke about managing privacy “at a global or granular scale”, meaning that not only an individual party to a smart contract be able to selectively release identity-proving information in any given transaction, but also that entire companies will have their data anonymized so that a competitor can’t aggregate their data and reverse-engineer it to get a look at their rivals’ operations. “You could disclose certain kinds of information about a driver to an LTL customer that required it, but hold that same attribute back from another customer who did not require it,” said Taylor. Taylor said that Omnitracs is still waiting for all of the regulatory dust around the ELD mandate to settle—he cited a few well-known exceptions and deferrals that have not yet been resolved—but expects that Omnitracs’ ELDs will be crucial inputs for the blockchain. “We don’t want to embark on something immediately until all the outstanding items are resolved,” said Taylor. “I don’t see the lack of regulatory clarity as a huge negative,” Taylor continued, “the critical thing is that progress [at BiTA] is being made and we’re likely to see conceptual alignments in the forum BiTA is defining around the time that everything is settled around the ELD mandate… that’s the point where you move beyond the science experiment stage in your own company to looking to do something more concrete, especially with ELDs.” “One thing we think is interesting to us because it transcends short-haul and long-haul is chain of custody: from pharmaceuticals to cold chain, to volatiles… these are areas where, you know, there is no single common peer to peer history, which can be very important for each link in the supply chain, from the transportation and storage to handling,” said Taylor. “It could also provide information on the trailer and the driver. Custody chain looks very interesting. In addition to ELDs, there’s other on vehicle opportunities where blockchain can be of interest, like DOT inspection requirements—at some point it might be valuable to have that record… currently these records aren’t mandated to be electronic. We have customers that use our predictive analytics to forecast noncompliance with DOT reportables.” One of the reasons why Omnitracs is such an enthusiastic BiTA member is that the firm wants to make sure data standards have been established before it tries to develop a blockchain-based product. “We want to be a supportive peer with a reasonable computational cost,” said Taylor. “We believe that there will still be opportunities for us to facilitate significant transactions even if we wait for the standards to emerge… we’re big enough, and connected enough to fuel and service providers that there will be still enough opportunities to do that. There are a lot of exciting opportunities to use blockchain, ELDs being one of the many, but we view our effort as one that will be emphasizing alignment with the other industry players, as opposed to being out of step with what’s good for the industry.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"BiTA, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Omnitracs, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Paul Hampstead","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-15T11:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/technology/learning-machine-is-helping-reduce-driver-identity-fraud-using-blockchain","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/pexels-photo-357514.jpeg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Learning Machine is helping reduce driver identity fraud using blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Verifying official records has historically been a redundant and cumbersome process, where in certain situations, tracing the record issuers is a futile exercise – specifically with international records, as the issuer might no longer be around to substantiate the record or is not inclined to authenticate it. The U.S. transportation industry is so large that it frequently finds itself witnessing driver identity fraud. Atop this, the industry is bogged down with a driver shortage and its inability to plug the high driver turnover rate, which affects trucking insurance premiums that have been rising steadily over the years. This exposes the industry to systemic risks surrounding driver identity. Identity fraud has played a role in 10% of all cargo theft in recent years, with the average value of the load lost to fictitious pickup amounting to over $140,000 and impacting the industry at around $15 billion a year. Learning Machine, a company based out of New York is looking to solve this problem, by developing an enterprise application for issuing and verifying official records using the blockchain as a secure encrypt of trust. “We developed a technology standard to do this which is called Blockcerts. It is an open source standard that is not owned by Learning Machine, and is a toolkit for any government company or university around the world to build their own applications for issuing and verifying official records,” said Natalie Smolenski, VP of Business Development at Learning Machine. In practice, a lot of companies do not have the wherewithal to build their own software, which is where Learning Machine finds its product-market fit. “Think about blockchain the same way you would think about the internet. You don’t use the internet directly, but use Facebook, Google, and Gmail – which are examples of applications that talk to the internet,” said Smolenski. “It is the same with blockchain – you don’t use it directly but through applications that talk to the blockchain for you and perform certain functions.” Learning Machine is essentially an application for an issuing system that talks to the blockchain through the blockcerts open standard and anchors official records to any blockchain. The company believes in digital self-sovereignty – meaning that individuals have the right to own and control their personal data. Blockcerts creates a digital record that is owned by the recipient and co-owned by the issuer, making it a direct peer-to-peer transaction, where the issuer sends the recipient an official document like a commercial driver’s license, and both parties can prove cryptographically that they own the document. “This empowers them, which means that they are not dependant on a particular vendor or software platform to own and verify their records,” said Smolenski. Learning Machine can thus identify and eradicate problems around identity fraud, double brokering, and even issues regarding lost paperwork. A universal driver ID that is owned by the driver but based in the blockchain for a decentralized verification will reduce costs over the years for all the players in the industry. The timeline is key in here. Smolenski is certain of the benefits of switching to a decentralized verification in the long run, but in the short term might cause some negative revenue impact for brokers and shippers. This would be because the blockchain-led verification processes would weed out bad actors from within the driving ecosystem, leading to a tightening in the labor pool – and causing an increase in driver pay. “But in the long term, the elimination of bad actors is going to reduce costs related to replacement records, and costs due to theft or loss, insurance, and screening,” she said. Learning Machine is a part of BiTA, and its primary objective in the consortium is to raise awareness about the capacity of blockchain to serve as a verification infrastructure for driver identity. “We want to get the coalition together to begin to think through on where the low hanging fruits are – the ones we can target right away,” said Smolenski. Keeping the Blockcerts software open-source is central to Learning Machine’s ideology. “The question right now is when blockchain technology gets adopted, would our industry go for open standards, or would they go for proprietary solutions that will lock them into specific vendors’ ecosystem,” said Smolenski. “This is a very important question, and Learning Machine is always advocating for the adoption of open standards, because in the long run, it benefits issuers, recipients, verifiers more than any proprietary solution can.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"BiTA, blockcerts, Blockchain, driver identity fraud, Learning Machine, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-14T13:45:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/bita/suddath-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BiTANewMemberPressReleaseGraphic281429-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Suddath Joins the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA)","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Suddath Global Logistics (SGL), a division of The Suddath Companies, joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an organization setting freight industry standards for blockchain use and educational forums for early adopters.

Now, Seeking Alpha writer John Engle is suggesting that the much-anticipated Tesla Semi project may be dead. The Tesla Semi was unveiled in November 2017 to great fanfare and intrigue. Did Tesla have the magic ingredient to make an all-electric truck viable that has so far eluded so many others? A series of public announcements from the likes of Pepsi, Anheuser-Busch, and UPS followed, suggesting that this truck was maybe – just maybe – going to revolutionize the industry. After the initial glitz wore off, industry experts starting dissecting the few available numbers on the truck – and it wasn’t always good. Still, many believe an all-electric Class 8 truck could work in certain applications and there remained optimism that Tesla could deliver. Then the Model 3 came along. Tesla’s Model 3 production problems are well-documented, and the long-awaited car has run into one roadblock after another as Tesla and Elon Musk try to straighten out their issues. In the company’s most recent earnings call, Engle points out that Musk never mentioned the Tesla Semi – the darling of the company just mere months ago – until he was asked specifically about it by Phil LeBeau of CNBC, who wanted to know about reservation numbers and how far along in the process the development was. Musk’s answer was eye-opening. “I actually don’t know how many reservations we have for the Semi. About 2,000? Okay. I mean, we haven’t really tried to sell the Semi. It’s not like there’s like an ongoing sales effort, so sales – orders for Semi are like opportunistic, really companies approaching us. Yeah, it’s not something we really think about much,” Musk answered. To Engle, the acknowledgement that Tesla isn’t actively selling the Semi is telling. “If the Semi looked like it could claim a significant market, then Tesla would be moving forward with it,” he wrote. “That would not necessarily require massive capital outlays toward building a production facility – not at first, anyway. But one would expect the company to at least tout the market opportunity and continue to promise that development would be coming soon. Instead, investors have been left with a rather peculiar silence.” So, what is the status of the Semi? Last week, the Semi triggered a lawsuit from Nikola Motor, which claims Tesla violated three of its patents in designing the Semi. That suit is seeking $2 billion in damages. In addition, Anheuser-Busch announced that it will purchase up to 800 Nikola Two tractor models over the next seven years as it works to convert its entire dedicated fleet to alternative power. With all the bad publicity swirling around Tesla, many are now wondering if Tesla itself will survive. To do so, Tesla may have to shut down the Semi project and funnel that money into other needs rather than try and compete in an arena that is well-stocked with legacy companies with a technology that may still be several years away from being viable in the Class 8 market. Engle surmises that with only about 2,000 orders for the Semi – a total he calls “anemic” – and Musk announcing that Tesla would be cutting its capital expense budget from $3.4 billion to less than $3 billion gives Engle reason to believe the Tesla Semi is not a priority. “Apparently, the company has “significantly cut back on its capex projections by focusing on the critical near-term needs”. In other words, it is cutting costs and pushing back growth projects to conserve cash during the still agonizingly slow Model 3 ramp. With Tesla’s net working capital deficit having reached a record level, the urge to pull back from expensive adventures makes sense from a financial perspective,” he wrote, noting that it “now seems evident that Tesla has abandoned the Semi project – or at least put it way back on the backburner.”","TAGS":"electric truck, Nikola Motor, Seeking Alpha, Semi, Tesla, Truck, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Cash Flow Corner, News, Sustainability, Technology, Trucking Equipment, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-10T17:02:28-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/fec-railway-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BiTANewMemberPressReleaseGraphic281329-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Florida East Coast Railway announces it has joined BiTA","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Based in Jacksonville, the Florida East Coast (FEC) Railway is a Class II regional railroad that provides end-to-end intermodal and carload solutions to customers who demand cost-effective and premium quality transportation solutions.

And so is the fear of missing out (FOMO) anxiety, as nearly every major company in the segment is looking to be an early adopter of the technology. Blockchain without question is futuristic, and raises a lot of exciting possibilities with a myriad of use cases that promise transparency and trustworthiness in an industry that has remained shrouded and chaotic for decades. SAP, the enterprise software major recently conducted a survey with its clients who are looking to partake in blockchain-related activities in the hope of understanding the inherent value companies perceive with blockchain. “84% of the companies we spoke to are engaged in doing something around blockchain,” said Gil Perez, Senior VP of Product and Innovation at SAP. Though a majority of the companies view blockchain as an opportunity, only a fraction of them are using the technology in production. “But the ones who are into production are not doing production at scale, but more like a very advanced pilot,” said Perez. “I think in reality, there is no real production of blockchain in the enterprise section. We might be seeing a gradual adoption and implementation over the next 12 to 18 months.” Though blockchain looks to be a perfect solution to a lot of the industry’s owes, Perez is of the opinion that a mutual consensus on adopting standards between companies would take some time to materialize. “Blockchain is a tool, and it needs to be used in the context of a business process that multiple parties are a part of,” he said. “For example, if I give you a cheque, you need to agree that it is a cheque and the systems behind it also need to agree that I’m transferring money to you. If there isn’t an agreement and trust behind that cheque, then what I gave you is just a piece of paper.” Then again, the potential of blockchain is endless. Major corporations like Maersk, Samsung, and IBM have already started working on pilot projects by securing documents like BOL through blockchain. The documents are put in an immutable decentralized ledger, through which sellers, buyers, banks and authorities can share, review and sign documents electronically and track the statuses from initiation to completion. Perez spoke about the emergence of consortiums across different niches, with focusses ranging between industries to region-specific alliances. SAP is a member of a few such consortiums, quite notable amongst them being BiTA where Perez is a board member. Consortiums go a long way in organizing and funneling intent, the absence of which would lead the technology into a black hole. For instance, the technology behind digital signatures have existed for many years now, and yet a lot of companies mandate paper copies of essential documents. This is because these are specific requirements of regulatory audits or sometimes is dictated by the law of the land. Though these issues look trivial on the veneer, it is vital to circumvent such problems for blockchain to be adopted widely across any industry. “Blockchain is one of those technologies that everybody could benefit from. There are so many use cases in here. It can help with tracking of goods, be it containers or packages – almost any physical product,” said Perez. “If you are a taking a pill, you would want to know if that is an authentic one and not counterfeit. It is the same with food, where if there is a problem we can trace it back to the origin and contain an outbreak if any.” Perez stressed that the future of blockchain is dependant on industrial cluster adoption and that its value depends on its use cases. He also stressed on the need to stay away from complacency with regard to the ‘absolute security’ that blockchain promises to provide. “I’m sure that in the next couple of years someone would come up with a way that could perhaps compromise blockchain,” he said. “Blockchain is a very secure way of keeping data right now, but we can’t rest on our laurels. We have to keep pushing forward and improving the trust and the security – because at the end of the day, that is the oil that makes this engine run.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, freight industry, SAP, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-03T18:37:47-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/dex-freight-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dexfreightbitaannouncement-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"dexFreight will attend Transparency18 as a proud member of BiTA","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"For the past 20 years, dexFreight’s co-founders have been firm believers in innovation.

You then begin to realize the scale of the world’s largest flower market in the Netherlands. Every 24 hours, 30 million plants and flowers arrive in Holland from all over the world with most passing through three huge flower auctions, all within a 60 square mile area. The main Royal FloraHolland flower operations are at Aalsmeer, Naaldwijk and Rijnsburg, comprising 1,140 loading docks and covering a 14 million square feet area, equivalent to 243 footballs fields. Around half the world’s flowers and plants pass through one of the 11 cooperatively-run regional flower auctions in Holland, with buyers and sellers bidding on trading floors just like a typical stock exchange in financial markets. Hence the term, “The Wall Street of Flowers”.  From the moment the Dutch Auction starts at 6 a.m. and flowers are purchased, every order must be delivered to a loading dock within 2 ½ hours via any one of 280 battery powered scooter carts that haul the flower and plant-laden trollies. A “Dutch Auction” is unique in that prices start high at one euro, and then buyers drive down the price, which is displayed on one of 35 massive price clocks in auction trading rooms scattered throughout the three main locations. Using a series of buttons and buying keypads, buyers frantically race to stop the clock at the price they want to pay, and then advise how many stems of plants they need to fill customer orders from the previous night. The challenge for buyers is that if they wait too long for their preferred price, they may miss out. That becomes problematic if they have already booked capacity on planes and trucks and have retail customers in Munich, Paris or London expecting fresh flowers the next morning. Buyers can also bid online from anywhere in the world and account for more than half of Royal FloraHolland’s 2,500 clients. Most flowers head to Germany (29%), U.K. (14%) and France (13%), with 90% leaving same-day by road and 10% by air to Asian, U.S. and some Russian markets. (Siberia is served by a road-air combination). The process of moving flowers and plants from the auction room to the loading dock is logistical choreography at its most brilliant. The 280 scooter cart drivers work at a frantic pace from 6-11 a.m. daily. They receive all delivery navigation instructions verbally from a TomTom “egg” as it’s known locally: an egg-shaped navigation device on each driver’s belt. After voice recognition training during the initial hiring process, each driver speaks to a computer using a headset advising their location and via a barcode scanner communicates which one of 250,000 flower and plant trolleys they are connected to. This enables the TomTom navigation system to immediately send precise delivery routing for each trolley load of flowers and plants based on the buyer’s delivery dock location. As an added safety measure, new hires wear a green vest and only haul full trolley loads (going to one destination), whereas more experienced orange-vest wearing scooter cart drivers deliver part loads to buyers on the more complex routes within the exchange. All the while truck drivers, who are paid an annual salary in Europe, are off-duty resting or asleep in their trucks waiting for their load to be ready, so as to maximize their 9-hour drive-time daily limit. In Europe, drivers can drive up to 10 hours per day twice per week. But they are limited to a 45-hour weekly total, have a 13-hour clock rule and must take 11 hours off every 24 hours. (For a look at the floor and how it operates, please see this.) According to its just-released annual report, Royal FloraHolland’s 2017 annual turnover increased 1.2% to EUR4.7b 9US$5.7b0 based on sales of 11.7 billion units, which declined 1.8% from 2016. The decline in flower and plants unit sales is due to the rise in exports from Kenya, Columbia, Ecuador and Ethiopia, all close to the equator where growers have natural light all year round, reducing the need for artificial illumination. This is why trade typically moves south to north to the major U.S. and European markets from South America and Africa, respectively. According to the 2016 Rabobank World Floriculture Report, the Netherlands is no longer the largest global exporter of cut flowers with 43% market share, with the four equator-based countries now making up 44% of exports. Their success is remarkable considering they have little domestic demand for their product, have limited air freight capacity, are exposed to volatile exchange rates, high transportation costs and an ever-changing geopolitical environment. Royal FloraHolland began operation as a grower-owned cooperative more than 125 years ago (companies must be in business for 100 years to use the term royal) by dragging wooden boats on canals to showcase their flowers to prospective buyers. Today, they are being disrupted by the internet. As part of their digital strategy to become the world’s leading digital floriculture marketplace, Royal FloraHolland launched a digital supply platform called Floriday to integrate multiple third-party vendor platforms used by growers and members. In 2017 they also assumed majority control of FloraXchange, a large digital trading platform to strengthen their global competitiveness. The bulk of their competition comes from mass-market retailers including Wal-Mart, Tesco and Aldi, who rather than trade on the volatility of flower spot prices via the auctions in Holland instead lock in growers to long-term fixed price contacts. In 2017, the company observed a shift from regular auction sales to direct sales between their growers and clients. Auction sales represented 44% of turnover while direct sales increased 6 percentage points to 56% of total revenues. Guided by Royal FloraHolland’s former CEO Lucas Vos who joined the company from Maersk in 2014, the company began a project involving Kenyan rose growers, IBM, Maersk and the Dutch government to improve efficiencies in the cut flower business and create the industry’s most highly developed supply chain. Today, Kenya has the largest international air cargo hub in Africa and has become the leading producer of roses for the European market, exporting 67% of tonnage to The Netherlands. In the process they have more than doubled Kenya’s global market share from 5% to 11% in the last decade. In one study, IBM and Maersk followed a refrigerated shipping container filled with roses from Kenya to The Netherlands. They found that almost 30 people and organizations were involved in processing the container on its 34-day journey, resulting in 200 different communications and interactions between supply chain participants, resulting in 80 well-defined bottlenecks in the supply chain. Considering paperwork and established export/import processes are so vital to global trade, they are fast becoming one of its biggest impediments. The solution was to create an electronic shipping platform by digitizing all documents using blockchain technology, with the aim of increasing transparency and security among all trading partners, reducing fraud and errors, and most importantly, decreasing time product is spent in transit. To compete in global markets, Kenyan growers put roses to sleep at zero degrees centigrade and keep them dormant for up to 3 weeks during the shipment to The Netherlands. This makes blockchain a vital component in speeding up the maritime supply chain and maintaining the competitiveness of South American and African exporters in the global cut flower market. Notwithstanding the costs of keeping flowers cool, local growers in Holland will also delay shipping flowers to market by putting them to sleep so they can take advantage of favorable spot prices. In the flower spot market, prices are highest when weather is coldest and prices lowest when it’s hottest. The only exceptions are major seasonal events such as Mother’s Day, major religious events and certain public holidays when demand and prices are always high. According to a global trade study by the World Economic Forum, the benefits of blockchain, an electronic ledger system that automatically verifies communications and customs border administration by replacing EDI and paper-based systems, can realize an additional US$1 trillion in global trade. According to IBM, Maersk already has entered close to 20% of its global containerized volume on to ledgers built on IBM’s Hyperledger blockchain platform, providing growers, shipping lines, freight forwarders, port and terminal operators, shippers and customs authorities access to the blockchain platform via a dashboard. Flowers remain a luxury item. Even though it’s still a European tradition to buy flowers at the end of the work week–so the kitchen table has flowers over the weekend–flowers have become a cultural symbol of positivity: they make us feel good, especially roses. Of the 12 billion items sold at Royal FloraHolland in 2017, roses were the dominant cut flower with 3.3 billion (28%) involving over 1,000 different rose types (species, length and color) exported globally. As the traditional Dutch Auction clock is challenged by online buyers and mass-market farm to shop retailers, another trend is emerging. Millennials are buying more and more plants and flowers, and they’re doing it in a way they are most familiar with: the click of a mouse. While Royal FloraHolland’s CEO Steven van Schilfgaarde “remains committed to reinforcing the clock and its power”, it’s clear that digital platforms and blockchain technologies will enable more streamlined farm-to-ship supply chains in the future. Online floriculture sales driven by millennials are expected to jump by 500% in the next 10 years according to one Rabobank study. A highly efficient high-speed supply chain using blockchain technology supported by reliable IT systems and data analytics will bring about more change in the next ten years than the traditional flower growers have seen in the last 125 years.","TAGS":"logistics, Netherlands, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-04-28T11:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/trac-intermodal-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TRACnewmember-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"TRAC Intermodal joins BiTA","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"TRAC Intermodal has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), an organization for the development of blockchain standards and education for the transportation industry, with the goal of bringing together leading companies that are committed o developing blockchain technology. “TRAC Intermodal has joined BiTA to better understand the role that blockchain can play in improving transparency and creating greater efficiencies among all the stakeholders in chassis provisioning,” said Keith Lovetro, President and Chief Executive Officer at TRAC Intermodal.

The CDC advisory now includes whole heads and hearts of romaine lettuce, along with chopped and bagged romaine and salad mixes that include romaine. While the government believes that the lettuce is from the Yuma, Arizona region, it doesn’t know specifically who grew, supplied or distributed the contaminated vegetables. Today, when an outbreak or recall occurs, each participant must disclose their product’s path one step forward and one step back. Regulatory bodies and retailers must take that data and piece it together manually to determine the source of the issue. The process can take days or weeks. In some cases, the source may not be known. According to Bloomberg, three problems in the food value chain that blockchain could help solve are: (1) traceability and food safety, (2) price discovery, and (3) food waste reduction. Because of its ability to improve traceability, blockchain lends itself to improving food safety both from a preventive standpoint as well as drastically reducing reaction time in the case of a recall. Using blockchain, digital ledger tech locking in shipment data, that process could be improved upon from days to mere seconds. Data captured, stored, transferred, and accounted for at each point in the supply path in real-time. Track items or transactions using a shared digital ledger significantly more efficient than any current method for logging and sharing information. In fact, it’s already happening in various sectors of the food industry. Cargill will soon offer consumers Honeysuckle White turkeys produced by family farmers. In select markets, consumers will be able to text or enter an on-package code to access the farm’s location (by state and county), view the family farm story, see photos from the farm, and read a message from the farmer, according to Meat + Poultry. Also, according to Meatingplace, Cargill recently announced that blockchain technology will soon be used for its “Birth to Burger” beef transparency initiative. Walmart brought blockchain technology to the forefront now two times. First, by conducting the pork trial in China in 2016, and second with sliced mangoes in 2017 with IBM, Dole, and Driscoll. It has now formed the Blockchain Food Safety Alliance with IBM, JD.com and the Tsinghu University National Engineering Laboratory for E-Commerce to develop standards and partnerships to enable a food safety ecosystem, and to create a standards-based method of collecting data about the origin, safety and authenticity of food. Farm origination details, batch numbers, factory and processing data, expiration dates, and shipping details are digitally connecte–within at least two seconds–to food items and entered into the blockchain at each step. Blockchain is also a big selling point for the global food industry to identify food fraud by identifying fraudulent ingredients and to trace the source of contamination during product recalls, such as the mysterious case of the currently very bad, no good romaine. Comprehensive, national recalls are expensive and can be catastrophic for reputations–not the least of which are numerous hospitalizations and serious health issues. However, heightened public awareness isn’t the only reason for more frequent instances of food contamination. The global food production system is more complex than ever, with products coming from around the world than ever before. The latest case of the E. coli outbreak is another example of the impressive capabilities already at our disposal. It is now a matter of comprehensive and intentional collaboration and compliance between parties, not the least of which are ag companies creating guiding principles for their own transparency use cases, whether the information is agronomic, land, farm management, machine, weather, or livestock. All data points can help secure the chain.

Whiteside has played major roles in engineering companies, software companies, fashion, publishing, packaging, transportation and alternative fuel companies. An entrepreneur at heart, he has helped businesses streamline their processes to save costs and grow their businesses. It didn’t take long before he realized what he was up against. Between traffic jams, wrong addresses, no one home, the reasons for packages not making it on time–or at all–were virtually endless. “It was like packages just disappeared into oblivion. You could have a package scan in, make it through the hub. We wait and we hope that the product turns up,” says Whiteside, speaking at the Home Delivery Conference 2018 in Atlanta, an event solely focused on retail logistics. “There are millions of products flying around this country ever day,” says Whiteside. “Acme does millions a day. DHL over 1.5 million a day. FedEx over 3.5 million a day. UPS over 15 million a day.” Whiteside set out to answer the question: What is actually a good delivery? “Your SLA (Service-Level Agreement) percentage may be 99 percent, but for that one percent that doesn’t get their package on time, or at all, they’re not happy, and thus you’re not happy. So, it’s necessary to get 100 percent.” The idea is to make the invisible, visible. “We track every single step. Packages are confirmed pickup or reported missing (POINT A) all the way to delivery confirmation (POINT B). It’s all about accuracy, speed, and efficiency. We also have maximum security with the SprintTag application.” It’s also all about real time information and information flow. “When you’re doing millions a day, you can’t watch all the packages but technology can. You have to be able to deal with last minute changes. For instance, GEO code errors—or what if a customer lives in a gated community and we don’t have the code? You have to account for everything.” Label Delivery App helps make it happen with real time tracking. “Also, we trying to find missing orders in time to remake. We can proactively (in real time) tell the customer of an issue. Also with the delivery app we can actually track the delivery of the product.” They can monitor exactly where a package is. Not only that, but other important aspects like temperature. “We can track and prove that we never let a package go over a prescribed amount,” says Whiteside. “We literally have photographic proof of delivery, and that’s our goal. We aim for the perfect delivery.” Omnichannel is a multichannel approach to sales that seeks to provide the customer with a seamless shopping experience whether the customer is shopping online from a desktop or mobile device, by telephone or in a bricks and mortar store. Whiteside says that in order to meet their goal of perfection they need to follow “elastic logistics trends.” Things change rapidly, month-to-month, week-to-week, even daily. “There are huge peaks and troughs even throughout the week, much less seasonal,” he says. “One approach we take is to market locally using logistics. We also ask for delivery choices. For the retailers what everyone cares about at the end of the day is to increase their volume.” “Brick and mortars are here to stay, by the way,” says Whiteside. “I think brick and mortar is on the uptick. Everyone is trying to achieve ‘ship from store,’ and for a driver to pickup locally and make the delivery. By using the store and shipping locally you can also learn people’s buying habits. Often when people make a purchase online it’s like from a black hole. It can be coming from anywhere. Also we’re working on automatic van sortation.” It takes passion and commitment, and the ability to wear a lot of hats, not the least of which is knowing best practices in the technical application. Visible and transparent is the name of the game. And security. All of which is better performance and then customer satisfaction.

The early adopters of various technologies “will start to really get some traction and solve problems that people have.” Looking to 2026, blockchain technology “will have a level of maturity that will make it like a cell phone,” Fuller added. “It isn’t just cool, it is something that is accepted.” What you’ll see before that in the years to 2021, according to Fuller, will be pilots that have blockchain as the backbone of their technology. The areas that the pilots are involved in now span a wide range, Fuller said, with payments being particularly notable. “The idea that you can settle at the end of the transaction, upon delivery, is exciting,” he said. Driving that sort of rapid payment will be smart contracts. Fuller provided a basic example, where he and a colleague placed a bet on the outcome of a sporting event. Now, when the game is completed–triggering the “contract” between the two–it is up to the loser to pay the winner, with the speed of that action less than certain. It is a completely manual process with questionable levels of trust. But in a smart contract built on a distributed ledger, the contract would take in a triggering event–like a score–and complete the payment automatically. The rapid payment to the driver noted by Fuller in the earlier example would be triggered by a variety of inputs, including the most basic test: did the freight make it to the end customer? When all of the triggers are tripped, the payment can be made. The use cases that Fuller sees numerous companies pursuing are more extensive than payments. Financing purchases of vehicles on a per mile basis becomes a possibility, because a blockchain-based record of mileage history of a vehicle in the secondary market would be immutable, a far cry from the data now supplied by an odometer with all of the questions of trust surrounding that. Maintenance records on ledgers perform approximately the same function. “I would know every time that the truck was serviced, and I can trust the information on such things as parts and warranties,” Fuller said. Many of those potential applications will be on display next month at the Demo Day activities of Transparency ’18, a BiTA sponsored event in Atlanta. Fuller said about 40 developers will be demonstrating their transportation-based solutions to the audience, with about half of them using blockchain technology in their application. Fuller described how blockchain technology might have affected a recent news story in the trucking world: the conviction of Pilot Flying J President Mark Hazelwood on charges that his company failed to deliver on promised fuel discounts. If those price agreements had been stored on a distributed ledger, with shared immutable records being held by buyer and seller (presumably the details of the transaction would not necessarily have been known to all parties on the ledger), the evidence of the initial transaction as well as the adherence to it would not have been in question, Fuller said. The existence of that data might have discouraged Hazelwood from even trying to implement his plans. “There are people who believe in the future that a truck company can buy its fuel, negotiate its own discount and there is no way the seller can alter that transaction,” he said.  In a less-sinister example, Fuller talked about an RFP between shipper and carrier that has no hard and fast guarantees and that runs the risk of either a shipper not actually moving the quantities specified in the RFP, or the carrier failing to supply the full number of trucks initially agreed upon. The parameters of the RFP that is now far from firm can, in the future, be on a ledger, with no question about its specifications and agreements. In a discussion about who are the winners and losers as the world moves toward 2021—and 2026–Fuller described a list of far more winners than losers. Even many of the losers, he said, can avoid that fate if they realize their shortcomings that could be revealed by the extensive use of the technology. For example, Fuller challenged the idea that brokers would all be disintermediated by blockchain, singling out C.H. Robinson and Coyote as the type of companies “that have an opportunity to provide a ton of value…they are well-suited for that.” But “somebody not playing by these rules will be outed,” he said. “It will be more difficult for brokers who aren’t paying attention.” Fuller did caution that blockchain does not provide the answer to all challenges. For example, the slow speed of the bitcoin blockchain operates at a fraction of the speed that something like the Visa or MasterCard system operates. “A lot of times, companies or executives have the idea that blockchain can solve all problems, and in reality some relationship data bases are actually superior,” Fuller said. “They can solve it already.” Among the winners cited by Fuller, and probably the most important: consumers are winners.","TAGS":"Blockchain, webinar, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Kingston","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Webinar, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-04-12T22:30:31-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/3pl-custom-pro-logistics-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CPLnewmember-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"3PL Custom Pro Logistics joins BiTA","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Custom Pro Logistics, a Cincinnati based 3PL, is excited to announce its membership in the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). “We are excited to be a part of such a forward-thinking alliance. The application of blockchain to the transportation industry is going to create greater efficiencies and transparency unlike anything ever seen before. We firmly believe this is where the industry is heading, and the combination of technology with good old-fashioned customer service will be the key to winning in a highly competitive and dynamic logistics environment. Being a member of BiTA will allow us to keep a finger on the pulse of where the industry is moving and also gain greater insight into the open data standards that will be fundamental to successful implementation and adoption of this new technology. It is very exciting to be involved in this process, as no organization or industry for that matter can blindly ignore the value blockchain can add,” said Devin Reilly, President of Custom Pro Logistics. Founded in May of 2013, Custom Pro Logistics has experienced double and triple digit growth year-over-year since its inception. Custom Pro specializes in refrigerated transportation solutions and works with hundreds of growers, shippers, and manufacturers of fresh and frozen foods and has a deep understanding of the unique intricacies and requirements needed to ensure proper transport and food safety. It has been this specific knowledge along with an intense focus on customer service that has not only contributed to CPL’s rapid growth but also driven it. Custom Pro is a data driven enterprise that embraces change within the industry and is always looking to find new solutions to old challenges.  Reilly went on to say that keeping up with new regulations, industry trends, and emerging technologies has always been fundamental to the value a 3PL adds to any supply chain. “For instance, when the FSMA (Food Safety Modernization act) went into effect last year we knew that we had to rethink our operations and how we go about doing things. Ultimately, we had to adapt and change our processes to be in compliance. We see the introduction of blockchain technology as just another change within the industry that will require us to adapt as well. In the long term, the use of blockchain with recognized standards for the industry will likely have an even greater impact on our customer’s cold chains than the FSMA regulations. So we welcome this new technology as we feel it will not only improve food safety as a whole but also help 3PLs identify problems more quickly within our customer’s supply chains. We firmly believe that this type of transformational technology will empower 3PLs to prevent future problems, which at the end of the day is our job as a trusted 3PL. Anything that allows us to provide more value to our customers we are fans of and we look forward to a day in which we can assist our customers in ways that would have been unimaginable a few short years ago .” Founded in August 2017, the Blockchain in Transport Alliance is a forum for promotion, education, and encouragement to develop and adopt blockchain applications in the trucking, transportation, and logistics industry. BiTA’s goal is for members to participate, discuss, create, and adopt industry standard uses of blockchain applications and to provide clarity and direction for the development of blockchain technology in the trucking industry in a manner that will create efficiency, transparency, and foster trust. BiTA standards are intended to create a common framework to help organizations develop and adopt blockchain technology. Custom Pro Logistics is headquartered in the historic Cincinnati neighborhood known as Over-the-Rhine with offices in San Diego, Las Vegas, and Austin. Over-the-Rhine has been described as one of the most promising urban areas for revitalization in the United States and the region as a whole has become a logistics hotspot because of its central location and explosive economic growth of the logistics sector. In addition, offering refrigerated transportation solutions, Custom Pro offers, full truckload brokerage of flatbed and dry vans, as well as port drayage, freight forwarding capabilities, Last mile logistics, and LTL operations nationwide.","TAGS":"BiTA, Blockchain in transport alliance, Custom Pro Logistics, logistics, Supply chain, Transparency, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-04-11T14:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/chainio-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chainio_Blockchain-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BiTA gets a new member: Chain.io","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Chain.io, a provider of systems integration services for logistics providers, proudly announces that it has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA).

And maybe that communication is going to be produced by sharing vital data on a distributed ledger. Through numerous presentations at both the first day’s keynote for both the annual Modex meeting and Georgia Logistics Summit for the supply chain industry in Atlanta, that was the message that could be extracted. A speaker would within minutes of each other note that technology is disrupting every player in the supply chain, but that to stay with the changes, you needed to communicate with your counterparties. Juan Perez, the CIO and chief engineering officer of local company UPS, kicked that theme off at the start of the day, when he declared that the brown-and-yellow is “more than ever before, a technology company.” And that didn’t apply just to UPS, he said; “whatever you do” in the supply chain, “you work for a technology company.” So what has UPS done to meet those goals? What Perez talked about was far more than just implementing new technology. “We had to disrupt ourselves,” he said in his address. But much of what he discussed involved focusing on customers, with some alliteration thrown in: “enhanced mobility…empower consumers…evolving technologies” were described as the company’s “innovative initiatives.” Perez described the “flexible shopper” as somebody who wanted to go “from one channel to the next channel and to the next channel. At the end of the day, we need to make sure that technology is easy, pleasant and efficient to use. Customers are defining these experiences. They want control of their delivery experience.” Perez talked about the latest developments in UPS’ ORION system, which he said is the company’s “best example” of its “robust technology.” ORION stands for On-Road Integration, Optimization and Navigation. When first introduced, it would provide a driver with a plan for the day that kept mileage down to a minimum and saved the company millions of miles driven, millions of gallons of fuel consumed, and significant reductions in CO2 emissions, Perez said. But more recently, ORION’s technology has been updated so that it isn’t just a one-and-done plan for the day. Rather, according to Perez, it can be updated over the course of the day to further improve the driver’s performance. But every time Perez laid out a technological change, he kept coming back to management. “We had to create a culture of innovation,” he said. “We had to create a rewards system and the discipline to support innovation.” And that might mean emphasizing “strategy over governance,” avoiding where the latter trumps the innovation inherent in the former. Companies need to be, Perez said, “constructively dissatisfied.” And to do that, he said the views of everybody right down the line, including the drivers, need to be taken into account. A company needs to “free your geniuses.” Perez joked that if he wanted the best and most honest feedback about the company’s technological innovations, “go talk to the drivers.” Among the other topics that were featured in the dozens of seminars through the day: 3PLs: Bryan Jensen, the chairman and executive vice president of St. Onge Company, a supply chain consulting firm, said the relationship between a shipper and its contracted third-party logistics company is going to be troubled “if you don’t treat each other like a partner.” And it’s particularly important where the product being shipped is subject to significant regulation. For example, a company using a 3PL to ship Styrofoam cups is going to have a significantly different set of needs that one shipping pharmaceuticals regulated by any number of governments, Jensen said. In his accompanying slides, Jensen talked about the “increased emphases on rules and regulations…cosmetics and drugs are particularly challenging.” And the slides drove home the message of necessary cooperation: “3PLs are often viewed as another vendor, not as a partner by the shipper.” Jensen provided data on the types of operations outsourced to 3PLs. In a survey from the company’s 2018 Third Party Logistics study, 83% of the respondents said they outsources domestic transportation, and 66% outsourced warehousing. Just under that at 63% was international transportation, with a surprisingly large drop to customs brokerage at 46%, showing no clear correlation with the amount of international transportation outsourcing. Jensen did show numbers that were positive for the industry. Quoting a report by Armstrong \u0026 Associates, it showed logistics costs rising 57.6% between 2010 and a projected total of $11.2 billion 2021. But 3PL revenue is shown rising even more, up 68% to $1.149 billion from $681 million. Jensen said one of the trends in the industry has been acquisitions and consolidation, joking that he thought XPO Logistics was going to buy everybody. But his accompanying slide asked a more existential question: “Will Amazon or Home Depot acquire a 3PL?” Blockchain: Data shown by Jensen from the 3PL study showed 3PL wariness over blockchain, interesting since supply chains have long been seen as a part of the economy that can most benefit from the sharing of data on a public or permissioned ledger. In the survey results, 67% of the shippers said they “don’t know enough (about blockchain) at this time to rate,” while 62% of 3PLs gave the same answer. In another question though, a far greater number of 3PLs than shippers did say that they could “see a potential application but not yet engaged.” Still, the largest percentage answer in that question was “not yet talking about blockchain.” A more optimistic view of the potential of distributed ledger technology was provided by Yvan Caceres of Deloitte Consulting in an address titled “Successfully Navigating the Last Mile.” That address was part of a series about Smart Cities, and cutting down congestion is a necessary part of any sort of Smart Cities initiatives. It would involve far more use of dropping parcels off at collection centers or so-called “lockers.” Just-in-time delivery gets more important; the delivery of materials needs to be able to “land that unit on any operation,” Caceres said. And the best solution to that would be a distributed ledger, Caceres said. Labor: It isn’t just trucking companies looking for employees. Jensen opened up his remarks on 3PLs with “Finding New Talent” at the top of his first slide. Peter Schnorbach, senior director of product management at Manhattan Associates, said rising minimum wage laws in many states pose a significant employee issue for many companies involved in a supply chain. A company with 500 workers seeing their hourly wage workers get a $1 per hour kick as a result of a rising minimum wage will see its labor bill rise $1 million per year.” Schnorbach also bucked conventional wisdom by pushing against the oft-heard complaints about millennials in the work force. They are oriented toward mobile technology, they “thrive on recognition,” they “work hard and we can learn a lot from them.” ELDs: It wouldn’t be a full day without some reference to ELDs. On the enormous convention floor, a representative from one airline that shall rename unidentified said his freight business in the last month or two had risen about 5%. He said he believed that reduced trucking capacity as a result of the ELD implementation was a reason, though he conceded he had nothing to base that on, raising yet another possibility of ELDs becoming the catch-all rationale for anything in the market that breaks with previous trends.","TAGS":"3PLs, Blockchain, ELDs, Logsitics, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Kingston","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-04-09T23:39:59-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain-webinar-freightwaves","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/blockchainwebinar-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain \u0026 Fleet Management: a Spireon webinar with Craig Fuller","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain isn’t just an industry disruptor, it’s technology that will revolutionize the way people do business.

Major shippers like Shaw Industries and JD.com have joined BiTA to collaborate with parcel carriers like FedEx and UPS, truckload carriers like JB Hunt, Schneider, 3PLs like Coyote, Echo, software companies like TMW, McLeod, and Descartes, finance organizations such as Triumph Capital, insurance companies, law firms, tech startups, and telematics providers. BiTA’s mission is to educate the industry about blockchain and create the open data standards crucial to blockchain’s successful implementation. FreightWaves caught up with Ken Craig, VP of Special Projects at McLeod Software and co-founder of BiTA, to talk about the organization’s early days and the impetus behind its formation. “We have a group at McLeod called the ‘Over the horizon’ group,” said Craig, “and our charter is to stay abreast of everything that’s coming at the industry from the future—autonomous technology, platooning, AI, or machine learning—and blockchain fits into that category. We had been investigating it for quite some time. We were trying to plan a session on blockchain for our user conference in September, but we could find very little trucking-specific material on the subject.” Then Ken Craig eventually made contact with Craig Fuller, who was already brainstorming the idea of an industry alliance around blockchain. The two got to talking and immediately bonded over their shared vision of the importance of data standards. Ken Craig recalled, “My immediate reaction was, ‘We have to do this!\u0027” “I did some work in the health care industry,” recounted Ken Craig. “Congress pushed out a law requiring doctors to use EMRs—electronic medical records—but there were never any standards created. Now there are over 200 branded systems generating these records, they can’t talk to each other, and the whole thing is a mess. However, in Europe, you can visit a doctor in Italy and go to a doctor in Spain the next week and the patient data is there, consistent, and easily accessible.” “When you talk about the supply chain,” said Craig, “you can’t just solve one problem without impacting other players and parts in the chain, and standards become even more important. In Europe, they have these consortiums, but the government controls them—when you participate, you have the law laid down for you. But we’re trying to do this with a voluntary organization, and it’s a bigger challenge.” “It wasn’t so much that [BiTA] wanted to pass edicts, but we had to try to develop common standards around data and use cases… if we’re ever going to realize the potential of blockchain, we’ve got to play together, and we needed a body that could provide that leverage,” explained Craig. BiTA saw the opportunity to not only help the supply chain benefit from standards, but also to avoid another EDI mess where ‘standards that were never standardized’ continue to create tremendous inefficiencies. As Craig Fuller stated, “Blockchain by its nature is distributed and owned by no single person. It is open source and requires collaboration and standards. We are helping to launch BiTA as a way to initiate dialogue between parties in the trucking ecosystem,” says Fuller. “We have relationships with many of the Alliance members that are not related to blockchain, but the conversation around blockchain keeps coming up and many of them are exploring blockchain, but most are concerned about making significant investments because of the lack of standards and commercial adoption.” Craig said that many applicants to BiTA understand the risk of being a laggard in adopting new technology, and that FOMO—the ‘fear of missing out’—motivated the surge of interest in the organization last fall when cryptocurrencies were in the news. But industry participants don’t have as firm a grasp on the risk of over-investing in immature technology that is not yet commercially viable. BiTA helps its membership manage both of those risks, taking in and processing input from diverse viewpoints and keeping everyone on the same page. “If we’re not careful, what always happens when new technology comes out is that people want to put it everywhere,” said Craig. “We’re already seeing some disingenuous marketing where companies want to put something on a private blockchain that is in fact perfectly suited to a normal relational database, and then claim the benefits as being related to blockchain.” The key, though, is that players from all different points in the supply chain work on the technology together—everyone needs to be integrated into the blockchain network for it to really be valuable. “You can’t just build one piece of a mousetrap—you don’t really have anything until you have the components there—and that’s the kind of the way blockchain works,” said Craig. “I tell companies ‘go ahead, right now, and start learning about blockchain. Get in the Ethereum and HyperLedger sandboxes and start playing around.’ But blockchain isn’t going to fix a bad process. It’s potentially disruptive, but it’s very immature, but CEOs should be in the learning and testing phase, maybe do a proof of concept with a partner. But the technology isn’t ripe for a commercial application—we still need to get everyone on board before we can realize the value.” Ken Craig also spoke about why McLeod was investing in blockchain and participating in BiTA. “We all know the use cases for the food chain around the whole question of provenance: where a piece of fruit is picked, when it’s palletized, when it crosses the border, etc, and we know there’s a tremendous ROI there. But there’s plenty of things that don’t require blockchain. Working with BiTA members, talking through ideas with different players, and helping define the use cases actually protects our customers and helps them understand where the value lies with this technology. We want our customers to feel comfortable that blockchain will provide them what they need to remain vital and competitive.” “One thing McLeod does with our architecture is—well, we try not to just throw software at people; we try not to add a bunch of features and present them to our customers. Instead, we extend our architecture with adjunct tools and allow our customers to build their own automated processes and do deep dive analytics for continuous improvement. They love this. Several years ago we created a visual workflow management tool for business process automation, FlowLogix, that gives our customers an easy way to automate workflows and processes. We realized that one of the issues with smart contracts is that business people create the rules and requirements for the contract, then hand it over to a programmer to code, but then that code can’t be validated by the would-be parties to the contract. And once that is placed into a block as a smart contract it is immutable.” “So what we said,” continued Craig, “is that we can take our FlowLogix tool, and once the business people create the logic and validate the requirements, the tool automatically generates the code required to support that business process… we just wanted to see if we could do it. It’s not something we’re marketing right now, but it will be part of our approach once we’re ready for commercial applications…. we’re demo-ing this function at Transparency18.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"BiTA, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, McLeod Software, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Paul Hampstead","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-04-04T11:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/fraight-ai-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/blockchainspaceshutterstock-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"AI-enabled freight brokerage Fraight AI joins BiTA","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Fraight AI, the industry’s first AI-enabled freight brokerage, announced today that it has joined BiTA. Fraight specializes in current applications of next generation technology, including Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain. Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) (BiTA) is the first of its kind: an organization created by transportation and logistics industry leaders with the unified mission of developing a standards framework for blockchain, educating the market on blockchain applications, and encouraging the use of those applications through exemplary implementation. Fraight Founder and CEO Parker Holcomb currently serves as the Chairman of TIA Blockchain Committee. He will be presenting alongside FreightWave’s Daniel Pickett at the TIA 2018 Capital Ideas Conference on April 11th in Palm Springs, CA. “Our team at Fraight AI is excited to collaborate with other future focused companies to help move our industry forward. We realize that supply chains have a need for innovation and believe that it will take an industry wide effort to understand the best way to get there. As a BiTA member we look forward to sharing our technology expertise and learning from others on how to continually innovate in alignment with our customers and carriers.”, says Holcomb. In essence, blockchain is a type of digital ledger technology (DLT) comprised of unalterable, digitally recorded data called ‘blocks’ that are shared between a privately or publicly distributed network. Once recorded via a cryptographic signature, the data in any given block cannot be changed without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires the consent from the other network participants.

Though the idea is still largely perceived to be inherently associated with cryptocurrency, the advantages that come with adopting this technology in logistics and supply chain is immense – especially with regard to security and tracking. Imagine the metamorphosis of grapes from being a juicy fruit to ending up in a wine bottle. The journey starts out from the vineyards, from where the grapes are plucked, dried, crushed and fermented, which is then sent out to the industry, coming out neatly bottled and store ready. It is quite obvious that the process chain is long and riddled with a lot of stakeholders at every turn, before it ends up on the consumer’s table. As a consumer or a key stakeholder in the chain, the uncertainties involved in the process is unsettling, as there are no efficient methods to track the supply chain at every step of the way. Enter blockchain – an immutable ledger of publicly stored and distributed information, with the ability to bring transparency into the whole supply chain process. Injecting blockchain into supply chains requires a concerted effort not only from the market players, but also from technology firms that have the technical wherewithal to develop technology that can expedite and simplify its adoption. IBM in its flagship conference IBM Think 2018, has unveiled a chip which it claims to be the world’s smallest computer. This is relevant to the context of blockchain because this chip could pave the way for precise tracking and data relaying across the supply chain. The computer which is the size of a grain of salt has a few hundred thousand transistors, RAM, a solar cell and a communications module embedded inside it – providing it the calculating power of a chip from 1990. The tiny chip is seen as an extension of IBM’s crypto anchor program, which it believes can prevent leakages in the supply chain and stop bad players trying to game the system. The idea is to create digital fingerprints that are tamper-proof, which can be embedded into products and linked to blockchain to make the records immutable. The chip is a computing platform that can monitor, store, and analyze data, while being stuck to a product and can verify real-time the condition of the product being transported across the supply chain. This helps the key players to identify the authenticity of the product in question, flushing out the possibilities of counterfeit goods from entering the system. The cost of manufacturing the chip is expected to cost less than ten cents, making it affordable to use across a variety of supply chains. Though it is still in the laboratory testing phase, IBM is looking to release the first version in 18 months. One of the possible use cases in the initial stages of this technology, could be to implement it in tandem with blockchain across industries like fashion, healthcare, and electronics – where there is an exceptionally high number of counterfeit products permeating the supply chain through different rogue players. Innovation in the field of edible electronics could be combined with blockchain for extensively monitoring the food industry. Researchers from Rice University’s Smalley-Curl Institute and the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev have successfully etched edible circuits on bread, which gives a 360-degree vision into the food supply chain – right from the farm to the fork. The process involves the use of laser-induced graphene (LIG), which can carry electricity through carbon-rich products like bread and potatoes. This technology can allow manufacturers to tag edible items with RFID code, completing the tracking loop. Supply chains are amongst the most vital cogs in the workings of the society, and it has not had a technology revolution for ages now. But with blockchain and tracking technologies sprouting up, the tidal waves of a disruption is incoming.

The companies hope to improve the way VTG’s 80,000 railcars assets are tracked by applying blockchain technology. The sensors will also be applied to shipping containers and similar assets to track updates related to mileage spanned, borders crossed and events relevant to delays that a shipment might encounter mid-transit. Any of these elements will trigger Nexiot’s self-sustaining sensors, documenting information sent out as messages to the distributed database every 5 minutes. Nexiot’s Director of Marketing and Sales, Daniel MacGregor, described these enhancements as a way to “build transparency, trust and legal compliance to our management solution, as the data records are legally binding.” These sensors were already deployed as of January 2018, gathering a total of more than 100 million data points in that month alone. The blockchain technology infused in these sensors improved data collected by adding a date-and-time stamp. With the date and time stamped in the transaction, it added credibility to the proof of third party quality and proof of service delivery metrics. MacGregor added, “This blockchain technology also opens the door to the introduction of Smart Digital Contracts. Our sensors have already established a new level of accuracy for contract stipulations of location and location-based events.” Based on the impressive volume of data gathered for the first month of 2018, MacGregor is optimistic moving forward. “By 2019, it is estimated that 20% of all IoT deployments will have basic levels of blockchain services and this development promises to deliver a long overdue layer of services to enhance quality in logistics.

In Chapter 9 of the 2018 Joint Economic Report, released just last week, blockchain is widely praised. Among other things, the report estimates the costs of cyberattacks, and the economic benefits from protecting private property and contract integrity. How can it be possible that the government—the source of the lawmaking regulatory bodies—would actually praise a technology that is being (for all intents and purposes) censored from major internet platforms? What are the motivations and pressures these platforms are facing in today’s climate? What does this all mean for the supply chain and the movement of commercial freight? In an effort to get some answers we reached out cryptocurrency and blockchain experts. We spoke with NodeSource founder and CEO, Joe McCann, and Global Blockchain Technologies president and COO, Shidar Gouran. McCann says, “Unfortunately, the term of the blocking by Google, Facebook and now Twitter will likely persist for some time until either clear regulation by the SEC is drafted and enacted, which is meant to protect the consumer, or there is a material impact to the top lines of said companies, which is highly unlikely.” Gouran says, “On one hand they’re banning [Google, Facebook, Twitter], but at the exact same time they’re also putting huge resources into researching these topics for their own various products. It’s a two-way street really. You have regulators who want to control everything, and you need reform in that space, but you also need freedom for startups to pioneer. What France is doing is great. Keep on top of it but don’t put up huge barriers. “It’s more about the bigger picture that the regulators are afraid of losing control.” “To block the word blockchain is inane,” says McCann. “Blockchain is a decentralized database, for lack of a better phrase, that often has economic incentives baked into its support and maintenance, issued in the form of a cryptoasset, but it is not required. In fact, there are a number of companies focusing on private and enterprise use cases of blockchain technology which would be collateral damage from the banning efforts being put in place today. “The relationship is not required, but useful, as the support and maintenance of any blockchain requires some sort of incentive for users to run a node on the blockchain to verify new blocks. If this is not tied to some sort of asset, then another incentive structure needs to be created and implemented.” How necessary is the relationship between a digital currency like bitcoin and blockchain? Are digital currencies a necessary element of building blockchain as a proof of concept? “Many folks conflate blockchain and bitcoin, but the asset could not be more different than the blockchain itself. It’s all about incentives. If altruism was a good enough incentive, people would not need the attraction to an asset that has value to support a blockchain,” says McCann. “They’re completely interdependent at this point,” says Gouran. “It’s a problem of computer science, and has been for many years. How do two systems that have different needs and designs, but are also interdependent co-exist? It’s like putting two queen bees in two different trees side by side. Both hives die because there’s confusion between the central authority. While there is no bank that has solved the issue yet, I will say that all the central banks are experimenting with digital currencies to see how they work.” Some have argued that blockchains (or DLTs) actually don’t solve supply chain visibility. They argue this is an IoT (Internet of Things) problem that needs an IoT solution based on a cloud blockchain, or other database; a network of connected sensors on top of the blockchain. Gouran disagrees. “No, that’s not correct,” he says. “Blockchain is about grabbing an asset (and social network) without a central authority. For supply chains it makes a tremendous amount of sense. If I’m a bank and I know where everyone is going and having the instant settlement and where things are going without everyone having to talk, that’s a big deal. “Marrying trade and finance is a thing blockchains will do really well. Every piece is automatically settled,” Gouran adds. “It’s the main point of it, you can get the whole view without any effort because all the different ledgers are synced together.” Another issue companies seem to be facing as they actively seek to make digital investments is trying to do too much too soon, and instead of fast-tracking to the next level of digital maturity, they’re actually taking an avoidable detour. How can companies know? “There’s a big problem—blockchains aren’t the solution for everything,” says Gouran. “A lot get a boost out of hype. For the trade industry, though, it’s not hype. Trade finance and supply chain can be completely revolutionized by this technology right now.” “Now, what about if I don’t want a lot of transparency? What if I do want an authority? That’s different. I don’t need blockchain. But in trade finance that’s not the reality. You don’t want one party in charge. It’s impossible to coordinate unless everyone has access to the same information.” “For 90% of business it may be nonsense, but the 10% where it makes sense will change the world,” he adds. Is blockchain the silver bullet projected to solve all the current issues in the supply chain? For the most part, yes. However, blockchains will need to be used smartly with many existing solutions and frameworks to yield the best results. The value of the network goes up as more and more participants join the system. Getting all parties comfortable with the change will be key. Blockchains are best suited where the supply chain is owned or participated in by multiple parties none of which want to relinquish complete control of record keeping to anyone else. This provides the groundwork of creating and maintaining a shared database. Add to it the emergence of smart contracts and blockchain becomes an attractive comprehensive solution. This can avoid delays, paperwork, contractual conflicts and expensive litigations. And if this entire process needs regulatory oversight from one or multiple parties, then they become the near perfect solution, providing visibility of transactions to regulators without the need of any additional filing.

Lab-simulations show how blockchain could handle more than seven billion unique serial numbers and 1,500 transactions per second.” DHL and Accenture’s pharmaceutical prototype is just one of the use cases highlighted in their trend report. Blockchain technology shows great promise for dramatically improving the efficiency and reliability of supply chains in all industries. Just today, Accenture also announced a “revolutionary” blockchain solution for a supply-chain consortium involving AB InBev, Accenture, APL, Kuehne + Nagel and a European customs organization. This is another emerging model, companies banding together to create a consortium, like B3i, a group of 15 insurance companies collaborating to increase transaction efficiency. According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), global spending on blockchain solutions is forecast to reach $2.1 billion in 2018, more than double the $945 million spent in 2017. In 2021 annual spending is expected to reach $9.7 billion, according to IDC Worldwide Semiannual Blockchain Spending Guide, 2017H1. The potential for blockchain in logistics is akin to the internet in the ‘90s. The current challenges involve some necessary huge technical strides to move from concept and pilot application to actually deploying viable solutions, mostly around scalability and power usage. Blockchain technology could drive the most significant change in society since the American Revolution, U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer says, speaking at the D.C. Blockchain Summit last week. But only if regulators resist the temptation to be heavy-handed. “But the transformative potential of blockchain and cryptocurrencies will never be fulfilled if regulators overreach, said Emmer. “We have to be vigilant and we have to remember that you create room for innovation when you don’t stifle it,” said Emmer. “And too much regulation, too many regulators has a tendency to put a wet blanket on it.” Also last week at the Cantech Investment Conference, Frank Holmes, the chairman of HIVE Blockchain Technologies, spoke on a panel titled “Blockchain: Hype or Hope?” along with Anthony Di Iorio of Ethereum and Jaxx Wallet and Kevin Rooke of Coinsquare. Cantech is Canada’s largest technology investment conference, which brings together over 3,5000 investors and more than 100 tech companies. The panelists were asked if they were concerned about regulation. “No, I think it’s about education,” says Anthony Di Iorio. “The key is trying to educate people about the technology, about what this is going to for sectors, for jobs. I think that’s one of the things that really been missing, is ways to break it down for them, to show them how they can benefit from these technologies. The countries that do this and who help the technology build itself are going to be the real winners.” Rooke of Coinsquare says across the industry most seem to realize that regulation is a good thing. “It is actually a sign of market maturity. You do have to work with regulators and make sure we’re on the same page moving forward. And again we don’t really know where things are going to go, but overall it’s a good thing.” Di Iorio said, “I think one of the things about internet-unlocked information, information 1s\u00260s—and now value is 1s\u00260s as well—is good. Information should be free, and information should be able to expand beyond borders. I think we’re actually going to look back and say ‘Wow we actually tried to control value within our borders. And I think we are going to have regulations, but I think information is value and it should expand beyond borders. One thing we need to remember is these technologies are decentralized, and regulation may have its place, but how can we look for better alternatives and ways to tackle the real problems. Back in the day people were saying the same thing about the internet. The real value of what these technologies can do humankind is what we should be focused on, and I think the governments and the ones who realize that early will be the ones that distinguish themselves.” Frank Holmes says Hive is working with Genesis mining, the largest cloud-based company to outsource to do your mining with. “They go with stranded electricity,” he says. “Whether it’s in Eastern Europe or Canada where there are pulp mills that are gone. You’re actually using surplus energy in Iceland that’s geothermal energy. You get this story that we’re using more electricity in the industry than the country of Denmark, and it’s so greatly exaggerated. I think there will be a point where all these pockets of electricity that are not connected to a grid, that are doing nothing, like Northern Quebec, Manitoba, British Columbia, and some places in Ontario, that will all of a sudden benefit from this.” Success also depends on all parties working together to transform legacy processes and to jointly adopt new ways of creating logistics value. Organizational transformation and a willingness to collaborate between all stakeholders is increasingly the topic of conversation. While Bitcoin is based on a public ledger that anyone can use to make secure financial transactions, Accenture is focused on building private blockchains that only its clients, their business partners and customers can access. It’s seeing the most demand in three areas: financial services, supply chain and identity. But why does Accenture need to use blockchain to link entities together privately, instead of a simple database? According to David Treat, managing director and co-head of Accenture’s global blockchain practice, it comes down to trust. Historically, organizations have rarely trusted one company to become a central data repository, “either because of the proprietary value of their data or due to a lack of trust in others.” According to JP Morgan blockchain head, Amber Baldet, private blockchains are faced with the same concerns as anyone building public blockchains today. “These problems really aren’t so far apart, it’s just that people are trying to solve the problems in different ways,” Baldet said at EthCC, an ethereum conference in Paris this past Friday. According to Baldet, who speaks with enterprises, business, central banks and corporates about blockhains, the conversations of private-public are crucial to mutually educate and improve both sectors of the industry. “I don’t think those two things [public and private blockchains] need to be so different or are necessarily mutually exclusive.” Similarly, Accenture’s projects with supply chain companies are based on interparty communication to bring a product from a factory to a store shelf. A blockchain can serve as one system that countless companies can plug into and are more likely to trust. Accenture is also a founding member of a public-private partnership called ID2020 that aims to solve a wide range of identity problems, from helping the one billion people around the world who don’t have an official identity to solving the customer-service headache of having to provide your information every time you deal with a company or service provider. Blockchain’s digital potential for the supply chain industry is gaining so much traction because of the inefficiencies of tracking goods through so many paper-based sources and multiple interfaces. The open and collaborative approaches between regulators and innovators, public and private blockchains, and related stakeholding consortiums, is key to gaining traction in the industry and the required market acceptance.

The Summit marries high-growth technology companies with investors that want to establish relationships with the founders. Some of the companies are looking for capital, others are just interested in laying the groundwork for future capital raises or to hear some of the sharpest minds in how to scale a technology company. FreightWaves attended both as a presenter and as an observer. We had the opportunity to jump into a number of great sessions at the event. One of the speakers was Paul Brody, the Global Innovation Leader of Blockchain for EY. The big four consulting firm is always on the cutting edge of understanding innovation and has been studying enterprise blockchain and their uses cases. Paul joined EY in 2015 after serving as a Vice President of Mobile and IoT at IBM. He currently oversees the blockchain efforts for EY. Paul was not shy about his belief that most ICOs are going to zero and the use case in enterprise applications is questionable. His view is that most investors lack the sophistication to “match the statements in the SAFT to the software code” and often lack an appreciation for the challenges of commercial adoption. According to Coindesk, SAFTs stand for “Simple Agreements for Future Tokens.” SAFTs are issued during the ICO process to explain the opportunities and risks that are involved in investing in floated crypto currencies. He believes that fiat currencies in the US, Europe, and Japan are far superior to tokens that have been generated during ICO processes. According to Paul, “we looked at 400 ICOs from 2017; 60% have already closed up shop. Never bring a product to market. Most investors do not understand the risk.” His view of ICOs boiled down to a single description: most ICOs as “non-refundable” donations to for-profit companies. He believes that countries with trusted banking systems, regulations, and stable currencies like the US, Japan, and Europe will not benefit from alternative currencies that are being issued in ICOs. Once the discussion evolved to enterprise applications using blockchain, Paul was much more enthusiastic about the potential. He was quick to point out that many people assume that blockchain is a universal answer to solve issues using data, but in fact in many cases, it was not necessary and a centralized database could be superior. He said EY has developed a quick set of questions on whether blockchain is the right approach: Are you trying to get multiple parties to work together? Do you have trust issues between the parties? Examples are payments, royalties, or purchase orders. Is it important to get tamper proof record of transaction between parties? Are you moving something of finite value around? Does the group benefit from increased transparency? If you can answer yes to at least three of these questions, then blockchain makes sense. Otherwise, you might be better off with a centralized database application.

Most people who are aware of blockchain learned about it because of the media’s fascination with Bitcoin, the volatile digital currency that has taken its “hodlers” on a wild ride in 2017-8. When you ask someone in the transportation industry—say, a trucking carrier—if they’re interested in blockchain for industry applications, they often assume it means receiving payment in a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. And why would you want to receive payment in Bitcoin? The value of a Bitcoin fluctuates daily, and the currency has doubled its value in a month, then halved it the next month. Currencies work well when their value is stable—you want to know that the $1,000 you’ve contracted to be paid in a month is going to be worth about the same as it is now. At this point, Bitcoin is an asset more like gold than the USD, ‘invested’ in by speculators hoping to strike it rich when a flood of demand hits a commodity with a finite supply. But does blockchain make sense without cryptocurrencies? It’s a question worth asking, and FreightWaves reported last week from the Digital Chamber of Commerce’s Blockchain Summit in Washington, D.C., where the issue was discussed. It’s a question worth asking because, after all, the ideas of blockchain and Bitcoin were invented simultaneously. Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym of an anonymous person) wrote his now-famous 2008 white paper to propose a solution to the double-spend problem in digital currencies. The double-spend problem is essentially this: say I’m using a digital currency to buy something online. What is there to stop me from spoofing transactions, and spending the same digital dollar twice? And if I give two different parties a digital dollar with the same ‘serial number’, who is holding the authentic money and who’s holding the counterfeit? Satoshi’s solution was to create a distributed ledger so that many, many computers held a record of the Bitcoin’s transaction history. Satoshi wrote, “We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions… we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which [transactions] were received.” The system involves cryptographic hashes, a process that takes an arbitrary size of input data (a text file, or an MP3, or a video), runs it through an algorithm, and generates a 256 character output—the ‘hash’. The particular way that the hash algorithm works makes it essentially irreversible… in other words, it’s very easy to take input data and generate a hash (and the algorithm always generates the exact same hash for the data), but it’s virtually impossible to reverse-engineer the original input data from the hash. Here’s a video that explains how it works: \u003cbr /\u003e A Bitcoin is just a string of these kinds of hashes. The initial hash records the creation of the Bitcoin. When the Bitcoin is given to someone else, a record of that transaction along with the initial hash is fed into the algorithm, which generates a new hash. Each hash is a ‘block’, and this recursive way of linking them all together is what generates the ‘blockchain’. Since the hash is only 256 bits, it’s really easy for all the computers on the network to check and make sure they all have the same copy of the transaction record… even gigabytes of transactional history can be translated into a 256 bit hash, which can be verified instantly. Satoshi invented the idea of the blockchain to have an immutable, irreversible record of all of the transactions a particular Bitcoin has gone through so that no one could double-spend their digital currency. But there’s no reason in principle why a blockchain can’t be used to record any other kind of data, or records about a physical object. IBM and Maersk performed an experiment where the companies tracked a shipping container of flowers from Mombasa, Kenya, to Rotterdam, the major port in the Netherlands. They found that just a simple refrigerated shipment went through more than 30 different organizations and required over 200 separate communications. Any lost form or delayed approval could hold up the container in port indefinitely. In a blockchain, all of these steps in the chain of custody would be permanently recorded as they occurred in real time, made available to all concerned parties instantly, and would be completely tamper-proof. Shipment tracking is just one application of blockchain without cryptocurrencies that has potential in transportation and logistics. Smart contracts are another: because the blockchain is at its essence code, it’s programmable, and can automatically execute actions when certain events are hashed into the chain. Payments can also be made using blockchain tokens, but rather than dealing with floated cryptocurrencies that experience volatility, the token value is fixed to US dollars. The token governs the value of the transaction and is executed based on the terms of the smart contract. Once a triggering event happens, a transfer of value goes from the payor to the payee. The funds are guaranteed by a bank or clearing house that stands in for the value in USD. Blockchain ledgers are used to record the activity of the transaction, the history, and the tokens are instantly converted during the settlement. The token itself still holds value and the value is transferable. This means that the bank that has provided the settlement service could trade the token that has a finite value. The value of this token is based on the cash-flows that the token is expected to generate throughout its life. If we are talking a load, the maximum value of the token is the total charge on that particular load- including line-haul, fuel, and accessorials. How would this work? A shipper would tender a load that is backed by a smart contract token and honored by a clearing bank. The trucker would know the value of the token and the the requirements to get the full value of the token. Once the truck delivered the freight and the POD is transmitted, the carrier could request payment in the form of the token. Assuming that the requirements set forth in the smart contract have been honored, the token transfer would be immediate and exact. Any disputes to the outcome would go to a process of smart arbitration, offered by the clearing house. The trucker would receive funds immediately, but the clearing bank could offer to “float” the payment terms to the shipper. A shipper that wants to pay in 120 days could do so, assuming that a clearing bank is willing to stand in for the risk of default. The clearing bank would charge a fee to float the money, based on current value of future cash-flows, underwriting, and the risk of default. There is the possibility that the token could be sold off into the secondary market. Single load transaction values are quite small, so it is unlikely that a single load would be sold off to an investor. But with blockchain, a set of loads or a portfolio of transactions from a specific shipper could be packaged up and sold off to investors based on their risk profile. Crypto purists will argue that payments in blockchain must be used with a floated token, because the idea of eliminating third parties and intermediaries is appealing. The idea that you have to trust a third party to ensure payment is what blockchain was built to address. If the third party were to go out of business during the payment cycle, it would put the integrity of the payment network at risk. If you are dealing with assets that have long life cycles, such as real-estate, the argument could be valid. But when it comes to domestic freight, the payment cycles are usually within 60 days and the risk of a bank default is incredibly small. If the clearing house is an FDIC insured bank that is providing the funds guarantee, then the risk is tiny. It is certainly less risky than getting paid in a floated cryptocurrency where you neither know what is injected in the underlying crypto code or the volatility of a floated instrument. Plus, cryptocurrencies that float are considered assets and must be treated under mark-to-market accounting requirements and any gains on the value of the currency are considered taxable income by the IRS. The confusion and misconceptions surrounding blockchain are understandable because the term is something of a buzzword, and doesn’t have a clear definition. Trade organizations like the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) are using the word ‘blockchain’ to refer to a cryptographically generated distributed ledger, with or without a token. There are lots of industries that could use shared, tamper-proof, instant record-keeping but have no desire to wade into cryptocurrencies.

That means that it can be challenging to pick out the day’s highlights and how they might impact the trucking industry, as well as how the meeting’s discussion had changed since this reporter attended last year’s event. But some themes relevant to how blockchain might be introduced into supply chain issues were a frequent topic over the day. Tokens for all: It was a week in which the market for Initial Coin Offerings has been dealing with subpoenas reportedly issued–but not confirmed–by the Securities and Exchange Commission to the promoters of several ICOs. Those subpoenas reportedly have been a reason why the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have fallen sharply. Still, even in the face of that, the whole idea of “bitcoin no, blockchain yes” was pretty thoroughly mocked more than once at the conference. That theory is the idea that you can build a distributed ledger to host a smart contract that serves a supply chain, but transactions can take place in dollars, euros, etc. Even if speakers at the conference didn’t criticize that view directly, their remarks made it clear that they believe fully capitalizing on the technology can only come about if friction with the banking system and trying to use multiple currencies is going to slow distributed ledgers so much that only a token can fix it. At the 2017 meeting, the theme was that the time for blockchain hype was done, and that it was time to get down to work. Now with a lot of that work well underway, the theme for 2018, if there was one, is that the smooth running of multiple distributed ledgers serving one industry, or different ledgers serving industries that need to do business with other industries, is probably going to require a token. Fiat currency is still a term that gets sort of a snort that is silent but obvious nonetheless. On day 1, it was noted by one speaker that a distributed ledger for an industry that doesn’t use a token is like a toll booth for a bridge between two countries that needs to take in multiple currencies and as a result finds itself with lengthy delays to cross. Arun Ghosh, life sciences blockchain lead for KPMG, said that given the recent subpoenas, a push into tokens for a supply chain is “something that I wouldn’t recommend yet.” But he noted that there are still entrepreneurs in the blockchain ecosystem “who are taking leaps of faith and creating tokenizable assets that becoming trading mechanisms.” The key word heard often was “utility token.” If it can be proven that a token has been developed strictly for the purpose of allowing it to be used on a blockchain protocol to achieve a certain purpose, like payment or use of an application, then it might be able to avoid being classified as a security, which brings it under heavier SEC regulation. The discussion also was taking place against a backdrop of Wyoming moving toward adoption of regulations that would make it easier for a token to be classified as a utility token and avoid some regulations that impact tokens marketed more as investments or stores of value. Smart contracts: In a session to discuss the legal aspects of smart contracts, two attorneys from Perkins Coie’s blockchain group observed that while federal rules on the legality of smart contracts were scarce, states are stepping up to fill the void. Dax Hansen, a partner at Perkins Coie, said states have taken actions that have been “truly inspirational and supportive” on recognizing the acceptability of smart contracts, even as the federal government has done little. However, he did say that existing federal law on e-signatures is adequate, and he suggested that governments just let the current legislation stand without taking further steps that might prove to be confusing. “The law says an electronic signature can suffice,” Hansen said. “It does not say it needs to apply to a specific protocol or technology.” That issue, however, seems relatively minor compared to the larger issue of putting together a smart contract that can power a distributed ledger solution to the inefficiencies of a supply chain. “If you try to slap blockchain on top of an existing supply chain, it will not work,” Sam Ganga, the supply chain blockchain lead at KPMG, said in his company’s session on supply chains. But figuring out how they will work will remain a key challenge. “There are always pressures on supply chain leaders,” he said. “Now they have the additional need to have to delight their customers, and you have to figure out how to leapfrog your competitors, and you have to create a view of the supply chain that is real-time or real near-time.”  Why blockchain?: In the session that featured KPMG blockchain consultants, a question was asked why a blockchain is better for a supply chain than a central database. It’s a question that is the starting point in any consideration of whether a company should undertake the necessary work to introduce a distributed ledger solution to a process. Ganga focused on the immutability of entries on the ledger. “Immutability is a significant value proposition,” he said. “If we just look at the automotive industry, I will know where my part came from, I know that not only do I now have the ability to say not only do I know where the part came from but maybe I know what lot it came from. Any industries you can think of, automotive, airlines, these are the conversations we’re having.” How long? A blockchain solution—or distributed ledger, whatever you want to call it—for a business or a group of businesses is called an enterprise blockchain, and it was clearly more of a focus this year than in 2017. They can be built in multiple ways, but smart contracts to displace now inefficient processes are at their heart. They also can be built to talk to other blockchains, a feature known as interoperability. But there will always be a question of just how many ledgers a company will need to be a part of to get their tasks completed more efficiently. As Ganga said, you can control your own business, and you can try to have your smart contract dominate a sector with a “big stick.” “But if you carry a big stick and he does, and she does, how many blockchains are you going to join?” he said. Interoperability between however many ledgers shake out in the end is going to be required. Laurie Rosini of Perkins Coie, in an otherwise optimistic outlook for smart contracts, gave a sobering outlook on when this might become reality. Smart contracts for supply chains “are very complex, and I don’t think we’re going to see any practical examples of it in place soon due to that complexity,” she said. “But they’re definitely in development.” Standards: The ledgers that will be adopted will need standards, but Ganga said the ecosystem is not at a point yet “where we can define what standards mean in this movement.” But Eamonn Maguire, the global blockchain lead of KPMG, said in the financial services industry, “certain trade associations are coming together to establish the sets of standards that will be captured in smart contract language, so there will be a common language.” (Note: The Freightwaves-affiliated Blockchain in Transport Alliance is undertaking a similar effort in the transport industry).","TAGS":"Blockchain, smart contracts, Supply chain, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Kingston","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-09T13:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/technology/blockchain/konexial-load-connection","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GoLoadDLM-1.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Konexial is all about driver connection","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"It’s a small piece of hardware unlike anything else currently on the market, and ranks high in Amazon’s search results. It’s also a software solution for drivers dealing with the need to adopt a quality ELD. Technology has the power to connect drivers with real time information to improve visibility, availability, and communication — all within the driver’s hand, with a device they already own — their phone. That’s what Ken Evans, founder and CEO of Konexial, realized way back in 2014. Evans says he founded the company to bring “dynamic load matching” to the market. “Drivers don’t want 10 apps,” Evans tells FreightWaves at TMC 18. “We are committed to creating technology to enable drivers to improve their lives,” he says. Evans knew they had to start with working through ELDs, which would soon be on smartphones, and Konexial could work in direct coordination with a trucker pain point: having to adopt unwelcome electronic logging devices. Evans knew truckers would want a solution. So, Evans set out to find the right tech talent — and eventually form a strategic partnership with Cloud Logistics. What has come out in the mix is a “swiss army knife,” a dynamic range of powerful load matching and visibility for everyone in the system. Konexial, also calls themselves a “mobile cloud ecosystem,” and their My20 app works for iOS and Android platforms. My20 includes ELD, map integration, a fuel tool with automatic monitoring, notifications, and low-cost refueling options, driver status buttons, and rewards features. Konexial’s founders share over 100 years of combined logistics experience in Fortune 500 companies. The company’s ambitions have them committed to a five-prong approach. They want to improve the economic: adding opportunity and visibility increases your earning potential; the environmental: reducing empty miles helps improve the environment; the social: connecting drivers to shippers removes barriers and creates community; the spiritual: daily life-affirming messages providing encouragement; and the physical: pursuing better living through healthy choices. My20 could revolutionize the ELD industry by providing compliance with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) mandate, as well as providing an all-in-one tool that streamlines every facet of a truck driver’s job. Compliance with the ELD mandate is common knowledge in the trucking industry, but the potential benefits of FMCSA compliance are not as widely known. The company designed My20 to solve the issues drivers, dispatchers, and fleet owners often face with the best hardware and software available, while also being super affordable. “We’re moving into blockchain for Q2,” says Evans. “Our GoLoad-Dynamic Load Matching has a built-in need for secure, electronic payments to create trust between shippers and carriers who may not have done business before. We believe using blockchain for dynamic transactions could provide an opportunity to create a standard for freight settlement.”  Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain, ELD, ELD mandate, ELDMarketplace, Konexial, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-08T13:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/cftc-sro-cryptos","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cryptocurrencies-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Crypto markets should set up their own regulatory regime: CFTC commissioner","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Waiting for the federal government to create a regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies could be a lengthy process, so the industry should seek to create a self-regulation organization, according to a CFTC commissioner. Brian Quintenz, a Republican commissioner speaking as the keynote speaker of the Digital Chamber of Commerce’s blockchain summit in Washington, said the model for such SROs is already established, citing the National Futures Association (NFA) and the Financial Independent Regulatory Authority (FINRA). And the target of such an organization would be the spot market occuring on crypto exchanges, where Quintenz said the regulatory impact of the CFTC is limited only to enforcement rather than ongoing regulation. The ability of the CFTC to regulate cryptocurrency futures and options is well-established, he said. “I think an independent SRO-like entity for spot platforms could significantly contribute to the ongoing efforts to rationlize and formalize crypto currency regulations,” Quintenz said in the summit’s keynote address. “Initially this entity could establish best practices for spot platforms. But eventually this independent body could enforce rules, supervise them and give customers a place to seek redress.” Recent efforts in the United Kingdom and Japan, as well as other SROs in the U.S., could serve as a model for a crypto SRO, he said. Additionally, states that have regulated cryptos are beginning to cooperate with each other and recognize other regulations in their states, Quintenz said. Compared to the slow pace of establishing federal regulatory oversight of spot sales of cryptos, and crypto exchanges, the private membership aspect of an SRO could mean faster oversight, Quintenz said. “Funded by members, an SRO can adapt rules faster than the federal government, and rules are informed by practical expertise,” he said. “This is especially beneficial in cases of rapidly-evolving industries like crytpos.” An SRO would be subject to federal rules, but those don’t exist in the case of cryptocurrencies, Quintenz said.  Quintenz did appear to be defending the agency’s regulation of the bitcoin futures contracts that have been launched in recent months on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the CBOE. The contracts to an outsider seemed to pop up and were approved in rapid succession, but Quintenz disputed that. A contract can only get CFTC approval with a significant transparent price history, which bitcoin had, Quintenz said. Additionally, the margins that have been established for those two contracts are 47% of the price of the contract in the case of the CME, and 44% for the CBOE. “That is ten times more than the initial margin requirements over something like a corn contract,” he said. Margin erosion is a measure of when the initial margin is eroded by up to 50%, Quintenz said. In the last two months, the bitcoin contracts have seen that happen only once. But it’s happened 11 times with the widely-accepted light sweet crude contract, he noted.","TAGS":"Blockchain, crypto, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Kingston","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Trucking Regulation, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-08T12:07:48-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/supply-chain-blockchain","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/champagne-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Using blockchain to track Champagne…or anything else","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Tyler Jenks gave a speech at the Blockchain Summit of the Digital Chamber of Commerce in Washington that spoke of major impacts on trucking, and he barely even mentioned trucks. Jenks, senior vice president for solutions at blockchain company Very, gave an address in which the ostensible topic was the supply chain of Champagne, and how the various parts of the supply chain can ultimately ensure that what those who bought a bottle of the bubbly are drinking real Champagne, per the French definition, and not something with grapes grown from a different region or failing to meet some of the many other specifications that qualifies it as Champagne. But while Jenks’ remarks may have focused on one small–albeit popular–product, he said the points he was attempting to make could go for any part of a supply chain. “It’s an identical problem,” he said on the conference sidelines after his address. “The agricultural piece is just an example because people understand it.” The key to repairing and ensuring the integrity of supply chains is data, not the technology, Jenks said. “Once you have the data you can do with it whatever you want to do.” But putting the data on a distributed ledger has the added feature that it is tamper-proof, or “immutable” in distributed ledger-speak. The blockchain-enabled Champagne example in his speech featured a wide range of devices that would fall under the internet of things (IoT) definition. It would go beyond simply tracking the origin and movement of bottles. For example, devices that measured growing temperatures, soil sensors ad wind speed would all contribute data to a blockchain tracking every grape that went into the making of an individual bottle of Champagne. The data would be recorded on a blockchain. And by definition, the piles of data that would go into tracking the history of any product would also involve its transportation. Jenks even played a fake “Alexa” intelligent personal assistant, being asked to provide information on the a bottle the owner was drinking. Gathering the data is not an issue, Tyler said: “This is available today.” Jenks’ remarks were made prior to a presentation by Rohit Tandon, the founder and CEO of Chainworks on enterprise blockchain, which is generally defined as a blockchain solution adopted by a company or a group of companies. Tandon spoke of “business value networks” in which individual distributed ledgers created to serve a particular industry sector work together through what he said would be a “cross channel protocol that will emerge.” Tandon also said he expected that commerce would be transacted using a token in a BVN, because it would presumably involve companies doing business in multiple countries and only a token could easily bridge that gap. In his post-address comments, Jenks did not dispute that. But he said based on the work his company has done, he would expect that it will “be more important to connect companies along its supply chain, and not necessarily its competitors.” “In an ideal world, they’re all using the same blockchain and playing nice, but anybody looking to dominate is going to be one of the first to use the system,” Jenks added. “Probably one player leads the way. That’s the way business works.”","TAGS":"Blockchain, Supply chain, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Kingston","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-08T12:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2018/3/7/origintrail-announces-bita-membership","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/origintraillogo-1.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"OriginTrail announces BiTA membership","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"OriginTrail, a European open-source supply chain protocol company which recently raised 22.5 million dollars, is proud to announce its new membership in the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA).

Companies such as UPS and FedEx, Schneider and J.B. Hunt, Echo Global Logistics and C.H. Robinson, and even SAP have joined, seeing the value that blockchain can bring to the supply chain. One of the latest organizations to join, announced today, is the University of Central Arkansas (UCA). To gauge the value that UCA expects to garner from its membership, FreightWaves spoke with Dr. Douglas Voss, Associate Professor of Logistics and Supply Chain Management at the university, to understand the reason UCA felt the need to become a BiTA member. “The whole blockchain phenomenon is so new, I think it’s so important for professors to stay on the cutting edge,” he explains. “We can take that message to students so they can stay on the cutting edge.” Voss is also a member of the Board of Directors for the Arkansas Trucking Association, so he sees his role as a member of BiTA as providing some dual benefits for both entities, although the students of UCA that should derive great value from the membership. Students in school now and those entering in the next few years will be leaving school to enter a logistics world that may be undergoing a change due to blockchain. Many experts predict blockchain will reach critical mass in the industry in the next 18 months to 5 years, meaning students who learn about the technology now will be among the first ready to implement it in real-world applications. “I think in the short term what you’re going to get is some definition of how blockchain can be used, case studies [for example],” Voss says, adding that UCA’s involvement might also benefit BiTA members and the many trucking businesses based in Arkansas. “Hopefully, we can bring an academic view to it,” he suggests. “Sometimes, we can view things from a 40,000-foot view so maybe we can bring a holistic view to it. “There’s certain research reasons we’d want to join,” he adds. “Hopefully, we can learn and share information with BiTA members and maybe publish some of that and share it with everyone.” The University of Central Arkansas launched a Logistics and Supply Chain Management major last year supported by a $3 million endowment from the Arkansas Department of Transportation. The school began its logistics program in 2007. Voss said the school will be creating a new major that is a cross between logistics and information technology. “We find that there are some personality traits between students in logistics and information technology, so I think [blockchain] sits nicely there,” Voss observes. And now students at the University of Central Arkansas will be able to tap into the knowledge base that is the growing member base of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance.

UCA is one of the first universities accepted for BiTA membership. “Trucking is the focus of UCA’s Logistics and Supply Chain Management program and technology plays an increasingly important role in trucking operations,” said Dr. Doug Voss, associate professor of Logistics and Supply Chain Management. “Joining BiTA provides our faculty an opportunity to help create blockchain standards, educate our students about this important innovation and share what we learn with UCA’s industry stakeholders.” Blockchain utilizes a decentralized ledger to record transactions across many computers so the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the agreement of the network. Similar to Wikipedia, anyone with access may modify the ledger. However, all parties must concur before changes are accepted. “Blockchain has potential to remove third parties from transactions and improve product traceability. It could remove a great deal of waste from the supply chain. We are excited to participate in BiTA and help shape blockchain’s foundation in trucking,” added Voss, who also serves on the Arkansas Trucking Association Board of Directors. By engaging the brightest minds from the most influential leaders in transportation, finance and technology, BiTA is focused on providing educational resources and open forums to those in the industry interested in leading the evolution of the trucking industry through the efficiencies offered in blockchain technology. “Today’s students are the future leaders of the transportation and logistics industry, so being able to engage with the University of Central Arkansas through its membership in the Blockchain in Transport Alliance will ensure its students are fluent in the most transformative technology to come along in years,” says Chris Burruss, president of BiTA. “Just as importantly, BiTA members will benefit from the ability to connect with leading academics in the supply chain field in the shared exercise of information gathering and problem solving.

To Jon Slangerup, the Chairman, and CEO of AGL, being at the forefront of supply chain technology advancement is nothing new. Before taking up the reins of AGL, Slangerup was running the port of Long Beach, when the port was going through technology upheavals with a lot of communication issues that were ubiquitous all across the West Coast. “I launched a local initiative called the supply chain optimization, which involved everyone in the supply chain – from the ocean carriers all the way to the BCOs, including the freight and rail guys, terminal operators and everyone in between,” says Slangerup. “I quickly realized that this wasn’t just for the port of Long Beach, but can be a broader initiative. The whole process of doing this initiative was to talk about the future of communication and information management across the complex maritime supply chain.” The marine supply chain is highly fragmented, silo-driven with nearly no tangible standards for communication, and lacked an information backbone – leading to a complete dearth of end-to-end visibility. Blockchain, Slangerup believes, could be an opportunity to start looking at ways to drive efficiency through the supply chain, which could spur enormous financial benefits to all the stakeholders in the chain. “The technology is out there and is evolving very rapidly. The goal of joining BiTA is to really make sure that platforms are compliant with standards and with the ability to secure data,” notes Slangerup. “One of the biggest concerns you come across in the industry is not the technology itself, but the willingness of people to trust the system.” The concern holds a lot of water – all the players in the space, be it the ocean carriers, terminal operators, or the BCOs, own a lot of sensitive customer information like financial data, rates, and contract information, which is not just proprietary but also viewed upon as competitive advantage. “Companies are resistant to sharing or being part of a common system, whereby proprietary information could be compromised,” adds Slangerup. “Blockchain conceptually could eliminate that barrier of trusting the system to secure the information being shared within the system. This is what I like about blockchain and why I think BiTA is on the right track in terms of trying to focus on standards that anyone who plays in the space can feel secure about.” Being a company that constantly looks for a competitive edge, AGL wants to be part of BiTA and influence the development of the blockchain standards. “I think that from a typical learning perspective, nobody really knows what this thing is going to look like – we all have a bigger view of what it would look like, but it still is a learning process,” insists Slangerup. “Being at the table is very important to us, as it has both a practical competitive value and a very compelling strategic value.” Slangerup also mentions that AGL would be announcing a significant set of initiatives revolving around the platform that they have established, with a newer version of the application that has been heavily enhanced. “We certainly will be working with some of our key customers on their own initiatives around blockchain, and I believe we would be announcing projects in the May to June timeframe,” he adds. AGL’s customer base is in the small to the mid-sized range of companies, where AGL strives to help its clients optimize their supply chain and effectively manage the movement of goods through their system. “We are serving a part of the market that has tougher competitive challenges and risks when compared to the bigger players – they don’t face the same constraints in resources that the smaller companies do,” concludes Slangerup. “We are helping bring value in that regard and make them more competitive in this rapidly changing world.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Supply chain, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-02-26T19:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/john-kingston","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/JF1_2982_RETOUCHED_COLOR_small-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"FreightWaves adds S\u0026P Platts executive that helped launch the benchmark crude index and futures contracts","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Leading commodities, markets-data news, and blockchain expert joins FreightWaves as Executive Editor and will develop the BiTA Community Organization membership engagement platform. When DAT, Nodal and our TransRisk division launch the first trucking futures market, it is imperative that financial market participants understand how the freight market works. It is also important these individuals have reliable and near-time reporting on developments that impact freight rates. This includes both fundamental and pricing data. It is a monstrous task to educate the financial community on how events in the freight markets will impact pricing and even more challenging to educate the freight participants on how trucking futures will work. The good news is that we have recruited the top voice in the commodity markets to help with this. He even helped to launch the Platts Data Brent assessment, the leading benchmark of global oil prices. John Kingston, a veteran executive of the financial and commodities news and data powerhouse – S\u0026P Platts, has joined the FreightWaves team as Executive Editor and BiTA as Head of Member Engagement. In this role, he will be working with the freight editorial team to broaden coverage, content, and data that financial market participants need to understand how the freight markets are impacted by regulatory, economic, technology, and business climate developments. Additionally, he plans to bring Wall Street to Main Street, with his coverage of broader news stories that come from outside the freight space. John plans to truckify Wall Street news coverage. Interesting enough, members of BiTA will also benefit from John’s arrival. He most recently ran the S\u0026P Global task force on Blockchain and has deep connections and knowledge of blockchain in the capital markets business. John had a 30+-year career with McGraw-Hill/S\u0026P Global, with most of his time at the Platts division of the company. At Platts, where he had a key role as the group rose from less than 100 employees to its current level well in excess of 1,000, Kingston held a wide variety of positions. He began his career in 1985 as a crude oil market reporter, rising eventually to become Director of Oil and Director of News. The Platts Data Brent assessment, now the world’s leading benchmark, was launched by Kingston in the late 1980’s. He was awarded the 2015 IAEE Award for Excellence in Written Journalism by the International Association for Energy Economics. Kingston was also Platts’ leading “talking head,” with numerous appearances on such networks as CNBC, Fox Business and Canada’s BNN. He has presented at conferences on energy, and more recently blockchain, around the globe. In 2015, he was recruited to join the parent company’s management team, where he served as both President of the McGraw Hill Financial Institute and Director of Global Market Insights, working with the team of worldwide economists. He also launched the S\u0026P Global task force on blockchain, seeking to determine how the nascent technology would impact the company. Prior to joining Platts, he began his career with commodities-oriented media at American Metal Market. He also has worked for newspapers in New Jersey and Virginia.

The United States is also the world’s largest exporter of pharmaceuticals, with exports valued at $86B in 2015. Some of the most valuable drugs being produced these days are temperature-sensitive biopharmaceuticals (more on that later), but the refrigerated supply chain—or ‘cold chain’—that enables this lucrative export business is low-tech and wasteful, often amounting to little more than styrofoam coolers and frozen gel packs. The global pharmaceutical industry spent $13.4B shipping temperature-sensitive biopharmaceuticals in 2017, but the World Health Organization estimated that up to 40% of vaccines shipped worldwide degraded due to temperature variation during transport. More than 60% of the temperature deviations affecting the quality of biopharmaceutical shipments occurred on airport tarmacs, which experience extreme temperatures. Air freight logistics personnel under time crunches often plan ahead, and park pallets next to aircraft hours before departure, where they can be exposed to temperatures from -40° F in Anchorage to 120° in Dubai. Enter SkyCell, a Switzerland-based high tech firm that has created an IoT and blockchain-enabled refrigerated air freight container especially for biopharmaceuticals. Why biopharmaceuticals? The economics of this class of drugs are completely different than typical small molecule medications produced by chemical processes. Biopharmaceuticals are typically large, complex protein molecules grown by genetically engineered microorganisms in vats called bioreactors. Small molecule drugs can be expensive, too, but these costs are mostly related to recovering research and development expenses: it takes years to invent a compound that works and bring it through a multistage FDA approval process—then a pharma company has a limited amount of time to sell the drug on the market before its patents expire. The cost of production and the ingredients themselves are trivial, though, and that’s why drug companies have historically tolerated wasteful supply chains. Biopharmaceuticals, though, are different. Biopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities are an order of magnitude more expensive than traditional drug factories—$200-500M instead of $20-50M—and the nature of the product makes production tedious and labor-intensive. Biopharmaceuticals are exceptionally sensitive to changes in pH, temperature, and environmental contaminants. Even slight changes can alter the chemistry of the protein under production, rendering it ineffective or even dangerous. Biopharmaceutical production processes are small batch, and equipment has to be carefully cleaned after the proteins have been harvested—it’s more like artisanal, microscopic organic farming than an industrial chemical factory. Because biopharmaceutical production costs are much higher than for traditional drugs, supply chain waste and loss is more costly, and companies have a strong incentive to minimize it. SkyCell’s stylish line of air freight containers are built out of patented insulation, kept cold by a special rechargeable passive cooling technology, and are equipped with a plethora of sensors that monitor temperature, humidity, and geolocation. The SkyCell cloud platform records documentation like bills of lading and customs forms for each container on a blockchain-like ledger, providing a level of supply chain visibility and security that complements the container’s temperature security. Check out this video of a SkyCell container being handled on its way from Austria to Brazil: \u003cbr /\u003e Besides the increased production costs of biopharmaceuticals, regulatory changes have caused pharma companies to upgrade their cold chains from styrofoam. FreightWaves spoke to SkyCell’s co-founder and CEO Richard Ettl by phone. “What’s driving our industry right now—the cold chain and cold chain packaging—this regulation kicked in about 3 years ago,” explained Ettl. “Countries which in many cases are the buyers of medication realized they need to set a standard. Ten years back, pharma companies set their own standards. Now this is over. In most countries, regulators have decided that the companies have to prove temperature through the whole supply chain—from manufacture to pharmacy. These rules are now effective in Europe, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, China, and the USA is working on a similar regulatory regime. Even Botox is regulated in Saudi Arabia; it’s no longer an option just to ship it and hope that it works… they check the shipment at the airport—they open the container, and pull the data. If it’s supposed to be between 2 and 8 degrees [Celsius] constantly, and the logger says it reached 8.1, they send it back,” said Ettl. “It never makes it past customs.” Pharmaceutical companies are also upgrading their cold chains because of consumer demand. The problem is that degradation due to temperature variation is invisible, unlike food spoilage, which in many cases is obvious. “Large molecule drugs break down because of heat or if they freeze; temperature has a huge impact on the performance. Insulin breaks down the warmer it is. If you freeze it, it breaks completely, from 100% effective to 0. The problem with pharma is you can’t tell, optically, if it’s broken,” said Ettl. Globally, 8.5% of sensitive pharmaceutical shipments experience temperature deviations; in the Middle East, that number rises to between 15-20%. For 2017, SkyCell brought their temperature-deviated rate down to less than 0.1%. Now SkyCell has slightly more than 1,000 containers circulating through the global cold chain, making them the fourth largest container firm in the space. Ettl said they will add another 1,000 containers this year and take the number three spot in the industry. SkyCell is preparing to move its most valuable shipment so far: one pallet-sized container of bulk vaccine worth $12M will move from its pharmaceutical manufacturer in Germany to Japan, where it will be divided into about a million doses and distributed to more countries. “This is typical of a pharma supply chain—super-expensive, mission-critical bulk shipments—where if you lose a shipment you lose weeks of inventory,” said Ettl. Cold chain security and visibility are paramount for biopharmaceuticals, which is why SkyCell bet on technology early. Ettl said the firm started putting sensors and data loggers on their containers four years ago, and has accumulated 1.2B data points, enabling SkyCell to map the biopharmaceutical supply chain and leverage its data in partnerships with airlines, pharma companies, and customers. Later this year SkyCell’s parent company, Smart Containers Group, is doing an initial coin offering (ICO) to attract a decentralized, global network of investors to help grow a sister business called FoodGuardians, which will offer low-cost refrigerated shipping containers for food products like salmon. Dividends will be paid out in Ethereum to coinholders.

It has terminals in Guadalajara, JA, Monterrey, NL, Nuevo Laredo, TM, Silao, GT and Manzanillo, CO.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Mexico, Technology, Transportes Innovativos, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-02-21T17:03:40-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain/ondiflo-blockchain-platform-oil-and-gas-industry","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/oilandgas-1.jpeg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain platform Ondiflo automates ticketing processes in the oil and gas industry","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Amalto SA, a provider of order-to-cash solutions, and ConsenSys, a global blockchain company, have come together to create a platform that is dedicated to the automation of ticketing processes in the oil and gas industry. Ondiflo, as the joint venture is called, works on the Ethereum blockchain platform and is looking to experiment with pilot programs and by devising new use cases for the industry to improve its process efficiency. FreightWaves caught up with Rana Basu, the Director of Energy and Natural Resources at ConsenSys, and Jean-Pierre Foehn, the CEO of Amalto SA, to discuss their ideas for Ondiflo and its prospects in the oil and gas industry. “My journey in this field started even before I moved into blockchain technology. I used to be the risk manager for a trading house. We had to deal with a lot of trucks, and that’s when we started looking for systems that could make life a lot easier,” says Basu. “We didn’t find any product that was commercial, that could handle the logistics for tanker trucking – diesel or gas. And we started building our own version, and that is how the whole concept started for me.” Basu was joined by Foehn, and Sandro Giannetti, an entrepreneur and startup investor, who had been trying to solve the same problem, but in different ways. “We identified issues associated with field ticketing for water hauling, which is one of the use cases that we are addressing on Ondiflo,” says Foehn. “This is how it started for us; we were looking to resolve issues using blockchain.” Water hauling in the oil and gas industry is a simple yet vital procedure. When oil and gas are being produced, water is a by-product which is stored in tanks and then hauled by trucks to disposal wells or a recycling center where the water is processed. Associated with this process are various transactions involving the trucking companies and the rig stations, where a lot of disputes arise while creating invoices and sending payments. “The procedure involves calling the trucks at the beginning, which is a service request. Then a field ticket is issued, which describes the service being delivered by the trucking company. Eventually, the field ticket leads to an invoice which leads to the payment,” explains Foehn. “When you put this together, it leads to a lot of issues in the industry – like for example, questions regarding the real volume of water that is transferred from the tank to the truck. And this led us to think that maybe blockchain could help.” Ondiflo helps capture the water level in the tank through IoT sensors that push information through blockchain, which is then used to create smart contracts where the steps mentioned above can be triggered by leveraging sensor data. By capturing key information about the water volume, time spent on site, contract information, and any additional charges in the blockchain database, the disputes that arise can be addressed quickly and seamlessly. Ondiflo is looking to create a consortium with four distinct groups as its core players. “The first one is the large oil field operators who are working both offshore and onshore. The second one is the service providers and the third group is the one who works in fuel hauling. We have a lot of them on diesel, heating oil, and jet fuel – they are pulled on trucks and delivered to gas stations and homes. This makes them a very large constituent of the consortium,” explains Basu. “The final group consists of the financiers, who could be banks or non-banking institutions who provide the receivable securitization.” Over the next quarter, the focus is on launching the consortium and getting the initial adopters and investors on board. The initial prototype is already partly ready and the team is working intently on providing a full-fledged solution that can tackle different types of ticketing issues inundating the industry. “Blockchain’s initial impact will be in terms of improving efficiency and reducing friction in operational aspects. However, combining the emergence of industrial IoTs with a crypto economic layer, we have the ability to create new incentive models that could help the industry transform disruptively,” notes Basu. “I think this is going to be something very exciting and the reason for most people to come on-board our platform.” Foehn also mentions that BiTA is of particular interest to Ondiflo. “It would make a lot of sense to bring BiTA into our project or to have bridges between the two. We want to develop standards that are critical to the success of this project. I think at some stage, the trucking world and the oil and gas world can basically adopt similar standards through blockchain,” he concludes.

What’s obviously missing in the discussion is whether the tokens that are being proffered in the ICOs are going to be needed to make distributed ledger technology a reality in the transport sector. FreightWaves has identified more than 20 ICOs in the transport sector that have been announced or launched. They are at various stages of the process; their white papers range from being classic black letters on a white background, to carrying full graphics. Some of them lay out what they want to do with tremendous clarity. Others leave a lot to be desired. One thing that is consistent through all the ICO white papers is that the blockchain protocols lean heavily toward residing on the Ethereum platform. This makes sense, because Ethereum was developed specifically to host the smart contracts that would be at the heart of any blockchain tools developed for the supply chain. In those instances where the specific size of an ICO is listed, the currency is always listed in ETH, the currency of the Ethereum blockchain.  The second consistency of the white papers is their identification of the problem to be solved. The argument they make is similar: back-office operations in the transport sector have not changed for years; they are adding enormous costs to all players in the supply chain; distributed ledger technology can fix it. For example, ShipChain, which had a successful pre-sale of its tokens last fall, enough that it did not need to go through with its regular ICO, described the problem like this in its white paper: “The lack of a unified communication platform prevents the various players from interacting efficiently. Most land transportation providers, carriers, governments, customs brokers, and freight forwarders have outdated ways of keeping track of their goods. According to KPMG, 40% of global manufacturers lack information and material visibility across their supply bases. In some cases, companies are still using paper ledgers to track their products. Given that upwards of 65% of the value of a company’s products or services is derived from its suppliers and its supply chain, utilizing older highly ineffective systems results in tremendous amounts of wasted time, resources, and money.” Slogn gets specific in a white paper section called “Real Life Scenarios.” These contrast the current method with what it envisions should the industry move to a DLT solution. For example, under the heading of “Instant Pay,” the Slogn white paper says under the current system, “Brokers pay motor carriers 30, 45 or 60 days after they receive the delivery confirmation paperwork. If a motor carrier wants to receive the payment sooner, Brokers or Factoring Companies assess a quick pay fee of 1-5%.” Under “Solutions,” Slogn said that with a DLT in place, “Payments are made to carriers as soon as the receiver confirms the shipment has been received and that there are no issues.” Similar, for Fuel Advance: “Anytime a trucking company books a load, they ask for a fuel advance from the freight brokers providing the job. Fuel Advance is a partial amount of the final load rate. Freight Brokers charge at least a 1% fuel advance fee. Fee and the total fuel advance amounts are deducted when the final payment is made to the trucking company.” “Solutions: When a load is booked, the carrier is allowed to spend a certain percentage of the load rate on fuel without any charges or penalties.” Why does this all work better with a token, at least according to the authors of the various white papers? With financial transactions made completely with tokens whose ownership would be by the consensus mechanism of the ledger. As a protocol named Fr8 says in its white paper: “Once delivery is confirmed via Fr8’s smart contract, settlement begins. Settlement can be made instantly via Fr8 token or in fiat through ancillary services. Settlement can even be triggered by the smart contract to execute automatically based on proof-of-delivery. After final settlement has been made, the smart contract is formally closed out.” What it doesn’t say is the assumption behind all ICOs: that a robust industry of money-changers will develop that will be able to convert tokens into hard currencies, known as fiat currencies in the blockchain world. A shipper of carrier can then have the profitability of the transaction that is initially paid in tokens able to be easily converted to a currency that for now at least is more widely used, like a dollar. Another aspect of the token ecosystem is a series of rewards, where you earn additional tokens for taking certain actions on the ledger. For example, among the ICOs Freightwaves has discovered have been two protocols that would share information on a vehicle’s maintenance and other history, Vinchain and VLB. Both protocols award users of the system, not just for doing a nice thing, but also because their use of the protocol contributes to what the developers hope would be a vast and growing transparent knowledge base, stored on the ledger, of presumably millions of vehicles’ history. (While vehicle history may be the primary focus of those ledgers, the idea of a growing history of other information comes through many of the white papers, such as broker and driver performance.) There has always been a dichotomy in discussion of blockchain and bitcoin, that sort of went like this: “I don’t believe in the whole bitcoin phenomenon, but I do think blockchain technology will be a significant game-changer.” The pushback to that has often been that distributed ledger technology will always work better with a cryptocurrency, because otherwise the speed and efficiency gains of DLT will be slowed by friction with the banking sector. Yet one of the most significant announced commercial applications of DLT—the replacement of the Australia Stock Exchange’s legacy system Chess with a DLT system built by Digital Asset—involves no cryptocurrency. While the slew of white papers on transport solutions all call for a cryptocurrency—that’s why they are ICOs—what would be not publicized at this point is an alternative that didn’t use cryptos and instead relied on fiat currencies. Beyond those broad similarities and largely unified goal, a random walk through various white papers does bring out a few differences. –Putting aside the hysteria that has infected much of the cryptocurrency world, ICOs initially had a legitimate reason to exit. The ICO was designed in part not just to make developers wealthy, but also to provide a base of funding to create open source software, which can be difficult to monetize. But a blockchain protocol called IMMLA, which had a successful ICO last year, spells out in its white paper how it would claim a percentage of every transaction on its blockchain protocol. It said that IMMLA would take 1% from any financial transaction completed on its platform, estimates that it would “occupy” at least 1% of what it calls “global cargo transportation services.” “Thus, financial transactions via IMMLA will be at the level of 1% * $1 trillion \u003d $10 billion per year. Revenue: 1% of these transactions \u003d $100 million per year.” IMMLA also says its revenue would be provided by “Other third-party and built-in paid services: advertising, analytics, banking services, accounting services, arbitration, insurance, customs clearance, etc.” What it doesn’t mention, but which some blockchain protocols have projected as a source of revenue, would be to build the support network for the software that runs the platform. Still, the IMMLA revenue projections were more specific than what was found in most white papers, which generally had revenue projections only on what the ICO would bring, but not on any continuing businesses. –The role of brokers: two separate white papers have very different takes on the future role of brokers in a world where distributed ledger technology is deeply embedded in the supply chain. Conventional wisdom is that DLT, being a technology that would disrupt intermediaries, would be devastating if not fatal to the voice brokerage industry. ShipChain’s white paper sums up this view: “The ShipChain blockchain will supplant the need for brokers by allowing carriers the ability to find shipments and intelligently route their team for multimodal transportation based on factors such as distance, traffic, weather conditions, fuel use and more.” But the Fr8 proposal views brokers as still important in a market where Fr8’s protocol becomes dominant. “Fr8 doesn’t want to eliminate brokers entirely – quite the contrary,” it writes in its white paper. “We believe individual brokers will exist in the marketplace as representatives of shippers or carriers, much as they do today. But we want to give every broker access to the tools and information they need to operate effectively and capture the full rewards for their hard work. Today’s brokers exist primarily as liaisons of relationships. Now independent brokers can enter the Fr8 ecosystem as enablers–a critical asset for optimizing our network of shippers and carriers.” ","TAGS":"Blockchain, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-02-20T16:33:33-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/technology/blockcerts-manage-driver-risk","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/blockcerts-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockcerts extend risk management to the driver level","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Transparency18 Sponsored article Driver identification is an integral part of transportation risk management. Drivers are regularly entrusted with valuable cargo that must be insured against accidents, theft, and other adverse events. With over 100% driver turnover annually, recruiters and carriers spend an inordinate amount of time verifying that an applicant is physically and mentally prepared for delivering a customer’s cargo safely. This means that a significant amount of paperwork must be verified: the driver’s CDL; DAC records; MVRs; background checks; drug tests; medical history; and employment history. This is an expensive and time-consuming process, and the information provided is often selective or misleading. Accordingly, insurance is usually assessed on a carrier rather than the individual driver. Due to overwhelming demand, additional slots have been opened up for Demo Day presenters. Register online at: https://transparency18.com/participate/apply-to-demo/ With blockchain-based credentials, or Blockcerts (an open source standard developed by Learning Machine and the MIT Media Lab), risk management can now extend to the driver level. With Blockcerts, drivers own private copies of their digital records, which they can share with anybody they choose—like a prospective employer. That individual or company can then verify the authenticity of the records with the click of a button, without having to consult the organization that issued it. This saves time and money while providing a high level of certainty that the document has not been forged or tampered with. To minimize document withholding by applicants, employers can also issue drivers new records that link to past assessments from previous employers, forming a chain of records documenting employment history. Over time, drivers will accumulate a “scorecard” based on their past performance, which becomes a risk assessment measure for insurers. The driving record could also release automated rewards for good performance, based on “smart contracts” to better incentivize drivers. Blockcerts achieves this data linkage without relying on a giant, centralized database of private information. Those are a legacy of the digital past, difficult to manage and honeypots for attackers. Instead, carriers maintain their own separate databases while instantly verifying information issued by any other carrier. This is much more manageable. How does this work? The blockchain serves as a distributed ledger of transactions which are pseudonymous, meaning it doesn’t store any personally identifiable information (PII). Instead, it stores the “digital fingerprint” of a transaction, which could be, for example, a carrier sending a driver a performance assessment. That performance assessment, which contains PII, is stored securely off-chain, but it contains a reference to its digital fingerprint on the blockchain. This means that wherever the private driver record is stored—in the cloud, on a mobile device, on a hard drive—it references the blockchain, but the blockchain does not reference it. When a Blockcert is presented for verification, the algorithm calculates its digital fingerprint. If someone has tampered with the certificate, the fingerprint won’t match the copy on the chain and verification will fail. Verification will also fail if the issuer has revoked a Blockcert, or if it has expired. And because all the Blockcerts code is open source, verification is independent of any vendor or issuing institution—meaning Blockcerts will stand the test of time and remain verifiable over an entire career, from anywhere in the world. Blockcerts empowers both drivers and their employers while creating major efficiencies for the insurance system. By 2020, blockchain-based records will be fully mainstream—thanks in large part to open standards like Blockcerts.

It’s massive, it’s complicated, and yet no one really knows what is going on throughout it. Transparency has been often talked about, but rarely fully achieved. Some aspects of the supply chain have become visible – such as tracking technologies that allow shippers and customers to see where their load is at any given time – but the majority of the process is shrouded in secrecy. Blockchain technology is something that can create that transparency, but until that becomes an industry standard, it will be left to companies such as Unilever to pull back a corner of their veil. Unilever recently unveiled its entire palm oil supply chain – all 1,400 mills and 300 direct suppliers – to provide some transparency to the process. “By sharing information about our suppliers and the mills that process the products we buy, we are making a real step change towards greater transparency in the industry. We strongly believe that being open and transparent is key to achieving a fully traceable supply chain – a goal we set ourselves back in 2013 when we first launched our Sustainable Palm Oil Sourcing Policy and which we have been pursuing ever since,” the company said in a release announcing the move. “A lot of people think if you outsource your value chain you can outsource your responsibilities. I don’t think so,” said CEO Paul Polman at a panel at this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos. “We need to be at the forefront of change. This is why Unilever is committed to greater transparency and continue to work with our partners to drive positive change in the palm oil industry.” The company believes that by making the supply chain more visible, it will enable issues to be identified quicker and also for others to identify change within the supply chain. “This in turn enables us to investigate and work to remedy the issues alongside suppliers, NGO partners, governments and other stakeholders,” the company said. The palm oil supply chain is long and complex, Unilever explains, with the palm oil changing hands many times before it reaches company factories. The fruit is grown on plantations where farmers sell their produce to middle men and agents. They in turn supply it to a mill where the fruit bunches are processed. Next it is transported via traders to refineries for further processing. Only after this point does it enter Unilever’s direct supply chain. “We have been long committed to lead the drive towards transparency and the best way to demonstrate this is by opening up our own supply chain,” says Marc Engel, Unilever’s chief supply chain officer. “Due to traditional commercial sensitivities and the complexity of the palm oil supply chain, it has required perseverance to get to where we are now. We are very proud to be the first consumer goods company to take this step. Unilever believes that complete transparency is needed for radical transformation. We want this step to be the start of a new industry-wide movement.” Housing permits rose 7.4% in January, indicating a strong start to the spring home building season, according to FTR’s Steve Graham. ‘This is a big step towards greater transparency, but we know there is more work to be done to achieve a truly sustainable palm oil industry and we will continue our efforts to make this a reality.’ – Marc Engel, Unilever’s chief supply chain officer, on the company’s plan to reveal details of its entire supply chain for palm oil As the Trump administration ponders tariffs on imported steel and aluminum products, China has threatened to retaliate while Japan and South Korea are lobbying against the measure.

The members of the Alliance felt the technology could help them solve problems without the need for an intermediary or using a third party Areas like driver recruiting, firm load contracts, accelerated payments, safety and compliance could all can be improved through blockchain technology. We recognized this, but we had no idea what the organization would become. In the first week, we had over 60 applications, almost all trucking-related in the US. At first, we chalked up the initial response to excitement, intrigue, and FOMO driving interest. But our membership applications continued to explode. We received applications beyond trucking, representing all modes of traffic, including truck, rail, ocean, and air, and they were coming from all over the world. We rebranded as the “Blockchain in Transport Alliance” and the applications continued to pour in. Today, we have members from 23 countries and have an application count that is over 1400. The organization is adding around 20 official members a week. Our membership generates over $1 trillion of combined freight revenues amongst them. We also have OEMs, vendors, banks, lawyers, accountants, insurance companies and others as part of the alliance. We find that most of the members of our organization are involved in technology or the use of data in their operations, either for their internal development or through their product offerings. Many of them are thinking about collaboration that goes well beyond blockchain and are interested in how data can be applied in their business models to make faster decisions. They are also eager to use technology to provide better experiences for clients. Certainly, reducing manual processes and accelerating cash flows are at top of everyone’s minds, but members want to go further. One of the things that we get asked regularly by people who are not involved is to describe Blockchain. Having done so thousands of times, we understand that the description of a distributed ledger does not help to explain it. So we have come up with a simple everyday example anyone could relate with to describe Blockchain. Here it is: Let’s say that you and a friend were to place a bet on a basketball game (we will call him Mike). He is a UNC fan and you root for Duke. So, we are betting on the UNC/Duke basketball game that will take place on March 3rd. You agree that the term of the bet is $100. We are placing this bet in February, so plenty of time for either to forget the terms of the bet. Both of you write down the bet in your independent “ledgers”. You write the bet in your phone and Mike puts it into Excel. Neither of you have any way to know what was written by the other, but both being honest and knowing the game is far off, you make the notes. Mike inadvertently leaves out a zero, making the bet $10 in his records, not $100. The game is played and Duke wins. It’s time for Mike to pay up. You call him up and ask for the $100 that was agreed to. He responds that it was $10. When you protest the amount, he tells you he has it in Excel as $10, not $100 as you suggest. You respond that you have it written down in your phone and it was $100. You are upset because you feel like he is trying to weasel out of a bet and Mike is upset because he is thinking you changed the terms of the bet. To deal with it, there are a few options. Mike can refuse to pay you anything until you have come to his number. You can agree to take the $10, upset thinking Mike “screwed you.” Mike can come to your number of $100, upset thinking you are “screwing him.” You guys can meet in the middle. You can hire a lawyer and sue Mike. Think of how often this happens in business, almost every single day. One party disagrees with another and then we are in a state of constant negotiation. Shippers refuse to pay bills because the invoice is off by a penny a mile or the fuel surcharge is wrong. Detention notification procedures are not followed, etc. Carriers service fail loads and you have to pay fines. Truck stops fail to honor pricing discounts that were agreed upon, thinking the fleet is too unsophisticated to notice. People forget. People change. The party with the most leverage usually wins. Our society has all sorts of ways to deal with it. We have armies of lawyers, arbitrators, letters of credit, processors, etc., but those get quite expensive, and they can be manipulated, too. But then came a technology known as blockchain that promises a better way. The technology itself is quite simple. Going back to our bet example, let’s say that you and Mike agree to use blockchain to record the bet. What would happen is pure magic (not really, but I’ve been at Disney this week). The bet would be recorded on the blockchain and both of you would have an identical copy. The $100 would have been agreed to by both parties. If either party tried to modify it, it would require consensus and all modifications would be ledgered, showing a perfect history of everything that happened. Now, when it came to call for the bet, both you and Mike would know that the original bet was $100. We have a perfect record. This is a simple use of blockchain. But there is more. Let’s say we get real crafty and decide we want to enforce the outcome. We create a “smart-contract.” This smart-contract is built to execute upon some kind of triggering event. In our case, it is the basketball game. So, we code the smart contract to read the final score from ESPN’s RSS feed. As soon as the game is over, ESPN sends an alert of the final score and our smart-contract gets triggered. It knows that UNC lost the game and is programmed to know that Mike owes you $100. We can even set up the smart contract to auto-settle the amounts by linking it to some type of monetary instrument, escrow account, or automating a payment process. Each of these have advantages and disadvantages. Cryptocurrencies: The term cryptocurrency gets thrown around a lot because it is a digital currency that is fungible into another currency (ETH to USD for instance). A cryptocurrency is most commonly used for these types of applications, primarily because they have created a fantastic way for blockchain startups to raise capital to fund development. The downside is that both parties must agree to accept the currency, there is substantial volatility in the value of the currency, and the regulatory environment is not certain (and large corporates are unlikely to adopt them until it is). The other drawback of cryptocurrency is the tax treatment of them and the fact that the IRS sees these as assets and requires mark-to-market accounting treatment, meaning the holder of cryptocurrencies owns principal risk in the value. The other issue is that exchanging cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies–and vice versa–is usually fairly expensive (fees can be as much as 3%). Escrow account-based smart contracts: Some of the use cases we have seen are where two counter-parties will agree to put a small amount of money into an escrow clearing account. Advantages include the ability to get paid in USD, the funds are held by a third party, and there is little risk of default. The disadvantage of using an escrow account is that both parties must have money tied up on the front end and there is a cost involved in the escrow process. Smart payment: A financial institution or fintech company agrees to stand in for the default and performance risk of the smart contract. Once the contract outcome has been determined, the contract will be cleared automatically. The smart contract pulls the money from the fintech and puts the money in the correct party’s account. The fintech is responsible for collecting payment from the paying counter-party. The fintech could offer to front the money (securitizing) or require the payor to originate the money and once the funds are on hand, they will transmit it to the payee. If you go back to our bet, we can talk about how this will be settled. You have coded the smart contract to payout upon an agreed set of conditions and events. If you used a Secured Smart Payment contract, a fintech would “back” the value of the contract, meaning that you would actually be collecting funds from the fintech and not Mike. Mike would have a credit account at the fintech and the fintech would collect from Mike. If you are interested in learning more and getting involved in the future of freight, we invite you to join BiTA. We will also dive deeper into these concepts at our future of freight summit in Atlanta in May known as Transparency18, where we are assembling the most innovative minds in freight and transportation.","TAGS":"basketball, BiTA, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Craig Fuller, CEO at FreightWaves","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-02-19T01:44:48-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain-driving-name-changes","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/blockchainimage-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"From blockchain to big bucks, it’s all in a name","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"A trend among companies trying to be relevant in today’s investing climate is becoming apparent. When the Long Island Iced Tea Corporation decided to change its name to Long Blockchain and saw its stock rise, other companies quickly saw the opportunity to regain valuable marketing exposure by adding the word “blockchain” to their company name as well. Castle Rock, CO-based company Bioptix was one of the first to see the rise of blockchain as a business trend to hit gold. While pundits point to Bitcoin as “the new gold rush,” companies see the term blockchain as springboard to relevance. Once rebranding itself Riot Blockchain in October 2017 saw its stock jumped from $3 a share to a high of $38.60. The rebranding effort then infused their operations into investing in other blockchain companies, a major enterprise shift for a company originally known for peddling animal fertility products. Riot’s new CEO, John O’Rourke, also reportedly cashed in on the blockchain trend by unloading 30,383 shares that he owned in the company into the stock market once its shares hit $46.80 apiece. He ended up earning about $869,000 from the transaction, raising eyebrows about the so-called “Friday Dump.” O’Rourke cited taxes as the reason for selling his own shares. He told Denver Post, “Basically, I sold less than 10 percent of my overall position. And I was doing it for tax obligations.” The iconic Kodak brand is another that is cashing in on the blockchain and bitcoin frenzy. After the old film manufacturing company had “lent its name to a digital currency called KodakCoin,” according to the New York Times, its shares shot up 200 percent late in January 2018. KodakCoin is slated to fuel a blockchain used by its roster of photographers for making permanent their records and better traceability of photographs captured. This rebranding effort also resulted in striking a licensing deal over the Kodak KashMiner, a device dubbed as “a Bitcoin-mining computer” with the goal of generating its own cryptocurrency. Other companies like the Crypto Company and UBI Blockchain Internet (formerly JA Energy) are not so lucky. Both companies felt the brunt of the blockchain crunch as the SEC suspended them after suspicion of conducting “potentially manipulative transactions.”","TAGS":"Blockchain, Kodak, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Economics, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-02-17T19:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/bita-welcomes-simple-logistics","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/simplelogisticslogo-1.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BiTA welcomes 3PL Simple Logistics","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"St. Charles, IL-based Simple Logistics is the latest 3PL to become a member of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). “With the rapid growth that we are experiencing, we are excited about BiTA and the use of blockchain technology.

Commenting on the announcement, OpenPort Founder and CEO Max Ward said, “In developing regions, where the financial resources allocated for the movement of goods can reach as high as 25% of a nation’s annual GDP, paper-based proof of delivery systems delay invoicing, impact working capital and open the door to disputes.” “For emerging markets experiencing economic growth, freight volumes are outstripping the capacity for efficient and cost-effective scaling, raising logistics costs. New technologies such as blockchain proof of delivery and tokenized micro-rewards for supply chain participants provide a clear solution,” added Ward. Delivering real-time status updates from tender through to the delivery stage, OpenPort facilitates lower costs, increased control, and improved cash flow. Already supporting many of the world’s largest shippers, including engagements with 7 of the 10 largest multinational FMCGs, OpenPort is Asia’s only multinational digital logistics provider. At present, OpenPort is facilitating direct, transparent relationships among parties in the supply chains of China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. Facilitated by the OpenPort OpenTM (transport management) software and Driver App, an application that allows truck drivers to use their phones to capture electronic proof of delivery (ePOD) and send shipment data during transport, OpenPort’s digital ePOD ecosystem was established in early 2017. OpenPort is now utilizing blockchain technology to create an immutable ePOD with an indisputable record of the freight’s history and plans to use micro-rewards to incentivize data sharing via its OPN token. “OpenPort’s technology framework shows great promise and the Asian Pacific rim where the organization is focused is the world’s factory.

Blockchain technology allows many parties to contribute data and share access to a common ledger in a way that prevents any participant from tampering with the integrity of the data. In logistics, for example, this could mean that all parties related to a freight move – from shippers and carriers to software providers and financial partners – could create a shared and trustworthy digital record that contains information at every phase of that move, from load tendering to payment. Although still in its infancy, blockchain has been characterized as a disruptive technology that, if widely adopted, could enable a giant leap forward in supply chain collaboration and automation. Cass processed nearly $25 billion in 2017 on behalf of its freight payment clients and is a global leader in freight payment services. “Cass joined BiTA so it could participate in conversations surrounding the important areas of audit, accounting, payment and related business intelligence,” stated Mark Campbell, president of Transportation Information Services at Cass Information Systems. “We share the view of fellow BiTA members that blockchain is a promising technology for advancements in transportation.” BiTA, founded in 2017, has already achieved great success attracting a wide variety of member companies, including logistics, technology, OEM, financial services and other organizations. “Adding a freight audit and payment company to our membership was vital,” commented Craig Fuller, BiTA co-founder. “Carrier payment is obviously a key component in the movement of goods, and Cass certainly has an influential voice among our members.” About Cass Information Systems, Inc.

We are creating an ecosystem which brings investors, lenders, developers, contractors, sub-contractors, engineers, and architects together. The ecosystem collectively can help run large-scale public infrastructure projects in a way that it provides value to individual participants,” says David Stout, vice president of operations at OpCentre Inc. The ecosystem that the foundation envisions has different components that provide value to specific participants. Across the world, infrastructure projects are predominantly funded and built by government entities, with many such projects prolonging completion due to lack of transparency and accountability, thereby increasing costs over the estimated budget. In that stead, the foundation looks to create a crowdfunding initiative to develop a greater public-private partnership which could foster large-scale infrastructure projects and raise them quickly off the ground. “There are billions of dollars worth of infrastructural projects across the world that need to be built, but aren’t getting done due to excessive bureaucracy and lack of public funding,” explains Stout. “Our goal is to expedite that process. From the initiation perspective, we are creating a crowdfunding platform where apart from the money that comes from government entities, a part of it could come from private investors.” One of the major challenges with regard to infrastructure projects is raising money to do feasibility studies on the site. This is critical to the project as it helps determine the economic viability, environmental impact, timeline of the project, and operational requirements. “A lot of times, it is hard to get the feasibility studies funded because they can take a significant amount of time and also there’s no guarantee with the feasibility studies that the project is initiated,” notes Stout. The foundation is filling that gap by helping fund specific strategic infrastructure projects, in part by the money it has. At present, it has funded the feasibility studies of a project in Sao Paulo. “Another component of the ecosystem is the ability to use blockchain for faster payments, and streamlining it between developers and contractors, from the schedule of values they maintain to the payment application submission,” adds Stout. “The key components of the payment cycle will be done through smart contracts, and the approval processes will be stored on the blockchain.” The foundation plans to utilize its BuildCoin token along with the smart contracts and workflow processes to expedite the payment for all the players within the ecosystem. Apart from this, the foundation would capture information of performance in large-scale infrastructure projects, record their timelines and their capacity to toe the budget, meet regulations, and also keep a lookout for other issues that stagnate projects. This information would eventually be made available to investors and people who are looking to fund future projects by specific developers. This would help drive more project investments and funding, believes Stout. “It will be easier for investors because they would have more insights, information, and historical data to base their future investment decisions on.” That being said, the foundation is not stopping with infrastructural projects but is also looking at transportation as well, having been in talks with Hyperloop, about what the mission of the BuildCoin Foundation is about and how it could suit the former’s interest. The foundation is on the lookout for people to contribute to feasibility studies through new innovative ways of looking at infrastructure and have a dramatic shift in how such projects are seen by the community today. “Our goal is to make people think this is a great platform to run and manage large-scale infrastructure projects on,” concludes Stout. “And our job at the foundation isn’t about holding anyone accountable. We are creating a platform which in itself holds the different players accountable and ensures transparency.” The beauty of blockchain is that it is an immutable record that stores and records information. The blockchain in itself becomes the holder and also the approver, while people who participate in the ecosystem become the key to the system’s success.

LoadBlock, an Arizona-based start-up, is capitalizing on this shift in technology by developing blockchain-integrated systems, primarily their all-in-one solution for a load board, invoice management, and invoice factoring platform. To be considered for one of the available Demo Day spots, register online at: https://transparency18.com/participate/apply-to-demo/ Thomas Shivers, CEO of LoadBlock, recognizes the numerous inefficiencies that haunt the freight industry, like the 30-day delay in payments between brokers and carriers. Freight companies in need of cash flow are forced to factor their invoices at suboptimal rates, and still wait upwards of 1 – 2 weeks for payments to settle. LoadBlock’s Ethereum-based load board will allow carriers to place their invoices on a peer-to-peer marketplace, where they can receive instant factoring at rates of up to 99% (higher volume freight companies will receive higher rates to incentivize mass adoption of the platform). Outside lenders can buy any invoice listed, creating an unprecedented amount of liquidity for freight companies seeking immediate cash flow. Transactions on the Ethereum blockchain are near instantaneous, so users can factor their invoices and receive payments instantly. LoadBlock recently joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), a standards organization that seeks to create a common framework for industry participants to engage in blockchain technology. This relationship will eventually lead to a standardized way of representing invoices on the blockchain, a necessary goal for creating an open-marketplace where any freight company can factor their invoice, regardless of which platform the invoice originated from. However, factoring isn’t the only issue that LoadBlock is facing head on. The recent Electronic Logging Device (ELD) mandate has severely cut down on productivity for freight companies … reduced hours on the road means there is an even more pressing demand for efficiency within a trucker’s working hours. LoadBlock’s mobile application seeks to fix this by providing accurate ETA’s to nearby truck stops as well as alternative routes through advanced data analytics. This will prevent truckers from having to pull off to the side of the road preemptively while delivering time-sensitive cargo. John Quarnstrom, CTO of LoadBlock, is working hand-in-hand with numerous advisors and developers to integrate various blockchain solutions onto the LoadBlock platform. Their primary blockchain, Ethereum, has a proven track-record for providing valuable Smart Contract logic for businesses, while other blockchains, such as Dash, facilitate secure and encrypted transactions – a must have for larger corporations looking to secure their data. John is focused on fueling the adoption of blockchain technology by maintaining an open mind to any and all blockchain-powered solutions. A key member of LoadBlock’s advisory board, Dragan Boscovic, will play a huge role in identifying which blockchains are most applicable and beneficial to the freight industry. Dr. Boscovic is currently head of the Blockchain Research Lab at ASU and offers unique insight into this burgeoning technology. His affiliation with Dash, expertise with data analytics, and overall experience within IoT and data communications industries will prove tremendously helpful throughout the developmental phases of LoadBlock.

Closing arguments began yesterday and will continue today; the jury will begin its deliberations tomorrow, Wednesday. The jury is not scheduled to work on Thursday or Friday and may return a verdict as early as tomorrow. Regardless of whether defendants Hazelwood, Wombold, Mann, and Jones are found guilty or acquitted of conspiracy and fraud—or if there’s a mixed verdict on the various counts—transportation industry observers can leave the proceedings with some important lessons learned. One of the things that the Pilot trial’s testimony and filings have brought out into the light of day is the remarkable extent to which the trucking industry has weaponized data. What do we mean by ‘weaponized’? It’s worth recounting, for a moment, exactly what the Pilot executives and administrative workers were accused of. Pilot diesel salesmen offered cost-plus discounts to trucking carriers in exchange for agreements to purchase a certain number of gallons of diesel fuel. The cost-plus discount referred to the wholesale price of diesel fuel plus a few cents as a kind of pumping fee. CP-1 would be the wholesale price plus one cent, a very low rate; CP-8 would be the wholesale price plus eight cents, a much higher rate. The truck drivers bought the fuel at the pumps to fill their tractors, and periodically their carrier would submit their fuel spend records to Pilot. Pilot then calculated the difference between the retail price paid and the cost-plus discount that was negotiated and returned the money to the carrier in the form of a rebate. Pilot would then manually adjust the rebate—the nickname for this process was ‘Manuel’, because Pilot often stole from Latino-owned carriers—in its favor and pay back less than its customers were owed. The trouble was that it was almost impossible for a supra-regional or regional trucking carrier to know exactly how much money it was owed. Wholesale fuel prices fluctuate daily and a patchwork of state and local fuel taxes complicated retail prices—and thus rebate amounts—even further. Many medium- and small-sized carriers found it too difficult to replicate Pilot’s math if their rebate came in lower than expected, so they simply trusted in Pilot Flying J’s honesty. Pilot’s direct sales division would experiment with a specific customer by slightly cutting its rebate, and if Pilot heard no protests in return, the truckstop chain squeezed the customer even further, sometimes raising the ‘pumping fee’ to four times what it should have been. This is what we mean by ‘weaponized data’—Pilot Flying J used its superior data resources to identify holes in its customers’ information and exploit them. “Some of ‘em don’t even know what a spreadsheet is,” as Brian Mosher, Pilot director of national sales, phrased it to a group of sales reps at a training session. The American trucking industry is highly fragmented, meaning that even the top 100 carriers account for only a small fraction of total capacity on the market. The majority of carriers are small, though there are big regional and national players, and consolidation entered a new phase last year with the Knight-Swift mega-merger. Due to trucking’s fragmentation, the adoption of new technologies and the distribution of technological resources, including computing hardware, software licenses, and data professionals, has been very uneven. One of our mantras at FreightWaves comes from an article that appeared in The Economist: “the world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data,” or in shorthand, “data is the new oil.” And the uneven distribution of data expertise in trucking has translated to a corresponding uneven distribution of power. Insurance companies, freight brokers, factors, fuel providers, and shippers with stronger data operations than the carriers they deal with all have a corresponding advantage in negotiating contracts, and, as in the Pilot fraud case, a corresponding advantage in assessing the other party’s performance in a given contract. Pilot found out that their real advantage wasn’t in using the massive size of their network to squeeze their customers in the negotiation stage—the truckstop chain’s real advantage was in navigating the complex, index-based pricing data after the contract had been signed. Pilot figured out that it didn’t matter what the contract said if the other party didn’t have the data chops to verify Pilot’s performance. The inability of small outfits to leverage their own data resources means that they have to defer to larger entities, and often this means they have to trust them in order to do business. The Pilot trial revealed that that trust can sometimes be misplaced, and a company with a better data operation will not only use its information to its own advantage, but it will systematically identify your weaknesses and exploit them. One solution might be blockchain technology. Blockchain-powered fuel payments would be indexed to the day’s wholesale diesel price, with fully automated discount calculations visible to both parties. The fuel contracts would self-execute and would not be vulnerable to the kind of manual rebate manipulation that Pilot Flying J engaged in with its customers. Morgan Stanley has said that the revenue opportunity for blockchain-enabled truck fuel payments alone is $150B. The overall effect would be to level the playing field and allow smaller companies with little data infrastructure to have confidence in their dealings with larger, more sophisticated players, without having to trust them.

That was one of the main points that Michael Zargham, founder and CEO of BlockScience, told about 150 members of the New York Supply Chain Meetup group during a discussion last month in New York City entitled, “Decentralized Systems \u0026 Supply Chains.” To illustrate his point, Zargham noted the supply chain of an automobile. The finished car is pulling components from numerous supply chains, for items such as electronics, steel, oil, seats, etc. “At some level, they cross-constrain each other,” he said. “Ultimately, you’re not solving a local problem, you’re solving a global one. “The problem for me as an entity [within the supply chain] … is fundamentally limited by the information,” Zargham added. The introduction of blockchain to the supply chain is a significant step towards bringing these disparate systems and information into agreement. “In the blockchain world, our consensus algorithms provide a solution that is Byzantine robust,” Zargham said. “The bridge into blockchain is that the blockchain allows us [to approve prior data/events].” This is done through the distributed ledger technology – allowing ledgers to only update when the transactions are approved by the appropriate participants. Ultimately, the key is agreement, Zargham noted. “If we have the record and agree on the priors, then we can move forward [with the next transaction],” he explains. “We can use blockchain to agree on a state and then we can do a local computation.” That will help solve those local problems, but everyone will have access to that solution, making the overall chain more effective. “Blockchain allows us to agree on the current state of things … so we can get better models,” Zargham said, adding that blockchain’s effectiveness in the supply chain will likely fall in three areas: finance, logistics and for chain of custody applications. In response to questions following his presentation, Zargham suggested not looking at the big blockchain picture. “It’s probably not useful to talk about the whole blockchain,” he said. “I think we’re talking about specific networks, likely permissioned, to run the supply chain. “I think in the blockchain hype, it’s easy to forget that when it is actually operating, it’s facilitating things and we won’t be talking about [blockchain],” Zargham added, comparing it to current operating systems that in essence, just work without the need to discuss how they work or even what system it is that is doing the work. Following Zargham’s keynote address, a group of panelists discussed blockchain in a free-flowing discussion. Representing different backgrounds, each panelist talked about their vision of blockchain within their operations. “What’s really fascinating to me about the promise of blockchain … is the shared ledger of tracking products through the supply chain,” said Rob Bailey, CEO and co-founder of MState, a growth lab for enterprise blockchain companies. He mentioned that within the cold chain, temperature of product can be monitored as it moves through the supply chain and a shared ledger can assist everyone in ensuring that product maintained the correct temperature throughout. Later in the discussion, he pointed out that it’s important for the larger companies to be involved in pushing blockchain. “I don’t think blockchain will be successful without big companies like SAP, UPS and L’Oreal,” he said, before noting that startups will play a critical role in this. “I think some of the startups are being agile and have some of the ideas, but they need the big companies [to leverage their networks],” explained Kange Kaneene, director of business development for SAP Ariba, which provides cloud-based solutions. Mahesh Sahasranaman, principal architect, Supply Chain Solutions at UPS, agreed. “You need the startups with the ideas that can provide [the innovation] to solve use cases,” he said. UPS and SAP are both members of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance, which is a collection of companies involved in the movement of freight working toward creating common standards and providing education on blockchain. Sahasranaman noted that UPS views risk management as a potential avenue for blockchain, in addition to the more traditionally thought of supply chain applications. “We do have a risk management [division] where we provide insurance for maritime parcels that move on ships,” he said. “We want to utilize blockchain to facilitate” writing and enforcing policies. All the panelists agreed that within 5 years, an enterprise blockchain solution will reach critical mass in the supply chain. A few, such as Bailey and Kaneen, believe it will be within 18 months. Sahasranaman predicts 2021 or 2022, while Natalie Stanetsky, manager of IT application security at L’Oreal and co-organizer of the group Women in Blockchain, says it will happen, but there are still limitations. “From a blockchain perspective, we need to be aware of the limitations [of the supply chain],” she said. “Fortunately, there are companies working on those limitations and I think within five years, many will be solved [and blockchain can take off].” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain in transport alliance, Supply chain, Technology, Transparency, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Economics, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-02-05T14:01:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/peir-to-demo-product-at-transparency18","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/PEIR-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Always with you, and always ready to provide irrefutable photographic evidence","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Transparency18 Sponsored article An estimated 17M ocean shipping containers make approximately 200M trips globally on an annual basis. A typical international shipping container is interchanged between 8-10 parties before the load is delivered. To be considered for one of the 40 available Demo Day spots, register online at: https://transparency18.com/participate/apply-to-demo/ At each one of the interchange points, the potential exists that the receiving party obtains a shipping container that is damaged, or the seal has been tampered with or broken. In today’s market, there is no irrefutable blockchain photographic evidence with date, time, and location that records the actual condition of the equipment or the seal status except for PEIR Mobile. Without PEIR we call that “interchanging in the dark” or interchanging with your eyes closed. PEIR™ operates on the premise that a picture is worth 1000 words which makes our irrefutable Blockchain technology priceless. With PEIR’s easy to use mobile app, a permanent, irrefutable record is accomplished anywhere with any iOS or Android mobile device that has a front facing camera and an internet connection. PEIR™ users are guided through an intuitive, step by step process in real time, capturing the entire ocean container, chassis or trailer. At any point during the process, PEIR™ users can flag damage and capture additional photos of damage or the seal to further protect their company. After the process is completed, the user reviews all the photos taken to verify the interchange. At this point PEIR utilizes patent pending technology which takes the meta data collected from the device and creates an immutable cryptic hash. This cryptic hash is then joined to the inspection record and the series of pictures. That data is then stored and rendered irrefutable through the blockchain in a daily journal. Today carriers are paying millions of dollars for damages and freight claims, even if they weren’t responsible. If they had PEIR, they would have irrefutable blockchain photographic evidence to prove otherwise. Spending money to settle the claims without photo evidence will no longer be a normal part of doing business. PEIR provides carriers with an inexpensive insurance policy that they can depend on to protect them from paying for damages or claims they did not cause or the driver failed to record. For about $1 per interchange, carriers will no longer interchange in the dark. When a repair invoice or freight claim arrives, the carrier will use PEIR to look up the interchange and provide the billing party a link to the irrefutable and immutable documentation that protects them. No more digging through boxes of paper interchanges, notes in dispatch systems, or hand-written driver notes only to end up not finding the documents, and even if found they may not be considered irrefutable proof. PEIR makes this ongoing problem solvable with a couple of keyboard clicks. Through PEIR, the interchange is irrefutably recorded utilizing the Blockchain to include the date, time, geo-coordinates coupled with the series of photos which then are searchable. As technology continues to advance and improve within the shipping industry, PEIR will be looking to have a block in the chain that includes the interchange and other valuable meta data. PEIR Mobile is insurance that you carry around in your pocket. Don’t get stuck holding the bag, PEIR Mobile is there so that interchanges are no longer done in the dark.

FedEx, being a global leader in logistics and as a company known for its eagerness to innovate and stay ahead of the curve, has joined Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). FedEx has its reasons to keep a tab on technologies that can usher greater transparency and data security to logistics processes. The company comes into the blockchain sphere in the wake of a high-profile cyber attack on its TNT express branch in Europe last year. Reports indicate that the integration of TNT into FedEx operations would cost the company a whopping $1.4 billion over the next four years – a number that was revised from an initial forecast of $800 million. FreightWaves spoke with Dale Chrystie, vice president of strategic planning \u0026 analysis at FedEx Freight, and Kevin Humphries, senior vice president of IT at FedEx Services earlier this week, about the prospects of blockchain and how they look at FedEx’s association with BiTA. “We are proud to be a founding member of BiTA and the BiTA standards board, because we want to work on developing common standards around blockchain technology in the transportation industry,” says Chrystie. “We continually try to enhance the customer’s experience, and blockchain is tied to that. We try to make it easy for our customers to do business with us. Since the technology is around making data more secure and transparent, we see that it holds a lot of promise.” “FedEx has a long history of innovation in the logistics space since the beginning,” adds Humphries. “One of our focuses has always been to find innovative ways to provide the kind of visibility that our customers need to get all the information up and down the supply chain. And blockchain is opening the door to that by giving customers even more visibility to their package before it gets in our hands and after it leaves our hands.” By many counts, the blockchain revolution cuts parallels to the time when people woke up to the idea of the internet. Companies have realized the amount of data that supply chains create every day and the potential of the existing data pile they are sitting on. In that regard, safety and transparency of data are of utmost importance, leading to the significance of blockchain. “We have millions of records a day in our system, and we think of blockchain as a secure chain of custody that could transform the logistics industry. We believe it holds a lot of promise in that space and would streamline all that data exchange in a very secure way,” explains Chrystie. “The nature of the distributed ledger and having common definitions \u0026 standards is something that is applicable from origin to destination in the supply chain. So we are pretty hopeful that blockchain will have many use cases,” adds Humphries. FedEx is also looking to work on some blockchain pilot programs, with some of them already underway. “Our early work is in dispute resolution, where we have customers both upstream and downstream from us, trying to speak back in a common language. We are trying to determine if that data is common and in some cases, we as carriers, don’t necessarily have all the data that we would like to have,” notes Chrystie. “And if we could agree on these elements and standards, we think we can drive a lot of efficiency in the process, and that’s just one example.” FedEx is developing a few pilots to make sure it has an edge in the technology. Pilot programs help the company grow its knowledge on technology implementation across different platforms and also in understanding its scalability and performance characteristics, believes Humphries. Although blockchain is still in its nascent stages of growth, it looks like it is here to stay. “I would foundationally go back to the fact that it is innovation,” concludes Chrystie. “Innovation is in our DNA at FedEx. We have been at the cutting edge for decades, and at this point, we think blockchain is a fantastic technology coming along, and we certainly want to play in this space.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"BiTA, Blockchain, FedEx, logistics, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-31T16:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2018/1/31/reliance-partners-joins-blockchain-in-transport-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reliancepartnerslogo-1.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Reliance Partners joins Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Today Reliance Partners, the fastest growing privately-held property and casualty insurance brokerage in the United States, announced its membership into the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA).

What they settled on was Demo Day. Demo Day is an opportunity for just 40 companies to showcase their solutions. “Participants should be prepared to showcase emerging, disruptive, and innovative technology solutions catapulting freight transportation and logistics to the next level,” organizers said. “There will be no slides. The format will be fast-paced, 7-minute demonstrations providing live, simulated or video of new technology products and services.” Transparency18 is sponsored by FreightWaves and the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), in conjunction with the Georgia Tech Institute of Technology. Transparency18 will be held at the Georgia International Conference Center in Atlanta, GA, on May 22-23, 2018. Registration is now open. Demo Day presentations may focus on, but are not limited to: Companies can currently apply to participate in Demo Day, but there are rules. First, only 40 slots are available, and when they are filled up, applications for participation will close. The final deadline for applications is March 9, 2018, but it is a rolling application process, so when all 40 slots are filled up, applications will close. There is a fee to present. One of the slots is being awarded to the winner of the HackTheIndustry event taking place April 13-14, 2018. Secondly, selection for participation will be based on product relevance to the industry and timeliness (to market in less than 6 months), and it must focus on emerging, disruptive and innovative solutions. Finally, each presentation will be limited to 7 minutes and slide decks or Powerpoint presentations will not be allowed. “Powerpoint sucks for most technology presentations. People actually want to experience the application first-hand and a pitch deck doesn’t give that opportunity, so we have banned it from our Demo Day. No vaporware. The format is a lot of fun and engaging because you get just enough to see a taste of the app, without having to sit through a long-winded presentation that is there to just fill time,” notes Craig Fuller, managing director of BiTA. Companies presenting on Demo Day will be provided a breakout area where presenters can network with attendees when not on stage and all presentations will be professionally recorded and posted to the event website for post-event viewing. Some of the companies that have already signed up to present on Demo Day will be featured on FreightWaves in the coming weeks. Transparency18 will feature Demo Day on May 22 and a more traditional format on Day 2, featuring industry-leading speakers and sessions led by top Wall Street sell-side analysts from the trucking and logistics space; futurists covering subjects impacting the industry such as blockchain, autonomous vehicles, hyperloop, drones, and digitization; and market data and research on the impact of technology on the freight markets. The morning will feature keynote speakers followed by afternoon breakout sessions focused on financial, technology and commercial tracks. Keynote speakers include author and thought-leader Tony Seba, futurist Jason Schenker, blockchain researcher Bettina Warburg, and business executive Don Tapscott.

The sales reps for the carriers that had the strongest relationships with the shippers would win a substantial amount of volume. Price might be in play, but if a carrier were off on pricing, they would be given the deets on what to charge and where to ensure their place in the routing guide. This is the reason that aggressive 3PLs with mature sales operations hire recruiters to go out and find the reps with the biggest books. To protect their high-performing reps, brokers and carriers would use non-compete agreements to ensure that the book of business did not leave the company if the rep were to leave. Many freight companies have built their businesses through raiding talent of larger companies, hoping that with the sales rep comes a large customer win. No judgement here. In fact, I know of at least one $100M broker that has two primary customers that were acquired simply by raiding front-line customer service folks of a much larger trucking company. Recently some of the investor pitch decks for the digital brokers have been floating around that brag about how efficient the company is in its sales process. Stats like our sales reps generate $6M/person become big points of pride, when in fact the stat itself is meaningless. No mention of what the margins are in that book or what the revenue per employee for the whole company is overall. As a point of comparison, many of the largest for-hire carriers have sales reps that do an average of over $30M each in revenue and often from only a few select shippers. Since when did top-line revenue become such an important stat in freight pitch decks? Isn’t the metric supposed to be gross margins or net revenues? The reason for this is simple- Silicon Valley investors have encouraged it. By pumping hundreds of millions of dollars into our industry, they have encouraged startups to grow top-line at all cost without consideration of what their margins would be. Never mind that we’ve never had a substantial exit in freight that has been based on top-line revenue. The traditional buyers of logistics companies are far more disciplined and intelligent than anyone on Sand Hill road gives them credit for. But rather than completely dismissing venture capital investors as drunk sailors at port with a fist-full of dollars, we should examine why they are bidding up these companies. They see something far more powerful and promising that even the most seasoned freight executive would recognize. The rules are changing. Soon, we will enter the next generation of freight companies, where the personal relationship between the company and the carrier is meaningless. In this world, the strength of the relationship is entirely predicated by the speed of execution and the ability for the carrier to provide instant pricing and universal tracking. The color of the truck or name on the trailer will not matter to the shipper in this next evolutionary phase. Investors that invested in Uberization will discover that CH Robinson was the original Uber and no mobile-based broker is going to destroy them. But what will change their model and the entire industry will be actionable data and the ability to create value from these data-streams. In a post relationship world, the highest paid roles will not be sales reps, but rather data-scientists. The ability to compete in RFPs will be predicated by how fast a company can guarantee capacity at a predictable price. Blockchain will become a key component in shipper RFPs. We are already seeing this, in-fact. One major retailer has been asking carriers to describe their blockchain strategy as part of their RFP answer. This same shipper has a history of using technology to optimize their supply-chain. Price and capacity discovery will all be based on data and less on gut or negotiation. Shippers will demand to know where their freight is at all times and who is behind the wheel. Carriers will be forced to comply with shipper requirements, not just to check the box in an RFP, but because there will be an entire forensics history of compliance. Much like Michael Lewis described the impact of speed of information in capital markets in his best-selling book Flash Boys, the victors in the future of freight will be companies that use machine learning, large data sets, and blockchain to speed up freight execution.

The company has confirmed its plan to eventually evolve by rebranding itself into VeChain Thor as reported in Coin Central. VeChain says it has been fusing blockchain technology and their internally-developed smart chip system for about 2 years now. The smart chip was implemented in various IoT projects like “NFC chips, RFID trackers, or GR codes.” They can be useful in product quality control for retail companies to avoid losing business to the counterfeiters. For example, a common enterprise losing business to counterfeiters is French manufacturer Louis Vuitton. A single purse, just like most luxury items, gets released to the market involving a series of middle men or intermediaries, especially in online transactions where a single item can change hands multiple times. Multiply this transaction a hundred times over and it’s easy to lose track of the genuine Louis Vuitton purse. Trust is behind VeChain’s use of blockchain technology to connect buyers to legitimate sellers. If a smart chip is included in each genuine Louis Vuitton item, once one of these shipments is sold, the transaction is reflected in the blockchain based data from the smart chip. With the blockchain recording transactions in real-time, Louis Vuitton is notified of a sale and the party purchasing the goods can see in the blockchain that the item bought is genuine. VeChain’s plan to rebrand was brought about by its entry into the Enterprise DApp solutions, a platform that Ethereum is known for. In adopting Enterprise DApp solutions, the company will then offer 2 tokens under its brand – VeChain Tokens (VET) and Thor Power (THOR). Enterprises interested in participating in the rejuvenated BaaS company have to purchase VET. No date of an initial coin offering (ICO) has been announced yet. But the more VET an enterprise possesses, the higher the priority they attain in the VeChain Thor blockchain. VET is also seen as a currency used to help boost the perceived market value of THOR. An enterprise cannot buy or earn THOR without investing in VET first. THOR tokens are necessary on self-executing (smart) contracts. The rebranding is scheduled for Feb. 26.

It is here that blockchain has found its success in, with it capable of revolutionizing business transactions by bringing in a ledger that can provide a secure and verified route for transactions and value storage. Samsung SDS’s Blockchain platform, Nexledger, was designed to take full advantage of these proven benefits of blockchain and to allow full-scale blockchain implementations into existing enterprise business processes. “Nexledger provides the infrastructure and services required to implement blockchain technology, for all industries, including logistics, financial services, electronics, and manufacturing,” says Seungkee Baek, principal consultant at Logistics Business Unit, Samsung SDS. “The Nexledger is an agile system that can rapidly launch a variety of blockchain based services including payment transactions, authentication security, authentication verification, cross-institutional transactions, IoT solutions. Security and stability of the system are guaranteed with blockchain based information processing. The foundations for growth is provided with the expansion friendly platform system that is not limited to any specific industry, channel or location.” Samsung SDS, undertook a 7-month pilot of Nexledger with South Korea’s shipping logistics companies, government shipping arms like the Oceans, Fisheries, and the Customs, alongside major ocean liners – becoming the foundation of what is being called the “Ocean Shipping Logistics Blockchain Consortium” now. The idea was to create a blockchain framework that could be the lynchpin of all shipping related logistics processes at the Korean ports. “We developed several functions for logistics processes such as purchase order, booking request, bill of lading, and freight tracking. As financial processes, we included freight insurance and settlement using open account transaction,” adds Baek. “Our proof of concept (PoC) can be classified into two – one focusing on logistics process, and the other covering end-to-end ocean shipping logistics process including financial process.” At the time of initiation, there were fifteen members in the consortium which has inflated to include 38 members now, including insurance companies, and bank and port terminal operators. One of the challenges faced by Samsung SDS while working on the pilot was converting paper-based documents into its electronic equivalent. “The first stage of PoC is to analyze the current ocean shipping logistics process, where we found that nearly 99% of the documents have already been generated by electronic data interchange (EDI) technology,” notes Baek. “Since blockchain stresses ‘sharing’ of data and not ‘exchange’ as EDI does, we had to define a common format of documents at each process. This can be easily resolved because we simplified the document format, by extracting common data from various document formats. This did work. Simplified data format composed of common data requirements eliminated any potential obstacle that members may have.” Baek firmly believes that blockchain will become a major player in distributing electronic bill of lading (e-BoL). Although several platforms such as Bolero exist in the market, blockchain based BoL will make an effective threat to existing e-BoL technologies because blockchain can be offered at competitive prices. “The hidden secret of the superior competitiveness of blockchain comes from smart contracts which allow autonomous data sharing and processing,” says Baek. With the success of the pilot run, Samsung SDS is keen on developing its logistics blockchain technology and its affiliated platform. A blockchain platform would guarantee trust amongst global trade parties, and Baek insists that this could lead to additional service offering like a blockchain based data analytics application (dApp). “We are interested in applying the blockchain platform to cross-border trade. The technology can be a good candidate for removing dispute of authenticity of trade documents, which would continue to boost up the speed of global trade,” explains Baek. Samsung SDS is also examining the feasibility of blockchain to create an innovative financial service ecosystem based on the supply chain network of manufacturers (Digital Supply Chain Finance). At present, most of the suppliers for major manufacturers receive promissory notes or bills for providing products, and use these notes to obtain short-term loans for stable cash-flows. By implementing blockchain to this network of participants, Samsung SDS believes the verification process would become transparent and create trust between all parties. This could categorically reduce risk for financial institutions, allowing them to provide lower interest rates on their loan to the suppliers, who can now charge the manufacturers less – thereby allowing the manufacturer to play at a more competitive pricing.

To help combat this there are crypto-based debit cards that convert cryptocoins to fiat currencies. Users upload a selected balance of cryptocoins from their cryptocurrency wallets that is then converted into fiat currencies and are ready for use. The cards are extremely popular because they allow cryptocurrency account holders to use their accounts to make simple purchases just like a regular debit card. However, thousands of European cryptocurrency debit card users were left in the lurch when Visa suddenly discontinued their services to cryptocurrency debit card issuer WaveCrest earlier this month. The announcement that Visa would stop servicing the cards came suddenly and most users had no idea it had happened until they tried to use their cards. There are concerns about increased regulation which is why some speculate that Visa terminated the relationship. However, there are other crypto debit card providers whose service has not been not discontinued. There is also speculation that the reason Visa cancelled the cards was because they felt threatened. However, with Visa’s volume of payments processed at over 100 billion transactions per year, most argue that Bitcoin’s annual average of 130 million does not compare. Others attempted to cast the move by Visa as repression of the small upstart by the large corporation due to greed or other nefarious motives.  The most likely reason that WaveCrest was pulled is because of the company’s own actions. Visa said that WaveCrest violated Visa’s operating regulations. Visa stated, “We can confirm that Visa’s partnership with WaveCrest has been terminated due to continued failure to comply with our operating rules. As a result, all WaveCrest Visa card programs will be finalized.” Despite the tumult caused by Visa cancelling WaveCrest’s service, several of WaveCrest’s customers are not overly concerned about the future of cryptocurrency debit card usage. In its statement Visa came out and explicitly stated that there are other cards that are not affected. “Visa has other approved cryptomanced card programs converted into trust funds in various jurisdictions,” the company said. “The termination of the Visa and WaveCrest partnership does not affect any of these other products”.

The youngest of our five companies, their software focuses on smart tendering, stitching together continuous jobs for drivers, workflow visibility, real-time alerts, and packages that integrate the software across numerous platforms. The very first version of TNX was released about 18 months ago, and the current generation is about a year old. They have customers using TNX in Europe — particularly the German, Swiss, Austria and Belgian areas — although their strongest presence is in New Zealand. “We are in particular looking at this with the view of a large shipper or 3PL in mind that has a variety of different alternatives on procuring trucking capacity, be it an owned fleet, subcontractors, or the spot market,” Hoffman tells FreightWaves. “We aim to tackle a key source of inefficiency in road transport: dispatching. Sometimes the differences are in the small details.” TNX gives drivers real-time leverage. They get to know what to put on a truck and where to send it and how to sequence the drop offs. Rather than making 10 calls to find out what’s available, and not feel like you’re in control, this gives much more control and efficiency. ShipChain uses Ethereum smart contracts to take out the need for freight brokers. Their technology tracks and verifies each stage of the complex shipping and logistics process, essentially acting as a digital broker for carriers around the globe. One example of a startup working on this is ShipChain, which aims to apply blockchain technology to the logistics space. A partner of BiTA, ShipChain is building a fully integrated supply chain management system that gives insight into each stage of the logistics process. In addition, the company aims to create a decentralized brokerage system — essentially an open marketplace for shippers and carriers. Leveraging the transparency of information on the blockchain, the marketplace will let shippers optimize cost and time for every shipment. In other words, shippers can track the capacity, cost and estimated delivery times for different routes for a given shipment before making a decision on the marketplace. At the same time, carriers can continually post information about their capacity for shipping vehicles and lanes, thereby dynamically adjusting the fairest pricing based on supply and demand. The transparency and efficiency afforded by the blockchain benefits all parties by allocating resources in the most effective way without artificial markups by rent-seeking brokers. Another BiTA partner, and this time coming out of Canada, Fleet Complete recently increased its workforce by 10 percent to keep up with demand for the electronic logs developed by BigRoad. It now employs 500 people, and between 130,000 and 140,000 truckers are using its electronic logs. As a result, the company is now implementing TMS system, Blackberry Radar, to understand temperature inside the freight to help understand the type of freight. “This maximizes the revenue for the driver, the trailer company, the carrier, and even offers discounts for the shippers along the way,” said Philip Poulidis, the company’s senior vice president for the Internet of Things and BlackBerry Radar. The BlackBerry Radar complements the BigRoad app the company has also recently absorbed. BigRoad describes themselves as the first company to launch in-app load matching within an electronic logbook application that suggests loads based on a driver’s GPS coordinates and available hours-of-service. Once registered, drivers are sent notifications recommending loads to them. They can view load details, including the payout, and choose to accept or reject loads from within the app. FR8Star is pursuing the most specialized segment of the freight transportation industry –- flatbed fleets — a $50 billion revenue market annually, with a ton of regulation often requiring special permits and escort services. From there, they plan to “land and expand” trying to build the right innovations for the emerging needs of the industry. Jessica Toy, Chief Product Officer at the company, along with Roslynn Tellvik, UX Designer, are two of the women at the company, which has an against-the-grain, 50/50 ratio of women to men on its technology team. Jessica brings her experiences at other disruptive tech companies including YouTube and Airbnb, and Roslynn provides a human experience sensibility with interface design. “Through our research we learned how to evolve the platform to add value. For example, by offering carriers more context about each load, they can easily estimate how much they’ll need to transport it. Which in turn gives more accurate pricing to our shippers. One of the things we also saw is that carriers often rely on their mobile phone to conduct business. So, we prioritized our driver app and mobile responsive versions of key flows on the web,” Tellvik told IoT Evolution. The customers of the FR8Star exchange are now more strategic in planning their loads and business, less reactive and more able to plan their pick-ups, drop-offs and routes in between more efficiently –- and more safely. That’s a win for everyone. Christian Lanng, Mikkel Hippe Brun and Gert Sylvest came from different backgrounds, but they’re all entrepreneurs at heart. Tradeshift’s alignment with decentralization and open-source development dates back to the founders’ relationships prior to founding Tradeshift. In 2005, they built Easy Trade, the world’s first open-source, peer-to-peer trade platform, where they established some of the world’s first standards for digital trade. “It’s our DNA and good business karma to make things open-source, so they come back to you,” CEO Lanng told TechCrunch. Tradeshift has now recently announced Tradeshift Frontiers, which allows developers to have access to open-source data with trade volume credibility, and the ability to develop third-party apps on their platform could be transformative for the global supply chain’s conscience and its bottom line. Analyzing aggregate trade data allows businesses to see where data is being valued and produce greater economic benefit in the chain. A developer could use blockchain to build an app based on this data to extrapolate anyone’s carbon usage, say, pressuring companies to opt in and report their own to strengthen their brand. Aggregate data could also be used to help companies identify where they are using more resources than necessary, and manage and track them more effectively. It’s virtually endless the possibilities, but it all begins by helping drivers maximize their margins and the rest of the interested parties in the chain all find ways to exponentially benefit.

BiTA was formed by experienced technology and transportation executives to create a forum for the development of blockchain standards and education for the freight industry. BiTA believes blockchain is one of the most significant developments for the industry since the creation of the internet. By providing more clarity and standards around blockchain through education and promotion of the technology, BiTA intends to be the leading blockchain voice for the industry. BiTA plans to create and publish its first blockchain market standards in 2018, standards that will create a blockchain implementation roadmap for the entire freight industry. “Blockchain technology’s impact on our industry is going to be significant: it can provide increased transparency for customers and can help supply chain services providers identify fraud quickly, due to the technology’s ability to maintain a source of truth,” said Eric Rempel, Chief Innovation Officer, Redwood. “Redwood is thrilled to have a seat at the table to collaborate with other industry leaders on developing practical, real-world standards that are poised to influence the industry for years to come.” Through engagement of the brightest minds from the most influential leaders in transportation, finance and technology, BiTA will build the first set of transportation industry-specific blockchain standards. BiTA is focused on providing educational resources and open forums to those in the industry interested in leading the evolution of the trucking industry through the efficiencies offered in blockchain technology. Many great transactional technologies that proliferate our industry are grounded in commonly accepted standards – including EDI, ISO, and ANSI. Like these standards, BiTA believes blockchain will benefit from having the same set of market standards.

Louis Dreyfus Company shipped 60,000 pounds of soybeans to China from the United States in the deal. The buyer was Chinese agriculture producers Shangdong Bohi Industries and the transaction was aided by the by financing from ING, Société Générale and ABN Amro. This is a reassuring sign for commodities shippers as they have been hoping that blockchain technology and smart contracts can handle some of the more tedious steps in the shipping process. This includes letters of credit, inspections, and other tasks that are currently emailed or faxed when goods are traded. Louis Dreyfus used only about 20% of the paper it normally would have in such a transaction according to the company’s global head of operations, Robert Serpollet. “Our expectations were high, but the results were even higher,” he told the Financial Times. Other ways the technology brings about quicker, safer, and more efficient ways of settling transactions are through gauging the progress of shipments in real time, data verification, and reduced risk of fraud.  The promise of blockchain technology has convinced multiple industries to run trials with smart contracts including the oil industry, banks, and others who engage in frequent large trades. However, for the technology to work at a large scale more players will have to warm to the idea of blockchain technology and come onboard. “For the new platform to work, we will need to design an industry standard which will bring together the main players of the agricultural commodity space,” said Serpollet. Some organizations have already done just that for their industries. Groups such as the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) have brought together players from across their respective industries in order to establish standards for the technology in their fields. BiTA has assembled a group of transportation industry players who aim to harness the potential of the technology for their industry. The association now has well over a thousand applicants and the interest continues to rise.

Turns out, possibly the single-most important aspect of the ELD mandate is not safety, but the beginning of a necessary technological shift to the blockchain revolution. Revolution, disruption, transformation, call it what you will, ELDs are preparing the yellow brick road of documentable, transparent, and lightning-speed-fast ledgers. “Ledgers” doesn’t sound sexy, but when you think about all it means, it is. Blockchain is also often called “disruptive” because it can revolutionize society, from the way Smart Cities are conceived and executed, to the way our grids work, to how we commute to and from home, to how we shop. Intermediaries and brokers are not going away—unless they want to stay in their pajamas and make phone calls from the basement of their parent’s house. They’re going to adapt or die just like everyone else. Drivers and carriers and law enforcement are just breaking new ground with the ELD adoption, or you could call it, ELD adaptation. According to recent KPMG data, the transportation industry’s “global value was $8.1 trillion in 2015, and is expected to grow to $15.5 trillion by 2023.” Not many industries get bigger. “55 billion tons of freight was transported in 2015, with expected growth to 92 billion tons by 2024. In the US, freight and logistics spend in 2015 totaled $1.48 trillion, 8% of the country’s GDP,” according to Select USA. The supply chain is complex. The lack of a unified communication platform prevents the cooperating players from interacting efficiently. “Most land transportation providers, carriers, governments, customs brokers, and freight forwarders have outdated ways of keeping track of their goods,” according to the KPMG report. “40% of global manufacturers lack information and material visibility across their supply bases. In some cases, companies are still using paper ledgers to track their products. Given that upwards of 65% of the value of a company’s products or services is derived from its suppliers and its supply chain, utilizing older highly ineffective systems results in tremendous amounts of wasted time, resources, and money.” And at the exact same time that freight volume increases and finds more efficient ways to meet rising consumer demands, so do the expectations from consumers. As economist Jason Schenker recently told FreightWaves, “The funny thing about technology, the first time a drone delivers our package to our doorstep, we’re going to be like mind blown. The second time we’re like where is that damn thing?” Both industrial and individual customers expect faster shipments with more flexibility, more transparency, and lower prices. Shippers will like the blockchain because they must handle all the complexities of booking, tracking, tracing, and regulatory compliance, unless they hire teams of full-time, experienced staff. This puts smaller shippers at a disadvantage, and makes larger shippers extremely inefficient. Carriers will enjoy the benefits of knowing when a vehicle is stopped, as well as how long drivers are held up at docks, among other things. Drivers should begin to see gains across a number of areas. Data generated by semis decked out with sensors connected to the internet is going to be huge. Everyone will be able to see exactly where, say, trucks are hitting the brakes. Information about traffic snarls, ice patches and highway closures can be shared with other truckers. It gets better. Consider a long-haul trucker on a long stretch of highway heading home with a half-empty trailer when he receives a message on his smartphone. There is cargo nearby that would easily fit into the underused trailer being pulled across the country. The software behind the message has already calculated his hours of operation, and knows he can pick up the load and deliver it without exceeding the hours-of-service limits. The message also tells the driver how much the job pays. After accepting the job, the driver isn’t worried about finding his way to this unexpected, but welcome cargo. The technology platforms that are emerging across the sector — due in large part to the technical development of ELD technology in the first place — guides him to the cargo’s exact location. “The funny thing about technology, the first time a drone delivers our package to our doorstep, we’re going to be like mind blown. The second time we’re like where is that damn thing?” Disruptive technologies are rolling toward us fast. Yes, the much-maligned ELD mandate is already having a possibly indirect effect on trucking. It’s paving the concrete sea, forcing late adopters to comply — and inspiring a generation of tech talent to develop apps to accommodate the complex needs of the industry. That should be something we can all get on board with because we want our packages, and we wanted them yesterday.

For more than three decades, TRAFFIX’s mission has been to put people first—their customers, their team, and their partners, and joining BiTA is just an extension of that mission. 2018 has already brought with it significant changes to the transportation industry and these impressive leaps forward in innovation and technology are only going to continue to affect trucking as we know it. By being at the forefront of the rise of blockchain technology in this sector, it is just one way that TRAFFIX will set the stage for success with their customers for years to come. TRAFFIX’s Director of Information Technology, Carlos Trivino shares that, “There is no question that we have invested heavily in technology. This has allowed us to grow over 120% last year and there is no sign of stopping. Our mission is to stay on top of the curve when it comes to technology in the transportation sector, which is why we have joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance to help form the standards and assist in developing blockchain technology in the supply chain world.” “TRAFFIX aims to be on the leading edge of technology, and being a part of this organization will allow us to comment on and be at the forefront of the implementation of Blockchain Transportation Standards” he adds. “Blockchain is having a positive impact in the supply chain world, specifically in RFP’s, EDI, POD’s, Invoicing, Driver HOS, etc., just to name a few. Its ability is virtually limitless, and we cannot wait to be part of this innovative and growing technology in the transportation sector.” In 1979, Chuck Snow established TRAFFIX after leaving his family’s flower import business, as he wanted to build a place for himself within the transportation industry and work to change a system of regulations and inefficiencies that offered very few benefits to customers and trucking companies. As one of Canada’s first load brokers, TRAFFIX reduced costs and worked to eradicate “empty” miles, while focusing on developing long-lasting relationships with their customers. Their commitment to customers and growth is seen today in their decision to invest in key transportation “hubs” across North America. Today, TRAFFIX boasts a fleet of state-of-the-art tractors and trailers, all of which feature their customized operating software. They have also expanded operations to include perishable, dry, project cargo, air, and intermodal freight services.

Tadmore is #980 on this year’s INC 5000. He is a member of BiTA, The Blockchain in Transport Alliance, and a Charter Member of TransRisk. Tadmore is in the TOP 5% of brokers rated by Credit Worthiness and the highest rated broker in at least 100 miles, per DAT Reviews. Emahiser is also a Moderator for the Rate Per Mile Masters Facebook Group, the largest Professional Trucking Group on Facebook. We live in a time in which things change at such a rapid pace, it’s probably better not to say something regarding technology “can’t happen,” says Polk. “It’s fairly mind-blowing what’s happening in the industry right now.” “Why do we need blockchain and what is it?” Polk asks. “We need blockchain, for one, to stop the misinformation,” Emahiser says, “which impacts the trucker as much as anyone else. It can be very costly. It’s managed through the Ethereum Network. The bottom line with the blockchain network is that it creates transparency. The ledger notations are made public to all sources on the network instantaneously, publicly, encrypted, and decentralized. The only way to hack it is to have control of more than 50% of the network at one time.” “It’s fairly mind-blowing what’s happening in the industry right now.” “The problem with the industry is the segmentation,” says Emahiser. “Sometimes for a single pallet you might have as many as ten businesses involved. Some of the routes were created in the 1930s. They were probably created by super smart and organized people, but the point is, the routes — and the industry in general — is outdated.” Emahiser can barely contain his enthusiasm about blockchain, calling it a “dream-state, where you can make some of this stuff reality.” “Say an owner-operator wakes up one morning and wants to type in all the things he wants and is willing to do, and what he’s good at. What if he wants to run a certain lanes and up to 300 or 400,” he says. While blockchain can’t currently do all that, it also seems to be leading to other disruptive innovations throughout the industry, which are making day-to-day options better for everyone. “Shared capacity, shared resources. It’s a cool place to be,” he adds. Also, repeated several times throughout the discussion, Emahiser noted that blockchain is improving the process so that drivers aren’t going to be squeezed as much. So much has been absorbed at the driver level. Drivers have been squeezed from every angle with the mounting inefficiencies, and the adoption of a new technology that helps is welcome news — unlike ELD mandates, which feel more like Big Brother. “So much has been absorbed at the driver level.” Can blockchain get rid of all paperwork? To some extent, yes, says Emahiser. Without a centralized authority, it’s in the chain. At the same time, certain bill of lading laws require some paperwork at least for now. It also depends on the parameters and need to be defined: how far and how frequently should updates be necessary and required? But the blockchain is instant settlement. A better process would be paperless, as long as regulations would allow it. BiTA is great because it helps bring together an alliance so that the industry doesn’t segment into so many players using blockchain. BiTA helps form standards to approach the technology in specific, understood ways. It creates what Emahiser calls the Network Effect, the way a product gains value by the more people who use it. Craig Fuller, BiTA co-founder, writes in to the live podcast, “Unlike Uberization in blockchain the industry is coming together rather than letting outsiders own the technology. With blockchain it will also level the playing field between the smallest and the biggest. Code don’t care.” “That’ll preach right there,” says Polk.

This time we met on a conference call to make a decision that would have a profound impact on the proliferation of blockchain technology in transportation and with it, potentially altering the transportation business forever. The whole call was dedicated to discussing intellectual property rights and how the group would see these rights working and what licensing arrangements would exist. The Board decided that open standards would truly be open and anyone that used the BiTA standard would not have to pay for the rights. This is profound, and not a typical approach that happens in technology standards organizations. By making the standards royalty free, it essentially means that anyone and everyone can have access to them, without having to pay a third party for using them. Consider it a victory for freedom and the transportation industry, because it means that BiTA’s standards intellectual property will be available for everyone to access and take advantage of, without having to license it from some group that collects payments. This was a real test for the young organization. Had it had gone differently and had the group chosen to restrict the use of standards or to charge for them, it would have likely meant a very different outcome. You could compare the work of BiTA to that of the Internet Society that in 1992 created the IP address standards and also pushed for it to be open. Had that group chosen differently, the outcome for the internet might have been quite different. The makeup of the board likely weighed heavily into the outcome. Fortunately, the board was not set up to be heavily weighted toward one industry vertical. In fact, it’s the only transportation organization where vendors, banks, insurance companies, accountants, lawyers, 3PLs, carriers, technology conglomerates, startups, and shippers all have an equal voice. The board also fits this definition. The BiTA board is comprised of FedEx, UPS, P\u0026S, Triumph, McLeod Software, Trimble, TransRisk, Salesforce, Echo Global Logistics, and Kleinschmidt. All of these companies have different business models, but the beauty is all are equally focused on solving major issues in the transportation space. Unlike other attempts at creating market standards in transportation, the fact that BiTA is driven by industry and built to work across platforms is important. The fallacy in many technology standards driven solely by technology companies is that the standards they create are driven by a single company’s commercial goals–the technology company ends up owning the intellectual property (and perhaps patenting it) and the same companies that participated in the discussions end up having to pay the same company to license it. That outcome hardly seems in the interest of participants in the organization. The membership of BiTA continues to swell. With over 1100 applications into the transportation standards group, representing nearly $1 trillion of global transportation revenues, the group has some significant weight in the industry and any standard that the group chooses to adopt is likely to become market standard.

BiTA is the first association to unite businesses from across the transportation industry around the promise of blockchain technology. On November 16, 2017, BiTA held its inaugural Executive Council Meeting, where Learning Machine presented about the potential of blockchain technology to streamline the verification of driver identity while respecting driver privacy and autonomy. The meeting laid the groundwork for cooperation between Learning Machine and carriers across the United States and beyond. The meeting also showcased a strong alignment between BiTA’s commitment to developing shared technology standards for using blockchain in transportation and Learning Machine’s work developing the Blockcerts open standard for issuing and verifying documents on the blockchain. Unlocking the maximum value of a new technology for any industry depends on taking a standards-based approach Craig Fuller, Managing Director of BiTA, said, “Learning Machine came across my radar in the fall as BiTA was first launching. I was intrigued by the ingenuity of the organization in using blockchain to certify university diplomas and records. I thought using the technology to certify driver, equipment, and transactional records would have a profound impact on the safety and security of the global transportation system and wanted to ensure that BiTA and Learning Machine had an active partnership. We are super excited about the work of the Learning Machine team and the applications they are developing around the transportation and freight ecosystem.” The application of blockchain technology to digital identity is an area where Learning Machine has been particularly active. Learning Machine’s VP of Business Development, Natalie Smolenski, explained how the transportation industry could benefit from a blockchain-based identity solution: “The transport industry sees annual driver turnover rates north of 100%. This means carriers are spending a lot of time verifying driver identity, background, and employment history. The blockchain makes verification of identity and claims instant and free while avoiding the privacy and security vulnerabilities of a centralized database.” Learning Machine will demonstrate its solution for blockchain-based driver identity at BiTA’s Transparency 18 conference, May 22-23, 2018, in Atlanta, Georgia. Learning Machine builds enterprise software for issuing and verifying records on the blockchain. In 2016, Learning Machine and the MIT Media Lab developed Blockcerts, the only open standard for anchoring records to the blockchain in a manner that is recipient-owned and vendor-independent. In 2017, Learning Machine released a suite of products and services that streamline the issuing and verification of Blockcerts at scale. Founded in August 2017, the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) is a forum for promotion, education, and encouragement to develop and adopt blockchain applications in the trucking, transportation, and logistics industry. BiTA’s goal is for members to participate, discuss, create, and adopt industry standard uses of blockchain applications and to provide clarity and direction for the development of blockchain technology in the trucking industry in a manner that will create efficiency, transparency, and foster trust. BiTA standards are intended to create a common framework to help organizations develop and adopt blockchain technology.

The New York-based company will be 51% owned by Maersk and 49% by IBM. The company will create products to help shippers, ports, custom offices, banks, and other participants in global supply chains track freight as well as replace cumbersome and inefficient documentation processes with an immutable distributed ledger. FreightWaves covered IBM-Maersk’s 2016 pilot that moved a blockchain-powered shipment of flowers from Mombasa, Kenya, to Rotterdam, Netherlands, in an article about Israeli container shipper ZIM’s trial of blockchain bills-of-lading. Now IBM and Maersk have taken a substantial step forward and have formed a collaborative business. “We see an opportunity to increase efficiency and timeliness for cargo movement,” said Michael J. White, the new company’s CEO. White previously served as the North American president for Maersk Line, Maersk’s shipping container division. White said that “today, a vast amount of resources is wasted due to inefficient and error-prone manual processes.” “Even small improvements can have a substantial impact on global trade,” added Marie Wieck, general manager of IBM’s blockchain team. A 2013 report by the World Economic Forum found that removing supply chain barriers to international trade would increase GDP growth faster than removing tariffs. The WEF identified major inefficiencies in customs administration, import-export procedures including the coordination between border agencies, the transparency of border administration, and problems with the availability and use of information and communications technology. Specifically, the WEF said that “Reducing supply chain barriers to trade could increase global GDP by 5% and trade by 15%.” The new company formed by IBM and Maersk seemingly intends to do just that. Globally, more than $4T in goods are shipped in all modes per year, and 80% of the goods consumers use daily are carried by the ocean shipping industry. Mikkel Elbek Linnet, Maersk’s senior press officer, wrote that “the maximum cost of the required trade documentation to process and administer many of these [container-shipped] goods is estimated to reach one-fifth of the actual physical transportation costs.” Inefficiencies in the current manual, paper-based documentation processes include inconsistencies in information across organizational boundaries and ‘blind spots’ throughout the supply chain; complex, cumbersome, and costly peer-to-peer messaging; and clearance processes subject to fraud. “The potential from offering a neutral, open digital platform for safe and easy ways of exchanging information is huge, and all players across the supply chain stand to benefit,” said Vincent Clerc, Maersk’s chief commercial officer who will serve as board chairman of the new joint venture, in a statement. IBM and Maersk’s technology will be built on the Hyperledger Fabric 1.0, a blockchain platform developed by IBM and released last July that is now maintained by the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger group. “We are super excited that two of the largest and most important players in the market have joined forces to commercialize this technology. We are bullish on the outcome and look forward to working closely with the organization and others that are implementing blockchain applications in the freight and supply-chain sectors,” said Craig Fuller, Managing Director of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA).

In essence, blockchain is a type of digital ledger technology (DLT) comprised of unalterable, digitally recorded data called ‘blocks’ that are shared between a privately or publicly distributed network. Once recorded via a cryptographic signature, the data in any given block cannot be changed without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires the consent from the other network participants. The results are a transparent yet incredibly secure method to record any number of processes from financial transactions like bitcoin to identity management and asset tracking, both a common occurrence in the facility management world. Founded in 1996, SCLogic is a leading provider of the innovative facilities workflow platform software that leverages the latest barcode scanning, printing, mobile computing and wireless technologies. The company has thousands of enterprise, government, and university users around the world. SCLogic, is headquartered in Annapolis, MD, with offices in New Jersey, Texas, Florida, and California.

International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) has rented out as many as 60 data centers worldwide for the Bitcoin-dependent enterprises using the blockchain. The open source code has become an opportunity for the tech giant to boost the potential of blockchain for everyone, even start-ups, to participate in transactions the platform. As industries such as freight and logistics have started dipping their big toes into the big new pond called blockchain, the market is predicted to grow to as much as $7.7 billion in 2022, according to the business think-tank firm Markets \u0026 Markets. The demise of databases that were once the claim to fame of tech behemoths like Oracle Corporation turned out to be a false prophecy. Thanks to blockchain, those databases are again in vogue. With companies like IBM and Microsoft shifting their sights to cloud-based solutions, old databases end up becoming useful in a different era. This is why IBM Blockchain’s Vice President for Technology, Jerry Cuomo, takes pride in cornering a major slice of the pie in this solution, which leads to additional sales. “Our sales team loves blockchain because a customer that is buying blockchain rarely walks out of the store with just blockchain. They walk out with multiple things in their cart.” As a network is used by more than one company, trust is established in trade. Transactions are recorded in a way that makes it difficult for one party to change or edit what was already written. Everyone in the blockchain is informed of the transactions.

BiTA initially formed in 2017 to build a forum of industry executives and companies dedicated to the development of blockchain standards and education in the freight industry. “As innovative companies continue to develop technologies to improve supply chain capabilities, it is imperative that the industry builds ways to streamline fragmented data,” says Dave Halsema, Executive Vice President of FreightRover. “We are extremely excited to be able to work with industry leaders to shape the future of transportation blockchain technology to serve our mutual customers and partners.” BiTA is the first of its kind, as blockchain is an emerging technology set to transform how the transportation industry utilizes and organizes data. Members of BiTA come from every facet of the industry: tech vendors, OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, consultants, banks, carriers, shippers, and brokers. Blockchain will organize and streamline data that is currently fragmented throughout the transportation industry. For example, ELDs can send a near endless stream of data to the blockchain in real-time. Pairing this information with traffic data, weather data, etc. allows for up-to-the-minute rerouting. Additionally, capacity availability can change throughout the day, but the blockchain is able to provide the necessary transparency to know when and where capacity opens up, allowing participants to take advantage of shifts in demand. FreightRover recognizes blockchain’s dynamic usability for transportation, and FreightRover’s real-time updates on load information and quick payment processing makes them a key partner within BiTA. FreightRover provides a much-needed connection point for all players in the transportation industry, as freight is moved around the world. From its automated freight board, to its robust marketplace of integrations, users can streamline their freight flow. And when the load is delivered, FreightRover’s Rover180 ensures carriers are paid for the load in as little as 24 hours, while shippers/3PLs are given 30-plus days to pay.

This is an odd concept, but it’s a process that we are already familiar with. Take online credit card purchases as an prime example. When we buy a product online on a site we have never interacted with, the e-commerce retailer knows very little about us, but they are willing (and perhaps eager) to do business with us, having absolute confidence in the outcome–their ability to get paid. They know nothing about our ability or willingness to actually pay our credit card bill, but that isn’t important to them. They know that as soon as this transaction clears, that their funds will be on the way. The settlement process that the banks and Visa/MasterCard have established give them confidence that they will be paid. For this, they have a responsibility to perform as well. For the same reasons that our e-commerce merchant has confidence in their ability to get paid, we consumers have the same degree of confidence in our ability to get the product that we paid for. The merchant must ship the goods that match the order they sent us, they must charge our card once for the agreed amount, and they must provide us some recourse if the goods are not up to snuff or we change our mind. It’s likely I know a bit more about the merchant than the merchant knows about me, but regardless, it’s amazing that trillions of dollars are transacted in this fashion every single year. When we interact using credit cards, both the merchant and the consumer have rights and responsibilities that are afforded to them. If either party fails to perform, then the card network (Visa/MC) has a set of rules established for recourse. Most of the transactional responsibility falls upon the merchant: in exchange for being provided quick access to cash, they are required to perform and provide a dispute resolution process. The consumer has little transactional responsibility. Their responsibility lies with their obligations to the issuer of the card, most often a bank. The bank has established a line of credit to the consumer and the consumer must meet their payment obligations on this line of credit. If they fail to perform, the bank is still on the hook and must collect against the consumer. For all of the work involved, there is a significant cost to providing these services. The card networks receive a significant portion of their income from interchange fees. Interchange fees are separate to the credit card interest fees that are paid to the banks for the line of credit. Interchange is basically the toll fee that a merchant pays every time they accept a credit card. Interchange varies based on card type, merchant time, value of merchandise, and all sorts of factors, but it can be as low as .70% (70 bps) to 5% or (500 bps). The reason only a fraction of b2b payments ever involve a credit card is primarily for this reason–the interchange is expensive. As the payment size gets larger, the more significant these fees become. Take a truckload that is $1,000. If the shipper used a credit card, this could cost the merchant as much as $35 just for honoring the card for payment. That might sound expensive, but when you consider this is a card-not-present transaction and a premium class card, it could run this expensive. If a broker hopes to make 12% on the load, $30 would knock out nearly 25% of the load profit. Enter smart contracts. With blockchain smart contracts, an agreement could be created between a shipper and broker. The shipper would outline their performance requirements: transit time, equipment type, regular shipment updates, etc. This would all be coded into the smart contract, along with the rate and some tie into cryptocurrency or smart payment settlement. Additionally, things like detention, TONU, and accessorials are all laid out in the design of the smart contract. The currency method is also mentioned so that both the buyer and seller know how they expect to get paid. Once the load is tendered, the smart contract goes into force. It has been activated. Now, both parties are expected to perform. If either party drops the ball, there will be penalties and those would have been coded into the agreement. Along the life of the load, the required messages are being ledgered into the contract. Perhaps these are circle of service messages or ELD codes, showing regular updates on the progress of the load. At the end of the load, the driver would submit the proof-of-delivery (POD) and this would trigger a settlement message to the smart contract, allowing the money to be transfered. The money could be an IOU (securitized debt obligation), an escrow release from one US bank account to another, or a transfer of cryptocurrency. Regardless of how the carrier receives payment or the shipper pays the carrier, the transaction in this example is far superior to a credit card e-commerce transaction. The smart contract did not require a card network to facilitate it. There was no MasterCard or Visa–all of this was done without an intermediary. Not only would this be far cheaper than going through the Visa or MasterCard payment rails, the transaction would be far superior in terms of the outcome. For all of its advantages over other methods, the card networks have a lot of limitations. Their networks can only handle a limited amount of data and they don’t know a lot about the transaction itself. It still requires a sophisticated processing infrastructure behind it and all money must be transferred through all of the parties in the transaction chain. This creates costs and limits how flexible these transaction sets can be. With smart contracts, two counter-parties can agree to practically anything they want. They don’t have to pay a third party and so long as the specifications of the contract are understood and properly coded, the outcome is exact to spec. Consider it a built-to-order payment network. The innovations of smart contracts, blockchain, and other technology standards requires industry players to collaborate. BiTA has been formed to provide this forum among market participants.

The deal is in response to concerns about security in the financial exchange platform offered by the former. LALA World is in the middle of an initial coin offering (ICO) with the goal of launching a solution to unbanked and underserved individuals. It estimates some 2 billion people worldwide do not use a bank. “Thanks to our partnership with VIBE, our current and prospective ICO investors can embrace our technology and its promise, armed with the knowledge that we are leading with security – not trying to apply it after the fact,” said LALA World founder and CEO Sankalp Shangari. The financial ecosystem that LALA World plans to create revolves around the distributed ledger blockchain technology. Integration of biometrics is already included the company’s platform and it has secured partnerships secured with governments, cause-oriented groups and the community at large. While VIBE is headquartered in Bermuda, it has its technical center of excellence in Singapore. VIBE is confident in its technology, which has eliminated the need for public key infrastructure (PKI). With the latter written off as a concern, the technology can accommodate blockchain on a “massive scale.” “The certificate-less nature of VIBE’s patented technology not only eliminates the threat of man-in-the-middle attacks – as there are no certificates to intercept – its elegant authentication and key management capabilities make it highly scalable, and very easy to manage,” said Shangari. VIBE is only too happy to help LALA World secure transactions under its blockchain as noted by its CEO, Bill Montgomery. “The entire VIBE team is delighted by the opportunity to render secure the LALA World digital platform and wallet which is so critical to this exciting company’s mission to provide financial services to the world’s unbanked. Given the nature of our business, we are acutely aware of the tens of millions of dollars that have been stolen from ICO-funded companies worldwide. I applaud LALA World for taking the steps necessary to eliminate any such possibility. It speaks to its leaders’ superior customer focus.” LALA World’s pretoken sale kicked off on Nov. 27, 2017, according to Tech Bullion.

Alabama Motor Express (AMX) has been in the trucking industry for over 30 years with supplemental logistics offices in Savannah, GA, and Dothan, AL. This alliance is just the beginning in the journey to standardize the tech for the supply chain. AMX recognizes the significance in joining the talk in its early stages and now is the time to get involved. Increasing efficiency in all aspects of the supply chain is one of the biggest concerns for trucking industry professionals. Blockchain technology has the power to do just that. Combined with the possibility of increased transparency, there aren’t many reasons to ignore this new change. On its homepage, BiTA says it “was formed by experienced tech and transportation executives to create a forum for the development of blockchain standards and education for the freight industry. [The] goal is to bring together leading companies in the freight technology industries that have a vested interest in the development of blockchain technology. “ AMX will work with BiTA to continue to educate members of the industry on any impact blockchain will have. “AMX is extremely proud to be a part of BiTA. We feel that blockchain technology will have a positive impact on the trucking industry and we look forward to helping promote its efficiencies. It is paramount that our industry gets involved in the early stages so best practices can be established with our customers’ and employees’ best interests in mind. After all, the benefits from the increases will benefit everyone involved,” said Scott White, President of AMX. Blockchain was created when the creator(s) of Bitcoin realized they needed a secure, decentralized way to transact with this new digital currency, hence the blockchain was born. It’s this seemingly boring technology created to keep up with these transactions that is set to disrupt the current models in several wide-reaching industries. It’s a way to keep track of transactions between companies or people that is supposedly incorruptible and unhackable. AMX is currently working on a blog post to breakdown how this new tech can affect the supply chain, featuring insight from Chris Burruss, President of BiTA.

Attendees at the Transparency18 show, though, will not leave with that feeling. FreightWaves, in partnership with the Georgia Tech Institute of Technology and the Blockchain in Transport Alliance, will be presenting the inaugural Transparency18 Future of Freight Conference, May 22-23, 2018, in Atlanta, GA, at the Georgia International Convention Center. The event promises to be unlike any previous trucking or logistics show. Transparency18 will include a live demo of products and a day of leading industry speakers, sponsors and exhibitors, and more. “Transparency18 is completely different than anything ever seen in FreightTech,” says Jeff Mason, Managing Director of FreightWaves. “We are borrowing formats seen in other industries such as financial services, that give the chance for early stage companies, investors, and established companies to actually experience the innovations first-hand rather than reading a Powerpoint. The format is much more immersive and will focus on the digitization of the industry. It’s an important opportunity for organizations and individuals to connect, learn, collaborate and ultimately impact the future of the industry.” “Powerpoint sucks for most technology presentations. People actually want to experience the application first-hand and a pitch deck doesn’t give that opportunity, so we have banned it from our Demo Day. No vaporware. The format is a lot of fun and engaging because you get just enough to see a taste of the app, without having to sit through a long-winded presentation that is there to just fill time,” notes Craig Fuller, Managing Director of BiTA. Mason points out that the demo presentations will go beyond blockchain and range from driver engagement apps, parking discovery apps, fuel price management, driver social media applicants, freight optimization, and price discovery and modeling applications. If you are an early stage company and want to get in front of 500 of the most powerful technology decision markers, investors, and influencers in this space, Transparency18 is the place to do just that. A few dozen investors and nearly 200 top technology and market thinkers have already signed up to attend. Demo Day itself will take place on Tuesday, May 22, 2018, and feature 7-minute live presentations for companies to showcase their new or emerging technologies or products. The use of slides or Powerpoint presentations will not be allowed. Instead, live, simulated or video-assisted demonstrations will be required. Companies interested in participating in Demo Day can submit an application through March 9, 2018. Once applications have been received, a selection committee will review the applications and choose the 40 who will be given the opportunity to present. Selection criteria will be based upon product relevance to the industry and timeliness (to market in less than 6 months) and whether it focuses on emerging, disruptive, and innovative technology solutions. Presenters will be provided a product demo/networking station to discuss their solutions with attendees when not on stage. There will also be a press hour for presenting companies to meet with media attending the event. All presentations will be professional recorded and posted to the event website for post-event viewing. A networking reception will be held following Demo Day for participants, sponsors and Transparency18 attendees. Day Two of Transparency18, on May 23, 2018, will feature industry-leading speakers and sessions featuring top Wall Street sell-side analysts from the trucking and logistics space; futurists covering subjects impacting the industry such as blockchain, autonomous vehicles, hyperloop, drones, and digitization; and market data and research on the impact of technology on the freight markets. The morning will feature keynote speakers followed by afternoon breakout sessions focused on financial, technology and commercial tracks. Keynote speakers include author and thought-leader Tony Seba, futurist Jason Schenker, blockchain researcher Bettina Warburg, and business executive Don Tapscott. Seba, a world-renowned author, thought leader, speaker, educator and entrepreneur, is the author of the Number-One Amazon best-selling book “Clean Disruption of Energy and Transportation – How Silicon Valley Will Make Oil, Nuclear, Natural Gas, Coal, Electric Utilities and Conventional Cars Obsolete by 2030.” He is a co-founder of RethinkX, a think tank that focuses on technology disruption and its implications for society and co-author of “Rethinking Transportation 2020-2030.” Schenker is the author of Jobs for Robots, a story about how robots and automation will be a part of our future. He is involved in the hyperloop and travels the world providing commentary and insights on the impact of technology on markets. He is an economist, author, speaker and the number-one ranked financial market futurist in the world. He is founder of Prestige Economics, a top-ranked financial market research firm and chairman of The Futurist Institute, which he founded in October 2016 to help analysts and economists become futurists. Warburg is a blockchain researcher, entrepreneur, and educator, and co-founder of Animal Ventures, “a venture studio and consultancy focused on building startups, educating executives, and designing comprehensive strategies to help large companies, governments, and SMEs take advantage of some of the most advanced technology companies coming to market.” Animal Ventures’ practice areas include blockchain, the Internet of Things, augmented and artificial intelligence, and digital platforms.

Then came the volatility. Then came the futures. Now, maybe the ETFs. But the real news is that it soon will take ALL the energy on the entire planet to mine the cryptocurrency. Please continue reading. A website called Digiconomist publishes the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index (BECI) which reports daily on how much energy Bitcoin miners use worldwide. As of yesterday, the BECI is at 39.44TWh (terawatt hour, used in industrial production and power generation). Yes, that is a lot of power. Below is a screenshot of the BECI on today’s date.  It is important to note that the graph is not accretive. Meaning the estimate on yesterday’s date (39.44) is what the BECI projects for the year, not the amount of power that is used on that day added to all the other points on the graph. But it is still a lot of power. In fact, if Bitcoin miners were a country they would use more power than a lot of third world countries. They would sit right between the Democratic Republic of the Congo (40.73) and El Salvador (36.92) at number 123 out of the 195 countries in the world, which makes a lot of sense given the volatility and potential for complete meltdown in all three of them. And take note that the graph is on a pretty steep incline. But it does not tell the whole story. In November, the website ZeroHedge wrote an article about this phenomenon that included the following graph and projections:  While it is highly doubtful that Bitcoin mining will consume all the world’s power two years from now, there is a computational arms race occurring with more machines and more powerful machines that can mine more Bitcoin. Furthermore, the Bitcoin mining algorithm continues to increase in difficulty to compensate for the increase in computational power. It is adjusted every two weeks and the difficulty keeps increasing. Therefore, the logic is as more people mine for Bitcoin and the blocks become more difficult to create, energy consumption will grow exponentially to keep up with the demand. At some point, high energy demand will create electricity price inflation as governments with artificially low energy prices will be forced to make adjustments. After all, places where electricity is nthe ot floated in the market and subsidized by the government will start to question why they are allowing this technology which adds zero value to their local economies drain all of their energy sources. This has certainly been the case for China. The country has built massive hydro dams to provide check and renewable energy for economic development as it tries to wean itself off of dirty coal. If the country realizes that the subsidized electricity is preventing them from doing so, they will be forced to either charge higher prices to miners, or in the case of a centralized command structure that you find in China ban, confiscate, and prosecute the miners. Transportation is currently the number one emitter of CO2, surpassing electricity production. But if crypto mining increases power consumption exponentially, it will become the biggest party responsible.. All of this brings up an interesting point that must be considered- if countries and society wants cleaner transportation choices, why would they subsequently subsidize non-transportation sources to suck all the juice?

President Donald Trump made it a priority upon taking office to renegotiate the trade pact, claiming it hurts U.S. businesses. U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer has previously said Mexico and Canada were not negotiating seriously. “I remain concerned about the lack of headway. Thus far, we have seen no evidence that Canada or Mexico are willing to seriously engage on provisions that will lead to a rebalanced agreement. Absent rebalancing, we will not reach a satisfactory result,” he said in November. Following the fifth round of negotiations, Gutierrez said some progress is being made. The next round of talks begins Jan. 23 in Montreal. He also said that while Mexico would not pay for a border wall, as Trump has called for, there have been discussions of a “user fee” to fund a border entry between Tijuana and San Diego, which is among the busiest commercial routes along the border. “There have been preliminary discussions on that matter, and I think both sides are open,” Gutiérrez said. American Trucking Associations Chief Economist Bob Costello, in October, said that group is in favor of updating NAFTA, but not eliminating it. Seventy-one percent of all surface trade value with Canada and 82% of surface trade value with Mexico is hauled by trucks, he said. There are 12 million truck border crossings per year in the U.S. with Laredo, Texas, seeing close to 6,000 per day. Half of all manufacturing jobs in the U.S. today are supported by NAFTA trade, he said, with trade contributing to 14 million U.S. jobs overall. “Cross-border trade supports over 46,000 U.S. trucking jobs, including 31,000 U.S. truck drivers, and generates $6.5 billion in revenue for our industry annually,” said Costello in a statement released Monday. “As the U.S. renegotiates this agreement with Canada and Mexico, we urge them to keep the tremendous benefits to our economy and our industry in mind.” According to a DriverIQ survey of 23 of the top 25 carriers, 40% expect driver turnover to remain at current levels in the first quarter of 2018 while 25% believe it will get worse. “In spite of important differences, we’re communicating fluently, we’re engaging, and that’s important. I’m moderately optimistic we can in fact reach an agreement in the next few months.” – Gerónimo Gutiérrez, Mexico ambassador to U.S., on NAFTA negotiations Twenty-five percent of carriers in a DriverIQ survey believe driver turnover will get worse in the first quarter of this year, while 40% expect it to remain the same.

Since we have already established relationships with a large number of those who will participate, we feel there is enormous opportunity for us to increase the long-term value to our clients in the education, innovation, and execution of blockchain technologies.” At a high level, blockchain is a digital ledger technology capable of recording transactions and storing their data in immutable blocks across a distributed network. Blockchain enables a digital supply chain and creates a peer-to-peer system of commerce. Participants in logistics and supply chain are considered ideal candidates for the introduction of blockchain. While more than a few years away from becoming a mainstream technology, Gartner quantifies the business value-add of blockchain at $176 billion by 2025, and then exceeding $3.1 trillion by 2030. Visibility, traceability, transparency, and security are the hallmarks of a successful supply chain strategy. In joining BITA, FLS will be collaborating with a number of North America’s leading logistics service and technology providers who are committed to real world execution of blockchain solutions in logistics and supply chain. FLS has been providing leading edge logistics solutions across North America for more than 30 years. BiTA was formed by experienced tech and transportation executives to create a forum for the development of blockchain standards and education for the freight industry with the goal of bringing together leading companies in the freight technology industries that have a vested interest in the development of blockchain technology.

It’s all a matter of how the technology is adapted and brought into the current marketplace’s way of doing business. The pull of trade generates a push in both markets to invest in the newest transportation developments. This results in what transportation economists call the “double-stimulus” of trade. The growth of the freight industry in the 19th century is such an example. As railway lines extended into undeveloped locations, farming opportunities emerged that were previously uneconomic. This encouraged trade and settlement that made demand for the railways self-perpetuating. What’s fascinating about product life-cycles is that innovations first must go through an introductory stage before reaching a tipping point. The tipping point perpetuates the newly established technology (whether it’s a product or a system or both), and then emerges a growth period before maturity establishes, and then, inevitably a decline. Over the past two centuries, these cycles tend to run in about 35 year lifetimes. Interestingly, in the United States, the total railway network reached its maximum in 1916, at 266,381 miles of track. As of 2012, the network had declined to 136,623 miles of track. Trucking is in the midst of a digital transformation, with revolutionary changes from all ends of the logistical supply chain. And with such a transformation comes the need for data – real-time data – so freight efficiency across a range of metrics can be maximized. Of course, it then becomes how companies are able to synthesize and aggregate that data swiftly enough that it makes a “real time” difference. Blockchain technology could disrupt any given industry, but transportation and logistics are especially ripe. In the coming years, logistics services will make or break the business models of shippers. More than ever before, they’ll require more accurate freight pricing and real-time shipment information. “We need to embrace and lead with technology,” Justin Hall, chief customer officer for LTL conglomerate YRC Worldwide, explained during a presentation at the ALK Technology Summit. “Data is the new oil for our business,” he stressed. “Predictive analysis is a big deal for us; it will help us develop more dynamic pricing and better division of labor.” While the industry clamors for one-stop shops, logistical data warehousing that handles everything from final mile, to reverse logistics, to contract logistics, all with real-time data, it’s easier said than done industry wide. For smaller businesses, “making high velocity data-based decisions are easy; they can react quickly,” said Hall. “However, larger ones such as YRC: a company with 384 terminals that operates 60,000 pieces of equipment and employs 32,000, it’s just not as feasible.” In order to make themselves more nimble, YRC is developing “pods,” small, cross-functional teams that can make faster, real-time decisions for customers, especially in terms of pricing. The use of distributed ledger technology can put an end to fraud concerns, which was one of the hold-ups for comprehensive industry adoption. However, now that the cryptocurrency market has demonstrated that fraud is no longer the real issue, it’s now about creating blockchain technology that can scale. It’s still in its nascent stage, according to LTP. Distributed ledgers are version 2.0 of the current systems, and can work around concepts such as identity verification, public/private transaction distinction, and automated execution of contracts which are more akin to what regulated financial institutions require to implement these systems at scale. While requiring all nodes (servers) to process each transaction makes blockchain natively resilient to cyberattacks – as hundreds or thousands of nodes would have to be hacked to gain control of the network – it also slows transaction processing and, ultimately, its scalability. Computerworld details the efforts of a company like The Ethereum Foundation that are trying to solve just such performance issues. Once the contracting parties agree to the terms of the transaction, identity verification takes place and the transaction is included in the interested parties’ digital ledger. This includes independent nodes that oversee the transaction, the seller, buyer, financier, and even insurance companies. All parties can participate and see what is relevant to each of them. There, the agreement remains securely stored and hard to repudiate subsequently. This speeds up the debtor confirmation process as well. Also, distributed ledger technology has the potential to bring smart contracts into vogue. Smart contracts are programmable contracts that function on distributed ledgers. When the parties in the contract meet certain conditions, the contract executes specific actions written in the distributed ledger. This eliminates the hassles of notifying the contracting parties of any changes in bank details, etc. As a case in point, consider the example we laid out between a broker and carrier. Blockchain could well usher in the next technological revolution in invoice financing. According to LTP, estimates suggest that the global factoring industry has a value of about $3 trillion annually. Significantly, the factoring industry will continue to grow by approximately 10% each year. The businesses that succeed in realizing the complete potential of this technology will acquire a hard-to-beat competitive edge. Concerning blockchain technology we are still in the introductory phase. Organizations like Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA), and the over 890 companies applying for membership in the industry, are maximizing the pressure to hit a tipping point sooner rather than later. It’s not about evolution right now, it’s about revolution. Those unwilling to adapt and pioneer, or at least jump on the bandwagon, will fail sooner than later.

They have been a significant number of investments in the space, most of which have or will fail. We have described these companies as “Groupons” in past articles, a phenomenon to describe a number of the digital brokerage startups that were pursuing revenue for the sake of revenue and not building traction in a sustainable business model. Companies like Cargomatic and Cargo Chief are among the biggest venture digital brokerage blowouts. There will be many more that meet the same fate. Both companies are still around, albeit under completely different go-to market plans. The big digital brokers that raised gobbles of cash, Convoy, Transfix, and Uber Freight appear to be investing in the platform and gaining traction along the way. They have the success of major Silicon Valley investors behind them that can tolerate substantial losses- so long as they show organic traction in their digital environments. A lot of negative press has been pointed at Uber, but the ethics and aggressive business practices which has plagued the corporate brand have not have entered the freight side of things. In fact, Uber Freight’s positioning of making the independent driver more successful seems promising and we applaud it. It helps to hire smart. Bill Driegert is the real deal. A product of MIT and Coyote, he knows the business and understands the cycles. Convoy is not the same type of company, with non logistics and freight people running it. But they are bring fresh thinking to how freight works, or should work. Think Silicon Valley CEO and Dan Lewis would easily fit the bill. No he isn’t a trucker by trade, but the guy is super smart and has a vision on how to change the industry for the better. Unlike some of the digital brokers, Convoy does not pretend to be experienced in the world of freight movement. They actually embrace their outsider status. To get large venture investors to get comfortable with trucking- they must first become comfortable with a CEO that is driving the company. But a logistics company that is funded by Jeff Bezos should not be ignored. After all, Bezos’ has been called the greatest logistician of all time. And there is Transfix. Reports suggest they are gaining great market traction, but their innovations appear to be in the long tail – i.e. finding efficient ways to bring on small and medium sized shippers in a cost effective manner. They also appear to be finding ways to create more stickiness with the driver- knowing that retaining capacity is imperative in this environment. All three show promising starts and have positioning their businesses differently. We applaud the differentiation. These three do not deserve the Groupon mark, but most others in the digital brokerage space do. The downside of being a digital broker, is that you are still a broker at the end of the day. And your business model is more evolutionary than revolutionary. Certainly, you are doing amazing things with the business, but you are not overhauling the operating model of our industry. It is time our industry stopped chasing Uberization and created an Airbnb model. In trucking, Uberization is still transactional brokerage. There are key differences in the personal transport versus the freight market. The first being that the industry already has 16,000+ intermediaries that provide the role that Uber plays in the personal transport business (i.e. ease of dispatch, collections, payment, sourcing of opportunities, etc). We know them as freight brokers or 3PLs. The majority of freight brokers still are “voice-based”, meaning the success of the broker is almost entirely based on their ability to negotiate over a phone. Soon enough, the vast majority of the voice brokers will collapse and with it a new world order of made up of digital brokers and project-based voice brokers will emerge. But none of this solves the capacity problem that plagues our industry, nor does it fundamentally change how our industry deals with its most important asset- the driver. Changing how drivers are paid is the first step, but the view that blockchain based percentage pay will solve all aspects of the pay problem like this article suggests is short-sighted. Blockchain is the perfect solution for company drivers of commercial fleets, but it still doesn’t solve the issue for owner operators or fleet owners. What we need is a pay-per-day model that allows for short-term dedicated capacity, rather than long term dedicated contracts. The dedicated fleet business is a large part of the mega fleet operators. They trade dedicated capacity at fixed prices for contracts with consistent payment relationships. Fleets love them because they provide a consistent cash-flow stream and shippers adore these relationships because they can have the advantages of a private fleet, without the issues that are caused by running one. Fleets that do it for a living tend to be far better than most, but not all, private fleets. Currently, in the freight market we have a few sub markets. Dedicated, contract, and spot. Contract is usually a soft commitment by a shipper to provide consistent loads to a fleet, in return for fixed prices and fixed capacity. Anyone that has been around the industry long-enough knows that most of those commitments are non-binding and almost meaningless. How the term “contract” became the description for that type of business is beyond the scope of this article, but the term should be abandoned altogether because beyond a fixed rate and shipper/carrier agreement that deals with indemnity and liability, there is nothing contractual about it. Either party can get out of the deal at any moment in time. Last, there is spot. Spot is a term that gets thrown around a lot as well and it means different things to different people. The safest definition is a load that is quoted and then subsequently tendered with a seven day time frame. Getting our industry to use consistent terms would go along way in helping solve some of the issues- as it be easy to differentiate between one shipper’s tender pattern over another. So what is left? A pop-up fleet that is offered by a carrier to provide a short-term committed capacity, that pays all miles and dispatch decisions are at the discretion of the shipper. Pop up fleets are usually priced on a floating rate, up to the discretion of the fleet. They will agree to a fixed daily rate, in return for a short-term commitment. Large fleets have been offering this type of capacity for some time, usually to help during surge or project markets. Postal runs, holiday peak capacity, and expedited capacity are all the types of situations that you see these types of environment. There are two major fundamental problems with these arrangements in that there is no market index to help carriers price the capacity to maximize their opportunity. They typically look at their current daily yield on a truck, add some margin, and quote a price. The second and more troublesome part of it, is that there is nothing binding to hold the shipper accountable for actually delivering the loads. Yes, carriers (and major ones at that) have paid a dear price for expecting pop-up opportunities, only to have a shipper reneg at the last moment. Beyond a couple of angry emails and talk amongst industry players, there is little recourse. Potentially, they could sue them for having something in writing that failed to come through, but most fleet executives get physically ill at the thought of going to court against the largest companies in the business. And frankly, most of these agreements are done within the normal course of business anyways, so there are tons of outs. But imagine a better structure. A place where fleets could put their daily capacity on a blockchain based token, use a central order book for trading tokens between counter parties, and then sell their capacity off on an auction basis to the highest bidder. Blockchain based tokens would enable a shipper to pluck a truck from the forward market and the because the capacity was sold on an exchange basis, the pricing would be transparent to all parties and set against the broader market. Fleets become enormous victors in the process, because they get binding rates set from the market, loads from shippers that are guaranteed to payout and shippers gain in having consistent capacity that is available to them. Yes, trucking is due its AirBnb moment. BiTA members are discussing it and I am sure that other entities are pursuing similar strategies in a go it alone way. Hopefully, they will raise enough capital to be successful or partner with distribution partners that can help them along the way. Have an idea on improving the freight market and want to share it?

Most over-the-road trucking fleets pay their drivers on a per mile basis, with additional incentives for longevity, sign on, and safety. Respectful fleets have a fair detention program, local duty pay, and driver assist package. How drivers are paid has not changed much since deregulation, albeit with occasional innovations and tweaks by some fleets getting creative. One such scheme is the one that Covenant announced this past week to get drivers to team up. But there are still major fundamental problems with how drivers are paid. Before deregulation, truck drivers were in the top 10% of all blue collar careers. Today drivers are in the bottom 10%. One would assume this explains a lot about driver turnover and they would be correct. But raising pay rates is not enough. What our industry needs is a complete overhaul of driver pay that pays drivers for time spent on a load and not just the miles driven. The reason this has never been possible is because fleets have never charged customers for actual transit and dwell times on a load. Typically, line haul rates are negotiated well in advance of a tender; fuel surcharges are based on an index; and detention/accessorials are buried somewhere in a contract or confirmation sheet. The last item, detention, is not only the least likely to get honored, it is also the hardest to track and collect. Disagreements about whether a driver had truly arrived on time, was held up, and kept on site at a shipper are all subject to dispute. Combine this with the hoops required for a driver to communicate and document these issues, it’s no wonder that it is the most painful collection exercise in trucking. Other issues in driver pay are problematic. Deadhead, re-positioning, rerouting, out of route, weather delays, traffic, etc all cause significant changes to the economics of a load. What if the industry paid drivers on a time model vs. mileage model? The amount of hours it took to execute a load would be tracked and then compared against a percentage of total allocated. A load that took seven hours on-duty would be 50% of the daily rate. Here is how that will work: Daily rate x % of available hours used up \u003d driver pay for the load The reason this is difficult today is that it has been nearly impossible to track execution hours in a way that is fair to the fleet, shipper, and driver in a way that no one believes that they are getting screwed. But new technology will change this. Soon telematics devices will be written into blockchain, meaning that all trackable elements of the load’s circle of service can be recreated without manipulation. This means that both the driver and fleet might have a trustless relationship, but still have mutual trust in payout settlement. And best of all, the same records can be used to recreate the environment that caused the driver to burn his available hours. Was it weather, traffic, shipper delays, or did the driver ditch the best route and hit up the casino? And with this same ledger, carriers can bill and collect for issues that were caused by the shippers themselves. Changing to a per day rate (or hourly) could be the magic bullet to curve the unseated truck problem. Drivers want to make a great, but predictable living; carriers want to maximize the utilization of their trucks; and carriers want to have the right to hold shippers accountable for their inefficiencies. The best news is that over 850 companies in the transportation space are thinking about this and other issues which our industry struggles with and advocating to use technology and common standards to solve for them. The organization is called BiTA and we are meeting in May in Atlanta. The second BiTA meeting is taking place on the front end of Transparency18, freight’s version of the Consumer Electronic Show. Helping solve driver turnover and lifestyle challenges will be a huge topic of conversation, along with many others.

Block Array is a blockchain-based startup focused on developing protocols, infrastructure and smart contracts required for supply chain and logistics companies to adopt blockchain \u0026 distributed ledger technologies for their businesses. Its software is designed for both the Ethereum blockchain (both public and private), and Hyperledger Fabric. The Block Array data anchoring network enables events and actions, such as ELD records or geofence-based event triggers, to be recorded on either the Ethereum or Bitcoin blockchain, with the ability of storing at least 200 records a second in production. Block Array is requesting 3rd-party logistics companies interested in conducting a pilot study of its mobile application to anchor certified Electronic Logging Device records to the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. The cost of the pilot is free, and when the mobile application goes into production it will be free as well. By empowering trading partners and business to business relationships with full control over their logistics Block Array can provide privacy and security in both data and business transactions using a provably secure protocol that can scale on any network with Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum Enterprise. Blockchain offers a shared ledger that is updated and validated in real time with each network participant. It enables equal visibility of activities and reveals where an asset is at any point in time, who owns it and what condition it’s in. By using a Fabric deployment, supply chain management personal can get to the root issue of not only traceability, but demand forecasting. Sharing information through a typical GS1 Data-Pool would no longer be required: instead a peer-to-peer network that is both private and not seen by other network participants enables companies to share information about retail sales with a high degree of accuracy, offering a more reliable demand forecast projection.

The sector’s failure to catch up to the innovations happening at break-neck speed might speed up its imminent demise with the involvement of blockchain-based start-up companies, the release said. Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) are predicted to reach a collective cap of $1 trillion in 2018. This was a bold prediction mentioned by Blockchain Capital’s co-founder Brock Pierce, who is also the chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation. He made the following comments at a panel discussion at the CryptoFriends Hype Up in Singapore conference: “What venture capital has become today is a far cry from what it used to be, and it’s bad. The old-school venture capitalists were legit, unlike the fakers today. They showed up and helped entrepreneurs, rolled up their sleeves and provided advice and real work to help them. What’s happened recently is it was co-opted by financial engineers, who don’t actually do anything other than take advantage of entrepreneurs.” Pierce was joined on the panel discussion by Anatolii Radchenko, Mike Costache, Sefi Golan, Daniel Shashoua and Eric Benz. Benz was the panel’s moderator. In the presence of fellow stakeholders in the cryptocurrency platform, Pierce continued. “They are supposed to fund innovation but haven’t innovated themselves. There are some legit venture capitalists out there, wonderful guys in our space like Tim Draper. Those are the guys that are still going to have a job, who evolve into the things that those of us up here are doing.” While occasionally referred to as the cryptocurrency version of initial public offerings (IPO) in the stock market, The Economist summed up ICOs best in describing them as “token sales.” Funds are raised to make these tokens valuable and, in the process, produces digital coupons in the form of “ICO coins.” Several cryptocurrency companies from different industries have successfully raised funds with the sale of these tokens, according to Smith + Crown, the research firm from which The Economist gathered some numbers to use as basis in analyzing how successful ICOs have become. Gnosis raised $12 million in less than 15 minutes for its platform that bet on electoral results. This escalated the perceived market value in Gnosis’ tokens by as much as $300 million. “I was an entrepreneur and, believe me, this revolution is first and foremost for entrepreneurs. They now have another way to finance their ambitions. We must be vigilant with every project, but this is a great opportunity for exponential growth,” Pierce said. Despite Pierce’s forecast as how “90% of startups will fail after 3 years,” ICO still ended up taking centerstage as the CryptoFriends event. A handful of blockchain start-ups were chosen to present their ideas in hopes of generating token sales. Most of the ideas for the event attendees may have been influenced by the insights shared in the panel discussion. The 7 chosen start-ups were: The various platforms pitched at the event provided an optimistic outlook for CryptoFriends’ founder and CEO, Daria Arefeva. “The high level of the projects presented at the Singapore Hype Up event showed that ICOs are still a hot topic for investors,” she said. “CryptoFriends is all about mixing cutting edge thinking with eating and drinking, and we will continue to organize more high-end events that put both business and having fun on an equal footing.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain, cryptocurrency, ICO, venture capital, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Economics, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-12-26T12:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/12/22/blockchain-enabled-routers-speed-transactions","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Blockchaincityshutterstock-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain-enabled routers speed transactions","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Decentralizing transactions have opened up opportunities for gadget manufacturers to capitalize on the hot trend called blockchain. Hong Kong-based blockchain start up Moeco is no exception. As one of the companies hand-picked to pitch its blockchain ICO at the recently concluded Singapore Hype Up event, organized by CryptoFriends, it was an opportunity to showcase its “blockchain meets IoT” platform for the real world. As Dubai has started positioning itself in the global marketplace as “the metropolis of the long term,” Moeco has secured a tech partnership with UAE-based Yzerchat. Yzerchat then launched a recent version of its app that contains the Moeco library and other Bluetooth LE-enabled units, TechCrunch reports. TechCrunch described it as similar to an “IoT records superhighway with phones, strung alongside with a Bluetooth mesh community.” Moeco’s video presentation has a more congruent way of explaining its services, complete with a reminder of how Bluetooth and WiFi work, as well as the limitations that come once you start wandering a little farther from the WiFi router or Bluetooth device. This is a problem that Moeco addresses through its product, the LPWAN gateway. This is the open source solution for individuals who needed a better solution to signal disruption and interrupted services due to choppy internet. Moeca noted how even delivery services benefit from its devices. This is due to the IoT network infrastructure formed. When you have a smartphone connected with the Moeco network, it alerts you of the last-mile or other delivery that occurred in the area where Moeco’s network infrastructure is built. Moeco clarified that apart from the LPWANG, users don’t have anything else to install to make this technology work for them. The limitations that come with IoT are then addressed by Moeco through the “blockchain-powered IoT platform which unites existing IoT networks and motivates individuals to participate in worldwide deployment.” Normally, a person that owns a router can only use the device for profit in an internet cafe where PC renters pay at the cashier for accessing the internet. Using Moeco’s LPWANG is similar wherein, according to the video presentation, “Users benefit from seamless global roaming, affordable plans and a huge selection of compatible devices. Anyone can become a Moeco gateway and IoT provider by installing a gateway to serve all IoT devices in your area.” The benefit is in the form of tokens used as currency in Moeco where the LPWANG router owner provides the IoT service and everyone that gets to use it is billed. And the LPWANG router owners are paid in tokens stored in the Moeco bounty pool. With constant use of the currency in the Moeco blockchain-powered transactions, tokens exchanged in this platform increase their exchange value. Smartphone owners with the Moeco app also end up providing “service to the surrounding Bluetooth sensors and devices with Moeco software.” In other words, any transaction in need of the blockchain conducted on your mobile device earns you tokens. You become the shipper’s most reliable go-to-guy to send, receive and confirm exchange of goods and money in the blockchain. The decentralized aspect of blockchain kicks in knowing that no agreements are needed to be signed with operators or ISP. As Moeco’s LPWANG is based on open source technology, it becomes easier for gateway owners and blockchain users alike to capitalize on this IoT trend and help them earn in the cryptocurrency space as well. It could be the quickest way to developing even more smart cities enveloped in blockchain-based IoT technology for everyone to cash in.

Elf Snowflake, Chief Household Intelligence Elf for Logistics and Data (CHILD), told Freightwaves that “On a sleepless run, Santa must hit 1.34 million addresses per minute.” Approximately 2.5 billion kids worldwide were at risk of untimely delivery due to the ELD mandate. Sources close to the situation are reporting that Santa does not have the necessary amount of hours to deliver toys to kids everywhere. To make it across the globe, Santa must deliver the toys over a 31-hour period. This assumes that the window for delivery is 11PM to 7AM local. With tougher enforcement, that rises from 2.4 million houses to 5 million every minute. Understand that’s going from 0.001 seconds to 0.0005 seconds to park, descend a chimney, deliver presents, devour cookies \u0026 milk, and depart for the next house. Urbanization has helped, but with strictly enforced ELDs, Santa needs to improve his speed from about 635 miles per second to over 1,100 mps. The reindeer can do that on a steep descent, but it’s dangerous to consider going to 1,100 as an average mps. Under the HOS rules, Santa would only be able to drive for a total of 17 hours over the 31 delivery window. In years past, Santa was not concerned about HOS rules, but the FMCSA (working in conjunction with the Grinch) made it clear that breaking the rules would not be tolerated. According to an agency source, the FMCSA, working with local and state authorities, has implemented a zero-tolerance policy to rules violators, and violations would potentially mean the loss of his operating authority. Our source suggested that auditors from the agency were already in route to verify compliance. Early reports indicated a very real possibility of victory for the Grinch in notifying the FMCSA about Santa’s lack of compliance with Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs), but Santa has outmaneuvered him again and converted to a 4PL, becoming the largest purchaser of on-demand capacity in the world. While many credit Santa with being a manufacturer of toys, this is no longer the case. The North Pole has converted to a carrier over the years, pivoting away from insourced goods. In an exclusive to Freightwaves, Elf Sammy, Chief Elf Officer (CEO), of North Pole operations stated, “Kids want goods that are marketed by global brands. Our homemade goods are not popular anymore, so we have reverted to partnering with toy, electronic, and clothing suppliers throughout the world. Kids are much happier, and parents prefer it because they are able to get support if something breaks. We spend weeks mining data from kids all over the world, based on lists they send us. We have a clear plan in terms of what goods are in demand and start stockpiling in early November.” Sammy stated that no one runs as sophisticated of a supply-chain as the North Pole and even hinted that Jeff Bezos has elf lineage in his ancestry. “Rest assured,” says Hal Holloway, Chief Logistics Officer of North Pole Xpress, “Christmas is not in danger for children around the world. Santa’s logistics team has been coordinating with our team members for the past few weeks, and has purchased supplemental capacity. It’s a huge undertaking for sure, with the billions of packages expected to ship this holiday season, but our carriers have plenty of lift and are used to dealing with global demand surges. Santa has implemented blockchain in all his logistics activities, so you can track Santa on the NORAD tracking system, with seamless tracking and instant alerts upon delivery.” Regardless of the obstacle, logistics finds a way. Have a great holiday season and be safe. -Your friends at FreightWaves!

The company has approved changing its name from Long Island Iced Tea to Long Blockchain and has reserved the web domain www.longblockchain.com. They aren’t the only ones in the satiric-sounding sweepstakes for zaniest pivot. But here’s the real kicker: Shares more than tripled to $8.42 from $2.44 during early trading. Some are likening the new blockchain craze to the dot com boom of the ‘90s. It’s becoming a real enough thing—the likes of a bubble—there’s already a name for it: crypto companies. Long Blockchain is now dedicated to becoming a significant participant in the evolution of blockchain technology that creates long-term value for its shareholders and the global community by investing in and developing businesses that are “on chain.” At the same time, they will continue to operate Long Island Brand Beverages, LLC as a wholly-owned subsidiary, and maintain the focus of the business on the ready-to-drink segment of the beverage industry, specifically, premium, affordable, ‘better-for-you’ brands. Long Blockchain believes that emerging blockchain technologies are creating a fundamental paradigm shift across the global marketplace, with far reaching applications across all industries from financial services (smart settlements) to consumer packaged goods (supply chain verification) to healthcare (electronic medical records). While the company is in the preliminary stages of “evaluating specific opportunities involving blockchain technology,” no partnerships have happened. Philip Thomas, CEO, commented, “We view advances in blockchain technology as a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and have made the decision to pivot our business strategy in order to pursue opportunities in this evolving industry. We are committed to enhancing shareholder value and believe that our new focus is the best path towards this goal. We will be taking a series of steps related to our efforts to assemble a world-class team of industry professionals to help us realize this vision.” Long Blockchain will continue to leverage its ownership of the iconic Long Island Iced Tea® brand name and its existing beverage portfolio, and remains committed to improving the cash flow profile and efficiency of the beverage business through recently adopted operating initiatives. “I am incredibly proud of what we have accomplished in the beverage industry and we are committed to growing our business both on a national and international scale,” Thomas continued. “I want to assure our beverage industry customers, suppliers, and partners of our continuing support of the Long Island Iced Tea portfolio of beverages.” While such reports might on the outside be considered something reported from The Onion, blockchain technology is taking hold in numerous industries. Blockchain technology itself could have an impact of serious magnitude in the supply chain for any given company, especially a company which sources its raw materials abroad. Traceability and transparency are some of the most important foundations of logistics. Blockchain enables equal visibility of activities and reveals where an asset is at any point in time, who owns it and what condition it’s in. It can reduce or eliminate fraud or errors, improve inventory management, minimize courier costs, reduce delays of paperwork, identify issues in the supply chain faster, and increase consumer and producer trust.

(AMTR) is proud to announce that it has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). “As a company that provides a service that sits at the intersection of both shipper and carrier data, we are excited to get in on the ground floor of the blockchain standards setting and adoption discussion. We can’t audit for our clients without integrating shipping, financial, and product data. Any changes to how that data looks, flows, or is exchanged is of critical importance to us. We understand that blockchain technology is transformative and, as such, is an important strategic consideration for us. We want to be involved as the technology develops, and feel we have some unique expertise to offer to the standards development effort as well,” says AMTR CTO Jim Sacrey. A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, comprised of unchangeable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks. Each block is then “chained” to the next block using a cryptographic signature. This allows blockchains to be used like a ledger, which can be shared and accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions. The built-in security mechanisms of blockchain make it extremely difficult for hackers to compromise servers participating in the network where the distributed ledgers are stored. BiTA will build the first set of transportation industry-specific blockchain standards by engaging with the brightest minds and the most influential leaders in transportation. BiTA standards are intended to create a common framework to help organizations develop and implement blockchain technology. For AMTR, partnering with BiTA is an exciting opportunity to be closely involved in an industry-changing effort, to stay better informed for our clients, and to gain more insight about how technologies and standards will evolve to incorporate blockchain technology. Founded in 1979, AMTR is a leading provider of expert-based, after-payment freight audit services. As the “Home of Smart Auditing®,” our difference in the industry is that human, transportation experts (vs. computer-based systems) lead every audit. Although enabled by leading-edge, data mining and analysis technologies, our experts can “find” and “know” what computer algorithms cannot alone, recovering millions in freight cost dollars for clients working behind some of the most technologically advanced systems in the business.

Navistar reported net income of $30 million, or $0.32 per diluted share for fiscal year 2017, versus a net loss of $97 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, for fiscal year 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA was $268 million, which included $11 million of adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 10.3 percent. Fiscal year 2017 adjusted EBITDA was $582 million, versus $508 million adjusted EBITDA for 2016. Full-year adjusted EBITDA margins increased to 6.8 percent. Revenues in the quarter increased 26 percent, to $2.6 billion, compared to fourth quarter 2016. The revenue increase was largely driven by a 31-percent increase in the company’s Core (Class 6-8 trucks and buses in the United States and Canada) volumes. Revenue for fiscal year 2017 was up six percent to $8.6 billion, compared to $8.1 billion in fiscal year 2016. Navistar finished the fourth quarter 2017 with $1.1 billion in consolidated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities including $1.0 billion in manufacturing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. “Our 2017 was a breakthrough year, as we returned to profitability and grew our market share 1.5 points,” said Troy A. Clarke, chairman, president and CEO. “These results were driven by stronger sales, our steady investment in the industry’s newest product lineup, early results from our strategic alliance with Volkswagen Truck \u0026 Bus and our ongoing focus on cost.” The company finished 2017 with strong momentum across the board. During the quarter, the company launched the International® HV™ Series line of vocational trucks. The HV Series, in addition to the HX Series premium vocational truck lineup, now has the option of being powered by the International A26 engine. The company also announced plans for its next-generation powertrains with alliance partner Volkswagen Truck \u0026 Bus, including big bore diesel, as well as electric medium-duty and electric bus platforms launching as early as 2019. Also during the fourth quarter, Navistar and Volkswagen Truck \u0026 Bus announced their intention to converge their connected vehicle activities – OnCommand® Connection and RIO, Volkswagen Truck \u0026 Bus’s digital brand. OnCommand Connection now has an industry leading 370,000 connected vehicles. Navistar refinanced its manufacturing debt in early November, which improved its debt profile and provided greater financial flexibility. The transaction yielded $200 million of additional liquidity and extended the company’s debt maturities by four years. Additionally, it will save approximately $25 million in annualized interest in 2018 and $34 millionin 2019, following the repayment of convertible debt that comes due in 2018. The company provided the following 2018 fiscal year guidance: “We think 2018 is shaping up to be one of the strongest industry years this decade, and we’re positioned to make it a breakout year for Navistar,” Clarke said. “We’ll drive even greater customer consideration with our commitment to uptime and our ongoing cadence of new product launches, which will include the introduction of our new medium-duty vehicle, as well as new IC Bus offerings. At the same time, we will build on our alliance with Volkswagen Truck \u0026 Bus by investing in and collaborating on the major technologies that are reshaping our industry, including electric, connectivity and autonomous.” Truck Segment– For the fourth quarter 2017, the Truck segment recorded a profit of $112 million, compared with a year-ago fourth quarter loss of $61 million. The year-over-year change was primarily due to the impact of higher volume in the company’s Core markets and a decrease in used truck losses. For the 2017 fiscal year, the Truck segment recorded a loss of $6 million, compared with a fiscal year 2016 loss of $189 million. The improvement was primarily driven by the impact of higher volumes in the company’s Core markets and Mexico and a decrease in used truck losses, partially offset by market pressures and charges related to EGR product litigation. Parts Segment — For the fourth quarter 2017, the Parts segment recorded a profit of $157 million, down slightly from year-ago fourth quarter, primarily driven by the gradual runoff of the Blue Diamond Parts business, partially offset by double digit revenue growth from its Fleetrite and the remanufactured parts businesses. For the 2017 fiscal year, the Parts segment recorded its second-largest profit ever at $616 million, compared to a fiscal year 2016 profit of $640 million. The four-percent decrease was primarily driven by margin declines in Blue Diamond Parts, partially offset by a slight year-over-year increase in North America Core market volumes. Global Operations Segment — For the fourth quarter 2017, the Global Operations segment recorded a profit of $1 million, compared to a year-ago fourth quarter loss of $2 million. The year-over-year change was driven by higher volumes due to improvements in the Brazilian economy, offset by restructuring charges. For the 2017 fiscal year, the Global Operations segment recorded a loss of $7 million compared to a year-ago fiscal year loss of $21 million. The Global Operations segment results improvement was primarily due to lower manufacturing and SG\u0026A expenses as a result of the company’s cost reduction efforts and a one-time benefit of $9 million recognized as an adjustment to pre-existing warranties, partially offset by restructuring charges. Financial Services Segment — For the fourth quarter 2017, the Financial Services segment recorded a profit of $26 million, compared with fourth quarter 2016 profit of $23 million. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by higher receivable balances and a lower provision for losses in the company’s Mexico portfolio. For the 2017 fiscal year, the Financial Services segment recorded a profit of $77 million, compared to a year-ago fiscal year profit of $100 million. The decrease is primarily driven by the paydown of certain intercompany loan receivables and lower interest margin resulting from an increase in the company’s average borrowing rate.

But as the underlying technology for a suite of new supply chain solutions, blockchain will be extremely useful to the CEO – even if he doesn’t understand exactly what it is. Fortunately, more companies are building applications to run on blockchain, which provides a trusted, immutable digital record of transactions and is viewed as a game-changing technology for the supply chain. Chattanooga, TN-based BlockArray is one of the companies working to develop blockchain-enabled solutions, and it is looking for companies to participate in pilot studies. “It’s using an open-source blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum enterprise,” co-founder San Bacha explains to FreightWaves. BlockArray, which has been self-funded since launching earlier this year, has spent plenty of time doing research and trial and error, Bacha says, but is now ready with an alpha version of the solution for shippers and carriers to pilot. He adds that the trials will help BlockArray fine-tune based on feedback. “Right now we’re focused on chain of custody because that is the most compelling use case for blockchain,” Bacha says. That chain-of-custody is based on product barcodes. Barcodes must meet GS1 standards, which include a unique 6- to 9-digit company code as well as “product numbers” that identify the product. The 12th digit is the “check digit.” The BlockArray solution breaks down that 12-digit code into “constituent parts,” parses them and builds them into a url/uri/mobile app. The resulting information indicates if the product is authentic or whether it may have been tampered with. All this information is entered into the blockchain through the barcode, which is purchased from GS1. Barcodes are essentially “hex data,” the company explains. Once this information is entered, BlockArray takes the barcodes associated with the customer’s account and creates a hash. “Then using the Keccak-256 hash, a transaction is signed on the online site and submitted to the smart contract,” the company explains. The smart contract is then used to track products through the supply chain. By aggregating all the information, complete visibility will be available. In the case of a food product, the blockchain would allow users to see things such as what organization certified the product, the producer, reviews, potential hazards, recalls and more. The BlockArray vision is larger than just this, though, with potential applications in warehouse management and trailer usage optimization among others. Bacha explains that companies could use information on the blockchain that would allow several fleets to better utilize trailers as part of a trailer pool. The company sees potential products from visual smart contracts, mobile apps, ELD integration, virtualized shipping pools, and ERP integrations. One of the benefits of the solutions is the ability to let companies “speak” to each other. “With Hyperledger Fabric, [each company] could have their own Hyperledger Fabric in the cloud and two companies could be talking to each other and no one will be able to see they are talking to each other,” he says. Bacha says the company hopes to have a blockchain-enabled product on the market by April that would capture ELD and HOS data for drivers. Other products down the line might include a way for small carriers and contractors to list unused capacity in their trailers and allow the marketplace to bid on that capacity through the ELD integration. The entire process, from the listing, to the bidding, to pickup and final delivery would be contained within the blockchain. BlockArray hopes to launch its barcode website and mobile app in the first quarter of 2018 with visual smart contracts launching in the third quarter.

Under Emahiser’s direction, Tadmore Transportation, a Toledo, OH freight brokerage founded in 2010, has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). Emahiser is honest about his decision to be involved with BiTA, which is working to create standards and promote the use of blockchain in the supply chain. In his view, blockchain is one of those technologies that comes along and changes the way things get accomplished. In an interview with FreightWaves, Emahiser says the blockchain will create a common language that carriers, shippers and brokers can all speak. “I’m excited by that,” he says. “Twenty percent of what I do every day is chasing down what people say” and reconciling that with what they mean. Emahiser says he believes the industry is ready for the change that blockchain will bring due to the globalization of freight movement and the associated paperwork involved in moving freight. “I do think that in order for someone to embrace change, they have to [have] the short stick for a moment,” he notes, “and truckers are ready for change. I don’t know if shippers are ready yet,” but they may be within a year. The executive thinks blockchain can help in several areas, including providing trust among parties and eventually helping with truck utilization as more visibility into truck locations is gained. To illustrate, Emahiser used the analogy of making a dinner. If you look in one cupboard, you may have one option, but if you open all the cabinets, there opportunities to make a successful dinner increase. Trust is also important, Emahiser says, as nearly everyone in the business these days operates on credit. It can also help ease the minds of all involved in payments, from the carrier who is hoping to be paid in a timely manner, to the shipper who is hoping that the broker makes the payment on time. Blockchain uses a distributed ledger approach that verifies and stores transactions on the chain. Once verified, the transaction can’t be changed. Emahiser notes the onslaught of technologies invading the industry these days and suggests that blockchain is similar to the university with several schools. While the economics department has little to do with the marketing or astronomy departments, they all are contained within the overall university structure. The same can be said with blockchain, which will pull together various parties and technologies into one trusted network. Getting more people involved in using blockchain will be critical, as will making it easier to understand, Emahiser says. “The internet was confusing for most people, but they could put a disk in the machine,” he says. “The same thing is going to happen to blockchain, who ever can make a simple” way to use it will be among the early winners. Emahiser recently hosted a Facebook Live chat for the Rate Per Mile Masters group after attending the first BiTA meeting in November in Atlanta. In the chat, Emashiser went through a number of scenarios that he envisions as possibilities for blockchain. He sees the attractiveness of blockchain being its immutable or undeniable data and it could be used to “dispense funds, dispense loads, or dispense smart contracts.” “When I go to book freight, I go to a customer and say I’ll move your freight,” he explains. “…The shipper pays me, I pay the carrier, but there is also an underlying agreement that I agree to pay that carrier on the shipper’s behalf. They are trusting me, or any broker, to pay the truck for that shipment. …I could totally see in my world where GM releases GM coin (cryptocurrency) and in order for me to move GM freight, I have to secure a certain amount of GM coin.” Emahiser addressed concerns over visibility of trucks, and noted that blockchain’s proof of transaction ability could eventually lead to a “capacity blockchain.” “If I go to spend $5, it says I have $5, but it also says I have $3 from Roxy and $2 from Sue, therefore my proof of transaction is this is where my money came from, therefore I am allowed to spend $5,” he explained. “In a way, I could almost see a proof of capacity. I took a load going to Florida, therefore I can take a load out of Florida; rather than some guy in Washington State dialing phone numbers and saying, ‘yes, I have a truck in Florida;’ this actually would show where the truck is.” It would also create more visibility into truck movements. “Right now, there’s a lot of questions about who’s my truck, when’s my truck coming in?” Emahiser said in the chat. “We have a lot of people who are double brokering and not being good citizens in our community and this will help a lot with that.” He also noted the amount of data that could be put onto a blockchain, such as safety records or maintenance records. “It enters into a pretty big scope of the data that will be available on a transaction basis,” he said. Emahiser said he was excited to join BiTA and be part of the discussion going forward with a broad cross-section of industry stakeholders. “BiTA is kind of an exciting thing,” he told the Facebook group. “It’s the alliance to get everybody together acting in the same way, which I hope we can. “The BiTA group is getting various people in transportation aligned so we don’t have the same cluster that we had with EDI,” he added. “With EDI, this guy had his standards, this guy had his standards and this guy had his standards, and there was really no standards across the board. So, the BiTA alliance is setting the standards and there were huge players [at the meeting]. People as big as CH Robinson and people as little as us; we were sitting right next to them.” For Emahiser, who acknowledged he is still learning about the potential of blockchain, it has opened up many possibilities in the future.

From autonomous vehicles to electric trucks to blockchain technology, the industry is on the precipice of unprecedented change. However, with all the exciting advances taking place here in the US it is easy to forget that not all parts of the world are up to the same level of technological advancement as we are here. If fact, many parts of the developing world still do not have the infrastructure to support reliable and productive transportation systems. Now some industry participants in these less developed areas are attempting to use new technologies to bridge those gaps. Companies like Heavyweight Group in South Africa are bringing advanced technologies into less developed markets in order to revolutionize transportation in their parts of the world. For the past 24 years Heavyweight has been South Africa’s largest transportation broker in the bulk commodities space. With its view from the top of the industry, the company recognized the need for digital migration across the logistics market in Africa, and therefore embarked on developing the continent’s first digital exchange which they are calling LoadX. LoadX is what in the United States trucking industry would be called a load board. Heavyweight Group’s director, Neil Orleow, states that, “Through LoadX, we are educating the market on the benefits of digital migration from both an efficiency and a corporate governance viewpoint. The shippers using our exchange are international trading houses and mining groups, and have been systematic in assisting with our Africa wide growth plan.” But the load board is only the first step for LoadX. The company has recently joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) and hopes to help spread technologies like blockchain and other advances to Africa. According to Orleow, “The brokering market in Africa is a totally unregulated, opaque industry, and this has created an atmosphere of distrust between shippers, brokers, and transporters. We believe that creating an Africa wide industry standard, built on blockchain infrastructure, will go a long way towards alleviating this toxic atmosphere.” Heavyweight Group, as well as other companies from around the world who are forward-looking and aim to stay in the forefront of their industries, see the importance of early adoption of game-changing technologies. “To maintain our position at the top, we need to be at the forefront of the evolution of logistics in Africa,” says Orleow. “Navigating the usual challenges of inefficiencies in a fragmented market in Africa comes with some uniquely African nuances. But it is a market we understand and have thrived in.” Due to considerable international interest from companies like Heavyweight, BiTA has announced plans to expand to London and Singapore. The organization will be actively searching for offices and an employee base in both cities in 2018. International expansion will allow companies around the world better access to blockchain technology and will enable those who choose to participate in new technologies better access to mature markets.

A term that has been used more often than expected, it has earned considerable second looks based on a plethora of feedback that Quartz has collected. Walmart’s executive vice president, John Furner, was quoted describing blockchain as “it allows someone to track a product from the farm all the way to the shelf and then have a record of it each and every step along the way.” The rising prominence of blockchain use in China, where some of Walmart’s stock comes from, has influenced the traditional retailing giant to adapt the technology as well. Blockchain’s association with Bitcoin (Bitcoin travels on a blockchain network) almost dampened the interest in the currency. The skepticism in Bitcoin is still looming over enterprises with a supply chain to watch over, but the same can’t be said for blockchain. Managing the supply chain is complicated, but IBM Blockchain’s Vice President Ingrid McDermott was quoted in the same report describing the main benefit behind the rise of blockchain use. “Everyone in supply chain is frustrated about data visibility or their inability to optimize processes or to truly manage customer demand.” Technology has never run out of problems that need solving, and visibility among parties is one of those. “The problem is not how do you solve visibility within one company that has total trust and transparency and a hierarchy,” McDermott added. “You have the ability to solve data visibility, but in practice you can’t actually achieve data visibility across the ecosystem, the same with optimization and demand management.” McDermott made sure to insert a disclaimer though. “Blockchain isn’t this pill that solves all problems, it solves the major problem that still really remains for data visibility: how do I get all the parties involved to trust enough to share their information so I can use the digitization tools, the demand management tools, data sharing tools, and use them efficiently and effectively?” It was a sentiment echoed by a statement that Quartz got from an earnings report from Webjet’s managing director, John Guscic. “It would be fair to say, we have some very interesting dialog with a broad range of partners outside of our normal sphere of influence, who have the intellectual curiosity to ask the question about what is this blockchain going to do for their business, and is there something that exists in the IP that we’ve developed so far, that is transportable.” While Quartz managed to collect a plethora of comments and keynote speech quotes from enterprise executives, Supply Chain Dive has gathered information from Google Trends on how interest in blockchain has increased in a span of 5 years. And it basically shattered the proverbial glass ceiling, with increased spiking 100% by January 2017. At the end of the day, business establishments with a considerable presence online have one concern that keeps them interested in viable solutions like blockchain – trust. McDermott summed it up best in claiming how this technology tells customers “I’m going to make sure the data that you have is something you can trust.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Supply chain, Technology, Transparency, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-12-10T12:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/12/8/can-blockchain-revolutionize-the-bill-of-lading","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/cargoshipshutterstock-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Can blockchain revolutionize the bill-of-lading?","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"As with the road freight market, the shipping industry is bogged down with numerous conventional practices which are on the brink of being phased out – and the legal document called the bill of lading could be next. A bill of lading (BOL) is a document that was developed in the seventeenth century by merchants who needed an official agreement that could be considered tangible evidence to the parties entitled for receiving goods at the destination. Fast forward four centuries, and we still see the existence of the old form of legal trade. Over the years, there have been minimal disruptions in that stead, and the process has been blighted with issues regarding parties’ rights and liabilities. This is primarily due to the growth in the shipping industry, which makes operations a lot more complicated – so much so that domestic conventions that attempt to mitigate problems have been rendered inadequate. One of the practical problems concerning BOL occurs when the cargo reaches its destination ahead of the document itself. This is usually because of unexpected hold-ups with bank procedures and unreliable postal networks. Faced with such a scenario, the carrier is left with two options – hold the cargo until he is presented with the physical document or deliver the cargo based on good faith. But then again, there are complications that might arise because of such decisions. For one, holding back a shipment is not resourceful for the carrier, because cargo detention wastes precious time that could be spent hauling the next load. Or further worse, it could be detrimental to the brand of the charterer in the case of delay and cargo detentions. Unintended consequences could arise in regard to delivering on good faith as well if there was a discrepancy with cargo being delivered to a wrong party. This could potentially land the carrier in a lot of trouble, since its P\u0026I cover would be rendered void against the lack of proper evidence. Nonetheless, these problems have been recognized, and reforms are being conceived to address them. Certain markets like the grain trade accept standard GAFTA 100 forms which allow buyers to produce alternative documents if the BOL does not reach on time. The Rotterdam Rules have introduced a convention which has made the use of electronic transport records acceptable. Yet, the overall safety and transparency of these transactions are still debatable. Electronic records are prone to hacking, and if the BOL falls into wrong hands, it could be a recipe for disaster. This is a scenario where blockchain could make a significant difference. A bill of lading through blockchain would be decentralized and automated, storing transaction information between involved parties in its system. Blockchain evokes greater transparency and accountability, since no single party can completely validate a transaction. First off, the participants in the blockchain need to be permitted into the system by existing members, thus making it inaccessible to the general public. And then, the transactions can only be validated with the collective approval of all the parties involved. This negates the chances of fraud or double spending since the encrypted data would be impossible to be modified by an individual. Due to the potential of blockchain to revolutionize the traditional bill of lading process, a lot of companies are vying for market share in this space. WAVE is one of the prominent players in the segment, having introduced a paperless bill of lading with a decentralized network at its core. Its application manages ownership of documents on blockchain and allows a direct exchange of information. R3 consortium is a league of over 80 financial institutions looking to make a difference by building an operating system with a distributed ledger platform powered by blockchain. Recently, an Israeli shipping company ZIM conducted a pilot for a paperless bill of lading trade by transporting freight between China and Canada. The transaction was run through the WAVE application, and the documents were issued, transferred, and received through the platform. Notably, Maersk had partnered with IBM early this year to create a blockchain ledger that could smooth transactions in the shipping industry. All this being said, the use of blockchain is still in its nascent stages, and phasing out the traditional bill of lading needs an explicit approval from the banking institutions as well. The R3 consortium is a good start, where major banking systems have joined in to create the platform. Though predicting a highly successful outcome for such ventures would be too early, it would still be prudent to say that the future does look bright for the shipping industry with regard to seamless transactions.

Some claim that it is the currency of the future, while others anxiously await its impending collapse. The Chicago Board of Exchange (CBoE) began trading Bitcoin futures this week and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is planning to start next week. Other than the occasional story about a corporate takeover or a U.S. Senator resigning (which would be leading stories at any other moment in time), Bitcoin is all CNBC talks about. Whether you are jumping up and down in sheer elation because you bought coins at 300 dollars and change last year or cursing yourself for not pulling the trigger earlier as you see it soar past $18,000 today, all transportation industry participants can rejoice in the fact that the cryptocurrency is providing a use case and, more importantly, legitimacy to the underlying technology called blockchain. Despite the volatility that the world is witnessing as cryptocurrency prices whiplash up and down literally hundreds and thousands of dollars per minute (which traders love but truckers hate), blockchain technology promises to provide more stability and transparency to the entire logistics process. From lane pricing to record of ownership to payments, smart contracts that will be tracked on the blockchain promise to immensely reduce variability and enhance visibility in the supply chain. Production, shipping, warehousing, and delivery will be clearly presented for all blockchain participants to see. While some companies are attempting to harness the power of blockchain technology for their individual needs, others are banding together to build the standards for entire industries. The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) has pulled together companies large and small across the entire transportation sector (and some from the tech sector as well) to write and officially certify the rules of the road for blockchain technology around the transportation industry. As private equity firms, venture capitalists, large corporations, and other interests watch the meteoric rise of cryptocurrencies that utilize blockchain technology at their core, it will prompt further investment in other technologies that use a blockchain as their engine (or at least a part of their apparatus). So if you feel like you have missed out on the cryptocurrency boom/bubble so far, don’t worry. The true value of blockchain technology has not even begun to be realized.

You can’t do blockchain without APIs,” he noted. Kerner was the final speaker on a day and his presentation, The role of Integration in Blockchain, really pulled together the technology and the different aspects and components of it. Kerner went through various components of a blockchain; They are: The blockchain is becoming more critical to transportation because of the increasing ways businesses reach customers and the data that is being generated, Kerner said. Among the ways this is happening, he cited business partners, smartphones, internet TVs, tablets, connected appliances, game consoles, websites and connected cars.  “You are going to have a lot of data coming from a lot of places, how are you going to integrate all that data, even within your own organization,” he asked. Kerner noted that many in the industry are still using EDI for management systems, having yet to move to API. Now comes blockchain, which will require API. “Integration is going to be very important,” he observed, “and not just with your own supply chain.” Among the integration considerations that need to be addressed are external systems, bi-directional systems, security, performance and omni-channel. In a less-than-truckload environment, blockchain can speed and simplify the process. For example, Kerner shared what he said was a basic example of how a blockchain could work. A shipper with a pallet to move requests a quote and transit time. Quotes are returned through the LTL blockchain and the shipper selects a quote. A dispatch request is initiated and dispatch is confirmed. Status updates are inputted into the blockchain and finally an invoice is generated upon delivery. In this example, what happens if the LTL carrier weighs the pallet and determines additional charges are necessary because of size or weight considerations? If that happens, the changes are also recorded in the blockchain and accessorial charges are added as well, which would be reflected in the final invoice. “In the blockchain, when something is added, you are notified of the change,” Kerner explained. Project44 realizes that understanding blockchain can be confusing and examples can sometimes be abstract, that’s why Kerner concluded his presentation by telling the audience they can try out blockchain for free. The Hyperledger Composer Playground is a “web sandbox” that any business can deploy, edit and use to test business network functions on a blockchain.

Wangler noted that blockchain’s ability to solve these problems comes down to three things that it does really real: provide transparency to the processes, visibility within the supply chain, and the ability to help match demand and capacity. “Trying to get accurate information to the right party [has been an issue],” Wangler said, who noted that TMW joined BiTA for the same reason many of the companies in attendance had: because it sees industry problems that can be solved by blockchain. Blockchain is a peer-to-peer electronic system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. TMW expects to have a couple of blockchain-based products on the market sometime in 2018. Wangler said Trimble sees blockchain being used for dealing with a wide array of industry issues that involve analytics; vehicle data; financial planning; logistics, planning and execution; and the Internet of Things. Tim Leonard, EVP \u0026 CTO of TMW Systems, took over the presentation from Wangler to highlight some of the work TMW is conducting around blockchain. He mentioned that the company is currently testing a blockchain-enabled solution with some carriers and they are finding significant savings so far. The key to making blockchain work for you, Leonard noted, is the data. “The data is so critical,” he said. “The data is coming from both the carrier and shipper; you have to solve for both.” TMW is using a “blockchain enterprise architecture approach,” which uses building blocks (architecture) related to applications, data, technology and business to build the blockchain. Leonard said TMW has collected over two years of data coming from over 420 data points that are feeding into its blockchain development. “That data allows building of apps that work on blockchain” he noted. Leonard walked the audience through an example that started with a request for proposal (RFP) and worked through each step of the process, showing how the data is stored in blocks on the blockchain along the way. In one of the TMW tests, the RFP data and bid application are all incorporated into a blockchain. There is even a test where the truck’s route has been included, providing additional visibility. The key, Leonard said, in any blockchain is knowing your data. “If you don’t know your data inside the blockchain, you are going to get lost real quick,” he said. The smart contract part of a transportation blockchain is critical, as it can provide automation of a host of conditions, all self-executing based on conditions being met and verified in the blockchain. The contract pulls all the relevant information from disparate systems and updates the conditions accordingly. Leonard said that future blockchains could potentially pull data from a number of publicly accessible sources leading to the integration of such critical information as weather, traffic, news, and fuel pricing along routes, all of which can improve the truck utilization equation and speed shipments. Management information such as census data, economic data, geographic data and industry-specific data like FMCSA carrier registration information or CSA scores, can also be included leading to more efficient overall operations. “The hardest part isn’t building the code, the hardest thing is building consensus on both sides,” Wangler said. BiTA is working to solve that by bringing together industry stakeholders to develop standards for blockchain usage.

Blockchain refers to the process of storing information in “blocks” across a digital network to make transactions more secure and traceable. While blockchain technology already has a major presence in the financial sector—most notably as the underlying platform for Bitcoin—there is unmet potential for the transportation and logistics industries. Not only will blockchain allow companies like Hummer to track shipments faster and more accurately (and keep more precise maintenance records on its fleet), it will allow carriers to identity excess truckload capacity, making coordinating loads more efficient. Blockchain technology offers big incentives for customers as well. Complete transparency will allow users to track shipments along every step of their journey. But most notably, blockchain can streamline payment processes, allowing customers to instantly transfer funds securely once a shipment is delivered. “Blockchain technology’s ability to transact in certainty, rather than just information, will have far reaching implications for every industry,” says Mike Johnson, director of IT at Don Hummer Trucking. “We recognize this potential and are eager to join with other industry partners in the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance to build a bridge between technology and the truck.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Don Hummer transportation, Transparency, Trucking, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-12-05T19:23:51-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/12/5/bnsf-logistics-joins-blockchain-in-transport-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/BNSFlogopromo.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BNSF Logistics joins Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"BNSF Logistics, a leading multi-modal third-party logistics service provider, announced it has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) to help lead, develop and promote benchmark standards for blockchain applications; the next generation of secure transactions in logistics and supply chain management.

Maybe he had a violation or violations he didn’t report? Maybe he’s had six jobs in seven months, but his resume indicates he’s been a valued and stable employee at a single company during that time? The fact is, job application fraud is a serious and significant problem in all industries. But without the time and financial resources to properly vet candidates, especially in an industry such as trucking with is facing a shortage of some 50,000 drivers, bad employees get through. And that can cost a company through higher insurance premiums, hits to their reputations, and even costly legal settlements. But what if there was a way to properly vet employees quickly and easily, at little cost? There may be someday. Natalie Smolenski, vice president of business development for Learning Machine, gave a presentation to members of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance last month in Atlanta on how blockchain technology can be used to identify people and their credentials. “Blockchains are not only a technical infrastructure, they are a social infrastructure,” she told the gathered BiTA members. “Right now, we are in the early days of blockchain so there is a lot of experimentation going on.” Learning Machine is working on building blockchain-enabled identify. It is contracting with governments, companies and school systems to develop secure blockchain credentialing systems. MIT just added diplomas on a blockchain built by Learning Machine. The digital diplomas allow students to access their records at anytime through the secure and unchangeable structure of a blockchain. To illustrate her point about the need for identity verification, Smolenski noted that there 200,000 fake degrees each year and 30% of people put misleading information on a job application leading to $744 million in fraud damages annually. She also said that there are currently 2.5 billion people in the world without proper documents to identify themselves, including many refugees who have skills that could be of benefit to nations but can’t prove it. An identity blockchain could solve that, allowing governments or employers to quickly look up someone’s credentials. Smolenski told BiTA members “the blockchain can provide your drivers with identity documents” to assist them with passing through security checkpoints or in dealing with roadside enforcement. Shippers can also use the blockchain identities to ensure the proper driver and truck has arrived to pick up or deliver its shipment. The complete and unaltered driver’s records could be made available quickly. “And [it could include] a complete portfolio of their career [including awards and recognition].” To dissuade companies from creating their own blockchain for drivers that is not accessible by others, including potential new employers, Learning Machine is building an open-source system called Blockcerts with the help of MIT. Blockcerts is a mobile app that provides a key for the individual holding the blockcert to access. In the case of a truck driver, he can use the key to open up the blockcert to verify the information needed, including their identity, any awards, violations, employment history, etc. The blockcert also allows the driver to create a “public” key to be used for job applications or to send to anyone else needing access to information in the driver’s blockchain. The public key does not allow viewers to change any of the information, so all the data remains secure, Smolenski said. “If you want to own your digital assets on the blockchain, you must own your own key,” she said. “What Learning Machine wanted to do at the beginning was help people own their own key.” Blockcerts are not owned by anyone, Smolenski said, and available now to anyone who wished to download the app and get started. Blockcerts and a blockcert wallet can be downloaded from blockcerts.org or through app stores.

In some ways, it’s still just an emerging idea. But it’s an idea so powerful it happens to be transforming our economic systems in radical ways. Originally conceived as a way of tracking Bitcoin currency, its implications reach far beyond Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency that everyone still associates with it. Many still wonder how it works, and more importantly, is it safe? For starters, blockchains lower uncertainty between parties because it’s replicated, it’s secure and hard to tamper with. Blockchain is designed to store information in a way that makes it virtually impossible to add, remove or change data without being detected and authorized by other users. Some have compared blockchain technology to something like a Wikipedia page with multiple parties contributing to an open system, but that’s not quite right. With Wikipedia, the changes and alterations to the data are open to the entire public, and are often recorded for significant time periods without the requirement to validate or verify the information. By contrast, a “Block” is a permanently recorded set of data with a time stamp. The rest of the chain is between a narrow and closed network working in a peer-to-peer format. The network interacts and functions together cooperatively as a team. For logistics and supply chain applications, it’s a game-changer. Perhaps the most important among these includes improvements of transparency and data sharing across the supply chain, better tracking of orders, reducing errors and better fraud detection. It’s no longer the future, either. It’s here and happening now. According to Morgan Stanley’s Blockchain in Freight report, IBM has invested in blockchain technology since 2014, and forecasts a $200 plus billion potential for FS and supply chains alone. IBM also has 50-plus Developer APIs, and over 400 clients currently engaged with blockchain. Another potential winner in the blockchain space is Trimble, a leading software provider for trucking. Trimble plans to have its own private, encrypted blockchain technology to roll out in 2018. Its application projects to handle up to 500,000 transactions per week. Walmart also announced the use of blockchain technology with an emphasis on identifying the source of bad food in the supply chain. DHL is developing a direct decentralized platform to facilitate financial transactions. Maersk, in collaboration with IBM, is using the technology to track millions of ocean freight shipping containers, and streamline customs and security inspections. The blockchain empowers individuals to hold their own official records and share them directly, and acts as a notary that can always attest to the authenticity of certificates. Clearly, blockchain technology presents huge cost saving advantages for the industry. The new platforms also assist in reducing transaction time, duplication of documents and authentication processes among all trading partners. It allows many intermediaries in the air cargo chain, from handlers to customs, from shippers to carriers, to communicate safely, cheaply and effectively. What has not been so clear is how safe the networks will function. So what is blockchain? It’s disrupting an industry that’s ripe for innovation. It has a lot more capacity for utilization than merely in the logistics industry, but because the industry is in need of innovation, and because the stakes are so high, it’s a perfect storm for growth projection. To further validate the growth and economic encouragement to the technology, at least eight U.S. States have worked on bills accepting or promoting the use of blockchain technology. Several bills have already passed into law. How fast and how widely will blockchain technology be implemented in the supply chain? No one can say for sure, but now that people see how secure it is, the future is wide open. It’s taking off in earnest and ahead of projected schedule.

ZIM, based in Haifa, Israel, was founded in 1945 and has a capacity of over 344K TEUs, making it a top-20 global shipping firm. During the trial all participants issued, transferred, and received original electronic documents using the Wave Application. Wave’s new blockchain bill-of-lading platform uses distributed ledgers to ensure that all parties in the supply chain can issue, transfer, endorse, and manage documents through a decentralized network. The application is free for shippers, importers, and traders, and requires no IT or operational changes. The video below explains what Wave does: \u003cbr /\u003e ZIM CIO Eyal Ben-Amram said, “promoting innovation and technology in our industry is an integral part of ZIM’s vision. While we are still in the process of evaluating the technology, we are confident that this type of forward-looking ideas will advance our industry as a whole towards a more efficient and modern phase.” The ZIM-Sparx-Wave collaboration shows how smaller, more nimble companies have been able to embrace and implement blockchain technology to maintain their competitive edge against larger industry leaders. Earlier this year, Maersk, the world’s largest container shipping line, and IBM announced a partnership to use blockchain to digitize and streamline the paper trail of millions of shipping containers all across the world. Maersk’s fleet has a capacity of about 3.8M TEUs, more than ten times what ZIM holds. In 2014, a Maersk study revealed that even a relatively uncomplicated shipment of refrigerated goods from East Africa to Europe can go through nearly 30 people and organizations, including 200+ interactions and communications between those parties. The costs of processing and administering trade documents are estimated to represent 20% of the actual physical transportation costs. Anglo-American shipping firm Marine Transport International (MTI) estimates that blockchain could save $300 per container in terms of labor and processing associated documents. For one ultra-large container ship, which carries up to 22,000 containers, the savings amount to $6.6M. Maersk and IBM’s solution is based on Linux’s open source Hyperledger Fabric and is hosted on the IBM Cloud. Maersk and Microsoft, on the other hand, completed a 20 week blockchain proof of concept trial for marine insurance earlier this year. “Insurance transactions are currently far too tedious and frictional,” said Lars Henneberg, Maersk’s head of risk and insurance, in a statement about the trial. “Blockchain technology has the potential to facilitate the desired development that is long overdue.” In August, MTI began a blockchain pilot to protect maritime supply chains against NotPetya-style cyberattacks. A month before, NotPetya had infected Maersk through a malicious update to the accounting software MeDoc, forcing Maersk to shut down operations at 76 port terminals and ultimately costing the firm between $200M-$300M. Maersk’s CEO, Soren Skou, said the firm’s communications networks were completely shut down and employees had to use WhatsApp on their private mobile phones to maintain the bare minimum of contact.

That’s according to the CEO of Marine Transport International, a UK logistics technology provider that specializes in blockchain-enabled products. A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. There has been significant interest in its application in the logistics and freight sectors, where it has the potential to increase transparency, improve efficiency and enable automation. “Blockchain has been touted as a major innovation in the digitalization of logistics, offering transparency, connectivity and automation at a time when all players are looking to become more efficient and cut costs to offset falling rates,” said Jody Cleworth, founder and CEO of MTI. “Yet as with any new hype, there’s a lot of smoke and mirrors, a lot of confusion and a lot of investment which isn’t necessarily focusing on the long-term potential. Defining a common set of standards is the only way that blockchain is going to make the step up to being seriously considered by the major players in the supply chain.” With so many of the major logistics players still wedded to legacy systems which can’t connect with one another, having a straightforward, transparent approach is the only way the sector is going to be able to harness the benefits of blockchain. “Supply chains are made up of multiple parties, all of whom have made major investments in their technology,” continued Cleworth, founder and CEO of MTI. “Historically, those systems haven’t been set up to communicate outside themselves, so people have had to spend time and money repeating the capture of inputting of data to ensure that all parties have what they need. At a time when everyone is looking to become more efficient, cut costs and automate, being able to use a system that can connect with any legacy IT has the potential to radically transform a business.” To that end, MTI has joined a new U.S.-based blockchain standards organization as its first European member. Blockchain in Transport Association (BITA) aim is to create a forum for the development of blockchain standards and education for the freight industry. It currently has 160 members, including UPS, SAP and Bridgestone. “For blockchain to be a success, we need to have a transparent, open and honest process, which means everyone working off a standard,” said Chris Burruss, president of BiTA. “Right now, everyone is excited about the potential, but as with any new technology, there’s multiple ways it might be deployed. Identifying the right approach is critical in the journey to mass adoption.” Another challenge is linking blockchain products to legacy systems. MTI’s approach, known as Container Streams, is specifically designed to connect with established systems, meaning that blockchain users can connect with non-blockchain users. In an industry built on the sharing of data, this approach can significantly reduce the amount of time spent on capturing and entering data across multiple systems. Cleworth said, “We want to build a collaborative ecosystem which connects everyone involved in logistics – from trucking companies and freight forwarders to distribution centres, ports and ocean and air carriers. To do that, we need consistency and standardisation, which is why we’re delighted to be working with BITA to help develop a blockchain standard for the entire transportation industry.” Burruss said “MTI’s focus on collaboration and connecting with existing systems puts it ahead of many other providers looking to introduce blockchain technologies in a rip-and-replace format. That’s why we’re delighted to have them join BiTA, and we look forward to both parties benefiting from the others expertise. “As our first European member, we look forward to being able to build on the connections MTI has in the region as we grow our membership,” he added. MTI has been developing logistics solutions enabled by blockchain since 2016. Its Container Streams technology was recently the subject of a whitepaper by the University of Copenhagen and Blockchain Labs for Open Collaboration.

That consortium joined forces to work on reducing friction in oil logistics. Consurgo is now working to implement emerging technologies such as blockchain into the oilfield logistics sector through an organizational readiness toolkit to enable enterprise adoption. The company is a collection of energy trading professionals with a focus on hydrocarbon commodity trading risk management and offers solutions to do that. Basu said that the group’s goal is to link oil producers and crude/water haulers with smart contracts and Internet of Things technology. The end game is to reduce days sales outstanding, he said, adding that smart contracts can create efficiencies through reduced manual checks and improved workflow around bills of lading, tickets and electronic documentation. Blockchain can also improve security of loads and reduce working capital costs through reduced payment times. In the oilfield, Basu gave an example of a truck leaving the production facility with less or more product than it is supposed to have onboard. A field ticket based on a smart contract is created and checks are generated at each step so when the truck fills up, the data is inputted as to how many gallons are on the truck. The field ticket would then check the tank to ensure it is now short that same number of gallons. “For that ticket to get made, each person must [input data],” Basu explained. The blockchain provides the validity of the facts in the process. Basu said there have been industry challenges to developing this process, including limited existing standards and getting buy-in from companies. Consurgo learned that the IT people were not the right ones to approach and it adjusted its approach to target CEOs. Other challenges have included developing the mode of operation (a public, private or combination blockchain); the capital cost to develop interfacing systems and control processes; legal concerns including what jurisdictions support blockchain and developing master agreements; and security of blockchain key management. There are also a number of operational challenges Consurgo has run into. These include privacy and confidentiality of data; partial and temporal visibility and invisibility with consensus; the ability to bring transactions “home” to internal systems; legal liabilities resulting from a mismatch between the intent of code and the legal intent; management of keys; pattern recognition and preventive risk management; and how to revert to manual processes in the case of device malfunction or a stolen ID or key.   Assuming both the operation and industry challenges can be met, Basu said the opportunity exists to combine Internet of Things and smart contracts into a productive tool for the supply chain. He identified several benefits of such a union: While Basu is working to develop this model for the oilfields industry, it would apply, with some modifications, to any segment of the industry.

Blockchain and Bitcoin are not the same thing – it is the blockchain that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are traded upon. Still, the confusion remains. And now we have something called initial coin offerings (ICOs), which use cryptocurrencies to raise money. Sometimes called token sales or TGEs, they are becoming a popular way for companies, especially startups, to raise funds. They may seem like a sure-fire way to raise money, but they come with significant risk, according to Austin Mills, chair of blockchain \u0026 cryptocurrency practice at law firm Morris, Manning \u0026 Martin. According to Mills, as recently as this past spring, there was about one ICO per month, but that has increased to about 5 per day. ICOs can raise massive amounts of money for businesses. For instance, Storj, a cloud-storage solutions provider, raised $130 million in an ICO. What is an ICO? “In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, but usually for Bitcoin” or some other cryptocurrency, explains Investopedia. In general, people who buy into an ICO or token sale would invest money and may get cryptocurrency, or in some cases access to a physical product or service, in return. Early efforts at ICOs saw many investors lose a lot of money. “All of a sudden, two guys with a white paper could raise millions of dollars,” Mills explained to members of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) during the group’s initial meeting in Atlanta earlier this month. “As the market gets more saturated, you are seeing less appetite for two guys and a white paper. It is looking for [more developed projects].” In some instances, U.S. individuals and companies are barred from participating in ICOs – either investing or using one to raise funds. The reason is the complexity of the law. According to Mills, the Securities and Exchange Commission views nearly 90% of all ICOs to be securities (the remainder would be considered “utility tokens”), and therefore subject to SEC regulations. That is one reason why most ICOs originate overseas. “Depending on the facts and circumstances, the offering may involve the offer and sale of securities,” the SEC wrote in an advisory this summer. “If that is the case, the offer and sale of virtual coins or tokens must itself be registered with the SEC, or be performed pursuant to an exemption from registration. Before investing in an ICO, ask whether the virtual tokens or coins are securities and whether the persons selling them registered the offering with the SEC.” If you treat or ICOs as securities, you will be on the right side of the law, Mills advised. So, if you want to get involved in an ICO, how do you do that? Start by answering a simple question: “You have to be able to answer what value that token will have,” Mills said. It could be a price increase or a physical good or service. “If you are trying to do an ICO, they are buying a token, but they are not going to buy that token for $5 if it’s going to be worth $5 [in the future].” An ICO starts with the planning phase and includes a white paper. It must also include a development plan (smart contract); marketing plan; a legal/tax structure; documentation; a presale or initial raise (this is for insiders); a crowdsale; security audit and then the token issuance. One consideration Mills noted is that if you raise money through an ICO, it is generally considered deferred revenue for tax purposes. Presales have become an increasingly important part of ICOs, Mills advised, giving companies a way to raise money from insiders to build out a product or service. “So that when the ICO sale takes place, it is less likely to be considered a security,” he said. Mills concluded by noting that anyone interested in an ICO should consider securities laws, tax consequences, money transmission regulations, jurisdictional bans and sale documentation before making the leap.

This membership will allow it to influence the future of transportation technology by taking part in the development of blockchain technology standards and education for the freight industry. As Arke Technology and the over 200 other BiTA members are looking toward the future, they all see the need for common standards and protocols in blockchain technology. This technology will disrupt every facet of the transportation industry from the contracts signed to the vehicles driven. Once developed and accepted, blockchain protocols will support constant, transparent, and trusted information sharing between every stakeholder in the industry. It will make data more easily accessible and therefore allow that data to be more useful throughout the supply chain. BiTA was founded in the spirit of embracing this movement into the future together.  “Blockchain technology has been accepted in many other areas from financial transactions to sharing Google Docs. Blockchain will cause a revolution within our industry and BiTA is here to enable us to evolve together. Down the road, these standards will be commonplace in our industry; it is our responsibility to be involved in their development,” said Tyler Mantel, Arke Technology CEO, as he spoke about the blockchain movement. “Here at Arke, blockchain technology is very important to us. We are able to provide our customers valuable insights, improving their day-to-day business, while ensuring consistent data security.” Similar to BiTA, Arke Technology’s focus on driver retention was birthed from industry necessity. The transportation industry has a driver turnover rate of 90% per year, causing a yearly loss of $125 billion. In order to combat this issue, Arke utilizes the data that haulers are already collecting in order to make insights which not only combat driver turnover, but also improve driver performance and satisfaction. Data, however, is a valuable resource that needs to be protected. That is where BiTA comes in. The blockchain standards and understanding that will come out of BiTA will enable the transportation industry to move into the future with security and a sense of trust. Arke Technology encourages everyone who has any stake in the transportation industry to join BiTA.

In many respects, you need a phD to understand it. So it was fortuitous for Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) members that the group’s first meeting in Atlanta recently had just such a person. Rajat Rajbhandari, a research engineer at Texas A\u0026N’s Transportation Institute, holds a phD. He is also co-founder of TruckIN Europe, a Berlin based tech startup developing asset sharing platform for transportation, and co-founder of Blocksec, a blockchain development firm. Rajbhandari took the audience members of nearly 150 through a lesson in Blockchain 201 – explaining in some detail how a blockchain works and some of its components. Simplified, Rajbhandari began, a blockchain is a ledger of transactions that are stored in data blocks linked in a chain. Those blocks are distributed and shared within a network and validated by the network using a common protocol. Within a blockchain, though, four key elements are needed, he said. They are a ledger, consensus, cryptography and business logic. The ledger is simply the chronological transactions in chained blocks or nodes. The nodes include “hashes” which are the equivalent of a “fingerprint of the transaction,” Rajbhandari explained. “If you change anything in the transaction, the hash changes,” he noted. This allows participants to see the transactions, see each different transaction, and validate the transactions. The nodes would include a merkle root, which is similar to a tree. According to Investopedia, a merkle root or merkle tree is a “block of transactions [that are] run through an algorithm to generate a hash, which is a string of numbers and letters that can be used to verify that a given set of data is the same as the original set of transactions, but not to obtain the original set of transactions.” In cryptography and computer science, a merkle tree is a tree in which every leaf node is labelled with a data block and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. Hash trees allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures. A node would also include a time stamp, the previous block hash id, the current block hash id, and the next block hash id, along with the value of the block, if there is one. The consensus is important as this is the common protocol for validating transactions and blocks. The consensus would follow certain generally accepted standards, such as those that BiTA is working to develop, as well as standards agreed upon between parties. The consensus means the nodes in a network agree on the same data. In an enterprise blockchain, this would be the validators. In Bitcoin blockchain, it is the miners. Cryptography, not to be confused with cryptocurrencies, is what verifies the origin of the transaction either through a digital signature or a public or private key that gives the user access to the blockchain. Once verified, it creates immutable blocks (hashes) that are similar to a fingerprint for each transaction. Business logics are actually what makes the blockchain work. They manage the interaction, visibility and can integrate with smart contracts. “Essentially, it [gives] permission to read and write transactions …and how smart contracts will be integrated with your business workflow,” Rajbhandari said. Smart contracts are among the first areas where the supply chain may benefit from blockchain. These are not a piece of code, Rajbhandari stressed, but rather a contract that resides in a blockchain and inherits features of the blockchain. They provide conditions that generate a value transfer – be it monetary or assets – involving humans-to-humans, humans-to-machines, or machines-to-machines. For example, the smart contract could trigger a payment if certain conditions within the blockchain transaction are met. Rajbhandari says the goal of blockchain should be to “outsource trust to a network.” One of the benefits of blockchain is that firms on different transportation management systems can still communicate in a blockchain. “Blockchain is not an end product,” Rajbhandari said. “It’s an idea; it’s a framework; it’s an operational philosophy. If properly implemented, blockchain can be a common language between companies.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Rajat Rajbhandari, Technology, Transparency, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Economics, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-29T16:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/mcleod-delivers-blockchain-101","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Smartcontract-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Getting up to speed on blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"While attendees at the recent Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) meeting in Atlanta were there because they are members of the blockchain organization, there were varying degrees of knowledge of the emerging technology. Some are part of companies actively working on blockchain projects while others are aware of the potential disruption the technology is set to unleash on the transportation industry and want to be part of an organization that is dedicated to building blockchain industry standards and promoting educational efforts. Regardless of where they are with their blockchain knowledge, though, all were engaged by Ken Craig, senior vice president of special projects for McLeod Software, as he delivered an energetic and entertaining primer on Blockchain 101. “We’re just part of a whole integrated supply chain; we can’t just go off and do our own trucking thing,” Craig told the audience. “EDI was a standard, but it was never standardized. Everyone has their own EDI. What we need to do with this consortium (BiTA) is avoid this,” he added. “We need to avoid this. We have an opportunity…we’ll never be able to achieve all the promise and hope if we don’t [work collaboratively].” Craig walked the BiTA members through a brief history of blockchain, tried to separate some of the hype and confusion and concluded with some of the “dirty little blockchain secrets” that no one will talk about. By way of noting the interest in blockchain, Craig pointed out that the best attended session at the most recent McLeod User Conference was on blockchain, with over 200 attendees. Sticking with the Blockchain 101 theme and a “gentle introduction” to the technology, Craig explained that blockchain is a “distributed secure ledger [but] obviously, it’s a lot more than that,” he said. Blockchain provides every participant in the chain a copy of the ledger and all parties can review previous entries or record new ones with the links between each block protected by cryptography so they can’t be changed. The entire blockchain is based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network as opposed to a centralized network where all transactions are conducted with a single computer point. Craig strongly noted that blockchain is not a database and that the data that appears on a blockchain must still be inputted into a real database for analysis and analytics. “[Blockchain] is not a process replacement,” he said. “It’s not intended to replace what you already have in place, it’s to augment EDI or whatever you have in place.” The type of blockchain that will likely be used in transportation is a “permissioned” blockchain, Craig explained. Permissioned blockchains are private blockchains where participants need a “key” to access the chain. This will allow businesses with the proper key to see transactions within the blockchain, but it will not allow the general public to access any of the data within the chain. Second-generation blockchain frameworks are now in development, Craig said, including Microsoft’s “Coco Framework.” Current generation frameworks include R3, Ethereum, Hyperledger, and Ripple. The triple ledger nature of blockchain (meaning it adds cryptography proof to the traditional double-ledger accounting standard) will help it develop into a transformative technology that allows the introduction of new technologies to the industry. “Smart contracts, I think, are what is really going to deliver on the promise of blockchain,” Craig said. “The smart contract is going to be a great thing.” Smart contracts are digital contracts between parties that feature triggers inserted into the blockchain using code. When a trigger is activated, the contract automatically executes the action, such as a payment. McLeod has been working to build tools that can operate on a blockchain, Craig noted. The company recently introduced a smart contract option that will allow companies to build smart contracts. Within the trucking ecosystem, Craig noted that areas where blockchain can be utilized may include fraud detection, theft prevention, dynamic optimization, vehicle maintenance, quality assurance, performance history, capacity monitoring and payments and pricing. To sum up his presentation, Craig went through the “10 dirty little secrets (that most blockchain advocates won’t tell you).”           They are: 1. Trust in a permissioned blockchain is determined by the permission mechanism itself (which may include an actual contract) and not cryptography 2. If the only reason to use cryptography is for stewardship of the data you probably don’t need a blockchain 3. The real power of the supply chain blockchain lies in smart contracts 4. Bad processes or master data management will not be improved or corrected by a blockchain 5. Blockchains do not scale linearly with increasing nodes and can’t handle huge volumes of data 6. First-generation supply chain-focused blockchain solutions will largely be proprietary 7. Most proprietary blockchains will not survive in a standards-based environment and will ultimately be discarded 8. Blockchains exhibit generally poor performance due to overhead of consensus mechanisms, signature verification and redundancy 9. Access to the private key file that unlocks a blockchain should be restricted because the ledger could be accidently corrupted. 10. In a nutshell, if you want to store some immutable data with no central control on a fault tolerant robust system, blockchain is for you, however, it will come at a cost of performance and scalability. In the end, Craig tried to portray the important role blockchain will play going forward, something that all in attendance can agree on.

That was just one of the interesting nuggets of information Bart DeMuynck, research director at Gartner Research, imparted on the audience during the recent Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) meeting, held Nov. 16 at the Georgia International Convention Center in Atlanta. BiTA was founded to combat this information gap and provide a collaborative forum for industry stakeholders to join together to develop best practices and standards and promote educational efforts to assist the industry as it transitions to the use of blockchain technology. The BiTA meeting, the first for the organization, was attended by nearly 150 members. DeMuynck delivered the keynote address to members. He noted that in the Gartner survey, while 59.34% found the technology “interesting, but unclear of its usefulness,” 28.57% believe blockchain will be disruptive and important to the future of the industry. “Today, we see processes for blockchain where there is a lot of manual processes,” DeMuynck explained, adding that the amount of data available today can improve the overall supply chain if it was shared. “Today, we have a lot of data but that doesn’t mean we are sharing that data beyond our own organizations.”  Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that provides transactions of value, he said. Within a blockchain, data is encrypted in blocks and distributed across a wide network of computers, providing transparency for transactions for each party involved in the transaction. In essence, blockchain provides a level of trust that does not usually exist among parties. DeMuynck said Gartner’s research indicates that blockchain will provide a business value-add of $176 billion by 2025 and $3.1 trillion by 2030 across industries. In transportation, which is forecast to produce $1.2T in truck revenue by 2028, blockchain can address challenges in the following areas: economic drivers, customer service, driver shortage, new business models, regulations, shipping models, controlling costs, and productivity. “I’ve never seen the level of interest” we are seeing in blockchain, he said. Key benefits of the blockchain, DeMuynck explained, include enhanced transparency of a product’s journey through the supply chain; greater scalability to allow an unlimited number of participants to be involved in a transaction and allow a verified level of trust; improve supply chain security, including verification of pickups and deliveries; and increase innovation as new uses for the technology are developed. Areas where blockchain can be utilized are in the rate/bidding process, to reduce errors through the elimination of manual documentation; visibility, traceability and monitoring; proof of delivery; payment efficiencies and even ELD compliance. “There is a lot of visibility out there in the market, but the problem is everyone has it in their own cloud,” DeMuynck said. Blockchain can bring that information together, he noted. With that said, DeMuynck warned that blockchain remains in the early stages of development in most sectors and faces a number of challenges, although there are already companies looking at it as a way to ensure fleets are ELD compliant. Walmart is currently testing blockchain to track food and IBM and Maersk have teamed up to run a pilot program for customs documentation. DeMuynck noted that Toyota is considering a blockchain test where it would use the technology to track vehicle components throughout the supply chain. While the hype around blockchain continues to build, DeMuynck pointed out that there is very little actually blockchain technology available today. “You will see a lot of news about blockchain,” he said, “but there are not a lot of blockchain products you can buy” right now. Concluding his address, the Gartner researcher noted some of the barriers that must be overcome, including the establishment of a decentralized network governance that gets initial guidance from an industry stakeholder/company willing to lead the pilot; establishing business ecosystems; enabling data interoperability; establishing business rules; showing it provides value above current systems; a steep learning curve and establishing security and risk management capabilities. “The first effort is to bring everyone together and I applaud BiTA [for doing that],” he said. “The next step is to [develop governance].” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"BiTA, Blockchain, Blockchain in transport alliance, Gartner, Transparency, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-28T14:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain-in-transport-alliance-expands-mission","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/BITATransportpromo.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BiTA to expand its blockchain mission, renamed Blockchain in Transport Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"BiTA, previously known as the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, has expanded its mission and renamed the Alliance the Blockchain in Transport Alliance to reflect its focus on all forms of transportation, not just trucking.

As a result, the mission of BiTA is being expanded to reflect the diverse business interests of members. “Since BiTA launched this past fall, we have seen overwhelming interest from all forms of transportation companies, not exclusively trucking,” explained Chris Burruss, president of BiTA. “These organizations wanted an organization to further their interests in blockchain standards, working on the same framework, regardless of mode.” The organization will also expand its presence globally by opening offices in London and Singapore, which it describes as global centers of transportation and commerce. “By expanding our presence into Singapore and London, we hope to help companies in the region expand their blockchain offerings and plug into our global standards organization,” says Craig Fuller, managing director of BiTA. While the expanded mission is important to many members, the alliance stresses that trucking is still a primary focus. “Expanding our focus and footprint is a reflection of a broader mission, but blockchain standards in trucking and road freight are still enormously important,” notes Burruss. “Seventy-five percent of all goods in North America are moved by truck, but as we focus on cross border and global trade, other modes such as maritime are far more prevalent. We are growing our team rapidly and expanded our infrastructure to focus on the evolution of the freight market.” BiTA has received over 540 applicants to join the organization since announcing its creation in August 2017. It held its first meeting of members in Atlanta in mid-November and is planning to co-host an open conference in May 2018 and invites firms and people interested in FreightTech to attend.

Morgan Stanley believes the revenue opportunity for blockchain in freight will be around $500B if it succeeds in swallowing global truck brokerage (about $160B), freight forwarding (about $150B), truck fuel spend (about $175B), and supply chain management software (about $10B). We break down the key takeaways from the Morgan Stanley report below. Middlemen are under threat: asset-light 3PLs like CHRW, Echo, and other shipper-carrier matching services will be the first to come under pressure if blockchain can achieve commercially viable levels of speed, transparency, and security. Stifel’s John Larkin commented that, “We don’t think [3PLs] are eliminated. Rather, we think that they will be early adopters of Blockchain and will squeeze out any remaining small brokers that cannot keep pace with accelerating changes on the technology front in our industry.” The next segment in the supply chain to feel the threat may be fleet card operators whose virtual card payments will be replaced by auto-executing smart contracts. The key beneficiaries will be asset-based carriers and shippers. One of the key differences between a publicly distributed cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and potential applications for blockchain in freight transportation is that the transportation industry will likely use a private/shared consensus ledger rather than a public/distributed ledger. A smart contract may only require 50% of the involved parties (plus an optional third party arbitrator) to agree on a transaction’s details, rather than the 50% of the entire network that Bitcoin requires. In practical terms, private/shared consensus ledgers will avoid the massive computing and electricity costs associated with Bitcoin and the applications will be able to scale much more efficiently. Morgan Stanley compiled a list of blockchain in freight transportation’s current use applications: Maersk built an application to track millions of ocean shipping containers; IBM has over 400 customers for their products enhancing workflow visibility and infrastructure management; Walmart currently uses blockchain to monitor its food delivery supply chain at a granular level to avoid massive recalls, etc. Morgan Stanley’s report digs into the details on many of these use cases, and then goes on to explain exactly how blockchain can address some stubborn problems and inefficiencies that plague the freight transportation industry. Blockchain’s potential benefits to the supply chain include standardizing payments, verifying product quality, optimizing cargo capacity, and increasing supply chain transparency. Morgan Stanley also goes through how obstacles like accountability, free riding, and scalability can be addressed. One of Morgan Stanley’s slides gives background information on the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). BiTA is a coalition of manufacturers, shipping companies, and logistics technology companies that aims to develop common standards around blockchain applications in the transportation industry, from speeding up transactions to securing data transfers. Use cases include visibility into truck performance history, vehicle maintenance, quality assurance, dynamic optimization, capacity monitoring, payment and pricing, fraud detection, and theft prevention. Major BiTA members include McLeod Software, Coyote, Convoy, UPS, DAT, Transfix, SAP, U.S. Xpress, TMW Systems, Polaris, Century, Logiflex, Kamion, Bridgestone, and Triumph. Specific issues BiTA members are addressing range from self-executing smart contracts, freight payment collection, asset maintenance and ownership history that ensures compliance with safety standards, gray trailer pools, and chain of custody. Morgan Stanley also forecasts stock implications for freight beneficiaries and entities that face challenges from blockchain. Morgan Stanley thinks that truckload and less-than-truckload carriers stand to benefit from blockchain because they will begin charging customers for assessorials and last minute changes, will be able to source freight directly from shippers without having to pay 3PLs, will get immediate payment settlement instead of waiting for weeks, and will see enhancements in freight security. Blockchain-enabled payment systems should be 200 basis points cheaper than current factoring. But 3PLs could stand to lose big: today logistics providers are paid by both sides to find capacity and demand, regardless of the transaction’s quality, they maintain an ‘in-and-out’ ledger, but have no provenance over the supply chain, and are much more expensive than blockchain-enabled solutions will be. Ultimately, Morgan Stanley claims, blockchain will automate the tasks of 3PLs at a lower cost with more security. Craig Fuller, the Managing Director of BiTA, was not as bearish on 3PLs as Morgan Stanley. Fuller commented, “I actually think the large 3PLs become big beneficiaries because they are able to eliminate armies of people that are not digital. It will hurt their top line and compress their margins on a per-transaction basis, but they will gain a lot of market share over the voice brokers.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"BiTA, Blockchain, Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Paul Hampstead","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-27T21:17:05-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/shipchain-joins-blockchain-in-trucking-allliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/shipchainlogopromo.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain platform provider ShipChain joins transportation blockchain alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"ShipChain, the blockchain platform disrupting the trillion-dollar freight industry, announced its membership in the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA.) In doing so, it also made clear its intention to partner with other major players in the logistics space, like UPS, in order to scale unified transport management as far and wide as possible. At a high level, ShipChain provides a decentralized platform to manage trust and access across the entire international supply chain. It is empowering shippers with tools that provide a level of transparency and security that the industry has never seen before, many of which are found intrinsically in frontier blockchain technology. Using this new system of trust and access management, ShipChain aims to supplant the need for costly and error prone freight brokers. Carriers can simply use the resources on the ShipChain platform to find shipment opportunities, and, in just a few clicks, intelligently route and mobilize their teams. This disruption will not only save stakeholders time and money, but also provide a clearer lens into each step of the process so that no customer is left in the dark. Furthermore, it is eradicating many of the problems around fraud and theft, which costs buyers in the United States over $30 billion annually, by implementing a smart contract that automatically confirms and verifies each and every stage of a shipment’s journey. Gone are the days of entrusting humans to handle information access and reliability. The future of transport is automatic, decentralized, and runs on blockchains, it believes. The team is led by strong industry experts who have accumulated years of experience in and around the world of logistics, as well as building blockchain applications. John Monarch has been a major part of the industry for virtually his entire life. “We’re excited about the technology and the all-star team we’ve assembled to tackle the biggest problems facing the global logistics industry,” said Monarch. “Our alliance and membership with BiTA only further solidifies our commitment to bringing blockchain technology to an industry that sorely needs it” Chief Marketing Officer Brian D. Evans, has tons of experience in distribution and marketing. He is an Inc. 500 Entrepreneur, ranked as one of the top influencers in the world on Forbes, and has spent over 18 years in online advertising having acquired millions of users for various apps over the years. ShipChain rounds out the team with Roger Crook as the Chief of Strategy, who was the Global CEO of DHL Global Forwarding, Freight leading the world’s largest freight forwarding and road freight company, and a management board member of DeutschePost DHL (DHL’s parent company.) They also have managed to recruit an impressive number of influential hands-on advisors to serve on the board. Most notably is the inventor of the infomercial and one of the original Sharks on ABC’s Shark Tank, Kevin Harrington. Harrington has launched over 500 products resulting in more than $5 billion in sales worldwide. Al Pettenato, the current VP of XPO Logistics and previous Senior Vice President of North America of DHL, also sits on the advisory board, bringing with him over 20 years of diverse management experience to add to the team. And last but not least, Steve Schoch, the former CEO/CFO of Miramax, and former CFO of Amgen (#123 on the Fortune 500) who adds one of the brightest financial minds in the world to ShipChain’s advisor team. What is most exciting about ShipChain’s announcement, above and beyond its team and technology, is how they are accelerating the overall vision of BiTA which is to “bring together leading companies in the freight technology industries that have a vested interest in the development of blockchain technology.” With the participation of ShipChain, and other major enterprises in the space, BiTA will be able to create an open forum for the development of blockchain standards and general education for the freight industry. This is an important step in revolutionizing and optimizing the freight industry once and for all.

According to the findings of the study, 65% of shippers and 71% of 3PLs are investing less than 5% of their capital expenditures on digitization and automation. Only 3% of shippers and 3PLs are investing as much as 25%. A lot of (3PLs) look at automation and digitization as a way to separate themselves from the competition, but shippers look at it as a way to improve [customer service],” explained Melissa Hadhazy, associate partner at Infosys Consulting. “While there is a lot of interest in this, it is an area that is not seeing a lot of investment.” The study, the 2018 22nd Annual 3PL Study, was conducted with Penn State’s Smeal College of Business and Penske. The survey was sent to nearly 10,000 people and incorporated additional research from Infosys. Nearly 35% of 3PLs view digitization and automation as critical to maintaining their competitiveness in the industry, but just over 15% of shippers believe the same. Survey respondents also noted decreasing operating costs, increasing efficiencies and visibility, lowering prices or adding value-add services among additional reasons given for adoption of digitization and automation. Infosys identified automation as driver-assisted technologies, vehicle automation and platooning. Digitization was identified as the Internet of Things, digitization of loadboards, virtual supply chain and warehouse robotics. While interest is increasing, investment is not. When asked what is holding back adoption of digitization and automation tools, 25% of 3PLs and 18% of shippers cited uncertainty of return on investment. Lack of funding (13% of 3PLs, 17% of shippers) and competing IT projects (22% of 3PLs and 16% of shippers) were also concerns.     Big data analytics is expected to leap to the top of the list of technologies being utilized with more than 80% of both 3PLs and shippers expecting to utilize it more in the future. Mobile applications and platforms, telematics and warehouse robotics all cracked the 60% threshold. “We’ve been talking about big data analytics for several years, and it has moved from something that is a buzzword to something that companies are looking to [incorporate],” said Hadhazy. Third-party logistics providers were more enthused than shippers about the increasing “Uberization of freight,” but both see connected vehicles as contributing in the future. Blockchain was mentioned by Shanton Wilcox, partner with Infosys Consulting, as a technology that is poised to disrupt 3PLs and shippers, but he noted that the technology remains too new at this point for many to understand how it will impact them. According to the survey, 62% of 3PL respondents and 67% of shippers said they don’t know enough about blockchain at this point to comment. In terms of trust, 2% of 3PLs and 8% of shippers said they don’t trust the technology while 15% of 3PLs and 14% of shippers are waiting to see how it develops. Twenty-one percent of 3PLs view blockchain optimistically or as a game-changing technology. Conversely, shippers are less optimistic, with just 12% saying the same. “The value [of blockchain] is being driven by reducing the time associated with gaining access or visibility to information,” said Wilcox. “Many of us work with point to point visibility, but are losing end to end visibility.” According to Wilcox, blockchain has potential in several areas of the supply chain, including traceability, visibility, regulatory compliance, ethical compliance, customer data, financial monitoring, security and safety of products, environmental sustainability and to eliminate corruption. “Ensuring ethical compliance is really important to shippers…but when you look at what 3PLs are focused on, it’s the safety and security of high-risk products and condition monitoring,” said. Wilcox The development of blockchain standards is important to help “get people over the initial hurdle,” said Wilcox. “I think if [the Blockchain in Transport Alliance] can facilitate that, it will speed up adoption.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"3PL, automation, Autonomous trucks, Blockchain, Digitization, internet of things, load boards, Robotics, Shippers, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Autonomous Vehicles, Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Economics, News, Technology, Warehouse, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-27T12:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/11/22/tmw-electrifies-logistics-execs-with-blockchain-demo","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/TMW_Trimble_CMYK_logo-00000002.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"TMW electrifies logistics execs with blockchain demo","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Over the past two years, the transportation industry has graduated from Blockchain 101 and has become hungry for demonstrations of specific business applications of the technology. Tim Leonard, Executive Vice President of Technology at TMW, has emerged as an industry thought leader on the marriage of blockchain and Big Data. Leonard has a long pedigree in the information technology of trucking and automobiles—he served as the CTO and VP of Information Management at US Xpress before moving to General Motors to run their Big Data strategy. Leonard gave a particularly well-received presentation at the North American Logistics CIO Forum that was held in Austin, TX, from Nov. 7-8, and again at the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) conference in Atlanta the week after that. In Austin, the audience of about 150 executives from companies including JB Hunt, UPS, SAP, Werner, and Project 44 gave Leonard a double standing ovation after his demonstration. Yesterday, Tim Leonard spoke with FreightWaves about what he’s learned about blockchain, data, and educating the industry about new technology. “For the last 26 months, really, I’ve been looking at all different kinds of data sets from Trimble, our parent company—data from across sectors, including construction, agriculture, and geo-spacing,” said Leonard. “What we’ve come to realize is that you can’t just build a blockchain solution in a vacuum—it has to be data-driven or there’s no point. So we’ve been analyzing the data and identifying inefficiencies and problems, and then designing blockchain applications to solve those specific issues. We’ve found that industry participants respond much better to hearing about small, concrete steps they can take to solve real problems than grandiose visions of technological revolutions.” Although streamlining payments has been one of the biggest areas of interest in blockchain—probably because of the widespread public awareness of blockchain-based technologies like cryptocurrencies—Leonard thinks that blockchain solutions can address inefficiencies and create transparency at all stages in the shipping contract. In particular, he’s been sharing with transportation executives his insights into how blockchain can improve commitment management, after analyzing hundreds of thousands of shipments from 400 different companies. Commitment management is a trouble spot for the industry, Leonard says, because over time commits trend downward—carriers rarely get what they’re promised. A shipper might commit to move a certain amount of freight with a specific carrier each week in order to obtain a desirable, discounted price, for example, 5 truckloads from Monday to Friday. In the day-to-day scramble of fleet management, the carrier loses track of how many trucks are leaving each week from that specific shipper. Eventually, the carrier might discover that the shipper has only been providing 3-4 truckloads each week for shipment, and the shipper isn’t really earning his discount. “Blockchain can allow both the shipper and the carrier to see exactly what’s happening with immutable ledgers. They get on the same page, and they can re-negotiate their agreement based on a shared reality of what’s happening, in a more efficient way,” said Leonard. Leonard talked about the dozens—even hundreds—of data elements involved in each agreement between shippers and carriers, and said TMW was breaking them down into 58 ‘swim lanes’, each of which can be further subdivided. Everything from bid management, to freight priority, location, and special requirements can all be separated out and managed on the blockchain, according to the specific needs of the shippers and carriers. Most importantly, though, Leonard said that industry participants, technology companies, and BiTA members need to come together. Blockchain in transportation will be less about individuals inventing solutions and trying to impose them on the industry; instead, shippers, carriers, 3PLs, and tech companies will have to share their data, identify trouble spots that affect everyone, and collaborate on mutually beneficial solutions. “For blockchain to flourish,” Leonard said, “nodes will have to seek out nodes. I can’t create it by myself.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Paul Hampstead","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-22T17:56:32-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/11/21/cargills-blockchain-tells-the-story-of-your-thanksgiving-turkey","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Capture2.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Cargill’s blockchain tells the story of your Thanksgiving turkey","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The power of the blockchain is coming to your Thanksgiving table this year. For years, there has been a growing trend in consumers wanting information about where their food comes from. This year for Thanksgiving, Cargill Inc. is responding by tracking 60,000 of its well-known Honeysuckle White brand turkeys on a blockchain constructed in-house. The turkeys have a six-digit number printed on the label that consumers can type into a Transparency Code box on the website. The site will then return details about the farm where the turkey was raised including information about the farmers and their families. Furthermore, the site will give information about the individual turkey, including what it ate, how long it was at the farm, and where the bird was processed. “We’ve always worked with independent family farmers, which is why we’re such big supporters of the farm to table movement. And now, through our new traceable turkey pilot program, we’re taking it one step further,” states the Honeysuckle White website. In the United States as well as other industrialized nations there has been a strong move toward locally sourced foods and other products and in some cases there has even been suspicion cast upon larger food production firms. Blockchain technology can help large agribusiness producers overcome the idea that their products are inferior to local ones because of their methods of production or miles traveled. For years food suppliers have been attempting to digitize data concerning their products. But it is only now with the power and promise of blockchain technology that growers believe that true transparency and traceability can become a reality. There are four farms participating in the Honeysuckle White blockchain trial program, all in Texas. If the program is successful it could be expanded after the holidays.

AmEx told Reuters that its FX International Payments (FXIP) business has decided to partner with Ripple and Santander to conduct business in real time, allowing non-card payments between the U.S. and Britain. This means that payments routed through AmEx’ clients’ accounts “will now be routed through Ripple’s enterprise blockchain network, RippleNet,” according to CNBC. AmEx’s Executive Vice President and Chief Information, Marc Gordon, said in a statement, “This collaboration with Ripple and Santander represents the next step forward on our blockchain journey, evolving the way we move money around the world.” Santander’s head of global transaction banking, Jose Luis Calderon, echoed this statement. “The blockchain solution opens up a new channel between the U.S. and the U.K. and presents significant opportunity for payments globally.” The collaborative effort that comes with working with financial institutions was a goal realized for Ripple’s CTO and co-founder, Stefan Thomas. During Ripple’s banking and blockchain conference Swell, CTO and co-founder Stefan Thomas explained the concept behind the company and was blunt enough to admit that joining Ripple was borne out of frustration. Thomas’ experience in blockchain traces back to 2010, when Bitcoin was still trending despite rising skepticism. And he admitted slightly leaning towards skepticism. “I remember getting very frustrated going from Bitcoin conference to Bitcoin conference year after year. And there would be a keynote speaker talking about how this year, Bitcoin is going to go mainstream and it never happened.”  It made Thomas think long and hard about how this kind of technology could be made mainstream. He believed in the technology enough to envision how blockchain can actually work. “I wanted to see it [blockchain] realized in practice and actually, you know, real money moving through it, people really using it and having an impact on people’s lives.” This proved to be a self-fulfilling prophecy with the deals with AmEx and Santander in the bag. “What excited me about joining Ripple was this idea of working together with the incumbent financial industry and kind of building something together – making the technology accessible to everybody,” Thomas said.

In the middle of the affairs is the extensive paperwork and red tape that needs to be generated to ship cross-border freight. Quite recently, the industry looks to be receiving the much-needed shot in the arm it needs in the form of technology including digital marketplaces, smart maintenance software, and automation systems. The newest entry to the mix is blockchain. It is a decentralized form of a digital ledger that can improve security, stop illegal smuggling, and more importantly, reduce transit times currently bogged down by bureaucracy. Ninety percent of all goods that cross borders every year are carried through ocean shipping at some point. The procedures involved in such supply chains are quite similar to the ones inland, with some added complexity. The players associated with moving freight cross-border are often multi-modal and far too many – shippers, freight forwarders, brokers, truck fleets, ocean vessel companies, customs officials, and even governments – which increases the occurrences of discrepancies due to manual intervention. Thus blockchain in its capacity as a distributed ledger has the potential to make every player toe the line, with the technology establishing transparency among the key players. IBM and Maersk are working together to create a new blockchain related solution to this situation built over the Hyperledger Fabric platform. The solution, they believe, could vastly reduce the complications involved and also expedite the transit process. This approach tries enveloping the complete transaction by placing all the documents and paperwork involved in a trade deal into a single template-based workflow. Every step along the way is monitored and tracked, with details on where and when documents were submitted being recorded. The blockchain feature makes sure that no party involved in the transaction can singularly modify or delete any document without the express approval of the rest. This is of vital importance since it prevents freight fraud and illegal smuggling of contraband. The pilot test to changing global cross-border supply chain has already been underway. Maersk had freight belonging to Schneider Electric shipped from the Port of Rotterdam to the Port of Newark in New Jersey, using blockchain as a part of an EU research project. “As a global integrator of container logistics with the ambition to digitalize global trade, we are excited about this cooperation and its potential to bring substantial efficiency and productivity gains to global supply chains, while decreasing fraud and increasing security,” said Ibrahim Gokcen, chief digital officer at Maersk. Though envisioning a form of absolute transparency would be out of the reckoning, blockchain could help us get close. Apart from holding the invested parties accountable, it also helps shut down bribes at border clearance inspections and unnecessary freight withholding. Since the system regulates workflows and creates transparency, such practices would slowly phase out. The shipping industry needs committed players like Maersk to bring blockchain into wider prominence. Maersk has gone on record saying it plans to move and track 10 million of its 70 million container shipments through blockchain by the end of this year. For a technologically struggling industry, blockchain could provide a new lease of life. But for the system to succeed, it requires unflinching support from all the parties involved in the shipping trade. The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) is bringing together companies across the transportation landscape to discuss standards and collaboration on the technology. The process might take a while since it involves revamping legacy financial infrastructures that the market is currently used to working with. But then, change is inevitable and the days to a more widespread use of ‘permissioned’ blockchain is indeed approaching.

Payment processes are one area where blockchain is likely to have near-term impact; smart contracts are another. Smart contracts are, in essence, digital contracts that include automatic triggers to execute conditions set forth in the contract. In the case of freight moving through the supply chain, a shipper and carrier may enter an agreement that is executed through a smart contract. That contract may include triggers such as paying the carrier immediately upon successful delivery of the load; making partial payments could be made based on achievements in the contract, such as a certain number of miles traveled; or even penalizing the carrier if conditions are not met such as temperature control or late delivery. Building those smart contracts, though, requires coding, and incorrect code could turn a good deal into a not-so-good deal. To help alleviate that problem, McLeod Software this week introduced FlowLogix Smart Contracts. FlowLogix Smart Contracts turn that code into visual representations and workflow design to help designers and business process owners create the correct contract and test that contract against a blockchain distributed ledger before implementing that contract. “One weakness in smart contracts today is that they are difficult for business process owners to articulate in a way that translates into perfect code, and then for process owners to validate how they work, because they are written in software languages that are hard to understand,” McLeod said. “The McLeod FlowLogix Smart Contracts product will enable McLeod customers, who want to structure, validate, and test their smart contract interaction with the permissioned blockchain distributed ledgers, to do so before they are implemented,” the company added. Using the FlowLogix Smart Contracts enables McLeod customers “to build the logic, data mapping, formatting, business triggers, API’s to the blockchain frameworks, and automated communication mechanisms to meet nearly any required interaction with a smart contract embodied by a permissioned blockchain,” it said. McLeod is part of the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, which is working with industry leading companies to develop blockchain standards. McLeod said that as standards for data definitions, API’s, smart contract structures, and technical architectures are developed, it will build API’s within FlowLogix Smart Contracts to support those standards, allowing customers to build new applications and business process automation solutions to interact with permissioned blockchains. Current users of the McLeod FlowLogix business process automation software will be able to adapt their existing solutions to a permissioned blockchain environment if they choose.

(NASDAQ:YRCW) has joined the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA) to help lead, develop and promote benchmark standards for blockchain applications; the next generation of secure transactions in logistics and supply chain management. BiTA will build the first set of transportation industry-specific blockchain standards by engaging the brightest minds from the most influential leaders in transportation, finance and technolog. “Our decision to join BiTA was two-fold. As supply chain innovators, we want to be in on the ground floor of defining the standards set to become a key component of future global supply chain management. As a company with one of the largest, most comprehensive networks in North America, we see our BiTA membership as a strategic alliance that will increase transparency for our customers and improve their supply chain efficiencies,” explains Justin Hall, YRC Worldwide’s chief customer officer. YRC Worldwide Inc., headquartered in Overland Park, Kan., is the holding company for a portfolio of less-than-truckload (LTL) companies including YRC Freight, YRC Reimer, Holland, Reddaway, and New Penn. Collectively, YRC Worldwide companies have one of the largest, most comprehensive LTL networks in North America with local, regional, national and international capabilities.  BiTA believes blockchain is one of the most significant developments for the industry since the creation of the internet. A Deloitte tweet from May 2017 predicted that 10% of global GDP would be built on top of blockchain applications by 2025. BiTA intends to be the leading blockchain voice for the industry by providing more clarity and standards around blockchain through education and promoting the technology. “We see efficiencies offered in secure blockchain technology as a natural evolution for the transportation \u0026 logistics industry. In this case, it’s evolution by unity. Using blockchain applications, our digital third-party logistics, shippers, YRCW carriers and partners can participate in smart contracts, all with variable physical requirements, financial service-level agreements, insurance structures, network switching, and real-time tracking for end-to-end visibility. We’re already heavily invested in implementing technology that streamlines communication and processes, both internally and for our customers,” says Hall. Simply defined, blockchain securely digitizes transactions. Those within the industry and those who rely on it could benefit if the technology is widely adopted. Companies using blockchain applications could manage shipments more quickly, securely and with greater integrity. Consumers gain automation and precision throughout their supply chain, freeing them up to focus on exception management and incremental improvements. “The real potential in blockchain technology is the built-in trust factor which could revolutionize the types and amount of information sharing between organizations. Our goal is to help define these secure certifications – imagine cryptographic distributed ledgers, data standards around weights and measures, and shipment provenance. And with agreements set, payments are tied to delivery timelines and specifications, improving payer and cash management, while speeding cash flow. I envision a new world order where even the most complex of transactions could be managed with ease and complete transparency,” says Hall. “Blockchain standards and protocols are the technological equivalent of a treaty between nations, opening transparent lines of communication between shippers, brokers, carriers, vendors, other supply chain stakeholders, and consumers. Though widespread adoption will be years in the making, blockchain technology could create a scenario in which those turning their backs on the standards become as extinct as the Pony Express,” explains Hall. Members of BiTA understand that blockchain is the way of the future, an industry changing technology that will revolutionize the way organizations do business. YRC Worldwide sees their alliance with BiTA as an opportunity to usher in this change in a uniform way that will benefit the entire industry.

However, IBM reports supply chain fraud is just as bad. A recent Deloitte survey reveals companies in the United States increased spending in supply chain risk analytics by 35% in 2017. These efforts aim to mitigate fraud and waste. However, the Big Four consulting firms don’t see any reductions in supply chain fraud. In fact, it’s getting worse. Supply Chain Management Review reports over the last 12 months, the consumer and industrial products industries experienced the highest level in fraudulent activity in their supply chains (39.1%). Only the healthcare and life sciences industries reported a decline (26.3% in 2017 from 36.9% in 2016). With the advancement and focus in analytics, one may wonder if these industries really are experiencing higher levels of fraud or if the reported increases can be attributed to better visibility and intelligence. The leading form of fraud in supply chains is financial abuse. Larry Kivett of Deloitte recounts fraud instances in energy and resource supply chains as “rife with bribery, bid rigging, collusion, fraud and other schemes.” He suggests one of the ways supply chain professionals can prevent this is through proper and transparent invoicing. Billing suppliers should be done timely and accurately and require stringent internal approval processes. Deloitte also warns companies that when investigating supply chain fraud, don’t restrict your analysis to third parties and vendors alone. Internal fraud also poses risk to global supply chains. Deloitte’s findings conclude that project managers, invoice approvers and procurement professionals rank among the highest employees at risk for committing supply chain fraud. In fact, internal employees pose the highest levels of risk (22.9%) compared to vendors (17.4%) and third parties (20.1%). One of the leading factors contributing to supply chain fraud and abuse attributes restraints in compliance resources. However, at its core, fraud stems from a lack of transparency. More and more companies look to blockchain as a technology solution for increasing transparency. The peer-to-peer approval network of computing nodes can help prevent fraud in supply chains. Global supply chains are extremely complex. They involve many people, companies, governments and moving parts across international borders. Lots of transactions and activity occurring simultaneously can leave blind spots where fraud can occur. IBM promotes blockchain for supply chain fraud mitigation as it greatly enhances the traceability of products from end user all the way upstream to raw materials suppliers. As products and services are bought and sold throughout the supply chain, documents relating to transactions and the employees that approved them can be recorded in the ledger for compliance professionals to view and audit. Once a transaction is made and recorded as a block, it cannot be tampered with retroactively. While blockchain is not a silver bullet to end supply chain fraud all together, it certainly makes a dramatic improvement on paper tracking and antiquated transaction methods still used today. Blockchain implemented in supply chains will not only reduce the instances of fraud, but also improve the safety of the products we use on a daily basis.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, financial fraud, Technology, Transparency, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-16T14:00:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/11/15/archer-atlantic-global-logistics-trusts-blockchain-joins-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Archerlogopromo.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Archer Atlantic Global Logistics trusts blockchain, joins BiTA","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"In July 1955, when Charles E. Bennett of Florida introduced the resolution in the house that the inscription “In God We Trust” appear on all paper and coin currency, he intended that those four words would serve as a constant reminder that the nation’s political and economic fortunes were tied to its spiritual faith. In 60 years since those words, there have seen many stock market crashes, the dot-com bubble burst, financial crises, Ponzi schemes, and housing crises that have served to erode all our trusts. A man’s word is no longer his bond and as Richie Etwaru ably puts it, “we increasingly start every company and transaction with the automatic subliminal assumption that the counterparty cannot be trusted.” That is the nature of business today. Enter the blockchain, built on distributed technology and proven cryptographic algorithms, it has found a way to codify reputation and trust. This new codification of trust opens new possibilities for how we will be doing business in the future. Nick Darmanchev, CEO of Archer Atlantic Global Logistics, believes that joining BiTA, “provides us with an opportunity to embrace the technology while helping to lay a foundation on which the future applications we build will conform to agreed standards.” This alliance of industry players, coupled with the best minds in finance and technology will no doubt ensure transparency, growth and profitability for the future trucking industry.

Drivers who are forced to wait for hours lose valuable driving time and deliveries are sometimes delayed, causing additional penalties for carriers to absorb. The result is frustrated drivers and higher costs. While detention has been acknowledged as an industry problem, solutions to date are elusive. Even shipping contracts that include detention fees are not always enforced. If a shipper refuses to pay detention, what alternatives does a carrier have? Not many if they want to keep that shipper’s business. In Japan, the country is trying to put an end to such practices. According to the Japan News, the Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry has instituted “standardized contracts” for truck drivers. These contracts are aimed at compensating drivers who are forced to wait for hours when loads are not ready to be picked up, or to ensure drivers are paid when they must load and unload their cargo. Currently, most contracts in Japan include some of these costs, but because they are incorporated into the “freight charges” portion of the bill, many believe drivers are not appropriately compensated. Going forward, all contracts between shippers and carriers will specify related charges as separate items, including a “standby time charge” for drivers forced to wait and specific loading and unloading charges. The belief is that by calling out these charges separately, working conditions will change and wait times shortened as shippers will now have to pay for these items separately. Drivers who are affected by these items, in turn, will see increased compensation. Could a government-backed system work in the U.S.? It’s doubtful the federal government would create such a system, especially with a Republican administration in power that is looking to get rid of government regulations. That leaves it up to industry to solve these issues, which has not happened to this point. In early 2016, DAT conducted a poll on detention and found that 26% of drivers were detained more than 2 hours at least 25% of the time. Thirty percent had that happen at least 50% of the time. In all, only 6% of those polled said they were rarely detained at least 2 hours. That same survey found that 41% of the time, the carrier never collected a fee for that detention, and only 28% collected a fee at least 25% of the time. The problem with detention is “getting the shipper or receiver to acknowledge that they had a problem at the dock,” DAT’s Mark Montague wrote. “Any trucker will tell you that being paid for detention isn’t the goal. The goal is to be loaded and unloaded promptly, so the driver and equipment can be deployed efficiently.” The mandate to require electronic logging devices (ELDs) on Dec. 18, though, is one step closer to making this happen. No longer can a shipper pressure a driver to just “change the log” to cover detention time. The ELD will record those hours regardless, and do so in a digital manner. Combined with software, it can also create a digital roadmap of when the truck arrived at the facility, when it left, and much time it spend in motion, leaving no interpretation of how long the truck was there. “If we can get those delays recognized, they can become part of the negotiation,” Montague said. “Then, in order to get the best rates, the shipper or receiver actually has to do something to mitigate those delays. Freight brokers can take advantage of ELD data to advocate on behalf of the carrier. The most responsive brokers and shippers will win the loyalty of their preferred carriers when capacity becomes scarce again, as it inevitably will.” In addition to ELDs, the hopes of creating a standardized system for charging of detention and other accessorial charges – and of the carrier and driver being properly compensated for these items – is being buoyed by blockchain technology and smart contracts. Smart contracts are digital contracts that can reside on a blockchain. They are executable contracts that include clauses that trigger events, such as payments. The ELD indicates the driver arrives on time for a 2 p.m. pickup, but is not loaded until 4 p.m., that data, inputted automatically into the smart contract, would trigger the penalty and could potentially even deduct that penalty from the shipper’s account, ensuring collection. This would incentivize shippers to meet scheduled loading and unloading times. The smart contract would also protect shippers and brokers. A late-arriving driver could no longer manipulate his paper log to make it appear as those he arrived on time. This data, inputted into the smart contract automatically by the ELD, now would trigger an escape clause in the detention portion of the contract, exempting the shipper from paying detention time.  Built on the blockchain, which does not allow previous blocks or nodes to be changed, these smart contracts become the equivalent of the government-mandated standardized contracts Japan is instituting, without government involvement. By working outside a specific government mandate, the contracts are then customizable to specific situations, allowing carriers and shippers to negotiate their own terms, and once agreed upon, cement them in the contract. As Japan takes a more formal government approach to addressing detention and related issues, it’s technologies like ELDs and blockchain that will likely do the same here in the U.S. Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, Detention, drivers, smart contracts, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Economics, Insights, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-13T16:30:00-05:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/11/13/apex-capital-announces-membership-in-burgeoning-blockchain-in-trucking-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Apex_Logopromo.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Apex Capital announces membership in burgeoning Blockchain in Trucking Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Fort Worth, Texas-based Apex Capital Corp, a freight factoring company serving small to medium-sized trucking companies, proudly announces its membership in the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA).

Often, situations arise where the carriers end up paying for damages that they did not cause. This hassle is ubiquitous and perennial, to a point where fleets have accepted it to be a problem that is inherent in the system and in essence, unsolvable. Enter PEIR (Photo Equipment Interchange Receipt) to the scene – a startup spinoff from parent company TCompanies – that is working on creating a realistic solution to this predicament. Founded by Tom Burke, PEIR helps fleets record photographic evidence at every interchange of consignments over specific points in time, making it irrefutable. “Our application makes a series of images that document an event in real-time, which is also authenticated and unchangeable, with the use of blockchain,” explains Burke. A few years back, Burke was running a successful trucking company with over 350 trucks in his fleet and nine offices across the U.S. Back then, the company had to shell about $180,000 every year in damages as there was no viable way to prove they were not at fault. “In the freight business, client satisfaction is very important. If we were held responsible for those damage bills and if we didn’t pay them, we would stop getting clients,” adds Burke. To create an effective solution, Burke tried employing owner-operators as a part of his fleet. They were made responsible for protecting the company’s brand, but soon he realized that an average owner-operator might not have the passion for guarding the company’s interests as a regular employee would. “Sometimes, they weren’t doing inspections the way they should. Other times, they were from a different country and did not have a clear understanding of what they needed to do or to describe damage at the exit point of a terminal they picked the freight from,” explains Burke. “So, at the end of it, we realized it was about developing a technology that could take pictures and make our stance irrefutable.” Going forward, Burke plans to use blockchain to protect the authenticity of the pictures. “Blockchain can be trusted because if anything was changed in the series of pictures, it would drop out of the sequence and thus be easily traceable,” notes Burke. “We are also transmitting the location and time stamp along with the pictures. So, PEIR is an amazing tool for trucking companies for under a dollar.” PEIR believes its services save fleet companies many hours of paperwork and the need for looking into interchanges that may have registered incoming freight with existing damages. “Not only do we save them time, but we also save them a headache in customer relationships and also repair bills that they may normally be paying because they have to,” adds Burke. Burke calls PEIR a very inexpensive insurance policy. “We don’t just ascertain the condition of the freight, but also the integrity of the seal through the pictures clicked – this can prove when a trucking company showed up at a customer’s door and when the freight was picked up.” Initially, PEIR had started out testing its application at railroad terminals and container depots. The process was tweaked further based on end-user experience and interviews with truckers. “We recently attended the Intermodal Association of North America trade show in Long Beach, where we debuted PEIR,” says Burke. “There was an overwhelming interest in PEIR at the show. A number of people are extremely eager to become our beta-testers before our official launch in early 2018.” The most significant hurdle in the transportation industry was its seeming reluctance in adapting to change. But the situation is improving now, feels Burke. “I have been in this business for 30 years and never has the marketplace been this willing to adopt new technology. We are looking to work on one iteration that will make the product turnkey. And hopefully, we will be widely adopted and used in the industry.” PEIR is looking to scale up its operations across the U.S. and Canada and venture into Mexico once it has established a firm foothold in these countries.

UPS sees the need to create industry standards and protocols to enable blockchain platforms to operate together with established technologies. In the future, blockchain standards and intercompany collaboration will support the logistics strategies that enable UPS customers to participate in global trade and finance. “Blockchain has multiple applications in the logistics industry, especially related to supply chains, insurance, payments, audits and customs brokerage,” said Linda Weakland, UPS director of enterprise architecture and innovation. “The technology has the potential to increase transparency and efficiency among shippers, carriers, brokers, consumers, vendors and other supply chain stakeholders.” UPS, which is investing in capacity and leading operations technologies to build the Smart Logistics Network of the future, views blockchain as a truly disruptive technology that could change many facets of global commerce.  In particular, UPS is exploring blockchain applications in its customs brokerage business. UPS is one of the world’s largest customs brokers, and a key objective of its brokerage strategy is to digitize transactions. Blockchain technology would help by improving transaction accuracy and by replacing existing paper-heavy and manual processes. This will benefit all parties involved in the transactions. Such an application would be highly secure and would generate valuable efficiencies for shippers who rely on UPS for customs brokerage. UPS wants to leverage blockchain technology to facilitate execution and visibility of trusted transactions between UPS, its customers and government customs agencies. Blockchain, a digital database using blocks that are linked and secured by cryptography, can be used to keep record of any information or assets. This includes physical assets, like transportation containers, or virtual assets, like digital currencies. More than 300 companies have applied for membership to BiTA. Now, UPS and Coyote Logistics, a technology-driven, non-asset based truckload freight brokerage company that UPS acquired in 2015, are BiTA members. BiTA explains its mission as the creation of “a forum for promotion, education, and the encouragement to develop and adopt blockchain application standards in the trucking, transportation, and logistics industries.” “We are engaging the brightest minds from the most influential leaders in transportation, finance, and technology,” the organization states on its website. “BiTA will build the first set of transportation industry-specific blockchain standards and promote the most transformative technology since the internet.” The group notes that it will develop standards that “are intended to create a common framework in order to assist members and industry participants with their organization’s decision to develop and adopt blockchain technology.” BiTA believes that blockchain will allow for greater clarity, transparency and trust within the supply chain, but notes that without a common set of standards, those will be lacking among entities.

What if the future of freight was not a mobile app freight broker, but rather a blockchain-enabled digital 3PL? To make it easy to understand how this technology could work, I produced an example: Tech Freight (our broker) and JB Express (our carrier): Tech Freight has a load that is going from Chicago to Dallas. It posts a smart contract load offer on a blockchain enabled load board. Tech Freight has created a very demanding set of requirements for handling this load. In this case, we are dealing with a load of high-value goods. Tech Freight wants instant updates every 15 minutes, from tender to arrival. They are looking for team transit and want to ensure that the carrier has two drivers in the truck- not just one. They require $500k in cargo insurance and $2M in vehicle insurance. JB Express bids on the load for $2000. Instantly, Tech Freight knows that JB Express is qualified to meet their stringent requirements. Tech Freight and JB Express know nothing about each other, but in a blockchain world, they know everything they need to know. JB Express’ carrier underwriting file has been written into the blockchain. Tech Freight has everything they need before the load is tendered and they don’t have to worry about JB Express creating fake carrier paperwork, because it has been validated by the blockchain. Tech Freight has a copy of JB’s Insurance info, Safersys record, operating authority, etc. Tech Freight also knows that JB has an ELD device that is able to transmit location Information in real-time and circle of service information. JB has its own set of requirements. It wants to be paid detention after two hours without having to collect it, fill out forms, or even call in. It wants to be paid a TONU if Tech Freight cancels it and it wants to paid a fuel-advance as soon as the load picks up and paid in full the instant the consignee signs the POD. JB sees that a shipper has posted a load (at this point, they don’t know it’s Tech Freight- they only know that this shipper has a contract that meets BiTA standards and instantly knows what is required of them- no funny business and Tech Freight can NOT change the terms of the contract after it is accepted). JB bids on the load. Tech Freight sees JB’s bid and immediately accepts it. Tech Freight also knows that JB will do everything required because it has been written into the contract, or he will pay a penalty. If JB fails to pick-up on time, not only will Tech Freight know that, but they can also penalize JB immediately financially. If Tech Freight fails to load the truck in time or were to cancel the load after tender, JB would be paid detention or a TONU. As soon as the load is tendered, Tech Freight is notified that JB has accepted it. The load gets assigned to a truck and Tech Freight is notified of what truck number is coming (and because JB is rocking Blockchain- Tech Freight has instant info on the actual driver of the load- not just the company); As soon as the JB’s truck arrives, Tech Freight is notified that he has arrived. It takes 4 hours to get loaded, so JB instantly receives the detention on the load and the 30% cash-advance, the moment the truck leaves the lot. Throughout the process, JB’s ELD device is sending Tech Freight updates every 15 minutes. JB’s truck is running late, so Tech Freight is paid a penalty by JB of $100 for failure to arrive on-time. JB arrives at shipper a few hours late, but it still takes the consignee six-hours to unload the freight. JB is paid 4 hours of detention at $50/hr. As soon as JB gets the POD, they receive payment in full for the load. The assumption to someone that has never studied markets is that this would “destroy“ the freight brokerage industry, but that is not the case at-all. The fact remains that the vast majority of carriers lack the ability to develop their own digital technology and require service providers to build these offerings for them. The likely winners in all this are the digital brokers and 3PLs that have a deep tech stack or are able to ingest this technology into their own systems. They will be required to partner with a number of technology providers, using consistent message protocols and standard. All of these independent disparate companies will be writing universal protocols to a blockchain, where anyone can take advantage of the framework and create their own contracts, using industry-wide accepted standards. We are likely to see a future where different digital 3PLs, shippers, and carriers create different standard smart-contracts, each with its own niche in structure. This is great. This means that the competition for the next generation of brokerage will be less dependent on the personalities and drive of humans and more on the digital 3pl’s ability to engineer blockchain contracts and use machine learning to affect outcomes. The companies that are constructing this future have formed an alliance called the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA) and over 300 companies have applied for membership. Any company that is involved in the freight business are encouraged to join and participate.

For everything else, there’s MasterCard even for blockchain as reported by ZDNet. This opens up new opportunities for merchants and financial institutions alike to apply this technological trend to their own e-commerce-related foray into cloud-based solutions. The kind of blockchain technology that MasterCard has at the moment is especially intended for the business-to-business (B2B) community. The legendary payment platform conducted its own tests for the sake of addressing known issues associated with cross-border payments, speed (when it comes to transaction) and business transparency. MasterCard Labs EVP Ken Moore attributed the feasibility of its version of the blockchain technology to “a solution that is safe, secure, auditable, and easy to scale.” The ideas were sourced from the clientele base that MasterCard has nurtured through the years. “They are able to seamlessly use both our existing and new payment rails based on the needs and requirements of their customers,” Moore explained. MasterCard even prepared a video presentation hosted by its Payment Innovation Manager at MasterCard Labs, Ricardo Sota. Sota detailed how the company created its own version of blockchain and said there is an intent to apply the technology to enterprise-related money transfers. According to Sota, the MasterCard blockchain is a permissioned blockchain, which will allow participants to maintain the distributed ledger without sacrificing scalability or performance.” MasterCard said its main differentiators of its technology versus that of competitors are: These are crucial dealmakers as summed up by MasterCard in one sentence. “Our blockchain technology can be used for clearing in near real-time card payment transactions eliminating consolidation and improving settlement.” MasterCard’s blockchain has been created to solve the need for commercial processing speed. Having a payment network that encompasses 22,000 financial institutions in the MasterCard database alone, several MasterCard users can end up reaping the benefits of a registered cardholder. Sota also elaborated on how MasterCard has opened its API, leaving room for other developers to apply it to non-payment transactions “like proof of purchase or authenticity.” As this technology has become associated with supply chain transactions, the open-door policy might be an opportunity to develop electronic versions of bill of lading, warehouse receipts and other documents used in freight movement. Speed and accuracy are the main selling points that MasterCard has put forward to adapt to the e-commerce community. The company also sees its blockchain technology as a way to boost usage of existing products like virtual cards. The initiative to cloak in MasterCard Send and Vocalink served as a way to address issues over sending money in B2B transactions whether it’s in the blockchain or cross-border. But what got most blockchain enthusiasts is MasterCard’s decision to join the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. As there are still services that MasterCard has yet to offer, its inclusions in the highly-anticipated alliance will help it develop further financial services that are not yet in its portfolio.

Organizations like IBM Blockchain and the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA) are laying the groundwork for the implementation of this technology, which will allow for greatly improved food safety monitoring and product traceability. The timing for this new technology could not be more appropriate as media scrutiny of vulnerabilities in the US food system has intensified. From peanut butter to hamburger patties to fresh produce, the US food chain has experienced several high profile recalls just this year alone. Comprehensive, national recalls are expensive and can be catastrophic for companies’ reputations. However, heightened public awareness isn’t the only reason for more frequent instances of food contamination. The global food production system is more complex, with products coming from around the world than ever before. Through an openly and freely distributed database, blockchain technology provides transparency in records of product movement and ownership that constantly reconciled and verified.

A recording of the conference call be downloaded here. On Sunday, Stifel issued a report outlining its key conclusions from the conversation. BiTA has seen widespread interest from industry players who are keen to hedge against the risks of under-investing in the new technology and being left behind or, alternatively, over-investing and burning cash in the pursuit of a product that might never become commercially viable. Over 260 companies, including 6 of the 10 largest 3PLs, have already applied to join the Alliance. During Friday’s conference call, Fuller and Burruss fielded questions about the advantages of a blockchain-enabled supply chain and inquiries about specific token-based and token-less products. The conversation positioned BiTA as a neutral clearinghouse of information and resources that will help industry participants—whether they are small carriers with weak IT infrastructure or tech startups actively developing blockchain-based logistics solutions—develop a mutually beneficial consensus on how to implement blockchain technology. Larkin’s report summed up blockchain’s relevance to the trucking industry this way: “In simple terms, blockchain technology involves the establishment of a public or private shared accounting ledger, which enables approved participants, across the supply chain, to transact business based on pre-programmed logic that encompasses security measures and contract terms. The theory is that the blockchain enabled supply chain participants will be able to handle transactions, more quickly, more securely, with fewer errors and less labor cost involved in the overall process. Disputes can be automatically arbitrated and, upon satisfaction of smart contract conditions, cash can flow from one party to another however quickly supply chain participants agree that it should.” In their conversation, Fuller and Burruss elaborated on the stubborn, as yet unresolved problems in the freight and trucking industry and why blockchain could be the killer app that it’s been waiting for. Larkin sketched the future landscape of blockchain-powered logistics solutions: “Payments and cash settlements can be handled quickly, efficiently, and without an intermediary, at much lower cost. Big data collected from things (i.e., tractors, trailers, ELD’s, odometers, warranty work, vehicle servicing, etc.) can all be captured in an unalterable format for posterity. EDI or API communications can be handled without an intermediate clearinghouse. Smart contracts will be a central application of blockchain technology to the freight industry: proof of delivery can be electronically recorded; a shipment’s chain of custody will be recorded and distributed in real time as it moves through the supply chain; and contracts can be executed and disputes can be resolved automatically, saving carriers, brokers, receivers, and shippers time, capital, and expense. Imagining a blockchain-driven trucking logistics industry also means imagining how that industry would change, and which players would benefit or be put at a disadvantage by the forthcoming technological revolution. The ‘winners’ are widely distributed across supply chain participants, including end customers who receive their freight more quickly and more precisely, highly-automated 3PLs and 4PLs who are in strong positions to use blockchain to automate their accounting, software providers, trailer and chassis leasing companies, and Tier-1 suppliers. Other groups in the freight and logistics space will be, in Larkin’s wonderful euphemism, “disintermediated.” Supply chain participants who could see their roles automated and eliminated in a blockchain-powered freight industry include receivables factoring companies, voice brokers, and any “shippers, carriers, brokers, and receivers that choose not to comply with BiTA’s industry standard protocols or that choose not to be transparent.” In the conclusion to the Stifel report, Larkin describes the synergy between simultaneous technical advances that he envisions for the trucking industry: “Blockchain will combine with the truckload pricing futures market, with data analytics assisted/artificial intelligence assisted real-time matching of loads and empties (at a non-negotiated but mutually accepted price), and with API enabled real time data interchange to consolidate the bulk of the truck brokerage and 3PL community around a handful of tech savvy, well capitalized, large scale companies.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"BiTA, Blockchain, Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, Stifel, Supply chain, Technology, Transparency, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Paul Hampstead","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-10-30T15:38:42-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/10/29/bitcoin-skeptics-blockchain","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_717621892-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Cryptocurrencies face skepticism despite mounting interest in blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Last month, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a “fraud” and said “it’s worse than tulip bulbs. It won’t end well.” On Monday, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the billionaire Saudi investor, joined the chorus of anti-cryptocurrency skeptics on CNBC’s Squawk Box, predicting that “it’s just going to implode one day. I think this is Enron in the making.” While it comes as no surprise that multinational banking executives and authoritarian political leaders reject the very premise of a currency and payment system they cannot directly supervise, tech thinkers are growing frustrated by this critique for two reasons. The first is that this institutional skepticism often lacks a substantive factual basis—and at their worst, these critiques rely on misinformation. Dimon’s reference to the Dutch Tulipmania that roiled Europe’s first futures markets in 1637 and Prince Alwaleed’s allusion to the biggest case of accounting fraud in recent American history, tend to obscure more than they illuminate. For starters, both the tulip bulb bubble and Enron’s collapse are traceable to the same lack of transparency that cryptocurrencies were created to address. The second reason why tech leaders bristle at the dismissive attitude toward cryptocurrencies is that criticisms like Dimon and Alwaleed’s tend to respond only to the most overheated hype around the technology rather than the more measured claims about what cryptocurrencies and blockchain will actually be useful for. It’s tempting, and easy, for bankers and princelings to ridicule wild prophecies about how Bitcoin and Ethereum will revolutionize all of our most familiar institutions… it just doesn’t advance the conversation, or the public’s understanding of the issues. Adam Ludwin, the founder and CEO of Chain, a provider of blockchain technology to financial institutions, wrote an open letter to Jamie Dimon in response to Dimon’s “fraud” comments. Ludwin admits that cryptocurrencies and the decentralized services they enable come with inherent shortcomings and disadvantages—they’re slower, more expensive, less scalable, and sometimes have worse user experiences—but says that those drawbacks are more than offset by what cryptocurrency users are really after: uncensorable, unstoppable transactions. As Ludwin wrote, “If Bitcoin is capitalism distilled, it’s also a kind of freedom distilled.” By listing the drawbacks of cryptocurrencies, Ludwin is able to clarify the kind of businesses and users who are actually willing to deal with the inconvenience to get the freedom and privacy they want. So, no: Bitcoin will never make sense for most people and most payments, but it has an undeniable advantage for specific applications. The final problem with the unsophisticated dismissal of Bitcoin by figures like Dimon and Alwaleed is that it can end up conflating cryptocurrencies with the underlying blockchain technology, which has many applications that don’t require tokens like Bitcoin at all. Established industries are already developing blockchain tools to better trace food products as they move from farm to processing facility, to harden personal information against identity theft, and to streamline the creation, sharing, and use of medical records. And BiTA, the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, is creating a forum for standards and education for blockchain tools in the freight industry—the first meeting of BiTA’s executive council will take place in November in Atlanta, GA.

John Langley of Penn State University released his 22nd Annual Third-Party Logistics Study, which captures the state of the industry by surveying shipping and logistics professionals worldwide and conducting intensive workshops with industry leaders at Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, CA. The study contains particularly useful findings for understanding the ever-growing role of data and analytics in the shipping and logistics industries and points to new opportunities that have so far been underexploited. Langley’s results shows that shippers and 3PLs will strengthen their collaboration as data services grow in sophistication—the pressing need for acting on vast quantities of real-time data is forcing shippers and 3PLs to move away from transactional relationships into more meaningful partnerships. 81% of shippers using 3PLs agree that 3PLs are contributing to improving services to ultimate customers. And at the same time that shippers are recognizing the value added by robust information technology systems, they are outsourcing those capabilities to their 3PL partners. The 3PL study is especially good at tracking the differences in opinions between the shipping and 3PLs sides of the industry—it’s a way for Langley to identify opportunities for 3PLs to enhance their performance and increase client satisfaction. For instance, while both shippers and 3PLs are in agreement that big data shows the most potential in improving supply chain operations, only 51% of shippers feel that 3PLs communicate well in responding to risks. The obvious implication is that shippers are looking for 3PLs to collaborate more closely on data analytics to help them manage risk. As Langley writes, “Supply chain and logistics executives are increasingly shifting from physical efficiency to data efficiency… Shippers have greater expectations of what they want their logistics providers to accomplish.” Another useful metric calculated by Langley’s annual 3PL study is the so-called “IT Gap”. The IT Gap measures the difference between percentage of shippers who feel that IT capabilities are a necessary element of 3PL expertise and the percentage of shippers who say they are satisfied with their 3PL partners’ IT capabilities. The IT Gap widened this year, with 56% of shippers indicating satisfaction, which dropped somewhat from 65% last year. This could be because shipper expectations have increased as technology has improved or because shippers are seeking enhanced analytical capabilities to help drive more effective supply chain decisions. Shippers are raising their expectations for their 3PL providers at the same time that the shippers’ spending on third party logistics services are relatively flat. The percentage of shippers’ transportation spend managed by 3PLs increased from 53% to 55% over the past year, while the proportion of shippers’ warehousing spend managed by 3PLs decreased slightly from 40% to 39% since last year. Still, the North American 3PL industry has maintained a 3.8% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) from 2010-6. Another discrepancy between shippers and 3PLs over the perceived growth in use of 3PL providers reveals how shippers are leaning on their logistics partners even more than they realize: the study reported that 61% of shippers are increasing their use of outsourced logistics services, compared to a figure of 58% reported last year. However, 83% of 3PL providers said their customers increased their use of outsourced logistics services, compared to 88% last year. Finally, the study points to a massive opportunity for 3PL innovators to educate shippers about information technology and close the IT Gap: blockchain. Langley’s study reveals that 67% of shippers and 62% of 3PLs admit they don’t know enough about blockchain to be able to fairly rate its potential future benefits to their business. This indicates two things—firstly, the industry is maintaining a relatively open mind with regard to blockchain, and secondly, the time is ripe for leading-edge tech firms to step in and teach shippers and 3PLs about the technology that can help solve their most stubborn, intractable problems. Langley sums up the current state of industry interest in blockchain technology: “The study found that about one-third of shippers—36%—are interested in conversations surrounding blockchain and would like 3PLs to bring potential blockchain initiatives to the table; 30% of shippers have no interest in blockchain activities; 19% would like to see 3PLs owning or partnering in blockchain activities; and 15% believe blockchain should be completely independent of 3PLs. If a 3PL is willing to invest proactively in and partner with a blockchain provider, it may be a way to differentiate themselves in the market.” Stay up-to-date with the latest commentary and insights on FreightTech and the impact to the markets by subscribing.","TAGS":"3PL, Blockchain, data, langley, penn state, study, Transparency, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Paul Hampstead","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Insights, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-10-29T13:45:55-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/10/27/stifel-market-fundamentals-strong-partner-up-to-tackle-tech-issues","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/stifellogo.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Stifel: market fundamentals strong; partner up to tackle tech issues","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"STIFEL SEES STRONG MARKET FUNDAMENTALS ACROSS TRANSPORT SECTOR. John Larkin at Stifel Financial Corp. released his Transportation \u0026 Logistics Industry Note yesterday based on his team’s conversations with transportation professionals, service providers, and investors at this week’s ATA conference in Orlando, DAT User conference in Portland, and Armstrong \u0026 Associates 3PL conference in Chicago. We can break down Stifel’s findings into short-, medium-, and long-term outlooks. In the short term, spot market rates remain elevated (20%+), giving carriers an advantage in rate negotiations. Larkin writes that “irregular route truckload carriers have been the first to see the benefits of a tightening supply and demand dynamic.” Stifel expects spot and contract markets to stay high through the middle of 2018—by that time, the capacity eliminated by the full effects of the ELD mandate will force even the most parsimonious shippers to accept higher rates. Those high prices will cause freight to spill over to LTL carriers and intermodal, where they will have disproportionate impacts on rates. Even though GDP growth has accelerated to 3%, Stifel expects transportation companies to outperform the market due to faster revenue growth, expanding margins, and strengthened balance sheets. The stable, strong market fundamentals reported across the industry mean that every company, no matter its debt load, can make moves that will please investors: highly leveraged firms should be able to re-balance their books; optimally leveraged companies can increase share buybacks and dividend growth; and under-leveraged outfits will be able to make acquisitions to build density, add complementary services, and expand geographic coverage. Stifel’s report mentions a number of long term megatrends that will affect the transportation sector—the aging population and the concomitant shrinking of the labor pool, global urbanization, e-commerce, mobile computing, automation of manual and intellectual functions, data analytics, blockchain, and futures markets. Larkin counsels a proactive yet prudent approach to adopting future technology: “stand still and be crushed. Advance the ball too quickly and bleed cash.” In other words, companies who choose to bury their heads in the sand and ignore the industry’s transformations will see their competitiveness evaporate; but there’s also a danger for individual shippers and carriers who invest heavily in unproven technology because they might exhaust their liquidity without ending up with a commerce-ready product. The ‘goldilocks solution’—not too cold, not too hot—for companies facing these new technologies is partnering with outside organizations that can shield companies from the risks of operating on the bleeding edge. This means companies should like at vendors with a proven track record of satisfying clients, industry trade associations, and industry alliances. Larkin specifically mentions BiTA (Blockchain in Trucking Alliance) as a model for industry participants to mitigate their risk of under- or over-investing in new technology and stay abreast of the state of the art.

By some estimates, the industry is over $150B in annual revenues and generates around $50B in gross margins. As much as 20% of for-hire freight is tendered through brokerages and 3PLs. A study done earlier this year by LaneAxis Virtual Freight Management stated that, of the 13 largest publicly traded trucking companies, 42% of their capacity is outsourced to other carriers. Brokerages have a number of advantages. They are not responsible for managing assets or network density; they have limited liability; can pick and choose carriers at will; have very high returns of capital; and don’t have to deal with retaining or recruiting of drivers. The larger firms have strong engineering and quantitative teams that build offerings that enable shippers to operate more efficiently, with fewer disruptions. The 3PLs have one glaring disadvantage over the asset-based carriers and this is in the world of trailer pools. Trailer pools are a group of trailers that an asset-based carrier drops at shipper docks, allowing the loading and unloading to happen without the driver present. This enables the shipper to enjoy flexibility in loading and unloading without tying up a driver or congesting a yard with impatient drivers. It also mitigates the detention spending that shippers pay out for tying up the same drivers. Fleets enjoy trailer pools because they can keep their drivers generating loaded miles, making the driver and fleet CFOs happy. In an ELD environment, drop-and-hook freight will be much more valuable in the market. Carriers that have a large concentration of drop-and-hook freight will end up having better utilization records and will likely keep drivers longer. Any time that is spent tied up at docks will mitigate the amount of paid miles that a driver and truck can generate, so this freight will become less desirable for large commercial fleets, and will likely go for a premium. Detention is likely to be enforced to a much greater degree in the future as carriers get smarter about enforcement and collections. In 2015, executives from Swift told FreightWaves they generated $600 per truck per year in detention collections. This number is in range of what other carriers reported to us. The cash hits the bottom line, but this enforcement and collection process also creates a level of accountability and hopefully becomes correct shipper behavior in the future. 3PLs that have managed shipper freight on a committed business have been partnering with asset-based carriers, using their trailer pools in contract lanes. In the future we are likely to see trailer pools pop up in the spot freight market. Imagine if C.H. Robinson or Coyote were to add trailers to their irregular route freight, offering drivers in the OTR spot market trailers they can shuttle between shippers. Their freight network and density dwarfs most of the asset-based carriers, ensuring turns of the equipment and high-quality preloaded freight. Maybe DAT will create a trailer pool load board or a digital broker will partner with a trailer leasing company, using a blockchain payment clearing and tracking solution to ensure tracking, liability, or payments. The “grey trailer pool” is certainly on the agenda of BiTA’s November 16 meeting in Atlanta. Maybe it’s no coincidence that 6 of the top 10 freight brokers will be present. One of the things that the FreightWaves team has spent time thinking about is that the digital brokers have very little moats around their business because they don’t control capacity. Imagine a day where owner-operators went strictly power only and were using a shared pool of trailers to haul freight for a specific digital broker or a few. In the future, truck capacity may look a lot like the intermodal market. Spot carriers will operate in power-only lanes, while the trailer assets will be pooled through some clearing and posting system.

It’s not something they have seen yet, and it’s not something that anyone can buy – yet. That is quickly changing as evidenced by the interest in the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA). BiTA says that since its launch in September, more than 200 companies have expressed interest in joining the group which seeks to promote standards and education around blockchain in the transportation space. One of those companies that did join is TMW Systems, which itself is building blockchain-enabled software. Blockchain is a “peer-to-peer electronic system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party,” according to a slide that Timothy Leonard, EVP \u0026 CTO of TMW Systems, showed during a media briefing on TMW’s efforts Friday afternoon. One thing blockchain is not, Leonard says, is Bitcoin, although they are often confused. Blockchain is the technology that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum trade upon. Some have compared blockchain to the internet in the way that the World Wide Web allowed information and data to move from one person to the next through the use of websites. During the presentation, Leonard noted that TMW has been working on blockchain projects for 9 months or so and hopes to have a couple of blockchain-based products on the market sometime in 2018. But while blockchain can be an impressive technology, Leonard believes the real value is in what it brings to businesses. “A lot of individuals are talking about the technology, which is very good, but what they are leaving out is the business side of it,” he said. Leonard provide a slide that showed the evolution of information systems in the trucking space. It includes the transition from EDI-based systems to the current standard of API. “One of the things that EDI and API have not done is build that trust [between parties],” he said. “The blockchain has started putting back in what has disappeared in the past 20 years and that is the relationship between carrier and shipper.” Leonard explained that a blockchain is a ledger system – similar to a database – that connects transactions while providing for a distributed system in which no single authority owns the network or controls the transactions. For instance, TMW offers its Engage.Bid platform, which allows for shippers to upload an RFP and carriers to bid on that process. That platform builds off its Bid platform launched about 8 months earlier. Leonard sees this system being on a TMW blockchain at some point, perhaps by next year. Even though TMW would host the chain, it would not own the chain, and would only serve to track the contract as it moves through the process. It would not be involved in the process of actually moving the cargo. In this way, the blockchain provides levels of security and trust. As the blockchain monitors the transactions, it cross checks each transaction against known rules and regulations, such as federal rules governing commerce, and once those requirements are met, the transaction block moves along the chain. “That process of getting Bid out there allowed us to start working on blockchain,” Leonard said. Blockchains will also feature smart contracts that execute automatically. This helps speed up the entire process, from the time an order is placed to carrier payment. TMW is already running tests of its blockchain programs with select carriers. “We believe we’ve cut down to 7 days from 21 days” the time it takes to execute a transaction, Leonard noted. He added that carriers could be paid almost immediately through smart contracts and blockchain. Currently, TMW is working in three areas when it comes to blockchain: RFP, bids and awards; EDI transactions; and parts warranty and vehicle service records. Areas of future blockchain work will likely include HOS, fuel tax and analytics; temperature monitoring and reviews (through third party integrations); invoice and settlements; proof-of-delivery (including imaging products); and GPS and sensor data from vehicles and the Internet of Things. Just in the RFP process, Leonard said TMW looked approximately 100 customers and 98% of them were using some form of manual processes. He believes that by putting all of these processes on the blockchain, TMW can get payment time down to 24 to 40 hours. To illustrate how blockchain works, Leonard provided two examples. The first is a simple location update structure. In this scenario, a dispatcher could make a manual check call to a driver and input that information in a TMS system (blockchains are not dependent on specific TMS systems, Leonard said, so parties do not need the same systems). Also, the truck, using GPS data, could automatically send in its own check call. Either process – or both – enter the blockchain which builds a “block” each time a check call is made. Those blocks are added to the overall chain, which sends the information along to everyone on the chain, including the shipper and broker who now know the location of the vehicle. In the second, more complicated scenario, a shipper has a load to move. This process would take 8 steps to complete and may involve dozens of parties. The shipper would upload their RFP to the blockchain using their “public key,” which is equivalent to a passcode. Each party in a transaction would need to know the key to view the blockchain. Carriers would receive the block with that RFP and decide whether to make a bid for the contract. All carriers interested create their bids and submit them to the chain. Each carrier would also have their own private key. The shipper is notified that bids have been submitted, it picks one and the carrier accepts the bid. In a larger blockchain, that record of transactions would continue to include pickup, transit and delivery information for the load as well as anything that occurs en route. Using the smart contract, a carrier is automatically paid once the blockchain verifies all conditions of the delivery have been met. Leonard noted that incorporating this process with load boards that handle 500,000 transactions a week could save the industry between $60 and $80 million in costs. “It would allow more freight to move and to move quicker with fewer people,” he said. Further enhancements could incorporate things like weather data and traffic data or other social data into the blockchain to improve operations. Leonard added that the benefits of using blockchain in transportation include improved visibility within the supply chain and a reduction of unwanted inventory and costs as a result; faster payment processes; accountability; and record provenance that includes encrypted transactions that are logged and verified. TMW is working on a contracted truck services platform now that ties into its Bid platform and hopes to have its first blockchain product in the market sometime next year.

The ASU will affect all companies that engage in leasing activity, including those in transportation. It requires companies to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by lease contracts. Today, a leased asset and lease liability are off-balance sheets. When the Update comes into effect, the company will have to record any leased asset or obligation with a greater term than 12 months. It hopes to clarify accounting and give a more accurate picture of the long-term financial obligations. PWC highlighted the key areas where this could impact your business. First is losing the benefit of off-balance-sheet financing for operating leases. Second, all outstanding leases will now come on the balance sheet, and third, the new assets recognized for operating leases will change companies’ book/tax difference computations. The full detailed report is available on PWC’s website. Digitalisation of accounting methods is immature compared to other industries where technology has caused extensive disruption. One of the main reasons for this is the level of high regulation validity and integrity in accounting practices. As a result, it remains a heavily labor-intensive process, however, blockchain could hold the answer. Blockchain allows consumers and suppliers to connect directly, removing the need for a third party. Using cryptography to keep exchanges secure, blockchain provides a decentralized database, or digital ledger, of transactions that every user in the network can see. A key benefit of a blockchain network is that it establishes a shared, secure record of information where each piece of information can be verified, offering a highly integrated data chain:  Smart contracts are arguably the most valuable feature of blockchain technology, with the potential to digitize a number of the processes for contracted agreements. A recent pilot program between DocuSign and Visa used blockchain to introduce greater speed and automation to the car-leasing process. Ron Hirson, head of product at DocuSign, tells RTInsights: “With smart contracts, we are able to create self-executing contractual states, stored on the blockchain as a public ledger, which can act based on information or events from other systems, while keeping the data durable and reliable. The shared ledger can record signatures and agreements that can be validated on the blockchain. Smart contracts like this could be used in financial services, the public sector, healthcare, or legal proceedings” Given the characteristics of blockchain, it is likely that new practices will emerge as a result. Take, for example, innovative collaborations where blockchain is being used to track and share information, IBM has teamed up with large food suppliers to track contaminants in the global supply chain. Such applications also apply to the freight industry; business transactions surrounding the shipment of freight are likely to become automated using blockchain-based technology. Smart leases are another emerging entry. Deloitte’s new report lays focus on the use of blockchain in the real estate industry and, in particular, how the use of blockchain will revolutionize the leasing market. The report explains a number of key opportunities with blockchain technology. To drive efficiency and accuracy in the due diligence process, enable easier, transparent, and efficient management of property and cash flows, enhance data quality and also enable real-time recording and retrieval. Blockchain offers a number of opportunities within freight management, likely to drive efficiency and move toward more efficient cash management. Pay per mile insurance coverage is a new concept that has gained attention (See Metromile); when it comes to fleet management, benefits from the accuracy of pay per mile structures could emerge. Take, for example, OEMs leasing vehicles out to fleets and charging them on a per mile basis rather than capturing the full brunt of the up-front cost. This would stabilize the earnings of the fleet because it wouldn’t be paying for assets that are not generating revenue. Furthermore, fleet operators may be encouraged to compete on a per mile basis, increasing transparency of the competition. It could transform the way fleets and leasing companies capture the real-time value of capital resulting in more efficient resource use for all.

Blockchain, a ledger of records arranged in data blocks, uses cryptographic validation to link themselves together, resembling an unending chain. Since blockchain has the ability to sweep away intermediary banks and facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions between users, the technology is disrupting the way FinTech market works. With the technology looking to be a mainstay in the future of finance, the number of jobs related to blockchain has surged in recent times. Data derived from LinkedIn shows that over a thousand jobs are being posted every week in the field of blockchain, which is more than triple the number last year. There has been a steady growth of jobs in the blockchain industry, having a 40% increase every four months. The idea of blockchain has struck a chord in different domains as Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) are being offered across various niches, which has accounted for $2.3 billion funding overall, with a sizeable chunk happening this year. With so much activity in the field of cryptocurrency, it is why large investment banks have started investing in blockchain. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Barclays, Credit Suisse, and Royal Bank of Scotland are some of the major companies investing heavily in the technology, in the hope of it creating use cases around securities settlement and safer payment possibilities. Blockchain jobs have spiked over the last year, as explained by Financial Times, which reports that experienced blockchain engineers could command a salary of over $250,000. “It is on the high side of what a really talented consultant or software engineer can earn,” says Jerry Cuomo, IBM vice-president of blockchain technologies. “Demand is exceeding supply, so we are seeing shortages. It is up there with the cloud and artificial intelligence as a really hot area.” Since blockchain’s core competency lies in cryptography and machine learning, AI experts could also be brought into the fray. The demand for blockchain is growing, as technology startups, finance companies, and insurance giants look to hire engineers with relevant experience. The Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) is another reason for companies to rush into creating teams working exclusively on blockchain. With a technology that is being touted as the new Gold Rush and having an obscure but promising future in the cards, major technology giants are competing against each other on hiring the best talent in the market. A McKinsey report suggests that blockchain technology is here to stay, with it predicting steady growth in the technology over the next few years, leading to the emergence of new service providers and business models. By 2025, it envisions a world which would have adopted blockchain into mainstream transactions with blockchain developers being the frontrunners of the new-world banking system.

Cutting-edge technological ideas have been mushrooming in the freight hauling space, with major corporations and startups tussling for a share in the market. The freight economy is one of the largest markets in the United States, with over $700 billion in revenue every year and employing 8.7 million people in the industry. This provides an incentive for companies to cash in and it was inevitable that technology would be adapted to fit the market needs. And here we stand at the crossroads of innovation, with the impact of technology felt in different micro-niches in the industry – as we try shining some light on the niches with considerable potential, looking to change the facade of freight hauling forever. Running machine-learning models on the road has been of perennial interest to auto manufacturers around the world, and the race is tightening its screws on long-haul freight trucks, with autonomous driving being the market’s niche vertical. One of the underlying reasons for the trucking industry to look at autonomous hauling is the inherent difficulty the market is facing in recruiting new drivers and even in retaining the existing ones. Obtaining an interstate CDL license is not possible until a person hits 21, forcing a lot of aspiring young drivers to look at different paths after high school. The lopsided equation on the supply and demand of truckers essentially drives up labor costs which escalates friction on the economics front – with one-third of the hauling costs being accounted for by the driving community. But with Silicon Valley’s fascination towards AI and on big data collected from millions of miles of truck transits, it is possible to supplement drivers with intelligent bots. Decacorn companies like Google, Uber, Daimler, and Volvo are actively working and investing in the autonomous driving niche. Though obtaining licenses to run a complete end-to-end 360-degree automated freight hauling service is still not in the foreseeable future, assistive decision-making algorithms are here to stay. For example, Otto’s cruising mode can take some steam off drivers while on the road, with trucks having the ability to drive themselves for hours without intervention. The idea of platooning where trucks are made to trail behind each other to reduce fuel consumption is going a long way in making the industry more resource efficient. Electric auto-giant Tesla is working on furthering the pursuit of an energy-efficient and a greener future through its electric self-driving trucks. Tesla is currently developing its prototype and plans to create a fleet of trucks that can platoon themselves on transit. The company argues that techniques like these reduce drag and power consumption considerably during long-haul interstate freight hauls since trucks have the liberty to travel at uniform speeds and against minimal traffic. Tesla’s research on increasing battery capacity could go a long way in ushering in a new-age of electric freight transport. Morgan Stanley predicts that with all the freight intelligence and assistive technology, the cost of operating an electric truck could be 70% cheaper than a diesel-powered truck, making it a fascinating prospect. The autonomous driving technology, albeit with exciting potential, is not devoid of some apprehension. Safety of freight trucks on the road is a never-ending concern to the general public, since in the event of an accident it becomes difficult to assign responsibility. Nonetheless, with technology, persistence is crucial, and with improved models and a lot more data analysis, we should hope to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Blockchain technology burst into prominence with the advent of Bitcoin a few years ago, and there has been no looking back since. Storing information in blocks across a shared digital network makes the system incorruptible and thus paves the way for safely encrypted transactions, shipment tracking, and fleet management across the freight industry. Blockchain’s potential when coupled with the might of the trucking industry implies that it can tackle the most significant challenges in logistics and fleet management, bringing in a more efficient and transparent process. The Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA), is a coalition looking to lobby for an extensive adoption of blockchain in the industry. The organization is seeking to improve the conditions for all the players in the market – through instant payment upon delivery, record maintenance, and setting up a framework for tackling disputes over quality claims and safety issues. Since announcing the formation of the Alliance in August, the organization has received more than 200 corporate applications to join, with 85% of the trucking transactions accounted for in the group by at least one member institution. Though the technology is sound, problems arise with the feasibility of market penetration. The conventional freight industry has been conservative and slow on adopting new practices, which makes it necessary for industry leaders to create a conducive environment for the trucking fraternity to learn about blockchain. “By using blockchain, the industry can reinvent the very nature of a commercial activity,” says Craig Fuller, the co-founder of BiTA. “They can provide real-time settlement, tracking, and chain of custody without fraud and ownership by a single party.” Blockchain is about digitizing an industry that has been in the shackles of manual logs, paperwork, and physical transactions, and is the silver bullet to sustaining growth in the freight market. Finding investors is a cause for concern because of the skepticism in adoption rates, but there has been significant progress over the last year, with the community waking up to the idea of blockchain. The Hyperloop project has been creating waves in the transportation industry for over a year, primarily because of its affiliation to Elon Musk. Looking at a skeletal model of hyperloop after removing all the technical jargon tells us this – it is a highly pressurized tube that can push freight at about 700 miles an hour, which makes it one of the most ambitious projects of our time. Though the idea sounds captivating, adopting hyperloop into mainstream freight hauling might take at least a decade to materialize, due to the extent of infrastructure that needs to be constructed on the ground. Micro-level experimentation of the hyperloop tube is already underway, with it having a fair share of critics, who have been divided between elation and a lukewarm response towards its progress. Backers of hyperloop programs advocate that its realization would make it the most fuel-efficient means of transportation, but the expenses incurred in building the infrastructure might still keep it quite out of reach to an average shipper. The way forward is to make sure the government takes interest in this and foots the bill, along with private investors looking to share the risks of such a mega-construction project. Incidentally, the Virgin group has joined hands with Hyperloop One, bringing in a sizable amount of finance with it. This could help in bringing the system from being on paper to being realized on the ground. But then again, hyperloop for freight might still need some viability analysis because of the constraints it poses on both the technical and business fronts. Mathematician Alon Levy argues that heavy freight that is currently being transported by rail would not be feasible for the hyperloop because the lateral force it generates on curves would overstress the system’s proposed light elevated pylons. That being said, hyperloop does have a role to play in connecting cities of the future, and should consequently work on freight supply chains. Until then, the world needs to make do with High-Speed Rail (HSR) networks that a lot of Asian and European governments have invested in and find to be economically viable as well. Drones have been around for quite some time now, with them being widely used in photography, monitoring, and search \u0026 rescue operations. But with companies like Amazon and UPS investing heavily on drone fleets for cargo delivery, the idea has taken a new meaning for freight transportation. Over the last year, Amazon has commenced drone delivery trials in the United Kingdom for its Prime Air feature, through which customers get their items delivered straight to their houses with the help of drones. Cargo drones open up an entirely new line of work, with companies needing drone operators who are experienced with unmanned flight testing to control the delivery drones. With the technology that is present now, it is far-fetched to think about heavy hauling through drones in the near future, but one can surely anticipate weightless house items to be delivered through such services. Amazon is extremely motivated by the idea of cargo drones, especially because it shaves off a considerable amount on the delivery times. The e-commerce giant has recently patented a futuristic drone delivery center that resembles a beehive, with drones flying in and out of the landing pads across the facility. Natilus, an aerospace drone startup working on hauling larger loads through the air, is confident of reducing air freight costs by half to that of a Boeing 747. The drones that the startup develops can work outside of FAA airspace certification, which in essence means that regulations are not an issue, drastically reducing haul rates. Though the freight industry has been sluggish in adapting to change, it is vital to adopt technology to sustain the exploding growth. With commerce across the U.S. border at an all-time high, it is these technological advancements that can help the industry propel itself to considerable heights in the future.

Blockchain guarantees accuracy and integrity of globally shared databases that are maintained by its users. Paper Transport, Inc. choose BiTA because of the alliance’s commitment to building a standard communication framework for the next generation of logistics providers. Paper Transport is a De Pere, WI-based carrier with over 700 professional drivers focusing on regional truckload service, dedicated operations and intermodal services. The company has terminals in Green Bay, WI; Jacksonville, FL; Cedar Springs, GA; Albany, GA; Atlanta, GA; Savannah, GA; Sturtevant, WI; Muskogee, OK; Dayton, OH; and Pontoon Beach, IL.  Transportation has been communicating on a standard that was drafted in the 1970’s. Technological innovations, consumer expectations, and government regulation have created new pressures to which the industry must learn to adapt. Current communication channels are built with specialized programmers or costly third party intermediaries. Workflows have been created outside of the standard pathways to facilitate customer specific payment processes. Yard checks, RFPs, bids, lane definition, and location information are all maintained in database silos. Successful logistics requires timely, accurate information accessible to every party involved. Automation and seamless communication standards are essential for the industry to remain relevant. Blockchain will provide significant efficiencies for all members of the supply chain. BiTA provides an opportunity for the industry to collaborate and evolve the way the industry communicates. The low margin nature of the industry demands communication flows to be de-centralized and non-monetized. The onus of data ownership will be placed on each member contributing to the Blockchain. Each carrier will benefit and contribute to the Blockchain as it will be the only way to conduct business. “Paper Transport, Inc. welcomes these challenges and is excited to join BiTA in their effort to democratize the data that drives our industry,” said Peter Covach, Director of IT at Paper Transport, Inc. “Our business is fueled with metrics, contracts, portals, and endless sources of inconsistent data all of which can benefit from Blockchain technology.”","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, Paper Transport, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Intermodal, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-10-17T14:33:27-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/10/16/digitization-is-giving-rise-to-the-4pl","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/4PLshutterstock-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Digitization is giving rise to the 4PL","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The increasing digitization of freight transportation is opening the door to a new kind of management company within the supply chain: the 4PL. Third-party logistics (3PL) providers have been successfully managing companies’ operations for years. But with new data streams and technologies such as blockchain that will allow disparate systems to operate in a single, unified and trusted chain, the rise of the 4PL may be upon the industry. What is a 4PL? According to Penske Logistics, a 4PL, sometimes referred to as a lead logistics provider (LLP), “assume(s) many of the same roles as third-party logistics (3PL) providers, but have much broader responsibility and accountability in helping the customer reach its strategic goals.” “Accountability and control help differentiate a 3PL from a 4PL,” explained Andy Moses, senior vice president of global products for Penske Logistics, in a blog post. “As a 4PL, we become a trusted advisor, and the customer becomes reliant on our data to drive them forward.” The introduction of 4PLs are not new – they have been around for some time – but their mainstream use is growing, due in large part to advances in technology. Previously, different software systems and goals made it difficult for one party to control an entire supply chain. That is changing. “Will truck makers become transport managers? And will shippers become 4PL providers? Will digitalization lead to a tectonic shift in the balance of power and reset the interrelationships in logistics?” asks Frauke Heistermann, chief digitalization officer for Siemens Postal, Parcel \u0026 Airport Logistics GmbH, in a new AXIT white paper on the subject. “That’s a safe bet, since the time seems ripe for a new (or newly appreciated) business model: Only a few years ago, 4PL providers still occupied a mere niche market in the shadow of the big logistics companies. Today, potential new players in this segment are finding a new and promising approach for their idea in the tools offered by cloud-based platforms and transport management solutions.” In the near future, Heistermann suggests a 4PL will be able to monitor data for all parties involved – shipments, tracking, documents, freight costs, customs, dangerous goods, transport packaging, transit times, schedules, telematics and sensor data, pallet and container data, even data specific to real-time monitoring of the supply chain such traffic, weather, labor strikes, and environmental disasters. “The new 4PL providers can conquer the market using the power of modern IT while exposing themselves to only minor risk. The software required to manage all the various stakeholders was once a barrier, but all that has changed: Register, customize, and you’re good to go – including end-to-end visibility,” Heistermann says. Heistermann surmises that more 4PLs will enter the market as software advances have lowered the bar for entrance, but the industry will also see more logistics departments leverage their expertise and become 4PLs in their own right. “For many, [logistics] serves as a tool for customer retention and customer satisfaction, and its importance is enhanced by service factors such as quality and reliability,” she says. “Logistics is also a major cost factor, however, special trips, costly express deliveries, wasted resources, and excessive complexity drive up expenses. The question for shippers, then, is whether they wish to build up or expand their own logistics expertise or instead outsource it to partners such as 4PL providers.” And it is data and the expanding use of technology that will drive this trend. “The integration of various partners, which used to take weeks or even months, is no longer such a daunting task thanks to today’s integration tools. Trucks, pallets, containers, and the like – equipped with strong and sophisticated sensor technology – will someday actually report proactively and share their data without the need for any integration and without requiring any specific systems or people,” the paper notes. The Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA) believes that blockchain technology will be the backbone of connecting various systems and partners in the supply chain. As more data flows, and as 4PLs prosper, it is likely they will benefit from this technology to connect everyone involved. While not addressing blockchain specifically, Heistermann describes one of the possible scenarios blockchain could being used for. “Truck manufacturers are equipping their vehicles with smart telematics, sensors, and software,” she writes. “This will eventually allow them to offer their own transport capacities and compete in the traditional carrier marketplace. Shipping systems and trucks will then communicate directly about shipping demand and transport capacity without the need for carriers as the middlemen. The smart systems work together to automatically suggest free capacities that meet the needs of the shipper. Rating portals and user communities bring transparency to the quality of service so that this factor can be taken into account in the selection process.” Heistermann goes on to suggest that truck makers may become the carriers themselves with the 4PL handling everything else. She notes that 4PLs could reduce risk, waste, complexity and improve the overall environmental profile of moving freight through more effective end-to-end management. “What was once a black box that kept shippers from managing their entire supply chain is now filled with state-of-the-art software offering end-to-end visibility,” the paper concludes.","TAGS":"4PL, logistics, Supply chain disruption, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-10-16T15:07:33-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/bitcoins-rise-and-what-it-means","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/shutterstock_547062154-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"What triggered Bitcoin’s meteoric rise up the cryptocurrency ladder and what it means for logistics","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"To an average investor, the phenomenon of Bitcoin is nothing short of inexplicable. Just a month back, a significant ripple was felt through the Bitcoin system after China cracked down on cryptocurrency and Wall Street echoed in appreciation with J.P. Morgan’s CEO calling the virtual currency fraudulent. Though it led to a cascading effect with nearly 20% of its value being wiped out in a matter of a few days, the virtual currency is seeing bullish highs now – completely going against the tide, when analysts were predicting a drawn-out demise. To understand the way Bitcoin’s market works, we would have to understand the macroeconomics behind it and the reason why traditional banking institutions are squeamish to the technology that drives it. Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer form of currency, which means that no central bank or a government would have control over how the market functions – thereby placing them at great risk of getting their physical currencies destabilized. Right from the nascent stages of Bitcoin back in the late 2000s, the market has been represented predominantly by the US dollar and then by the Chinese yuan. In fact, the yuan represented nearly 96% of all bitcoin tradings in 2016, until the clampdown by the authorities last month. But post the Chinese debacle, Bitcoin investors have simply moved to the Japanese yen for transactions, with it accounting for 51% of the current market and having $30.3 billion in transactions last month. This is because the Japanese government has far friendlier legislation in place with regard to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s liquidity helped it to shift to the yen quickly, with minimal flutter. The virtual currency’s value has hit new highs, with it being expected to reach $6,000 soon. But investors are looking for red flags with two planned hard forks coming up within a month. Nonetheless, previous hard forks have been anything but a cause for worry, with Bitcoin Cash being a product of one such hard fork – which ended up helping the cause of Bitcoin as prices surged post-fork. With Bitcoin showing the market that it can survive pitfalls and is not just a fair-weather investment, the interest on cryptocurrencies has multiplied ever since. Over the last year, various ICOs catering to specific niches have arisen, signaling the potential support for such projects. The challenge has been that many of the ICO use cases have been poorly designed or not viable in a real-world setting. At worst, they were downright scams. But the interest and enthusiasm shown by both investors and developers demonstrates the power of the technology. The technology has moved from crypto cult status to solving real-world problems. According to CB Insights, 250 ICOs have taken place since 2016. In the US trucking market, only one ICO has been attempted (SLOGN) and one is in pre-ICO status (DOFT). SLOGN failed to raise enough capital in its ICO to meet its threshold and returned the money back to the investors. DOFT has been trying to raise funds in a pre-ICO, but in the two weeks since the pre-ICO went live, the firm has only raised a few thousand dollars, far short of the millions it hopes to do. Regardless of the successes, or lack there, blockchain is coming to the trucking industry. In September, the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA) was formed to develop standards for the freight industry. It describes itself as the “forum for the advancement of the blockchain in transportation.” The think tank is not floating an ICO and is not directly developing blockchain applications. It’s mission is to bring together commercial firms that are interested in doing so, develop standards and design applications. Since announcing the launch, BiTA has received over 200 applications from across the industry. The firm says that 85% of the trucking transactions can be represented by at least one member. Craig Fuller, co-founder of BiTA said one of the goals is to separate the speculative applications with ones that can achieve actual commercial outcomes. “We have some of the leading firms as members of BiTA and they understand the power of the technology. A successful blockchain implementation will require industry collaboration from a multitude of parties and getting endorsement from a number of large firms goes a long-way in achieving commercial success.” The industry is very fragmented, sporting more than 200,000 firms. This makes it difficult to achieve scale from one-off acquisition, you need a lot of transactions and users to create a viable application. While the industry itself is fragmented, the power actually resides in the hands of a number of very large technology vendors in the space. Their acceptance and endorsement of a technology is much more likely to result in traction. Trucking companies and 3PLs tend to use a lot of outsourced technology for their operations. They are dependent upon these vendors to help them innovate and create new business models. And some of these companies are massive in terms of scale and importance. The Alliance lists a roster of who’s who in trucking technology. Going down the list, it is obvious to see how blockchain could be successful with the roster of power-players. The bill of lading (BOL) is required for every shipment and essentially governs the terms of the shipment. To properly bill, a trucking company is required to submit a copy of the BOL and proof-of delivery (POD) to the shipper for settlement. The majority of these documents are imaged and indexed. Transflo is the power behind this. They have an estimated 55% of document imaging market-share. Kleinschmidt is another name not many folks know, but its influence over the industry is massive. An estimated 75% of all trucking transactions hit its servers at some point in the life-cycle. TMW and McLeod, the two largest software vendors in the space, provide the core operating software for over 60% of the for-hire trucks in the market. BigRoad, a subsidiary of Fleet Complete has over 100,000 trucks in its ELD offering. And Triumph Business Capital is a monster. They are the largest factoring company in the space, financing billions of dollars worth of working capital. “Trucking is not an industry that one can go-it-alone. Partners are critical. The space is massive, but the people in it are not naive. They won’t adopt a technology unless others in the industry agree to do so and they want these solutions to be integrated into their backend. Because of the scale of our members, they hold a lot of power to help innovative companies and applications take off,” Fuller stated.

For the uninitiated, systems built on cryptocurrency can be unfathomably complex, with confusion exacerbated by their constantly changing nature. Unfortunately, in the world’s modern business climate, understanding these intricacies is critical to nurturing a thriving business. There may be no aspect of technology that is more greatly tied to this truth than that of smart contracts. These complicated cryptographic codes are revolutionizing the way business owners conduct transactions online, and quickly securing their position as a vital part of the internet marketplace. While understanding smart contracts and their role in a business may seem daunting to the non-tech savvy, it is actually a rather simple system that even the most technophobic can grasp. More importantly, wrapping your head around smart contracts will provide unparalleled business opportunities and greatly streamline your virtual transactions! Before one can understand a smart contract and its benefits, one must have a basic understanding of Bitcoin and Blockchain, the backbones of smart contract usage. More than just a buzzword or economic fad, Bitcoin is the most popular form of cryptocurrency on the market, providing a decentralized, digital currency with no central owner, repository or administrator. Anyone can earn Bitcoins primarily through two systems: The reasons for which Bitcoin is becoming the de facto standard in online currency exchange are too numerous and nuanced for this article alone. However, the short answer is that the inability for users to trace Bitcoin use, resistance to inflation, high level of transaction security and non-existent transaction fees make Bitcoin a very attractive currency alternative in the virtual market. The Blockchain is nothing short of a drastic and positive change in the very nature of online transactions. It acts as a public ledger which automatically logs and time-stamps every Bitcoin transaction ever conducted, making them completely public matter. Not only does this improve security and transparency, but it also prevents double counting of a virtual currency that has little to no oversight at this time. Numerous external systems, like Sidechains and parallel Blockchains, deliver scalability and versatility. Though we have touted the merits of Bitcoin and Blockchain at length, you’re likely still asking yourself, “what is a smart contract, and where does it fit into all of this?” The simplest answer is that smart contracts are an “If-Then” statement for Blockchain. A smart contract acts as a pre-programmed set of logic instructions on the same system as the Blockchain, handling a cryptocurrency transaction in a certain way if the Blockchain meets the appropriate criteria. Think of the Blockchain as data storage, and smart contracts as calculations done on that data storage. All of these systems are running on multiple computer systems to ensure trustworthiness throughout all distributions. One of the most intuitive ways to explain smart contracts is through an analogy. Suppose you’re going to fill your car up with gas, and you plan to prepay $20 worth of gas. Multiple unspoken agreements govern the entire process: Smart contracts employ a similar set of unspoken agreements, considering Blockchain data in the process, when users conduct transactions. In this way, smart contracts provide security to your virtual assets through unspoken, pre-programmed agreements. A computer program, defined by a pre-determined set of rules, automatically controls your cryptocurrency transactions. The idea that a piece of software has complete and total control of how your money moves is definitely a tough pill to swallow. However, the reality of smart contracts is that they provide unparalleled security for your virtual transactions. By using a pre-determined set of conditions that the Blockchain data governs (which, as we already discussed, is secure and decentralized from any one individual’s power), payments are guaranteed to be made when fair conditions are met. This eliminates the need for escrow services, or any other third-party transaction security mediator. Furthermore, the nature of smart contracts confers the same transparency to its code that Blockchain data exhibits, so the logic governing a transaction is not hidden knowledge from any parties involved. Since the smart contract code runs in parallel on all computer systems involved in the transaction, everybody is able to validate the results of the transaction. Theoretically, it is impossible to cheat or be cheated by other participants in a transaction when using a smart contract. In addition, smart contracts provide unparalleled flexibility in determining how your money moves around. While traditional banking systems only provide basic mechanisms of manual money transfer between accounts, you can program a smart contract to perform complex movements of finances based on specific parameters. For example, you could easily design a smart contract that automatically splits your money in half and moves one portion to a different account whenever the balance reaches a certain threshold, if you needed such a system. Like all computer codes, smart contracts are vulnerable to human error when being designed, and a small portion of botched code could spell disaster for someone’s finances. Furthermore, smart contracts are relatively inflexible in terms of reworking a transaction due to unforeseen circumstances. No matter what happens before, during, or after the processing of a smart contract, the system carries out the contract to completion. In contrast, you could rescind a regular contract in court if need be. Finally, while decentralization carries a plethora of benefits, it is also costly for everyone involved, as each individual node that participates in the network has associated operational costs. Smart contracts, like many Blockchain solutions, are not one-size-fits-all solutions for any business, and the suitability of such a system will be up to the business owner’s discretion. However, nobody can deny that the number of business owners who will benefit from the security of smart contracts is rapidly increasing, as business dealings are increasingly relegated to the virtual world. The question is more typically one of whether your business could benefit from incorporating Bitcoin payments. So long as your business operates on Bitcoin, there are almost no disadvantages to employing smart contracts. However, the scalability limits of Blockchain play into these decisions. Unfortunately, blocks of data (i.e. transactions) in the Blockchain are currently limited to 1 megabyte, which can cause delays in large transactions. If your business makes frequent, large transactions, the current inability to scale Blockchain protocols and smart contracts may play against you. Bitcoin is currently able to perform about 1/100th of the number of transactions per second that VISA can, making it more suited to small niche businesses. Still, it is often these small niche businesses who are most vulnerable to problems with payment security, and solving that issue is what smart contracts are all about. Though there are many roadblocks to scalability in the current configuration of Blockchain, there are also many world-class software engineers whittling away at the problem on a daily basis. Unlike physical transaction systems, finding the right logic to improve scalability is only a matter of time – just as the large-scale implementation of Bitcoin is only a matter of time. Smart contracts may not be the best solution for your business right now, depending on its size, and that is okay. However, if you have the latitude to implement smart contracts and begin dealing with Bitcoin, you will be far ahead of the curve when the rest of the world inevitably joins in on the virtual currency revolution.

As of September 2017, all agricultural producers and carriers now have to follow the legislation. According to the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), “The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, the most sweeping reform of our food safety laws in more than 70 years…aims to ensure the U.S. food supply is safe by shifting the focus from responding to contamination to preventing it.” All agricultural carriers must now be in compliance with the Sanitary Transportation of Human and Animal Food rule, commonly called the “Sanitary Transportation Rule.” This rule puts in place new regulations on vehicles and transportation equipment, transportation operations, training, and records maintenance for agricultural product carriers. For smaller companies these new regulations are going into effect just before the mandatory implementation of electronic logging devices starting in December of this year. According to the Transportation Research Board, agricultural products account for 23% of total freight tonnage and 31% of total ton-miles of freight moved. Furthermore, trucks move over 90% of the nation’s fresh fruits and vegetables (by market share) and 95% of livestock transportation. Though the rule introduces the potential for increased carrier liability, it also opens the door to prospective innovation and necessitates smarter solutions in the agriculture and trucking industries. Blockchain technology will allow agricultural producers and shippers the transparency to easily prove that they operate in accordance with the new Sanitary Transportation Rule and other parts of FSMA. In addition, blockchain will allow agricultural producers and shippers a chance to gain efficiencies in their supply chain, especially in the areas of operations, accounts settlement, and finance. As consumer demand for healthier, more natural foods skyrockets, food producers and transporters will be able to verify the accuracy of data about their product from farm to table. It has been shown in the U.S. that consumers will pay a premium for niche products such as organic vegetables and free range beef, and blockchain technology will give consumers the ability to ensure that their food has been handled and shipped to the standard they are promised. And consumers will no longer have to rely on unclear certifications and regulations to tell them that their food is what it claims to be. Furthermore, blockchain will take the inefficiency out of the entire agricultural production and shipment settlements process by ensuring that farmers are paid on delivery for their products. In the current system, farmers must wait weeks or months after delivering their product to be paid. This puts a stranglehold on the farmer’s cash flow which can preclude the farmer from paying his carriers and other partners promptly. Blockchain will eliminate this burden. And adding transparency, trust, and efficiency to settlements decreases risk for the farmer and the shipper and unlocks new financing opportunities for both.","TAGS":"Agriculture, Blockchain, FDA, food safety, Refrigerated carriers, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-10-03T19:06:55-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/10/3/new-era-for-agricultural-transport-in-the-us-1","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Reefershutterstock-2.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"New era for agricultural transport in the U.S.","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Big changes abound for shippers of agricultural products in the U.S. In September of 2016, large agricultural production and shipping companies of more than 500 employees had to begin to abide by the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) which was passed by the Obama administration in January of 2011.

Though the rule introduces the potential for increased carrier liability, it also opens the door to prospective innovation and necessitates smarter solutions in the agriculture and trucking industries. Blockchain technology will allow agricultural producers and shippers the transparency to easily prove that they operate in accordance with the new Sanitary Transportation Rule and other parts of FSMA. In addition, blockchain will allow agricultural producers and shippers a chance to gain efficiencies in their supply chain, especially in the areas of operations, accounts settlement, and finance. As consumer demand for healthier, more natural foods skyrockets, food producers and transporters will be able to verify the accuracy of data about their product from farm to table. It has been shown in the U.S. that consumers will pay a premium for niche products such as organic vegetables and free range beef, and blockchain technology will give consumers the ability to ensure that their food has been handled and shipped to the standard they are promised. And consumers will no longer have to rely on unclear certifications and regulations to tell them that their food is what it claims to be. Furthermore, blockchain will take the inefficiency out of the entire agricultural production and shipment settlements process by ensuring that farmers are paid on delivery for their products. In the current system, farmers must wait weeks or months after delivering their product to be paid. This puts a stranglehold on the farmer’s cash flow which can preclude the farmer from paying his carriers and other partners promptly. Blockchain will eliminate this burden. And adding transparency, trust, and efficiency to settlements decreases risk for the farmer and the shipper and unlocks new financing opportunities for both.","TAGS":"Agriculture, Blockchain, FDA, food safety, Refrigerated carriers, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-10-03T14:51:10-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/9/29/6gcu665nh3ia0w5t5w9pkbfmdl8twu","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/BITAlogolargercanvas.jpeg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"BiTA appoints industry veteran Chris Burruss President of the trucking technology alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA) announces the appointment of Chris Burruss as the alliance’s first president. The blockchain association was launched to help develop common standards, certification, and education of blockchain technology in the trucking and transportation industry and has been on fire since it launched in mid-August. Over 160 companies have applied to join, ranging from early-stage startups, to large technology providers in the space, to the largest carriers and 3PLs. The Alliance believes that 85% of all truckload transactions can be represented by at least one member, showing the breadth and scale of the member institutions. Burruss is a 25-year veteran of the trucking industry. He served as president of the Truckload Carriers Association (TCA) for 10 years; the only national trade association exclusively serving the truckload segment of the trucking industry. Prior to that he held positions as president \u0026 CEO of the Tennessee Trucking Association and vice president of the Missouri Trucking Association. “I am honored to be a part of developing the framework for this massively important and transformative technology. While I am not a technologist by trade, I understand the issues and challenges that carriers, shippers, and 3PLs face in their operations. Since the internet, we have never seen a technology that is as powerful and offers to change an entire society to the level that blockchain will. The opportunities in our industry for using this technology are tremendous,” said Burruss. During his career, he has worked with trucking companies of all sizes; from small carriers to Fortune 500 companies. In addition he has worked closely with the vast vendor community that serves the trucking industry. Chris has lobbied on behalf of trucking at the local, state and national levels. He has also worked closely with state and federal agencies on trucking-related matters. “We have had an enormous interest in blockchain technology from across the industry. Companies that have agreed to join are doing so because they understand the power of the technology to transform transportation and society at-large,” said Craig Fuller, BiTA co-founder. “We wanted to develop proper governance and equitable standards and guidelines for member institutions that encourage collaboration and foster trust. We believe Chris can facilitate that.” Burruss is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps. He and his wife Kathy have been married for 28 years and have two grown children and a grandson. In his spare time, he enjoys hunting and fishing, the outdoors, cycling, brewing craft beer and spending time with family and friends. Blockchain is a technology that the World Economic Forum said could be one of the most important technologies to transform society and enhance the lives of billions. Deloitte mentioned that by 2025, over 10% of global GDP will be stored on the blockchain. The technology has been described as connecting two parties without mutual trust who have a natural reason to trade information or assets and instantly establishes trust, transparency, and accountability between them. It provides a record of human exchange and lowers uncertainly between counter-parties. The nature of blockchain is such that it provides identity management, asset tracking, and mitigates reneging on deals without the need for a third-party, corporation, or government to arbitrate claims. It is all done in the technology framework itself. BiTA plans to host its first meeting with members only on November 16 at Georgia Tech. For membership infomation or to join go to: www.bita.studio.

In fact, in a world of digitization, thse companies have an enormous opportunity to become victors. They have super smart people, access to some of the best engineers in the entire industry, strong balance sheets, customer relationships, and an understanding on how to apply technology to their businesses. The outlook for some of the people that are employed by these companies is not as bullish. The individuals that find trucks or secure quotes are dead men (or women) walking. They are the voice brokers and will be replaced with technology in the next decade. In time, we will see “voice brokers” replaced with “digital brokers.” Voice brokers are individuals that solely rely on people and relationships to intermediate capacity. They are common in most brokerages and 3PLs across the industry. The process is time consuming, expensive, and inefficient. Their value in questionable. All they really have to offer clients can be found in their personal relationships. There is no moat around their knowledge or experiences and nothing that keeps them from moving from job to job. Non competes have become a norm in the industry, because this is all about all an employer has in terms of leverage to keep the voice broker from jumping from job to job. Digital brokerage is a totally different animal. The speed at which they are able to discover both price and capacity enables them to win the game and capture the client. The moat around their business models can be found in the 1s and 0s and their access to data, integrations, and UX- all of which are about speed. Their ability to react and plan against market changes gives them a distinct advantage over the voice broker. If 70-85% of the transactions are held within the contract committed market and the providers are interchangable when looking at equipment type, then these transactions can be digitized. The balance will be much more difficult to make electronic, since they require project based or require cooridination of a lot of moving parts. For some time, voice brokers will still play a key role in these processes. When a company like a 3PL provider does not own hard-assets, what they really own is information and the ability to clear and settlement payment between parties. Lets break down all of the elements of a typical freight brokerage function: All of those functions can be digitized. We recently did a story about how trucking fleets are least likely to benefit from the driverless truck. The larger 3PLs and digital brokers will be among the likely victors in a driverless world. We stand behind this argument, as unpopular as it might be. Over $1B dollars has been invested in the “Uber” of trucking business models. Out of the 80+ companies we track, we find only a few that have differentiated their offerings using technology, speed, and automation to develop faster decisions. Most could be described as brokers with a mobile app, still using voice brokers for capacity procurement and tendering. Uber and Convoy are a different ilk. They are actually building machine learning and trying to create an efficient network. Convoy has been so successful in managing some of its client’s domestic freight, they are being asked to expand globally. Uber is doing the same, but is also investing in developing UX processes that improve the driver’s quality of life. Anyone that watched their driver video would be inspired to go out and get a CDL. When we think about the future of intermediaries, we should look no further than financial services. The process by which brokers and intermediaries are being displaced by digitization in financial services will happen in our sector as well. Predictions that Wall Street brokerage firms would go under was misplaced, but the view that individuals that traded stocks on your behalf (i.e. stock brokers) would be out of a job was dead-on. Another technology that holds promise is blockchain. We are excited about this technology because it holds the promise to democratise the process of freight management and create a ton of value for the fleets and shippers alike. The processes that voice brokers use today could easily be replaced with this framework. Alex Tapscott, the author of Blockchain Revolution, talks about how blockchain will eat the world. In his discussion he highlights the power of the technology and its impact to society. His focus is on financial services, which makes sense because 40% of global IT spending is in financial services. It is also incumbent upon companies in this space to constantly invest in technology that speeds up the transfer of information and payment clearing, since they are always under attack from new market entrants. Plus, in capital markets, the company that has the fastest information and can act on it, has a huge advantage over slower ones in arbitrating information. As a large percent of the volume on the stock exchanges are done by machine and not be people. Consumers can buy and sell stocks without ever talking to a person. Freight will go this way and the companies that provide these services enable faster price and capacity discovery will be the victors. Alex Tapscott presented at TEDx last year and discussed how blockchain technology is eating Wall Street. It doesn’t take much of an imagination to see the same opportunity in freight. See below: \u003cbr /\u003e In a digital world, the companies that can facilitate capacity, price discovery, and payment settlement more efficiently end up become enormous victors. Blockchain technology has an enormous opportunity to change the way the industry operates and could enable those companies that exploit this technology to win the speed and accuracy race in the digital freight world.

While this seems like something you would expect a small startup to be announcing along side an absurdly priced ICO, this is no startup. In fact, AXA is one of the largest insurance companies in the world (ranking at #3) and one of Europe’s largest companies. AXA had nearly a 100 billion Euros in revenue last year and employs over 160,000 people worldwide. AXA is the counter-party in the contract and accepts the risk (after-all they are an insurance company) for insuring the contract. AXA’s computer systems scan flights worldwide looking for disruptions and delays, identifying any flights where an insurance contract is active. The contract automatically settles without the need for the holder of the policy to file a claim; It’s all instant and seamless. This product has interesting applications in the freight sector. You could see the package carriers (or an insurance company) implementing a similar offering for package freight. There is an ecosystem of companies that monitor on-time package data to file claims on behalf of package customers. It also has applications in other elements of the supply-chain to automate claims, on-time performance, etc. With the proliferation of IOT transaction systems and tracking aggregators, you could also see companies partnering with insurance carriers to offer a similar product in the truckload sector. After all, anyone that has ever spent a day in the automotive sector knows how aggressive the OEMs are towards managing on-time performance clauses in their contracts and penalties for contingent liability. If a truck is delayed and ends up shutting-down a plant, the cost to the automotive manufacturer can be measured in hundreds of thousands per hour. Walmart also recently rolled out a penalty to carriers for showing up early or showing up late that carriers a stiff financial penalty if a carrier has consistent issues with on-time compliance.

At our November 16 meeting held at Georgia Tech, we will explore similar ideas and concepts around blockchain in freight transportation.

The digital ledger technology, blockchain, has been a huge focus of FreightWaves because of the transformative nature that it can deliver to any sector or application that it touches. According to Coindesk, White House officials emphasized that one of Trump’s goals was to overhaul government bureaucracy through the implementation of technology, all under the goal of eliminating waste, fraud, and speeding up internal decision making and processes. All of these elements are goals encompassed in a blockchain fabric. While most early blockchain enthusiasts were members of a community that advocated for less central control, the next generation of blockchain applications will be to enhance enterprises that are inefficient, wasteful, and slow to change- i.e. the Federal government. The Federal government, including the Defense Department and the NSA, have been building cutting edge technology and exploring blockchain applications, combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning. No one could argue with the need for a robust and agile defense and security apparatus, but the next version will further reach into branches of government that are normally slow adopters of technology, including social services, the IRS, FEMA, and anything that touches healthcare. We recently highlighted the power of this technology deployed during a FEMA disaster relief operation. Healthcare would certainly benefit from the technology. The runaway costs in healthcare since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act seem to be unstoppable, but there is hope with this new technology. As much as 40% of healthcare expenses go towards administration costs, much of which is providing record keeping, billing, tracking of information, and other elements that blockchain could mitigate. While FreightWaves is a logistics and supply-chain centric publication, our readers certainly understand the cost of healthcare. Trucking is among the most at-risk population for lifestyle centric disease and health care issues. Anything that mitigates these expenses would be applauded by the readers and editors of this publication.

As companies expand their global reach, they must also mature digitally. What’s entailed in a digital transformation? Companies implement a suite of technologies that will allow them to leverage a competitive edge by increasing efficiency and scalability. Some of the most pervasive technologies businesses incorporate in digital transformations today include artificial intelligence or machine learning, automation and blockchain. Blockchain may be one of the most disruptive technologies shaping the global business landscape today. Originally developed to support transactions in Bitcoin, blockchain has exhibited unlimited potential beyond facilitating cryptocurrencies. The technology uses a decentralized network of computing nodes to validate transactions. In other words, no governing body controls it and transactions can bypass centralized servers. Key benefits include visibility, security and speed. Most companies do business somewhere overseas. Practically every large company maintains regional headquarters in major global cities. Whether working with suppliers, customers or internal offices abroad, blockchain will catalyze business initiatives on the international stage. When conducting business abroad, many governments still require physical documents to be notarized and signed by designated authorities. With blockchain, mathematically encrypted keys create “signatures” that authenticate the approval of a transaction by a user. These signatures prove to be more secure in blockchain environments than written signatures in physical environments. For example, when exporting goods to Egypt, the shipper or freight forwarder sends original documents to the Egyptian embassy to be legalized. This process often takes over a week and is a required step prior to export. Many governments worldwide are experimenting with blockchain implementation for everything from property rights to customs documentation. While countries like Egypt may always require legalization on commercial documents, blockchain may allow for instantaneous authentication. Without the need for signatures or document processing services, businesses can potentially bid adieu to waiting days or weeks for documents to be mailed and pricey service fees issued by embassies and governing bodies for legalization. The advent of Bitcoin and blockchain in 2008 only led to the proliferation of hundreds of cryptocurrencies worldwide. Today other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Litecoin show even greater potential than their pioneering predecessor. Cryptocurrencies will probably never fully replace traditional currencies, but will operate in parallel to the traditional financial infrastructure. According to research by McKinsey \u0026 Company, over $150 trillion in payments cross international borders each year. Nearly 80% of these transactions are business to business. Transactions typically take three to five business days to complete. The traditional way businesses issue and receive payments inhibits operational efficiencies when it comes to visibility, speed and cost. It’s difficult to track payments effectively and know exactly when the delivery will occur. Long transaction periods often slow the total duration of a critical project or product launch. Foreign transaction fees and exchange rates can also detrimentally affect the commercial cost of products. Cryptocurrencies can ameliorate some of the challenges of cross border transactions through transparency, instantaneous processing capabilities and absence of an exchange rate. An added benefit of blockchain is its ability to trace the lifecycle of a product in a transparent manner. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has an increasing stake and interest in tracing the chain of custody of imported goods for matters of security and trade compliance. As goods pass through stages of the supply chain, documentation solidified in blockchain can be viewed and easily traced by CBP for faster and more accurate audits. Deloitte Luxembourg is utilizing blockchain to trace the whereabouts and validate the authenticity of fine art. Paper transactions in the art world pose immense threats to artists, dealers and buyers when it comes to fraud. Each time the work of art changes hands, the transaction is completed in blockchain. The lifecycle of the piece can be traced and verified for each subsequent buyer or collector. Interested in learning more about blockchain or keeping up with emerging FreightTech?

This short and entertaining explanation boils down the subject in an easy to understand and relatable video. \u003cbr /\u003e Bettina Warburg, a co-partner and managing partner at Animal Ventures was the first person to do a TED talk on blockchain technology. Her video translated this confusing and opaque term into something that we all can understand. In the caveman days, we used brute force to enforce our rights and control over property. If we took advantage of another party and they were stronger, we would be beat up or killed. It was the law of the jungle. As we moved into agrarian societies and had to plan long-term harvests, the skills required to be successful were not measured in strength, but rather numbers and intelligence. Trade was done through social norms and unwritten rules to enhance cohesion. Trade was local. Once society industrialized and global trade routes were established, we created institutions that helped establish a framework to ensure that trade was smooth, contracts were honored, and there was an arbitration process should one of the counter-parties violate the terms of the deal. Complex institutions, government bureaucracy, and corporations sprung up to assist and enforce. We are now moving to the next stage of development. One in which global institutions are not necessary for trade, trust, or enforcement. Welcome to the world of triple ledger, or blockchain. In a blockchain world, we will have a complete record of human exchange. Uncertainties are eliminated because the framework is established to ensure trust and transparency between unknown counter-parties. As Bettina puts it in the video, humans have a natural tendency for mutual distrust (which we learned through evolution and societal constructs) and with blockchain these issues are mitigated. In a blockchain world, uncertainty is eliminated by mitigating someone reneging on deals, enjoying full asset tracking and trade, and instantaneously have a complete record of the other’s identity – all without the need for regulators or intermediaries. Anyone that has been around the logistics space knows how often parties renege on deals, how little counter-parties trust one another, and how any contract or commitment is nearly unenforceable. With blockchain, most of these issues can go away, changing the way the industry works forever. Much like the internet in 1992, companies are coming together to create standards and explore ideas on how to create the framework for a successful blockchain economy in the transportation space.

The total bill represents a $84 billion dollar increase over last year’s budget. One of the things that was added to the bill just before passing was a requirement for the US Department of Defense to study blockchain and how foreign nations and enemies of the US could potentially use the technology- for either good or nefarious activities. According to a report on Coindesk.com, the research that will be conducted includes “…a report on the potential offensive and defensive cyber applications of blockchain technology and other distributed database technologies and an assessment of efforts by foreign powers, extremist organizations, and criminal networks to utilize these technologies.” This should be a positive development. The US military is very good and astute at understanding the risks and opportunities that are created through new technologies. While they appear to be doing research on risks posed by others using the technology, it will also likely reveal opportunities and outcomes in market-friendly offerings. The US military tends to create infrastructure and research that the private sector can take advantage of. This was true for both GPS and for the internet- two technologies, in part, that were funded for by the US DoD. Plus, one of the most important functions of our US military is to manage a global logistics network.

Blockchain will make it instant and safe","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain supports far more than cryptocurrency transactions. One of its greatest potential benefits for countless numbers of industries is facilitating paperless title transfers. One of the most talked about uses for Blockchain is maintaining property records. The most common types of property records include deeds, mortgages, court orders and leases. Most governments and industries still keep track of land and asset ownership using antiquated methods. When purchasing property or a vehicle, the current owner signs a title document over to the new owner. This often involves courier services, mailing documents and requires people to meet in person to conduct transactions. There are several disadvantages to managing property records this way: Time elapsed between required actions, tampering and security issues and accrued expenses. Recently, there’s been an increase in fraudulent check deposits and identity theft due to interception of important documents by criminals in the mail. This creates all the more reason to go paperless for crucial transactions. A Paperless Economy While paper will probably never go extinct, Blockchain will certainly help diminish the use of paper documents. In the transportation world, paper bills of lading and commercial documents will slowly go away as peer-to-peer computing becomes the norm. With property records, information can be stored in tamper-proof blocks in the Blockchain that remain transparent to involved parties throughout the lifecycle of an asset. When signatories exchange “documents”, unique mathematical keys will serve as secure signatures in the transaction. This will help drive out the need to use physical documents reducing environmental waste and security threats. Transactions can also be executed in real-time helping increase efficiency and revenue into the economy. Vehicle Records In a previous article, we discussed how Blockchain might serve as a “Carfax” for fleet owners and operators. Carfax provides a detailed history of a car’s lifespan including everything from service appointments to major crashes. Creating, modifying and storing vehicle records on Blockchain offers several benefits. Digital storage prevents loss, damage or tampering that physical documents remain vulnerable to. It also makes it easier for involved parties to update maintenance records that are crucial for government agency audits or the sale of the vehicle. Sweden’s Experiment Quartz recently published an article outlining Sweden’s plan to move property records to Blockchain. Sweden’s land registry is already mostly digital, and the Swedes are taking Blockchain technology seriously. The Swedish government estimates that recording property transactions on Blockchain will help save the country over 100 million Euros per year through the reduction of fees and fraud. Title transfers in Sweden are executed and recorded in a private Blockchain system. This allows the government to maintain some control over the land registry. One of the major obstacles the Quartz article mentions is the verification of digital signatures. So far, the Blockchain land registry’s migration is still considered an experiment but the Swedish government hopes that when successful, other agencies will also move to Blockchain. Wealthy, industrialized nations like Sweden are not the only ones exploring Blockchain uses for property records. Countries like Ghana, Haiti and Ukraine also see the potential for digitizing the real estate industry. After Haiti’s devastating earthquake in 2010, lots of property related documents went missing or were destroyed in the rubble. This has only worsened its already corrupt and inefficient land registry system. Blockchain could potentially help mitigate the headaches associated with title ownership in a country plagued by turmoil.

The argument they make is that Bitcoin will never replace the dollar and therefore will be nonfungible for most goods and services. If Bitcoin were to fail and drop to zero that would be a good thing for the blockchain industry and technology applications. The rapid ascent of blockchain into the lexicon of our industry has left many wondering what the technology is, how it works, and how they can benefit from it. Most often the conversations revert immediately to Bitcoin. If you are lucky, a more informed person will mention Etherium, demonstrating a basic awareness that there is more than one digital crypto currency. The important thing to know is that blockchain is not Bitcoin and the terms are not interchangeable. To compare bitcoin and blockchain is the equivalent of comparing Facebook and the internet. In fact, the internet is the framework in which Facebook operates, but they are not the same thing. You can access Facebook through the internet, but without the internet, you could not access Facebook. Bitcoin is like that. WIth blockchain, you can create digital currencies like Bitcoin, but without blockchain you could not create Bitcoin or other digital currencies. Lately, there has been too much dumb money going into the sector that has propped up prices of worthless crypto assets into the stratosphere. Applications that should be getting built are struggling because of the confusion around the technology and the lack of talent available to develop real-world blockchain applications. Some entrepreneurs that are active in the space are not building real companies, but businesses that look sneakingly close to giant digital ponzi schemes. A recent blog post by Wang Chang on TheInformtation.com regarding Initial Coin Offerings (ICOS) highlighted the craziness of the ICO bubble: What really upsets me is that most of the white papers pumped out by ICOs today are emphatically not the way we best understand how sustainable new companies come into existence. Many contain big grandiose plans that stretch years and don’t admit the necessary network effects, new technologies, etc., for even modest success. An idea, a LaTeX installation, and WordPress landing page are a very low bar for raising millions of dollars, especially by today’s standards. With open source software and services like AWS and GCP, we should expect more. Startups by definition are organizations in flux seeking their scalable business models, and claiming to have all the answers upon inception is an exercise in hubris and/or grandstanding. The late Steve Jobs did say that customers don’t know what they want, but many of these ICO firms don’t even seem to take the first steps in talking to early prospects. 1999 is calling, and they want their 18-month growth plans, 50-page business plans, and million dollar war chests back… Most of these companies have little to no commercial successes and even less infrastructure to succeed if they took off. What the industry and nascent technology needs are successful commercial pilots at scale and interoperable standards between commercial entities in the same sector, like the one that the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance is working on. While a bubble bursting would be a bad outcome for anyone that had money in these crypto startups, it would be a wonderful thing for qualified blockchain companies and enterprises. People would gain a clear distinction between what is real and what is vaporware. It would free up really smart blockchain engineers to pursue meaningful pursuits to solve real problems and it would allow legitimate companies to differentiate their stories from the pretenders in the market. Investors with real processes for evaluation and discipline would end up treating the technology with respect, not as some sort of lottery ticket.

Each of these benefits, together with smart contract capability, make blockchain attractive to leading businesses. While blockchain has clearly been embraced by the supply chain community, there are as of yet no open standards to help ensure successful implementation.” The entire whitepaper can be downloaded from this link: http://info.tmwsystems.com/blockchain-for-transportation-white-paper. TMW recently joined the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA), which is focused on developing such standards and creating a forum for participants to share best practices and research. A blockchain is basically a decentralized, distributed database that allows transactions to move seamlessly among participants, regardless of prior relationships, trust, and differentiated systems. TWM provides an illustrated example of how a blockchain works in the whitepaper, explaining that two parties wishing to conduct a transaction use cryptographic keys assigned to each, the transaction is then broadcast and verified by a distributed network. Once validated, a “block” is created, added to the chain to create a permanent source of the transaction, which is then completed. In a blockchain, any number of parties can be involved, but no party can alter a previous block in the chain, creating a transparent and trusted record of transactions. Leonard notes some often misunderstood statements about blockchain – for instance blockchain is not the same as Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies; rather it is the technology upon which cryptocurrencies operate. He then notes the various types of blockchain – public, private and consortium – and their differences, as well as some of the key components that make blockchain work before explaining some of the benefits blockchain can provide to the supply chain. Areas that Leonard sees being impacted by blockchain include freight tracking, carrier onboarding, load boards, factoring, Internet of Things, and protecting data. Leonard also highlights one possible application that many are not considering – as a master data management system. “If the technology can store all pieces of information in a single place, it could also very well serve as a Master Data Management (MDM) system,” he writes. With access to key information from shippers, carriers, brokers, users, drivers and the vehicles themselves among other data inputs, a blockchain-based MDM “becomes the perfect solution for building a data lake…because it inherently supports data validation by network members, blockchain could provide the function of ‘data stewards’ in an MDM solution,” he writes. TMW System’s inclusion in BiTA is one of the steps the company is taking to proactively prepare for the inclusion of blockchain in the global freight network.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, Supply chain, TMW Systems, Transportation, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-18T14:30:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/9/17/eld-compliance-and-blockchain","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ELDshutterstock2-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"ELD compliance and blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The logistics industry is one of the sectors that is often viewed as lagging behind when it comes to the use of technology in operations. Technology has grown at a magical pace; there are new innovations being made every day that are transforming how people work in different sectors of the economy. In recent years, however, players in the industry have embraced technology and this has greatly helped in solving the many challenges associated with manual operations, and the future is even brighter in the years to come. Electronic logging devices (ELD) are one of these technologies that while being adopted, have become a polarizing topic. Drivers and independent fleets feel like they place an unfair burden on them, disrupt their ability to manage their business, and represent government overreach. Large fleets feel differently. They argue that a level playing field should exist. Because they are subject to regular audits from FMCSA, subject to litigation by ambulance chasers and dishonest lawyers that paint them as evil large corporations, and receive pressure from insurance carriers, they argue that everyone should play by the same set of rules. So ELDs appear to be inevitable. Even with delays and changes – it is going to happen. ELDs are designed to enable truck drivers and motor carriers to record and electronically track the driver’s RODS (Record of Duty Status). The technology aims to create a breadcrumb record of all driver on-duty activity. It is also intended to simplify, as well as quicken, accurate tracking, management and sharing of RODs. It is an electronic solution to traditional paper logbooks. The device is also used to ensure compliance with hours-of-service (HOS) regulations. The blockchain is popular in the money market as it was created as a system for running crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin. It was highly embraced by big banks and giant companies to help cut down on cost and transform business transactions globally. Though created for the money world, blockchain technology is being applied in different industries to solve tough business challenges. It has a place in the trucking industry too and the expected benefits are unimaginable. The blockchain is simply a digital distributed triple ledger/accounting system that tracks and monitors all transactions. Transactions are grouped in blocks and recorded one after another to form a chain of blocks. The links between the blocks and the data held in the blocks are protected cryptographically thus previous transactions cannot be altered. This makes the ledger and the network trusted without a central authority. The technology will be mainly used in the trucking ecosystem as it will: Connecting the ELD and the blockchain technology will ensure that the fleet is in compliance in a number of ways. This will enable real-time management of log violations, an important tool for trucking managers. It is possible to tell even when a driver exceeds HOS (hours of service) by minutes and records the violation. It will also help in retaining supporting documents for HOS and audit of the ELD data (fueling, purchases and dispatch data). The ELD data audit will uncover cases where the driver logs off while fueling, pre-trip inspections, hooking up trailers or such other work-related tasks. The fleet managers will be able to get instant notifications which need their interventions such as a moving driver, who has already exhausted the drive limit. Drivers too can get notifications for instance to warn them ahead of reaching their hours limit. The ELD-blockchain technology allows the players in the trucking industry to create a roadmap of items in transit. The truckers are allowed to drill down and know the expected movement of the shipment from pickup to delivery as well as individual items within the shipment. Manufacturers and distributors will be able to track items from source to the point of sale. In a nutshell, the technology increases security and safety as it minimizes concerns about theft. The technology can also help in tracing the source of a problem when it happens during shipment, thus preventing huge financial losses. The drivers and fleets are not controlled by holding patterns hence no wastage of time. Drivers can also be paid immediately upon delivery. Maintenance of records will also be transparent and verifiable. Payment for fuel, repairs or any other service/product is immediate and self-executing within the integrated system. It also simplifies dispute and claims resolution and records carrier history and safety to the end of its life.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, Comp, ELD, Hours of service, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-18T02:44:25-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/9/14/trading-tokens-how-tokens-can-take-over-industries","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/tokensshutterstock-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Trading tokens: How tokens can take over industries","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"As blockchain transactions begin to take hold in the general economy and the supply chain in particular, there is a growing question of how to speed financial transactions. According to Coin Telegraph, the answer may be tokens. Making tokens, which are digital currency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, available for payments could speed payment processes. Tokens are not yet recognized as official currency, but their time may be coming quickly. Coin Telegraph mentioned Ethereum has become the token of choice used by some freight forwarders and other businesses involved in the shipping industry. With most industries taking their business, literally and figuratively, online, the e-commerce platform may have found its unofficial currency. Tokens are also called app coins, adding credence to their reputation as digital currency used in demand-intensive industries such as the freight forwarding industry. As tokens are “fast and liquid,” transactions are conducted faster as long as you have a device connected to the internet. Transparency of token-based transactions sometimes sounds like a contradiction. Coin Telegraph noted how these transactions are conducted while “keeping the identity of the entities involved as anonymous as possible.” The consistent aspect of the transaction though involves having them recorded in the blockchain for documentation and safe-keeping. As for the “anonymous” description, that applies to the account holder’s secure information. Donna Dillenberger, an IBM fellow, managed to explain the blockchain part of the logistics transaction involved. Delivering parts from the supplier to the importer involved a series of approvals conducted through the blockchain from the customs authority to the Port Authority to the importing party. Once the parts have been officially delivered, money is wired to the exporter’s bank account using the blockchain. Without the blockchain, freight deliveries will involve several documents subject to approval by various agencies. Taking everything online through the blockchain speeds up the process. The supplier/exporter is informed that the shipment has been approved by the customs authority and the Port Authority and finally delivered to the importer/recipient. And the importer/recipient receives the shipment quick enough to process payment. The demo used dollars. Since the blockchain has recorded transactions and payments, its developers eventually found a way to have its own unofficial currency to use. Instead of importers and exporters using their respective currencies, they will be using tokens. It then makes assets exchanged in this model “tokenized assets.” The tokens that are then used to pay completed transactions are called utility tokens. Instead of wiring money, payment is processed through wired utility tokens. This kind of transaction is explained further by Coin Telegraph as being used for staking mechanisms. In other words, the value of the token traded is based on “network effects” or how many times it is traded along with how many traders are at stake with the token. As of this writing, the transition to an economy using digital currency like tokens is still in its infancy. While comparable to the so-called internet boom before the turn of the millennium, the unpredictability of the market serves as a way to keep watch of the latest developments involving blockchain-based tokens. Only a handful of online traders have mastered the art of token-based transactions and blockchain is only beginning to be understood by trucking. But there is no stopping the e-commerce revolution. With a stateless tool such as the internet, it will eventually involve using a stateless currency. Soon, the term “token” will override the usage of the word “Bitcoin.”","TAGS":"Blockchain, Ethereum, Supply chain, tokens, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-15T13:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/9/14/developing-standards-key-to-success-of-blockchain","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/blockchaintrustshutterstock-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Developing standards key to success of blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"From a global perspective, there is irrefutable evidence that the world is getting smaller. Maybe not physically, but certainly economically. Societies are interconnected like never before; economies dependent on each other. It’s that way on a global scale, and it’s true on a local scale within countries, states, cities and towns. And it’s especially true in the business world. The butterfly effect is truer today than it has ever been before. The issues holding back these relationships, especially in the supply chain, are many. Language differences, time differences, and even cultural differences hold back the common good. They are obstacles to be overcome. Throw in trust issues between parties, and it’s a wonder that business ever gets completed. But it does. Now a technology has come along to overcome all these obstacles. Blockchain has taken center stage in 2017, and we are only at the beginning. But before everyone declares blockchain the solution to all the world’s problems, authors Richard Samans, head of the Center for the Global Agenda and Member of the Managing Board, and Zvika Krieger, head of Technology Policy and Partnerships, bring up a few words of caution in a recent white paper from the World Economic Forum title. “Realizing the Potential of Blockchain, a Multistakeholder Approach to the Stewardship of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies.” The paper’s authors note the enormous potential of blockchain, but also caution that without proper development, blockchain may not provide the connected links needed to be the game-changing technology the world seeks. “Distributed ledger technology promises to have far-reaching economic and social implications,” they write. “By leveraging a global peer network to assure directly and transparently the integrity of value exchanged between parties, blockchain appears likely to transform a number of important industries that supply or rely upon third-party assurance. It could prove to be a broader force for transparency and integrity in society, including in the fight against bribery and corruption. It could also lead to extensive changes in supply chains and governmental functions, such as central banking. “The extent to which this new technology realizes its potential will depend in substantial part upon how well stakeholders steward its development,” they add. “There remain important open governance questions regarding both the functioning of the technology and its current and potential applications.” The authors by no means dismiss blockchain, but through a 46-page document highlight some of its potential, some possible pitfalls, and summarize areas that blockchain still needs support. Perhaps the greatest area still in need of development, the authors note, is the governance of the blockchain. While the blockchain itself operates as a peer-to-peer decentralized database with no single owner of any chain, standards need to be created. Several groups have stepped into this space, including the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA) in the transportation space. “Like the internet before it, the blockchain promises to upend business models and disrupt industries. It is pushing us to challenge how we have structured society, defined value and rewarded participation,” the authors note. Blockchain is several things, it is encrypted, it is inclusive, it is immutable, and it is historical. It is also still developing and being shaped. This is where the stewardship becomes so important. “Where the internet democratized information, the blockchain democratizes value and cuts to the core of legacy industries like banking,” the paper says. It adds that the true power of blockchain is that it is open and permissionless. “The genius of distributed ledgers is that the technology (and everything that happens with it) is and must be distributed,” the authors write. “Power is distributed. Heavy-handed government intervention would kill this embryonic technology in its egg. Rather, we need self-organizing, bottom-up and multi-stakeholder governance. In fact, this type of governance is the best protection from government interference and subjugation.” In some cases, that means industry associations, such as BiTA, must step forward to develop standards and ensure that industry participants are following those standards. “In any one marketplace or ecosystem, we want everyone using the same code, the same chain and the same kinds of transactions to get the efficiency,” Brian Behlendorf, CEO of the Linux Foundation, said. “That means engaging industry associations specific to each industry and educating them on the trade-offs between (a) sharing enough data in the chain to reassure everybody of the integrity of, for example, the provenance tracking process; and (2) providing enough confidentiality to participants that competitors cannot figure out each other’s businesses or deduce terms of agreement with other members of the market or ecosystem,” the paper’s authors note. Systems must be designed to be both confidential and auditable, they say. They are also dependent on how much information businesses are willing to share. An example of this is in the financial markets, where developing a “know-your-customer” (KYC) utility has proved daunting. “There is an enormous appetite in the financial services community for a KYC utility, and blockchain is one way that such a utility could be operationalized,” Jesse McWaters, of the World Economic Forum notes. “However, before this can happen, institutions need to agree on standards and practices for the exchange of KYC data. Reaching that agreement among enough institutions to start building a network effect is the hard part and blockchain doesn’t actually do anything to fix that problem for us.” But as quickly as industry standards are developed, there is a danger to doing so too soon. “The space is still so young that the desire for standards, while well-placed, runs the risk of hardening projects that have really just come out of the lab,” Behlendorf said. He cited the boom of online credit-card purchases as an example. “People were in such a rush to take credit-card orders over the internet that they would use anything we came up with.” The result was an inferior internet security paradigm still in use that uses cookies to store items in virtual shopping carts, but have also developed into tracking devices that have turned the web into a “surveillance machine.” So, while the authors note several challenges to blockchain adoption, there are also plenty of possible uses. Within the supply chain, the Linux Foundation has launched Hyperledger, which is an open-source collaborative effort to advance blockchain technologies across such industries as banking, IoT, manufacturing and supply chains. The effort focused on distributed ledgers and smart contracts separate from cryptocurrencies, for scenarios where participants in a network want to share a recordkeeping system and to automate additional transactions on top of that shared ledger. Using blockchain, goods can move throughout the supply chain with each step in their journey recorded. Every transaction, from the initial order, to the loading of a trailer, to driver pickup, to tracking and delivery can be recorded and automated on the blockchain. When final delivery is made, payment can be reconciled quickly and easily with no paper, but a documented, indisputable ledger in its place. Linux’s Hyperledger group includes over 130 businesses all working together to ensure blockchain will be successful. The authors conclude the white paper by summarizing work that still must be done, including attracting necessary levels of stakeholder participation; setting standards; creating stronger advocacy which will slow regulatory oversight that could stifle innovation; develop policy and watchdog networks; build delivery networks for the technology; and step up education efforts, applied research and scientific research.","TAGS":"BiTA, Blockchain, Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, Technology, Trust, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-15T10:01:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/9/12/ending-shady-practices-in-trucking","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/shutterstock_436669966-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Ending some of the shady practices in trucking","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"It’s Tuesday afternoon and I am in midst of preparing for a Blockchain presentation for McLeod’s up-coming user conference and watching Chad Bobbett’s Rate Per Mile Master’s user group on Facebook. If you haven’t checked it, I highly recommend it. It’s a collection of brokers, carriers, and drivers all discussing rates and other things on their mind that happens in trucking. It’s a great source of info. One of the discussions that has garnered a lot of emotion and counter views are related to truck ordered not used (TONUs). A fleet is upset that a broker is not paying him a TONU for a load they tendered and subsequently cancelled on him. The broker says he doesn’t owe it, since the truck was not under dispatch at the time. I happen to side with the fleet- the broker should be liable for a TONU. Any time a load is tendered and subsequently cancelled, the broker should be liable to a TONU. Regardless of whether the truck was ever dispatched out, the fleet expected to haul that load and planned their operations around it. It is disruptive for it to be subsequently cancelled. But the broker in question also brings up a great counterpoint. What happens when the broker tenders over a load and the fleet cancels? This is also disruptive. The broker (or shipper) are dependent upon a truck to show up and when it doesn’t, it disrupts their operations. Both practices of cancelling and not delivering on commitments are shady, but are also common practice (anyone that knows my history with Xpress Direct can testify to my rabid use of overbooking and subsequently pulling trucks off other loads). They cost companies billions each year and strain operations. The reason that either party gets away with it is because of the lack of enforceability in agreements. Even if the agreements were enforced, no one wants to litigate these matters in court. Most in the market are too small to have the money for litigation and even if they did, the transactions are way too small to be worth it. Carriers, brokers, and shippers have built a way of dealing with these issues, mostly just through tolerance. They allow the various parties to get away with it because they don’t have a lot of recourse. The brokers build out large teams of track and trace personnel to track loads and ensure appointment compliance. Carriers employ a team of load planners and customer-service folks to deal with the changes to their network and disruptions that come along with cancellations or appointment changes. Even Silicon Valley understands the need. Venture backed startups like 10-4, Macropoint, and FourKites have sprung up to provide real-time tracking and visibility solutions to brokers and shippers alike so they can ensure circle-of-service compliance. All of this could be solved through blockchain. By having firm self-executing confirmation sheets and contracts, fleets that accept loads from brokers or shippers could put in the contract a TONU charge if the load is cancelled. If the broker cancels the load after tender, the TONU would automatically be paid out to the fleet. In the same vein, if the fleet does not show or cancels the truck, the broker could be paid a penalty. All of it would be automatic and self-executing. The best part of blockchain is that it is trustless, meaning that I don’t have to know who my counter party is. I don’t have to trust them at all or know anything about them. Through the constructs of the smart-contract, the payment and/or penalty is honored regardless of the counter-party. To implement these offerings, all that is needed is cooperation between the technology providers, brokers, and carriers using blockchain smart-contracts for confirmation sheets and tendering loads using this technology. The great thing about blockchain is that it is decentralized, meaning any carrier, broker, or shipper can write to the contract without having to pay a third-party. It’s all open-source.

Hackers accessed Social Security numbers, birthdates, addresses, credit card numbers and other sensitive private data. Equifax reports that the breach began as early as mid-May 2017. It wasn’t discovered until July 29. The company says hackers discovered and leveraged a vulnerability in a web application. Equifax, along with Experian and TransUnion, make up the big three credit reporting agencies. Together, they serve as gatekeepers to credit reports for over 200 million U.S. adults. These agencies play a pivotal role in determining financing decisions impacting the lives of the majority of consumers. This hack allowed perpetrators to gather enough information to open fraudulent lines of personal credit and new credit cards. The true scale of the cyberattack’s impact remains to be seen. The Wall Street Journal reports Equifax’s share price dropped 14% on Friday. Both credit-reporting agencies and financial experts urge people to monitor their finances and credit reports for irregularities. Consumers can also contact any of the big three agencies to set up fraud alerts. In the wake of the crisis, Equifax is offering customers a variety of methods to monitor and protect their credit information. If you haven’t changed the passwords on your major accounts, now is an opportune time. Cyberattacks remain at the forefront of national security concerns. With each passing month, we see increases in the scale and sophistication of cyberattacks affecting governments, businesses and everyday consumers. The Equifax hack serves as a prime example of how centralized databases and servers create massive vulnerabilities for consumers. One single company’s system exposed sensitive information potentially compromising the identity of nearly half the country. In the future, blockchain infrastructure will help mitigate the effect and scope of cyberattacks through its two fundamental characteristics: decentralization and cryptography. Bypassing centralized servers and databases will spread consumer information across secured peer-to- peer networks protected by layers of cryptography. While blockchain technology is not a silver bullet, incidents like the Equifax hack lend credence to the benefits of blockchain in enhancing cybersecurity. In their current form, websites like Equifax require users to enter multiple pieces of sensitive information in order to authenticate themselves and utilize that website’s services. Blockchain proponents advocate that consumers can limit the amount of personal information used to authenticate themselves when using blockchain technology. According to Jerry Cuomo, vice president of Blockchain Technologies at IBM, consumers will have sovereign authority over their personal information when operating on blockchain since transactions are securely verified by permissioned participants. Blockchain in its purest form obsolesces central authorities. However, in order to truly protect consumers, identity management on blockchain must be backed by a robust, established legal framework. There is a mix of opinions among tech leaders when and if identity management will migrate to blockchain. In the aftermath of the Equifax attack, it’s important from a practical standpoint to always protect your personal identity and limit the use of sensitive information. From a broader perspective, we must reevaluate the technologies and authorities we assume safeguard our personal information.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Cyberattacks, Equifax, Security, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Cybersecurity, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-12T14:30:18-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/9/8/fleet-completes-tony-lourakis-sees-blockchain-as-the-future","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/BlockchainShutterstock-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Fleet Complete’s Tony Lourakis sees blockchain as the future","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain has become the latest buzzword to enter industry lexicon. While many still may not know what it is – it is basically a decentralized electronic ledger of transactions – it is likely to be a technology that transforms trucking and the way it operates. The recently formed Blockchain in Trucking Alliance wants to help with that transition and produce a set of guidelines and best practices for the industry to follow. Within the transportation and logistics industries, blockchain has the potential to streamline processes, ensure trust among parties, verify and speed payments, and produce verification that regulations are being followed, among other possibilities. “I think there is rising interest around blockchain and, in particular, the BiTA alliance,” Tony Lourakis, CEO of Fleet Complete, told FreightWaves. “If you are a shipper, it doesn’t pay to do the heavy lifting [to verify carrier compliance], but blockchain can enable such verification.” Fleet Complete is one of the companies that has signed on as a member of BiTA. It provides telematics and GPS fleet tracking solutions worldwide. In 2016, the company acquired BigRoad and now offers the Fleet Complete Electronic Logging Device (ELD) in the U.S. and Canada. Lourakis notes that he views blockchain as “a data exchange, data authenticity, a data layer so you can … have trust.”  “We’re going to capture data in seconds and as we capture that data it could be useful to third parties. We intend to use blockchain across our architecture.” While Fleet Complete is not currently running any programs with blockchain, Lourakis knows the potential of it. “For us, this is about the future,” he says. “We can’t claim to have implemented any blockchain in our systems today, but we see great opportunity. It’s the way of the future.” With over 250,000 vehicles currently running a Fleet Complete solution, blockchain could serve as a way to coordinate all those data points as the company grows and expects to add millions of connected vehicles to its platforms. “We’re going to capture data in seconds and as we capture that data it could be useful to third parties,” Lourakis says, noting the potential to supply data to OEMs to improve vehicle performance or for autonomous vehicles as two examples. “We intend to use blockchain across our architecture.” To make all that data useful to Fleet Complete, and others as well, there needs to be trust that the data is accurate and transparency that the data being supplied is what it is said to be. Blockchain removes the human element from these data transfers and makes the connections between parties a trusted relationship. Lourakis says that one of the benefits of blockchain is its standardization, which brings together systems from different companies. “One of the most interesting opportunities with blockchain is connecting disparate systems … and doing it with trust,” he explains. “When you look at the members [of BiTA], we all have roles, some overlapping and it’s okay if there is overlap, because we all want to [support customers].” As an example, Lourakis points out that a shipper may book a load with Convoy and through the process that load information transfers at some point to a McLeod Software system. The driver could be using a Fleet Complete ELD. And a customer may have yet another system. Ensuring that shipment makes it through the system requires a number of touchpoints and integration with several systems, but blockchain can bring those systems together, communicate delivery ETA to the customer, generate the necessary approvals or confirmations, and initiate necessary payment or regulatory paperwork along the way. “I think it’s probably going to take a little bit of time to get it going,” Lourakis says of blockchain. “Like us, all tech companies have a bit of a backlog and blockchain will go into that backlog. I think in the next few months we’ll start to see some testing and a year or two from now, I think we will start to see it [adopted].” Fleet Complete is one of those companies that expects to be on the ground floor.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, Fleet Complete, Technology, Transportation, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Borderlands: Canada, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-08T14:44:17-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/caxfax","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/shutterstock_697007005-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain could create an enhanced “Carfax” report for commercial vehicles","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When purchasing a used car, you want to know its history. Similar to medical records, vehicle history tells a potential buyer if the car suffered any damage or serious accidents that can lead to more costly or dangerous problems in the future. Carfax reports also reveal service history and purchase prices. The trucking industry is capital intensive. It’s important to document the comprehensive maintenance history of a truck for safety and investment purposes. FMCSA Regulations The Department of Transportation requires commercial truck owners and lessees maintain adequate records. However, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) is more stringent. Businesses that operate commercial vehicles and are subject to DOT regulations may experience FMCSA audits. More often than not, operators and owners keep their pile of records stored in a folder thinking they’re acting in a compliant manner. They maintain DMV documents, insurance records and most of their maintenance history. What they may not be prepared for is a scrupulous, lengthy examination by FMCSA auditors that reveals violations that can result in costly fines. Protecting Assets Truck owners often lease their equipment. It’s common practice in the marketplace. FMCSA regulations only stipulate document retention for owners and lessees over 30 days. If repairs or mishaps made by short-term lessees are not recorded properly, the owner may be in violation of FMCSA rules. Proper record keeping protects your business as well as your assets. The Problem Visibility, cohesiveness and organization of maintenance records pose challenges for truck owners and operators. In order to keep equipment running healthily and remain compliant under government agency laws, maintenance must be meticulously documented and monitored. However, most companies use antiquated methods of record keeping that can cause trouble down the line. A Blockchain Solution Blockchain presents many potential benefits for the transportation industry. The global transfer of funds via cryptocurrencies, the transfer of titles in bills of lading and most of all, recordkeeping. Each transaction made on Blockchain platforms creates a “block” after it’s verified by peer computer nodes. Blocks can contain documents or records that cannot be tampered with or deleted. Blockchain can potentially improve record keeping for truck owners by” 1. Storing documents digitally 2. Creating added security in Blockchain infrastructure 3. Making it easier for lessees to update maintenance records and notes automatically When selling equipment, a blockchain application can offer a “Carfax” report in the transaction. Both seller and buyer can feel confident records are available, accurate and secure. Plus, because the of the superior nature of blockchain ledgers, the buyer would have all of the information on the vehicle at their disposal and without concern that it has been manipulated. The benefits blockchain delivers to truck owners in this scenario include improved compliance, mitigated risk, enhanced visibility, and most importantly overall safety for drivers and the public.

Hurricane relief logistics is among the most challenging projects any logistician will face. The confusion, lack of organization, inexperienced logisticians running ground logistics, and coordination (or lack of) between government agencies and private contractors creates a very chaotic environment. Supplies are coming in from all over North America and situations are changing on the ground in real-time. Combine this with the immediate need to help people, the influence of politicians which are under the gun, and the sensational reporting by the media, you are going to have a ton of problems that blockchain could address. To understand this, let’s look at what a disaster relief project would look like with blockchain applications being implemented. First off- the funding of relief. Insurance companies have been developing pilots to create blockchain products that mitigate fraud and accelerate pay-outs. While FEMA is not an insurance company, it serves a similar role as an appropriation fund for federally declared disasters. The agency handles billions of dollars in payouts each year. Imagine a world where FEMA implemented a blockchain smart contract that paid out when a hurricane hit and accelerates the amount of money based on the size of the storm itself. Once the hurricane hits landfall, the smart contract would automate payment to the state and municipal governments to accelerate the process of providing relief supplies. Insurance companies and flood insurance carriers would benefit from a similar offering. Property records could also be held in the blockchain. One of the things that inevitably happens during a hurricane is that some people lose most, if not all of their worldly possessions. They also happen to lose personal records and documents that prove identity. With blockchain, this information could allow people to keep records without depending on a centralized government server or having documents in a house that is now unrecoverable. Ordering of relief supplies like water and MREs could also be handled by smart-contracts. In disaster relief projects, there is a lot of delays that take place due to government bureaucracy and checks/balances. One of thing that I found remarkable is how slow FEMA and other agencies are to make decisions on what supplies to order and how many of each. In the hurricanes I was involved with, there can be seven government agencies involved in the decision tree. You can imagine how slow and painful that is to get a consensus. With smart contracts, the data could trigger automatic orders to ensure that the suppliers had the orders ready to go, track them, and handle payment. The routing of relief orders could also be determined through data and smart contracts, matching up locations of disasters with supplies among vendors. One of the things that astounding me during major disaster projects is that relief supplies could come from thousands of miles away. We dispatched 600 trucks to pick up water in Canada. It wasn’t because the water was colder. It was because the supplier chose to use the cheapest source of water and that was in Canada. In a similar fashion, the amount of trucks could match up with the inbound supplies. On countless occasions, we would have trucks show up at loading docks only to find that freight had not been ordered or too many trucks had. We also experienced a similar problem, where there would be more supplies than trucks and some of the products would be left behind, even though the Feds were charged for the goods. One of the things I also observed is that the process of tracking, billing, routing, and capacity planning is all done by hand. We had trucks coming from all over and we would use an excel spreadsheet to provide tracking of the loads. This would also be the ledger in Excel. In a normal freight transaction, the driver is required to get paperwork for billing purposes. This still exists in a disaster relief project, but it is compounded by the fact many loads do not have actual paperwork. Drivers are literally writing orders on pieces of paper and turning it in for billing. There are also the delays in information getting to the folks that could make the routing decisions to deliver relief supplies. At a typical site, there are likely hundreds of trucks full of freight and only a few people on the ground have any idea of where the freight is supposed to go. A lot of it is due to the lack of transparency on what is on site and the various sites around the community that needs them. Blockchain could track all the inbound loads and network routing software could dispatch those trucks out to the destination. In a disaster project, you end up dealing with so many orders and the stress level is very high. You are required to go outside your normal carrier network and deal with unknown carriers. The pressure is intense and there is a chance that some of the brokers in the business are not doing the normal compliance checks on the carriers. Having transparency to the fleet history, compliance, and safety record can all be revealed by the blockchain. The same can be said for the fleets knowing who the brokers are. In hurricanes, fraud is ripe. Carriers and brokers alike pop out of the woodwork to take advantage knowing that there is a lot of money and that things are chaotic. It’s important to know whether the other party is reputable. The thing that also happens during the hurricanes that drive brokers crazy is when carriers fail to honor their commitments. One couldn’t blame the fleets. Brokers are literally throwing money at fleets and offer to double the price on other loads if they take it. In some lanes, DAT saw a doubling of price over a few days as brokers scrambled for capacity. In a smart contract environment, the broker and fleet could use a self-executing forward contract which requires that both parties live up to their obligations. Self-executing contacts could also be used for handling things like driver and fuel advances. In the case of a self-executing contract, the moment the truck picks up a load, the contract could pay out a fuel advance of a pre-agreed rate. No human intervention or paperwork needed. The blockchain contract would use IOT data from the ELD device, knowing that the driver has picked up the load and automate settlement. When the driver delivers the freight to the site, he could get paid upon arrival. He could also receive payment on a daily basis for every day that he is involved in a task, which is tracked through a blockchain ledger. Fraud is also rampant during major storms. Stories of people taking advantage of both residents and the government are frequent because of the gold-rush nature of money in these situations. Using the blockchain, a large amount of this fraud be mitigated. Every single load of freight and item on the trucks could be tracked from order creation to delivery to residents. Through the blockchain, you would know everyone that touched it and have a perfect record of everything that happened to the goods. This would eliminate theft, accelerate billing, and provide a forensics ledger to ensure that a transaction that is being billed took place. Since a large percent of disaster projects are cost plus, the ledger would provide an accurate, trustworthy record of all transactions and costs associated with the project. One of the other use cases for blockchain has to do with paying contractors for the work they do. This includes the drivers. Fleets get paid for an hourly or daily rate for being involved in disaster project. It is almost impossible for the government officials to have visibility to whom was involved, how long they stayed, and what work they did. Through blockchain, this would change. The government, private contractor, and driver would all know and be able to bread-crumb their entire involvement.

To put it simply, a blockchain is like a database, it’s a way of storing records of value and transactions. However, calling blockchain a new type of database is like saying email is a new way of sending people letters. While the blockchain is a database, that definition doesn’t explain the true genius behind how the blockchain stores records of value and transactions. Where the blockchain offers significant potential is in transactions where parties don’t trust each other. There are many instances in trucking where two parties do not trust each other or the need to verify someone is very high. Examples include: A decentralized database built on the blockchain removes the need for centralized institutions and databases. Everybody on the blockchain can view and validate transactions creating transparency and trust. Trust lays at the core of the blockchain – it provides a system of trust between people without the need for an intermediary involved in the transactions. The blockchain allows people to transact between each other with anything of value. The Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA) is helping to bring together companies in the trucking ecosystem where blockchain will impact their organization.

Blockchain serves as a general ledger for cryptocurrency transactions. The technology uses a peer-to-peer network of computers to validate and approve value exchanges using algorithms. Each transaction, once approved, becomes a tamper-proof “block.” Most commonly, these blocks represent the transfer of cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is predicted to radically change the financial services sector. On May 21, Deloitte Tweeted that 10% of global GDP will be stored in #Blockchain. For companies like Deloitte, staying ahead of the curve in blockchain technology is paramount. But what about for logistics companies? Get ready to say goodbye to the physical paper trail. Just as blockchain enables financial transactions, it also stores blocks containing any kind of information to transfer. Despite its original design for cryptocurrencies, blockchain also presents unlimited potential for recordkeeping. Complete digitization of documentation for transportation still faces challenges with security. Unique digital signatures on blockchain ensure protection from tampering. Its decentralized structure allows for free flow of documents between parties and countries without the interference of centralized authorities. For carriers and third parties, billing on blockchain will help alleviate headaches. Tracking milestones of shipments in real-time backed by proper electronic documentation will mitigate disputes and allow for more accurate invoicing. The bill of lading represents the title to a set of goods in transit. Blockchain’s infrastructure can facilitate the transfer of titles between parties in a completely digital manner. Each time a bill of lading changes hands, a block is created in blockchain. Many bills of lading are already electronic. However, this concept still faces potential legal challenges. They are typically not accepted by banks. A usual arrangement between a seller and buyer calls for the buyer to pay for their goods in exchange for the bill of lading. The goods are often shipped before the buyer pays. In that event, original bills of lading are often exchanged by banks and title is granted to the buyer once they pay. This is common practice in international trade. Without the support of global legal systems, blockchain bills of lading will not fully replace original bills of lading. Players in the supply chain may forgo typical legal protection by exchanging bills of lading in a decentralized system. At least for now. For scenarios not involving title transfer during transit, blockchain presents a modernized, streamlined substitute for paper bills. The proof of delivery marks the completion of a job. When a trucker delivers, the document is signed by an authorized recipient and is time stamped. Logistics professionals face challenges with PODs when they contain mistakes or get lost. In the current environment, many truckers take a signed POD, take a picture of it with their phone or scan it into a TMS system. This creates significant room for error. Shipment tracking on blockchain will allow drivers to create virtual PODs automatically. The POD is another piece of paper facing obsolescence in the Blockchain revolution.","TAGS":"Blockchain, logistics, Technology, trucking market, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-01T14:42:17-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/8/30/blockchain-based-freight-transactions","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ETHEREUMlOGO-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Blockchain-based freight transactions","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"It seems as though all new platforms these days feature two common denominators – create transparency and streamline processes. Many of them are now being developed with blockchain. Futurism.com defines blockchain as a platform where “transactions are verified by distribution nodes, and anyone can join or leave the network as they please.” The main element that is attracting some freight brokers is how easy it is to opt in or opt out of transactions. Futurism.com noted that Bitcoin was one of the earliest examples of blockchain, but the platform known as Ethereum is gaining prominence in online transactions. Currency called “Ether Tokens” are used to get into contracts “without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference.” Bitcoin is often used for comparative purposes, but Ethereum is seen as providing a safer option. The level of confidence Ethereum provides is leading some e-commerce providers to consider offering it as a currency option. To make this work, coding of transactions must be done within the blockchain by connecting business systems. Futurism.com used a stock exchange analogy in presenting how Ethereum is similar to buying stocks or making an investment without using an advisor. One of the companies adopting the blockchain-based approach is 300cubits, Maritime Executive reported. 300cubits co-founder Jonathan Lee relayed in an interview how Ethereum worked for them, stating the problems associated with the container shipping industry. For an industry with an estimated worth of $150 billion, Lee mentioned how “Industry people complain about the lack of trust between liners and customers.” So 300cubits went the route of Ethereum. The company is slated to issue a token currency called the TEU. This means, under the Ethereum platform, tokens will take the place of dollars for transactions to be settled. Based on Lee’s explanation though, the value of tokens will increase or appreciate based on usage. This despite the TEU tokens being distributed for free. Lee added, “Their recognition and day-to-day use of TEU tokens will further enhance the value of the tokens.” And since Lee’s industry is in container shipping, the TEU token’s value will be associated with the value of “actual freight rates.” It implies that the token’s value will increase based on supply and supply. This brings to mind the early days of Ethereum in an effort to replace the venture capital platform. When the Ether crowdsale was launched in 2014, it generated funds amounting to $18 million. The fund was used to develop the blockchain platform that Ethereum has put up online. As much as the blockchain platform has proved to be an efficient way to raise funds for start-ups, there are still laws to be followed to prove that cryptocurrency is not a get-rich-quick scheme. The concept of token values rising with constant usage and rising demand was the main motivator for the new breed of investors to start snapping up token-based currencies like what Ethereum had to offer. That was what Stefano Bernardi said in this article for Token Economy. The main difference, though, is how tokens are expected to appreciate. Investors that purchased tokens from Ethereum expect this currency to appreciate similar to how investors in foreign exchanges buy currency based on speculation they will increase in value in the weeks ahead. Lee foresees the TEU tokens to appreciate due to incentives that come with using them. Lee further sees the TEU tokens to become the preferred cryptocurrency in container shipping as this “could move the whole industry’s transactions or even the entire logistics industry’s transactions onto the blockchain.”","TAGS":"Blockchain, Ethereum, Shipping, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-08-30T13:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/8/25/singapores-blockchain-revolution","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Singapore_Cargo-Terminal-03-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Singapore’s blockchain revolution","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Singapore might be world’s smartest city. When you think of tech, you reflexively picture Silicon Valley. While Palo Alto may reign in the west, a tiny island nation of 5.6 million leads the east… and it’s turning to blockchain. How did Singapore become an economic and technological powerhouse? A perfect storm of policy, technology and trade. To understand Singapore today, one must know its story. Modern Singapore truly began in 1965 after it officially separated from Malaysia. The country initially struggled with sovereignty both economically and politically. Singapore’s Economic Development Board opened its borders to foreign investment and trade. Companies received handsome incentives to do business in Singapore. The manufacturing and financial sectors boomed. The country rapidly industrialized and shifted focus towards export oriented businesses. Into the 70s, the Singaporean government invested heavily in computer education and progressive housing policies lifting many citizens out of poverty. The Singaporean population became increasingly educated and skilled. As a result, technology-oriented businesses began to thrive and textile and lower skilled industries started shifting to other parts of Asia. Moving into the modern era, Singapore became a beacon for technological innovation. Its business- friendly climate coupled with a dense population of highly educated people make Singpaore a catalyst for early adoption of technology. Singapore’s designation as a world-class trade hub only skyrocketed with the expansion of its ocean port and Changi airport. Its strategic location in the APAC region makes it ideal for transshipping and establishing foreign trade zones. Last year, the Port of Singapore processed over 30 million TEUs making it the second busiest ocean port in the world. In Singapore, logistics is king. Anything to make trade faster and better usually starts there. Blockchain is no exception. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the country’s central bank, spearheaded an experiment to digitize the Singaporean dollar using blockchain. Project Ubin aimed to streamline interbank payments and MAS officials were thrilled with the results. The implementation of blockchain in Singapore’s central bank allows for the exchange of digital and cryptocurrencies for cash. It also facilitates the secure and immediate flow of international transactions between banks in Singapore and abroad. Singapore isn’t alone. Banks in Canada, Japan and the United States started exploring blockchain proof of concept experiments as early as last year. So far, the results seem positive. Once the global financial infrastructure migrates to blockchain, other industries will likely follow suit. With blockchain increasing the efficiency of Singapore’s banking system, it’s only a matter of time before it starts disrupting the country’s massive trade and logistics sector. Tech startups in Asia look to blockchain to streamline both international and domestic logistics. Australia-based startup Yojee is utilizing Singapore as its testing ground. Yojee software uses artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain to optimize fleet utilization for last-mile deliveries and container drays. Blockchain capabilities help Yojee customers track shipments, exchange documents and locate equipment in real-time. Truckers in Singapore face some of the same inefficiencies as truckers in the US. Every minute saved in reducing wait time equates to increased profitability. Helping smaller truckers obtain more volume through improved visibility will help them compete with bigger international carriers in Singapore and beyond. Yojee isn’t the only player in the logistics blockchain space. Some of the world’s most pioneering blockchain companies call Singapore home. Major players such as IBM are working with Singaporean startups in blockchain innovation for both financial services and logistics. Over the next decade, we can expect Singapore to lead the way in blockchain applications for the logistics sector.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Singapore, Trade, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Borderlands: Canada, Economics, News, Technology, Visibility Tech, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-08-25T13:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/8/23/one-of-the-largest-flatbed-fleets-in-the-us-joins-the-blockchain-in-trucking-alliance-bita","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/PS.png","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"One of the largest flatbed fleets in the US joins the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA)","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"PS Logistics, LLC, a leading national transportation and logistics company, announced today that it joined the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA) as a charter member, to help advance the transportation industry through smart technologies and standardized performance standards. “We formed the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance to develop common standards around blockchain applications in the trucking industry, from speeding up transactions to securing data transfers.

The other companies involved include Unilever, Tyson Foods, Kroger, Dole Food Company, McCormick \u0026 Company, Golden State Foods Corp, Driscoll’s and McLane Co. Walmart is also running a test of IBM’s technology. Walmart said during a test, it was able to track the movement of mangoes in 2.2 seconds instead of nearly seven days. “Yes, the industry is cautious because this could be the next best thing since sliced bread but you wouldn’t say everything was fine and dandy after a trial you had with just two suppliers,” Kroger’s head of food safety Howard Popoola told Reuters. “The key right now is to involve suppliers and retailers and see how well we can share data to oil the IBM blockchain machine. This is an opportunity for us to speak with one voice and say to the world that food safety is not going to be a competitive issue.” During the June 6-8 Roadcheck event, enforcement officers placed 19.4% of all vehicles out-of-service for violations and 4.7% of drivers. In all, 62,013 inspections were conducted over the three days. “It is not just about building the technology, it is about building the ecosystem.” – Brigid McDermott, vice president for blockchain business development at IBM, on the potential of blockchain in the supply chain For the third consecutive month, truck tonnage posted a year-over-year growth, rising 2.3% in July, according to the American Trucking Associations.

Every startup in the transportation space these days is touting itself as a disruptive company. A few will become just that. Many, if not most, will not. But few are also introducing a technology, let alone a service, that is disruptive. Smart Logistics Network (SLOGN) is building a “blockchain coin for decentralized logistics networks.” What exactly is that? Many have now heard of the blockchain – it’s a decentralized database that creates transparency with the contracts (or blocks or nodes) that travel within it. It’s most commonly associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, but its potential within transportation and logistics is now entering the early stages of being explored. SLOGN is one of the companies doing that. SLOGN hopes to launch a blockchain-enabled logistics network next spring. Using SLOGN coins as the currency, the network would provide transparency and automate many of the processes currently found in the supply chain. Those processes can include things like matching freight to available trucks, negotiating rates and accessorials, transferring payments and more. “Something like this requires extensive checks and [quick turnarounds],” Govind Singh, product strategy at SLOGN, tells FreightWaves, “and that is possible with blockchain.” But the story of SLOGN doesn’t begin with the blockchain, it actually starts with a company called Bridge18. Bridge18, founded by Singh, has been 3 years in the making. Singh saw an opportunity to create solutions for smaller trucking companies, 50% of which have fewer than 100 trucks and 90% have fewer than six, he says. The Bridge18 platform is a back-office management system for these fleets which provides them with equipment and driver management tools. It seeks to solve the most common problems smaller fleets face, Singh says: lack of a support team, poor quality management systems, and access to better paying freight in a timely manner. Bridge18 standardizes procedures for smaller carriers and provides that support that so many are missing “We want to take the capacity of trucks to the brokers,” Singh says, adding that the idea is to open the door to more cooperation and capacity by connecting the smaller carriers and independent truckers. “We aggregate the capacity of the smaller guys, but instead of competing with each other, they can work with each other,” he says. As an example, Singh notes a small fleet hauling a load when the truck becomes disabled en route. A spare truck is just not available and a late delivery may mean significant financial penalties to the carrier. But, if that carrier was able to access available capacity of another trucker and transfer that load, there would be a happy customer and at least a partial payment for the original carrier’s time. It was during the time of building Bridge18 that Singh and his partners hit upon the idea of SLOGN. “The more we were developing the product and the closer we are getting to the blockchain, we realized blockchain was the future,” Singh says. Based upon the belief that blockchain will ultimately create the transparency and trust needed in the supply chain, SLOGN was born as a separate entity. While Bridge18 is trying to carve out its niche within the industry, SLOGN is seeking to do the same in an entirely different, and unique, way. Singh, along with Ihor Pidruchny, who is in charge of product design; Govind’s brother Nanak Singh, who is responsible for industry relations; and Andrew Zubko, who is responsible for technology; are working with the development team to build out the SLOGN network. Govind and Nanak Singh led their own trucking company for several years before Govind decided driving was not his future path. Nanak carried on, eventually growing the company to 132 trucks while Govind ventured off into software engineering. The idea of SLOGN is to improve the process the entire way through the supply chain. The company is using a “high-level, open-source platform and marketplace” that offers full transparency, resilience and trust, it says, creating a credible source for instant transactions and contract executions, including immediate payments. Other blockchains are available, such as the quickly growing Ethereum, but SLOGN says its network is optimized for the speed for transportation and logistics. For instance, a common industry problem is carriers waiting to be paid. Using SLOGN’s blockchain, that transaction can occur the moment the receiver confirms acceptance of the load. The smart contracts can also ensure proper insurance levels are in place as well as the safe delivery of goods – eliminating potential claims or disputes. Fuel advances are another common accessorial that can be handled through the SLOGN blockchain. “If a [broker] is handling a load for [a customer] and the trucking company is receiving fuel payments from the customer, that money can be transferred directly and [there are no fees that financial institutions would typically charge for the transfer],” Singh explains. SLOGN coins, which will be utilized for all transactions, will accumulate in an escrow account, he says. So, for instance, if a trucker is receiving $2 per mile for the load, by using tracking technology and the blockchain, a SLOGN coin is transferred into the escrow account every mile that truck travels. Once the delivery is made and confirmed, the entire payment is then transferred quickly and easily. Each company that participates in the SLOGN blockchain, which is not a public blockchain so all data remains out of public view and is only viewable by those involved in the transaction, will receive an account. Singh anticipates that SLOGN coins from those accounts will one day be able to be used to purchase goods and services such as fuel, food, and supplies. Until that day arrives, though, “the challenge is to make it very easy for guys to transfer from dollars to SLOGN coin and vice versa,” Singh says. A small transaction fee will be charged to do so, similar to many credit cards. Within the SLOGN blockchain will be standardized “smart logistics” contracts that participants can use, but the ability to add custom contracts exists as well. Having all the contracts on the blockchain, though, can quickly speed the process of moving goods. “Contracts are needed for business verification, compliance, insurance, and payment structures,” SLOGN explains. “Since all the parties exchanging contracts are using different software systems, most contract documents are still exchanged using faxes, emails etc., causing a huge delay in the business process and leading to many mistakes.” The blockchain can eliminate this problem. Once these smart contracts are executed, they generate a computational task to facilitate speed in transactions. “For every 50,000 truck drivers or significant industry professionals, blockchain would process 5.7 economically valuable transactions per second, which is ten times more than the Ethereum blockchain,” SLOGN says. For those using the SLOGN network, the company has designed a user interface that it says is easy to use and offers interactive, comprehensive and intuitive screens. Singh and the SLOGN team believes blockchain is the future of transportation industry. The question is, is that future now? SLOGN believes it is, and hopes to be that truly disruptive company come 2018.","TAGS":"Blockchain, logistics, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-08-18T10:30:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/8/18/maximizing-efficiency-with-trailer-pools-and-blockchain","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Cape_Cod_Coliseum_as_a_warehouse.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Maximizing efficiency with trailer pools and blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain entrepreneurs have an opportunity. The logistics industry is ripe for disruption and blockchain technology is ready to take the lead. Delays and poor visibility are common complaints among logistics and supply chain professionals. Often, these delays occur during local moves. Most carriers and 3PLs offer some form of tracking. However, visibility is still opaque in some key areas and causes for delays are not always clear. Everyone hates to wait. For truck drivers, waiting is part of the daily routine. With advancements in tracking and digitization, the trucking industry is becoming faster and leaner. But drivers still wait. The current waiting problem stems from lack of visibility and operational planning. When do drivers wait? They wait as shippers load and unload trailers. They wait in lines at the ports for containers to become available. They wait for empty trailers and spend time seeking empty equipment. The trucking industry is capital intensive. It’s also competitive and operates on tight margins. The more time a trucker waits or drives with an empty trailer, the more cost, waste and pollution accrues. The issue for drivers is that wasted time cuts into their hours of service. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates how many hours a driver can be on duty. Overall, waiting reduces the time truckers can safely and legally haul active loads. Shippers are also negatively affected by the waiting issue. Small businesses and large distribution centers alike need to plan diligently around appointment times. When the truckers arrive they must hastily load or unload trailers in order to avoid dwell time charges. If a trailer is floor loaded (not palletized), this process can be incredibly labor intensive. Finding enough people and proper equipment to execute a time sensitive floor load can result in a scramble. Shippers also risk tarnishing their reputation with carriers if they perpetually run over their appointment window or turn drivers away. Overall, the common practice of live loading and unloading contributes to waste in the overall supply chain and decreased profitability for carriers. One of the ways to ameliorate this predicament is to use trailer pools. Equipment owners keep empty trailers available in a common area for drivers of partner companies to recover and drop them off. This allows them to use equipment on demand. Trailer pools allow for truckers to make more drop and hook moves as opposed to live loading and unloading. Instead of waiting around at a customer’s facility, the driver can drop an empty trailer and immediately pick up a full one either on site or nearby. Shippers can also optimize their resources as they see fit. Instead of stopping activity to load or unload trucks, they can do so at will without threatening their operational efficiency. In order for trailer pools to operate at maximum efficiency, operators must implement the right tracking technology. In the future, blockchain-enabled tracking will help update tracking milestones in real time and alert carriers to changes in equipment availability. Some of the major benefits of blockchain tracking include visibility, automatic milestone updates and ease and security of exchanging documentation. One of the most crucial measures of success in business is the return on investment. Since trucking is capital intensive, interested parties need to clearly understand the ROI on their equipment. The equipment generates revenue when it hauls active loads. When calculating returns, one must know exactly when the truck was hauling freight. In order to optimize the ROI, equipment owners and drivers need to know how much time they waited and searched for available trailers. Blockchain-enabled tracking will paint a precise picture of a load’s lifecycle. Both the equipment owners and operators can accurately calculate ROI through blockchain tracking. They can also gain insight on wait time per customer in order to plan more productive routes. Billing can present challenges in equipment pooling scenarios. Blockchain-enabled tracking will provide clarity on when trailers are dropped, picked up and returned. This will help with settling disputes and justly billing operators and customers. One of the most crucial benefits blockchain can deliver is demand-driven data. Equipment owners running trailer pools can leverage blockchain tracking data to negotiate contracts and commitments with carriers. Pool operators can leverage this data to redistribute equipment to specific locations based on actual usage demand. Purchasers will also be able to better forecast the need for additional equipment. Blockchain data will help optimize pool sizes and drive out unnecessary costs from the system. This in turn can benefit all parties involved including drivers, shippers and equipment owners.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Efficiency, Tracking, Trailer pools, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Economics, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-08-18T10:30:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/8/15/mcleod-software-joins-blockchain-in-trucking-alliance","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mcleodlogopromo.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"McLeod Software joins Blockchain in Trucking Alliance","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"McLeod Software has joined the Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA), a new organization focused on the promotion and educational efforts to utilizing blockchain technology in the transportation ecosystem.

Yes, the trucking industry is poised to lead the blockchain way. Why? One of the reasons is that blockchain and the accounting system it utilizes – triple entry accounting – sets up perfectly to solve so many of the issues that plague the industry. Blockchain implementation could result in double brokering becoming a thing of the past; drivers can be paid immediately upon delivery; maintenance records become transparent and verifiable; payment for things like fuel, lumpers, and parts are all immediate and self-executing; freight quality and claims can be easy to dispute and arbitrage; and carrier history and safety can be recorded for infinity. There are plenty of other possibilities as well. Say goodbye to document imaging and hello to confirmation sheets becoming self-executing. Track and trace clerks would no longer be needed to manage exceptions and there would be no need for EDIs or APIs for load tendering. Freight bids can be binding and firm; fuel advances or surcharges self-executing; and short-term or gray asset leases are possible. As truck platoons become mainstream, the issue over payments will rear its head, but with blockchain, it can be automatically settled. Trailer pools can be easily tracked and assets can be exchanged between carriers; insurance contracts can be transactional based; and even contract attorneys are at risk in the whole blockchain economy. The one difficulty to blockchain, as it applies to trucking, is that you have a physical transaction – i.e., a load being delivered – and this transfer has to be recorded in a digital format. The evolution of blockchain must bridge the gap between analog and physical transactions to digital transactions and the blockchain. To facilitate this, a group of companies are discussing standards and ways to deal with turning physical/analog transactions in the trucking industry into blockchain-capable transactions. They call themselves Blockchain in Trucking Alliance (BiTA) and they have been busy signing up members to the cause since launch earlier this month. McLeod Software, 10-4 Systems, Triumph Business Capital, TransRisk, P\u0026S Transportation, U.S. Xpress, and Convoy are among the companies involved. Craig Fuller, co-founder of BiTA and CEO of TransRisk, explains. “Blockchain by its nature is distributed and owned by no single person. It is open source and requires collaboration and standards. We are helping to launch BiTA as a way to initiate dialogue between parties in the trucking ecosystem,” says Fuller. “We have relationships with many of the Alliance members that are not related to blockchain, but the conversation around blockchain keeps coming up and many of them are exploring blockchain, but most are concerned about making significant investments because of the lack of standards and commercial adoption.” What is the blockchain? According to the Institute for the Future, “A blockchain is an online database that stores information across a network of personal computers, making it not just decentralized, but distributed. This means no central company or person owns the database, yet everyone in the network can use and help run it, but not tamper with it.” BiTA explains its mission as the creation of “a forum for promotion, education, and the encouragement to develop and adopt blockchain application standards in the trucking, transportation, and logistics industries.” “We are engaging the brightest minds from the most influential leaders in transportation, finance, and technology,” the organization states on its website. “BiTA will build the first set of transportation industry-specific blockchain standards and promote the most transformative technology since the internet.” The group notes that it will develop standards that “are intended to create a common framework in order to assist members and industry participants with their organization’s decision to develop and adopt blockchain technology.” BiTA believes that blockchain will allow for greater clarity, transparency and trust within the supply chain, but notes that without a common set of standards, those will be lacking among entities. “We believe the freight transportation industry is quickly evolving from merely moving goods from Point A to Point B toward an arms race of technology and data with many players involved, both old and new. We see blockchain as being one of the key, transformative technologies on the horizon along with autonomous trucks, crowdsourced digital 3PL platforms and 3D printing,” Ravi Shanker, Executive Director of Research at Morgan Stanley states. Brigid McDermott, vice president of Blockchain Business Development for IBM, believes the industry is ripe for change. “The potential here is phenomenal,” she told FreightWaves earlier this year. “The match between what blockchain offers and the industry pain points is incredible.” McDermott says that the key to blockchain is trust. “Blockchain is all about trust and what blockchain gives you is a digital record in the supply chain ecosystem,” she says, adding that she sees three main transformation areas of the supply chain because of blockchain technology: visibility, process optimization, and demand management. BiTA has identified several areas which early blockchain applications could be focused. These are: BiTA goes on to explain how each of these areas could benefit from the use of blockchain. For instance, when it comes to payments, blockchain “transactions can be made at any time and can be completed within seconds. Payments can be tied to smart contracts,” the group says. “Working capital is the most costly and data intensive style of commercial finance. The key to providing liquidity for accounts receivable and inventory is all about moving up, or down, the supply chain in order to validate the authenticity and validity of the collateral,” notes Steven Hausman, President and CEO of Triumph. “We’ve been chasing various forms of peer-to-peer data exchange for 15 years, but the available exchange models are clunky. Now, we don’t claim to know what a transportation blockchain looks like, but we’ll know it when we see it. And once we see it, the world of conventional liquidity financing will become immediately obsolete.” Blockchain also allows for records (sometimes called blocks or nodes) to travel unchanged through the chain, providing “immutable record of ownership of cargo and assets.” Potential benefits extend to maintenance records, trailer pools, trailer leasing, tires and more, BiTA explains. One of the primary benefits of blockchain in any industry is the ability to provide verifiable proof of the parties involved in the transaction. This can be particularly important in the supply chain, where shippers, brokers and carriers are often unknown to each and where trust is critical. “Blockchain identity management projects are addressing the challenges of establishing provenance, authentication, and reconciliation,” BiTA says. “These solutions can be developed so that the transportation industry can reduce fraud and outsource specific regulatory obligations cost effectively.” Data can be held in the chain, providing easy access to information such as geolocation, timestamps, telematic data and communications between parties. Each step of the way, that information is locked into the blockchain so there can be no disputes as to when a transaction occurred, or whether a truck arrived, etc. Finally, according to BiTA, blockchain enables the execution of “smart contracts,” which allow for automatic execution of terms once certain parameters are achieved. For instance, a carrier can be paid immediately upon delivery of a shipment with funds transferred automatically, as soon as the customer signs the acknowledgement of delivery. “Successful standards are developed through consensus of the interested parties. P\u0026S sees the potential blockchain technology can bring to logistics. BiTA is a great opportunity to actively participate and learn of the uses of blockchain in our industry,” Mauricio Paredes, VP-Business Technology, for P\u0026S Transportation, states. BiTA does not have a direct commercial interest. It is involved in developing standards and open dialogue around blockchain applications and any company that is in the trucking and logistics space that wants to participate in the dialogue is encouraged to join. Membership is open to software vendors, payment companies, data companies, shippers, brokers, carriers, consultants, and anyone with a vested interest in the outcome of this revolutionary technology. “We recognize that many of the companies that participate will be competitive with one another and that is encouraged,” Fuller says. “In order for there to be standards in technology, companies with counter interests should be discussing open standards between each other for the multitude of applications across the industry. “As companies go out to develop their individual commercial blockchain applications, we want to ensure common standards are adopted,” Fuller adds. “We hope that everyone involved in blockchain around trucking will come and share ideas and dialogue and help to develop standards. “When the VCR was invented, there were two standards – one developed by Sony was known as Betamax and one that was owned by an alliance of companies became known as VHS,” Fuller continues. “Sony’s technology was better, but lost to VHS because there was a consortium of companies that supported VHS and not a single entity. Many of these companies competed, but VHS won because it was a collaborative process and not owned by a single player.” BiTA is currently accepting members. Those wishing to join must fill out an application on the website. The application can be found at https://bita.studio/ or one can be requested by emailing [email protected]. Once submitted, the application will be reviewed by the organization’s membership committee.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Blockchain in Trucking Alliance, Trucking, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, News, Startups, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-08-16T14:00:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/8/15/todays-pickup-mileage-based-taxes-to-be-tested-along-i-95","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/PA_420_at_I-9528329.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Today’s Pickup: Mileage-based taxes to be tested along I-95","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Good day, The I-95 Corridor Coalition is moving forward with research that will help it determine whether a mileage use tax is the right approach to taxing in Pennsylvania and Delaware, according to NBC 10 Philadelphia.

Picture a 40-foot container traveling from Mainland China to a suburb of Los Angeles. It often experiences more complications between the Port of LA and final destination than it does during its international trip. But why? A variety of factors contribute to headaches of the final mile. Culprits that immediately come to mind include equipment availability, congestion, communication, and documentation. While still on the horizon, blockchain may help alleviate some of those final mile difficulties. Blockchain will revolutionize global supply chains across the board. In concept, it could apply to every conceivable aspect of logistics from transactions to tracking to asset management. In theory, this technology can further secure and streamline every step of the supply chain. However, its full-scale application still remains to be seen. Many people are familiar with Bitcoin. Fewer have heard of blockchain. Some professionals know about the benefits of blockchain, however the ledger remains an enigma to most. Blockchain is working now. The decentralized database ledger documents all transactions made using Bitcoin. The primary perks include speed, transparency and security. Nodes in the network create a block for each transaction that is irreversible and tamper-proof. Conceptually, it works like a Google Docs spreadsheet, updating and verifying exchanges of currency and information in real time. The concept of blockchain seems abstruse. Think of it as an extension of the internet. Financial institutions will likely harness it first. The trade and transportation community will be among the early adopters as companies begin to leverage blockchain-enabled technology. Any industry that requires visibility and transparency will benefit from blockchain. IBM is one of the pioneering companies working with supply chain service providers and shipping companies to make this happen. Recently, the tech giant partnered with Maersk to test blockchain tracking and document exchange for specific trade lanes and commodities. When vessels arrive at the port, visibility becomes obscured. This creates pain points for truckers scheduled to recover available containers. Blockchain-enabled tracking has the potential to update live Customs clearance information simultaneously with container availability. Overall, this could help mitigate wait time, increase the number of local drays and decrease pollution in the terminals. Drivers will play a part in tracking as well. While en route, drivers can seamlessly enter information about traffic conditions and delays that will create event code blocks in blockchain tracking systems. They can also measure useful milestones such as drive time to track their hours and estimate how many loads they can handle in a given day. Blockchain tracking will prove useful for all parties involved in final mile delivery. As consignees keep closer tabs on inbound containers, they can maneuver staff accordingly to assist in labor-intensive live unloads. They will also know ahead of time if any delays occur. The nature of the system will protect both consignees and drivers if any disputes arise in regards to wait time or additional charges. Remember the Los Angeles port congestion in 2015? Peak season congestion, work slowdowns and chassis availability created the perfect storm for ultimate inefficiency. Containers sat on vessels and in the port complexes for weeks waiting to be picked up. Perishable items spoiled, retailers lost billions and many importers considered moving operations closer to East Coast ports. One of the solutions created to resolve this issue was gray chassis. The three major equipment leasing companies pooled their chassis to make them available upon demand regardless of who owns them. The driver also doesn’t need to return the chassis to its original terminal. However, chassis and container equipment shortages still affect drivers during peak seasons. Sharing physical assets also presents risk to those who own them. Blockchain will help streamline equipment sharing, increase security of pooling assets and help notify drivers once chassis and containers become available. Missing or incorrect documentation also holds up containers despite improvements in digitization. Bills of lading entered in blockchain will improve visibility and reduce the usage of paper. Since the system vastly improves security, it may reduce the need for original bills of lading and ease the overall title transfer process. When drivers deliver ocean shipments, PODs can be uploaded in real time as a block. This maintains accurate records of the delivery milestone and can help prevent disputes. Blockchain will play a part in improving security, efficiency and visibility in global supply chains. Truckers will benefit in the final mile from port to door as the technology will help optimize port operations. In the coming years, trucking companies will look to partner with 3PLs and importers utilizing blockchain-enabled technologies. Currently, blockchain is only being tested in logistics applications. It’s still difficult to predict when blockchain will fully take hold in practice.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Containers, Ports, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"FreightWaves Staff","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Economics, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-08-14T10:30:00-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/2017/8/7/food-supply-chain-can-reap-benefits-from-use-of-blockchain","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/food-eating-potatoes-beer-8313.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Food supply chain can reap benefits from use of blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"One of the great vulnerabilities in any nation is the food supply. The movement of food is dependent on many entities ensuring compliance with regulations, proper temperature control, proper handling and cleaning and more, including security. That is where blockchain technology holds great promise. Blockchain is a trusted, encrypted system of nodes or “blocks” that record data points and place those into a ledger. Typically managed by a peer-to-peer network, a blockchain is a way to ensure protocols are being met and allows authorized users throughout the chain to see all the transactions. As transportation networks gain more exposure to blockchain, new uses are being dreamed up. A new report from Chain Business Insights explores how blockchain can be used within the food supply chain to drive efficiency, transparency and trust. “The food supply chain comprises countless players that are functionally and geographically diverse. Many of these entities are largely unaware of each other, and have very different commercial agendas,” Ken Cottrill, co-founder and research principal at Chain Business Insights explains. “This fragmented structure inhibits the free flow of information up and down the supply chain.” Titled “Blockchain and the Future of Food: Driving Efficiency, Transparency and Trust in Food Supply Chains,” the report explains how blockchain can break down those information silos to improve visibility and traceability of the nation’s food. The report tracks blockchain’s potential in all aspects of the food supply chain, from farm to manufacturer, from manufacturer to stores and restaurants or the end user, and everyone in between. Shifting consumer buying patterns, demographic shifts, safety and security and the fight against waste, fraud and regulations are among the areas the report tackles. The report also addresses the growing online buying market, led by many “meal-kit” companies such as Blue Apron, but also encompassing large companies such as Walmart and Amazon, who are now shipping food through their networks. The online food market, Chain says, is estimated at $210 billion. “The efficiency of last-mile – the final delivery to buyers – is all important,” the report notes. “Foodservice companies must ensure that online orders are received and processed quickly, and delivered speedily while meeting required quality and safety standards.” Getting food delivered in the last-mile is not easy, as companies like SpoonRocket, which burned through $13.5 million in investment capital before going bankrupt in 2016, found out. “Clearly, the food business is undergoing far-reaching change,” notes Peter Harris, co-founder and research principal at Chain Business Insights. “These changes coupled with long standing structural issues, pose challenges that lend themselves to blockchain-based supply chain solutions.” Chain Business Insights identified at least 13 companies working on blockchain within the food supply chain. “Despite the obstacles of implementing blockchain, we believe that the food industry and its supporting supply chains represent one of the most important applications of the technology,” Sherree DeCovny, co-founder and research principal at Chain Business Insights concludes. “Given the potential benefits and promise offered by blockchain-based applications, we believe that it’s not a question of whether they will be implemented – but when.” One of the primary benefits of the blockchain is the traceability of food in the supply chain to show chain of custody and determine its origins, the report says. “In addition to traceability, food supply chains are highly fragmented and involve various enterprises in the end-to-end process of creation to delivery,” the report says. “Moreover, participants can be geographically dispersed and perhaps have no prior business relationship. Hence, establishing a framework to promote trust where relatively little inherently exists is important.” Blockchain can eliminate lengthy manual processes and cut down on errors, all of which can improve the food quality and speed up the process of moving the product to its ultimate destination, the report adds. “Especially for major distributors and retailers, forming a holistic view of a supply chain, and the gathering and sharing of appropriate data to improve efficiency, reduce fraud and comply with regulations is challenging,” the report says. “That is because in existing models, data resides in silos within individual supply chain participants. And this is the exact use case for blockchain technology – to connect separate parties through a unified and trusted electronic system. The use of smart contracts (electronic contracts that include triggers to execute computations) and a shared ledger system ensures everyone within the supply chain has visibility and trust of the goods movement. Among the benefits of blockchain, the report notes, is traceability, verification (of parties), transparency, payments and analytics data to improve efficiency and lower costs. Walmart is running a pilot program using IBM’s blockchain system to track mangoes. In February, Frank Yiannas, vice president of food safety for Walmart, presented at IBM’s Genius of Things Summit at Watson IoT headquarters in Munich, Germany, on the pilot. To show how important blockchain can be in the supply chain, Yiannas relayed a story of an e. coli outbreak in spinach in 2006. “FDA came out in September 2006 and said, Americans don’t eat spinach, there is an outbreak going on,” he said. “You know what retailers and food service companies across the nation did? All spinach was pulled nationwide. You know how long it took FDA to trace back the source of that spinach to the original farm? Two weeks. For two weeks there was no spinach served and when it was all said and done, they found out it was one supplier, one farm, one lot, one day of production. An entire industry killed, all the farmers’ livelihoods [threatened] because they weren’t able to track and trace efficiently.” In its mango pilot, the fruit is being tacked from the farm to the store. Each step of its journey is being recorded in a blockchain and will be reviewed. “Traceability in the classic sense is one step up, one step back. This is the mango, where did I get it from, where did it go? It defines attributes that are what, where and when,” Yiannas explained. “Today, the way this is done in the food system is through disparate methods, mainly on paper, so you can never have a long view of the food system. You have to piece it together.” For the supply chain, blockchain may be the holy grail that secures the nation’s food supply and ensures that what each American eats is both fresh and healthy.

If they were a publicly held company, they could sell more stock. For companies just starting out, that meant an IPO – initial public offering. Thanks to technology, though, there is a new option that companies are flocking to: an ICO – initial coin offering. SLOGN, which stands for Smarts Logistics Network, was one of the first in the transportation space to attempt an ICO, but the world into which it stepped is really the Wild West of fundraising right now. SLOGN says it is building an open-source platform for decentralized logistics using blockchain and artificial intelligence. However, according to the SLOGN Pre-ICO page, the company says it did not raise the required funds and gave instructions for returning the ether – or the “coin” used by participants to invest. “Thank you for participation in our pre-ICO and interest to the project,” the note said. “We received many inquiries for business partnerships, software development and media coverage and are going to proceed with the project implementation and deployment in the U.S trucking industry. We anticipate to run the ICO in the future.” In fact, according to its ICO page, the company only attracted 150 transactions. So clearly, at least in the transportation space, the interest in ICOs may not be there yet. However, many other companies have found success issuing ICOs, so it’s like that SLOGN won’t be the last technology firm in the transportation space to try and ICO. ICO’s may seem like an attractive option to quickly raise funds – especially for a small trucking startup or an established company looking for funding to build new technologies – but right now, they may be fraught with more risk exposure than most companies are willing to digest. So, what is an ICO and can it help companies in the trucking and logistics space? Understanding how an ICO works is critical, but it’s also important to note that they are generating plenty of legal questions and significant regulatory interest, even requiring the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue a warning to companies considering an ICO. First, before U.S. companies and investors get too excited, it’s important to note that in general, U.S. residents are not allowed to invest in an ICO. There are ways around this, of course, but even SLOGN’s Pre-ICO page noted that the coins were not available in the U.S. and a handful of other nations. ICOs are born out of the world of bitcoin. Since bitcoin debuted as a cryptocurrency residing on a blockchain, dozens of other cryptocurrencies have arrived. Cryptocurrencies are the equivalent of electronic money. A single bitcoin, for instance, was worth more than $2,000 earlier this year. According to an explanation of an ICO by TechCrunch, “an ICO is a fundraising tool that trades future cryptocoins in exchange for cryptocurrencies of immediate, liquid value.” What does that mean? For starters, an ICO – sometimes referred to as a “token sale” – is unlike a traditional IPO, where an investor buys shares of stock that give him a piece of the company. The token that is purchased in an ICO has no stake in the company, instead, investors are hoping that the value of the token itself increases and/or the company issues something in return, such as a product or exclusive content. The Economist explains an ICO this way: “Today most issuers simply write a ‘smart contract’ on Ethereum, a …blockchain,” the publication writes. “This piece of code then automatically creates tokens when it receives ‘ether,’ the coin of the Ethereum realm. Issuers typically publish a ‘white paper’ (a prospectus of sorts) and market their undertaking on social media.” The Economist goes to cite the example of a company called Back to Earth, which launched an ICO on April 26. The company wanted to raise 750 bitcoin, which is equivalent to close to $1 million, through the selling of “StarCredits.” Investors who bought the StarCredits would receive a “Golden Ticket” giving them access to special content and future StarCredits. So the investors are, in essence, getting access to a service or product by helping the company build that service or product. “Token holders are effectively prepaying for a product or service,” Stan Miroshnik, who runs Argon Group, a digital finance-focused investment bank, told TechCrunch. “If I run a video game company, for example, I can sell you tokens that represent in-game purchases once the game is built. If you know you’ll buy swords and shields and things like that, you can just pay for them now. It helps me develop the game and gives me more capital to do it, and you benefit from the currency becoming more valuable over time, because there’s a finite amount of it issued.” One of the concerns surrounding ICOs is that they are mostly unregulated, leading to the opportunity for companies to issue an ICO and never deliver on the promise. That is starting to become more difficult as the market matures, Matt Chwierut of Smith+Crown, told the Economist. More ICOs are now using escrow accounts to hold the money, providing some additional levels of trust, but it is still not a widespread practice. “Ninety-nine percent of these ICOs will be garbage. It’s like penny stocks but with less regulation.” Some companies are falling in love with ICOs. Fortune magazine reports that cryptocurrencies have a current worldwide value of over $100 billion, growing more than ninefold in the past 12 months and there have been 30 companies so far this year that have completed ICOs, raising more than $540 million. Lawyers and regulators, though, are not feeling that same love. Because ICOs are unregulated, there are few legal requirements for them, unlike IPOs, which must pass plenty of regulatory checkpoints to receive Security \u0026 Exchange Commission approval. Jeff Garzik, who runs Bloq, tells Fortune that “ninety-nine percent of these ICOs will be garbage. It’s like penny stocks but with less regulation.” Still, there are some investment firms that are starting to advise their clients that ICOs hold potential as funding sources. Marco Santori, a digital currency lawyer with the firm Cooley, told Fortune that future ICOs will change because of possible regulation. He adds that if regulators determine that tokens are the equivalent of securities, the SEC and IRS would be involved and investors will have more legal recourse for companies that don’t deliver to their investors. In fact, just this week, the SEC issued a statement regarding ICOs. “Lawyers are relying on case law that defines what a security is,” Miroshnik explained to TechCrunch. “The most well-known case is the ‘Howey Test,’ created by the Supreme Court for determining whether certain transactions qualify as investment contracts. If they do, then those transactions are considered securities and are subject to certain disclosure and registration requirements. When tokens are structured basically as the sale of a service or product, they’re designed to make sure the various prongs of the test are not triggered.” The SEC issued an advisory release, if you will, following its investigation of DAO, which was a digital decentralized autonomous organization. DAO had no formal management and was run completely autonomously. It was written by open-source code and used the Ethereum blockchain. In May 2016, DAO ran an ICO, setting a record for the most raised in a crowdfunded campaign at that time. It was valued at over $150 million, raised from some 11,000 investors. But, some users exploited a vulnerability in the DAO code and siphoned off nearly one-third of the funds into a subsidiary account. The SEC investigation led to it issuing the report “cautioning market participants that offers and sales of digital assets by ‘virtual’ organizations are subject to the requirements of the federal securities laws.” “Whether a particular investment transaction involves the offer or sale of a security – regardless of the terminology or technology used – will depend on the facts and circumstances, including the economic realities of the transaction,” the SEC added. SEC found that the tokens offered by DAO were in fact securities and therefore subject to federal securities laws. “The report confirms that issuers of distributed ledger or blockchain technology-based securities must register offers and sales of such securities unless a valid exemption applies.” SEC’s advisory also seems to lean heavily on encouraging investors to stay away from ICOs. “Investors need the essential facts behind any investment opportunity so they can make fully informed decisions, and today’s report confirms that sponsors of offerings conducted through the use of distributed ledger or blockchain technology must comply with the securities laws,” William Hinman, director of the Division of Corporation Finance, said. “The innovative technology behind these virtual transactions does not exempt securities offerings and trading platforms from the regulatory framework designed to protect investors and the integrity of the markets,” Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division, added. So for now, the Wild West of investing remains a buyer-beware environment.","TAGS":"Bitcoin, Blockchain, Ethereum, Initial coin offering, Technology, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Economics, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-07-28T15:49:25-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/blockchain-use-case","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/BlockchainInfographicpromo3.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Potential uses for blockchain in transportation","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain is a technology that is rapidly growing in many industries, and its potential to disrupt traditional work flows in transportation is large.

For those involved in the shipment of goods – from brokers, carriers and shippers to everyone else involved in the supply chain – the blockchain represents a financial revolution. Understanding blockchain terminology Is a blockchain revolution about to hit the supply chain? For truck fleets, blockchain opens doors to improved efficiency Blockchain offers big financial payoff Regardless of industry, financial transactions are the backbone of business. They ensure bills are paid on time and that you receive proper payment for your goods or services. But, in organizations that are far-reaching with offices in multiple locations, or in the case of trucking with vehicles in many states, keeping track of all these records, not to mention vehicle repair paperwork, warranty information and more, can be both time-consuming and difficult. But what if it didn’t have to be? That is where the potential of blockchain could create significant savings for organizations. To be sure, blockchains would never replace a human, explains Joseph Ciccolo, founder of BitAML, which provides compliance services to bitcoin companies. Using the example of bitcoins, Ciccolo says that those transactions, including the transfer of bitcoins to dollars, still must be monitored by humans called “miners.” For financial transactions within companies, a blockchain could speed the process and help keep information correctly filed, but humans would still need to be involved. “There is no shortage of ideas,” he says. “There are no shortage of practical applications, but I think we’ve still got a ways to go. I think in a couple of years, you will see a few big success stories.” “At the end of the day, the cost of regulations and compliance are rising for everybody. But the value for compliance is the same; you’re spending more money on compliance to make everything safe.” Blockchain does not need to be about currency transfer, though. One of the areas being looked at is regulatory and governmental compliance, including taxes and SEC filings. A blockchain could potentially help when an auditor or Dept. of Transportation inspector comes calling as well, says Jeremy Kirshbaum, research manager with the Institute for the Future. “If you have the information an auditor wants and it is stored on a chain, you could provide that access directly [and quickly],” Kirshbaum notes. “It could provide trustworthy information of an asset being transferred, for example, if both parties trust the chain.” It also can easily pull together diverse financial records that may be stored in multiple locations to create a single financial record with tamper-proof qualities. “At the end of the day, the cost of regulations and compliance are rising for everybody,” Brigid McDermott, vice president of Blockchain Business Development for IBM, says. “But the value for compliance is the same; you’re spending more money on compliance to make everything safe. It’s easier for companies to do the right thing and it’s easier to communicate that information to regulators.” Everything in a blockchain is handled electronically and in near real time, so time spent on paperwork is decreased. This includes time spent on bills of lading, proof of delivery documents and Customs paperwork. It could also potentially lead to a quicker settlement process for shippers and carriers by using what is called “smart contracts.” “Because blockchains are distributed, you can create smart contracts that execute automatically under certain conditions that don’t need a third-party to manage them,” Kirshbaum says. This is called ethereum blockchain. According to the Ethereum Project, which is developing just this sort of possibility, an ethereum is a “decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.” The apps run on a custom blockchain and enable “developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middle man or counterparty risk.” In the supply chain, such a situation may occur in the following example: A shipper contracts with a broker to move its freight. The broker hires a trucking company to pick up and deliver the freight. The trucking company, however, knows this particular broker has a history of delaying payment. Wanting to secure capacity, though, the trucking company inserts a stipulation into the blockchain that requires the broker to make either partial or full payment upon pickup by the driver. That stipulation is triggered by a driver’s signature and once that signature is recorded, a financial transaction is initiated.","TAGS":"Blockchain, Finances, Regulation, Technology, Trucking, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Economics, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-04-04T14:36:56-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/truck-fleets-and-blockchain","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Databinarynumbers-1.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"For truck fleets, blockchain opens doors to improved efficiency","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Once a disparate group of entities, the modern supply chain is becoming more akin to a well-oiled machine thanks to technological advances. This includes integrated software systems that allow shippers, brokers, carriers and end-users to seamlessly “talk” to each other throughout the transactions. But each party is still holding back, and with a more digitized approach to the supply chain thanks to Industry 4.0, that is becoming a problem. Proprietary information is but one reason, but the real culprit is trust, or lack thereof. Despite common business interests, each party in the supply chain continues to look out for its own best interests. Blockchain technology, though, is set to alter that equation and the result will be more cooperation, more transparency, and more trust without anyone giving up their individuality.

Along its journey, proper refrigeration is vital to a safe and tasteful fruit. \u003cbr /\u003e And in each step of the journey, information is recorded in the blockchain that ensures traceability, transparency and even that proper refrigeration or other chain of custody concerns are addressed. When the customer picks up that package of mangoes in the store, they can scan a code on the package and see whether that fruit is truly organic, as the package says, and whether it was sustainably sourced. “Traceability in the classic sense is one step up, one step back. This is the mango, where did I get it from, where did it go?

It includes a bit of futuristic thinking, and it requires trust, a lot of it. Blockchain technology may be a hot term right now, but it likely is not a passing fad. And it will likely disrupt the supply chain in ways that are only being imagined today. So, what exactly is blockchain technology? According to the Institute for the Future, “A blockchain is an online database that stores information across a network of personal computers, making it not just decentralized, but distributed. This means no central company or person owns the database, yet everyone in the network can use and help run it, but not tamper with it.” Understanding blockchain terminology Is a blockchain revolution about to hit the supply chain? For truck fleets, blockchain opens doors to improved efficiency Blockchain offers big financial payoff Joseph Ciccolo, founder and president of BitAML, a provider of compliance solutions for bitcoin companies, says a blockchain is only partially about technology. “A lot of people think that blockchain is the technology, but it really is the artifact [of a transaction],” he says. According to Bernard Marr, writing as a contributor to Forbes, blockchains were first created in 2008 by Sartoshi Nakamoto. The first blockchain implementation took place a year later as part of bitcoin. Marr writes that the blockchain is the public ledger part of bitcoin. Understanding the purpose of blockchain, particularly in the supply chain, is difficult to until you understand exactly what blockchain is and what it is not. “The core idea behind blockchain is it is a [system] that lets multiple parties agree to the [facts],” Peter Kirby, CEO of Factom, tells FreightWaves. Factom is an Austin, TX-based blockchain company. Kirby says the company provides solutions that run on blockchain technology. \u003cbr /\u003e “It’s, at the end of the day, a record-keeping tool,” he explains. “And supply chain and logistics involve a lot of record-keeping which is why we think it fits.” But what is a blockchain, really? A blockchain is a collection of distributed computing databases that are joined together to create a chain. Data is then added to the chain in blocks. Each entry is time-stamped and unchangeable, giving a documented, verified ledger entry. To access a blockchain, a unique “cryptographically created key” is needed, providing security. One of the special features of a blockchain is that everyone included in the chain has access to all the data in the chain – complete transparency – but can only alter their part of the chain. Trust and security are major components of any blockchain. “No one can edit a blockchain without having the corresponding keys,” Marr writes. “Edits not verified by those keys are rejected.” The first use of a blockchain was to transfer cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. “At the most basic, the bitcoin blockchain allows all the transactions to be visible, but not who made them,” explains Jeremy Kirshbaum, research manager with the Institute for the Future. He notes that a blockchain can be either private, available only to those who have been whitelisted, or transparent.","TAGS":"Blockchain, data, IBM, Supply chain, Technology, Trucking, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Economics, News, Technology, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-03-29T14:39:45-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"},{"LINK":"https://www.freightwaves.com/news/defining-blockchain-terminology","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"Freight Wave","IMAGE":"https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Databinarynumbers-2.jpg","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"A guide to blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Blockchain is a relatively new term used to describe a series of distributed databases that act as a tamper-proof, verifiable ledger. As with any new technology, blockchain has its own terminology. Here is a listing of some of the most important terms and their meanings. (More information can be found at http://www.blockchaintechnologies.com/blockchain-glossary#sthash.zjfdAO4c.dpuf) Address: Addresses (Cryptocurrency addresses) are used to receive and send transactions on the network. An address is a string of alphanumeric characters, but can also be represented as a scannable QR code. Agreement Ledger: An agreement ledger is distributed ledger used by two or more parties to negotiate and reach agreement. Attestation Ledger: A distributed ledger providing a durable record of agreements, commitments or statements, providing evidence (attestation) that these agreements, commitments or statements were made. ASIC: ASIC is an acronym for “Application Specific Integrated Circuit”. ASICs are silicon chips specifically designed to do a single task. In the case of bitcoin, they are designed to process SHA-256 hashing problems to mine new bitcoins. Bitcoin (uppercase): The well known cryptocurrency, based on the proof-of-work blockchain. bitcoin (lowercase): The specific collection of technologies used by Bitcoin’s ledger, a particular solution. Note that the currency is itself one of these technologies, as it provides the miners with the incentive to mine. Blockchain: A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, comprised of unchangable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks (rather like collating them on to a single sheet of paper). Each block is then ‘chained’ to the next block, using a cryptographic signature. This allows block chains to be used like a ledger, which can be shared and accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions. Block Height: Block height refers to the number of blocks connected together in the block chain. For example, Height 0, would be the very first block, which is also called the Genesis Block. Block Reward: The reward given to a miner which has successfully hashed a transaction block. Block rewards can be a mixture of coins and transaction fees, depending on the policy used by the cryptocurrency in question, and whether all of the coins have already been successfully mined. The current block reward for the Bitcoin network is 25 bitcoins for each block. Central Ledger: A central ledger refers to a ledger maintained by a central agency. Confirmation: A confirmation means that the blockchain transaction has been verified by the network. This happens through a process known as mining, in a proof-of-work system (e.g. Bitcoin). Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed or double spent. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it becomes to perform a double spend attack. Consensus Process: The process a group of peers responsible for maintaining a distributed ledger use to reach consensus on the ledger’s contents. Consensus Point: A point – either in time, or defined in terms of a set number or volume of records to be added to the ledger – where peers meet to agree the state of the ledger. Cryptocurrency: A form of digital currency based on mathematics, where encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies operate independently of a central bank. Digital Commodity: A digital commodity is a scarce, electronically transferrable, intangible, with a market value. Digital Identity: A digital identity is an online or networked identity adopted or claimed in cyberspace by an individual, organization, or electronic device. Distributed Ledger: Distributed ledgers are a type of database that are spread across multiple sites, countries or institutions. Records are stored one after the other in a continuous ledger. Distributed ledger data can be either “permissioned” or “unpermissioned” to control who can view it. Difficulty: Difficulty, in Proof-of-Work mining, is how hard it is to verify blocks in a blockchain network. In the Bitcoin network, the difficulty of mining adjusts verifying blocks every 2016 blocks. This is to keep block verification time at ten minutes. Double Spend: Double spend refers to a scenario, in the Bitcoin network, where someone tries to send a bitcoin transaction to two different recipients at the same time. However, once a bitcoin transaction is confirmed, it makes it nearly impossible to double spend it. The more confirmations that a particular transaction has, the harder it becomes to double spend the bitcoins. Genesis Block: The very first block in a block chain. Halving: Bitcoins have a finite supply, which makes them a scarce digital commodity. The total amount of bitcoins that will ever be issued is 21 million. The number of bitcoins generated per block is decreased 50% every four years. This is called “halving.” The final halving will take place in the year 2140. Hashrate: The number of hashes that can be performed by a bitcoin miner in a given period of time (usually a second). Ledger: An append-only record store, where records are immutable and may hold more general information than financial records. Litecoin: A peer-to-peer cryptocurrency based on the Scrypt proof-of-work network. Sometimes referred to as the silver of bitcoin’s gold. Mining: The process by which transactions are verified and added to a blockchain. This process of solving cryptographic problems using computing hardware also triggers the release of cryptocurrencies. Multi Signature: Multi-signature (multisig) addresses allow multiple parties to require more than one key to authorize a transaction. The needed number of signatures is agreed at the creation of the address. Multi signature addresses have a much greater resistance to theft. Off-Ledger Currency: A currency minted off-ledger and used on-ledger. An example of this would be using distributed ledgers to manage a national currency. On-Ledger Currency: A currency minted on-ledger and used on-ledger. An example of this would be the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. P2P: Peer-to-peer (P2P) refers to the decentralized interactions that happen between at least two parties in a highly interconnected network. P2P participants deal directly with each other through a single mediation point. Participant: An actor who can access the ledger: read records or add records to. Peer: An actor that shares responsibility for maintaining the identity and integrity of the ledger. Permissioned Ledger: A permissioned ledger is a ledger where actors must have permission to access the ledger. Permissioned ledgers may have one or many owners. When a new record is added, the ledger’s integrity is checked by a limited consensus process. This is carried out by trusted actors — government departments or banks, for example — which makes maintaining a shared record much simpler that the consensus process used by unpermissioned ledgers. Permissioned block chains provide highly-verifiable data sets because the consensus process creates a digital signature, which can be seen by all parties. A permissioned ledger is usually faster than an unpermissioned ledger. Private Currency: A currency issued by a private individual or firm, typically secured against uninsured assets. Private Key: A private key is a string of data that shows you have access to bitcoins in a specific wallet. Private keys can be thought of as a password; private keys must never be revealed to anyone but you, as they allow you to spend the bitcoins from your bitcoin wallet through a cryptographic signature. Proof-of-Stake: An alternative to the proof-of-work system, in which your existing stake in a cryptocurrency (the amount of that currency that you hold) is used to calculate the amount of that currency that you can mine. Proof-of-Work: A system that ties mining capability to computational power. Blocks must be hashed, which is in itself an easy computational process, but an additional variable is added to the hashing process to make it more difficult. When a block is successfully hashed, the hashing must have taken some time and computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered proof of work. Ripple: A payment network built on distributed ledgers that can be used to transfer any currency. The network consists of payment nodes and gateways operated by authorities. Payments are made using a series of IOUs, and the network is based on trust relationships. Replicated Ledger: A ledger with one master (authoritative) copy of the data, and many slave (non-authoritative) copies. Scrypt: An alternative proof of work system to SHA-256, designed to be particularly friendly to CPU and GPU miners, while offering little advantage to ASIC miners. SHA 256: The cryptographic function used as the basis for bitcoin’s proof of work system. Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are contracts whose terms are recorded in a computer language instead of legal language. Smart contracts can be automatically executed by a computing system, such as a suitable distributed ledger system. Tokenless Ledger: A tokenless ledger refers to a distributed ledger that doesn’t require a native currency to operate. Transaction Block: A collection of transactions on the bitcoin network, gathered into a block that can then be hashed and added to the blockchain. Transaction Fee: A small fee imposed on some transactions sent across the bitcoin network. The transaction fee is awarded to the miner that successfully hashes the block containing the relevant transaction. Unpermissioned ledgers: Unpermissioned ledgers such as Bitcoin have no single owner — indeed, they cannot be owned. The purpose of an unpermissioned ledger is to allow anyone to contribute data to the ledger and for everyone in possession of the ledger to have identical copies. This creates censorship resistance, which means that no actor can prevent a transaction from being added to the ledger. Participants maintain the integrity of the ledger by reaching a consensus about its state See more at: http://www.blockchaintechnologies.com/blockchain-glossary#sthash.zjfdAO4c.dpuf ","TAGS":"Blockchain, Currency, data, Technology, Trucking, ","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brian Straight","CATEGORY":"Blockchain News \u0026 Updates, Economics, News, ","CREATION_DATE":"2017-03-29T14:18:31-04:00","HTML_CONTENT_LOCATION":".entry-content.mb-30"}]
