All signs point to ‘yes’","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are in dire straits. With the market in a severe downturn, it’s safe to assume the NFT bubble has well and truly burst. It was never clear why these digital collectables traded for such large amounts of money. Now they mostly do not. What’s behind their turn of fate? And is there any hope for their future? Non-fungible tokens are a blockchain-based means to claim unique “ownership” of digital assets. “Non-fungible” means unique, as opposed to a “fungible” item such as a five-dollar bill, which is the same as every other five-dollar bill. But just because an item is unique that doesn’t make it valuable. Digital assets are easily copied, so an NFT is essentially a receipt showing you have paid for something that other people can get for free. This is a pretty dubious basis for value. The two most traded sets of NFTs are the Bored Apes collection created in April 2021 and the CryptoPunks collection launched in June 2017. Both sets consist of 10,000 similar-looking but unique figures, distinguished by differing hairstyles, hats, skin colours and so forth. The Bored Ape character seems derivative of the drawings of Jamie Hewlett, the artist who drew Tank Girl and Damon Albarn’s virtual band Gorillaz. The CryptoPunks are even less interesting. Although the first NFTs emerged around a decade ago, the trend really started to take off in 2021. And for a time NFTs were very fashionable. Even the venerable auction house Sotheby’s, founded in 1744, jumped on the NFT bandwagon. Sotheby’s sold 101 Bored Ape NFTs for more than US$20 million in September 2021. They’re now facing a lawsuit from a disgruntled buyer. As with Bitcoin and similar speculative tokens, the primary driver for buying NFTs was greed. Seeing the initial price rises, people hoped they too could make huge profits. NFTs are essentially a superficially sophisticated form of gambling. Like Bitcoin, they have no fundamental value. Read more: NFTs, an overblown speculative bubble inflated by pop culture and crypto mania Generally, one would only profit from buying an NFT by finding a “greater fool” willing to pay even more for it. So there was never a shortage of people – including some quite famous ones – talking them up and hoping to instil a fear of missing out. Eminem bought a Bored Ape that looked a bit like him. Rapper KSI boasted on Twitter about his Bored Ape rising in price. For a while there were large increases in the prices of many NFTs. But like all speculative bubbles, it was likely to end in tears. Although it’s almost impossible to predict when a bubble for a speculative asset will burst, we have seen this process play out before. Centuries ago there were the Dutch tulip, South Sea and Mississippi bubbles. Around 1970, there was a speculative bubble in the shares of nickel miner Poseidon. Then came the Beanie Baby and dotcom booms of the late 1990s – and more recently, meme stocks and Terra-Luna cryptocurrency. Punters now seem to be as bored with NFTs as the apes. Google searches for “NFT” – which grew rapidly through 2021 – have fallen away dramatically. Trading volumes have collapsed. Prices in the NFT market have also seen huge falls. The prices of Bored Ape NFTs are down about 90% from their peak. The CryptoPunks have done slightly better by losing only 80%. A recent report covering about 73,000 NFTs estimated 70,000 are now valued at zero. This leaves 23 million people holding a worthless “asset”. One high-profile example is an NFT of the first tweet by then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Crypto entrepreneur Sina Estavi bought this NFT for US$2.9 million in March 2021. When he tried to sell it a year later the top bid was US$6,800. What drove the NFT collapse? As well as losing their novelty, the market was hurt by the large falls in the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency, as well as the collapse of the FTX exchange and publicity given to scams. Beyond that, the lifting of COVID lockdowns meant people who began trading NFTs now had other ways to pass their time. And higher interest rates from mid-2022 made most speculative assets seem less attractive. Collectively, all of these factors made NFTs seem like a riskier proposition. Prominent people started jumping off the bandwagon. Some of KSI’s later tweets lament the losses he suffered from his gambles.  Last year, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced, when he was chancellor of the exchequer (their equivalent of treasurer), the Royal Mint would produce an NFT. The plan has now been abandoned. Some foolish people had even taken out loans using the “value” of their NFTs as collateral. When the lenders wanted the money back, they were in trouble: forced to sell their NFTs, they got back much less than they’d paid. Fortunately, there weren’t enough people like this to lead to a systemic problem in the financial sector. Read more: Damien Hirst\u0027s dotty \u0027currency\u0027 art makes as much sense as Bitcoin NFTs probably won’t completely disappear. Some subjects of past bubbles are still around. Tulips are still grown in the Netherlands. Poseidon shares, which ran up from 80 cents in September 1969 to $280 in February 1970, are still listed (and currently trading for 2 cents). But unless some actual use is found for them, NFTs are likely to fade further from public discussion, with their prices increasingly trending down (although the occasional blip up may give die-hard fans some hope). They will probably join the Dutch tulips and dotcoms in the history of speculative follies. Read more: Almost no one uses Bitcoin as currency, new data proves.

In our \u003ca href\u003d\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00590.pdf\"\u003elatest research\u003c/a\u003e, which has been peer reviewed and will be published as part of the International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.ares-conference.eu/\"\u003eARES\u003c/a\u003e), we have identified a novel threat that exploits vulnerabilities in cryptocurrencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is ransomware?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRansomware can mean subtly different things in different contexts. In 1996, Adam Young and Mordechai “Moti” Yung at Columbia University \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp\u003d\u0026amp;arnumber\u003d502676\"\u003edescribed\u003c/a\u003e the basic form of a ransomware attack as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCriminals breach the cybersecurity defences of the victim (either through tactics like phishing emails or using an insider/rogue employee). Once the criminals have breached the victim’s defences they deploy the ransomware. The main function of which is to encrypt the victim’s files with a private key (which can be thought of as a long string of characters) to lock the victim out of their files. The third stage of an attack now begins with the criminal demanding a ransom for the private key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe simple reality is that many victims \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60478725\"\u003epay the ransom\u003c/a\u003e, with ransoms potentially into the millions of dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing this basic characterisation of ransomware it is possible to distinguish different types of attack. At one extreme we there are the “low level” attacks where files are not encrypted or criminals do not attempt to extract ransoms. But at the other extreme attackers make considerable efforts to maximise disruption and extract a ransom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5461132/\"\u003eWannaCry ransomware attack\u003c/a\u003e in May 2017 is such an example.

Nevertheless, it led to widespread disruption across the world, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-41753022\"\u003eincluding to the UK’s NHS\u003c/a\u003e, with some cybersecurity risk-modelling organisations even saying the global economic losses going into the billions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is difficult to discern motive in this case, but, generally speaking, political intent, or simple error on the part of the attackers may contribute to the lack of coherent value-extraction through extortion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur research focuses on the second extreme of ransomware attacks in which criminals look to coerce money from their victims. This does not preclude a political motive. Indeed, there is evidence of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id\u003d4507111\"\u003elinks between major ransomware groups and the Russian state\u003c/a\u003e. We can distinguish the degree to which ransomware attacks are motivated by financial gain by observing the effort invested in negotiation, a willingness to support or facilitate payment of the ransom, and the presence of money laundering services. By investing in tools and services which facilitate payment of the ransom, and its conversion to fiat currency, the attackers signal their financial motives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe impact of attacks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the attack on the Dallas City Government shows, the financial and social impacts of ransomware attacks can be \u003ca href\u003d\"https://heimdalsecurity.com/blog/companies-affected-by-ransomware\"\u003ediverse and severe\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigh-impact ransomware attacks, such as the one which targeted \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57178503\"\u003eColonial Oil in May 2021\u003c/a\u003e and took a major US fuel pipeline offline, are obviously dangerous to the continuity of vital services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn January 2023, there was a ransomware \u003ca href\u003d\"https://talion.net/blog/royal-mail%20cyber-attack-wheres-my-mail-gone/\"\u003eattack on the Royal Mail\u003c/a\u003e in the UK that led to the suspension of international deliveries.

This attack would have had a significant direct impact on the Royal Mail’s revenue and reputation. But, perhaps more importantly, it impacted all the small businesses and people who rely on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn May 2021, the Irish NHS was hit by a ransomware attack. This affected every aspect of patient care with widespread cancellation of appointments. The \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-57184977\"\u003eTaoiseach Micheál Martin said\u003c/a\u003e: “It’s a shocking attack on a health service, but fundamentally on the patients and the Irish public.” Sensitive data was also reportedly leaked. The financial impact of the attack could be as \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ransomware-attack-cost-irish\"\u003ehigh as 100 million euros\u003c/a\u003e. This, however, does not account for the health and psychological impact on patients and medics affected by the disruption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs well as health services, education has also been a prime target. For instance, in January 2023 a school in Guilford, UK, suffered an attack with the criminals threatening to publish sensitive data including safeguarding reports and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://therecord.media/vice-society-ransomware-guildford-school-student-data-extortion\"\u003einformation about vulnerable children\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAttacks are also timed to maximise disruption. For instance, an attack in June 2023 on \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-65685607\"\u003ea school in Dorchester, UK\u003c/a\u003e, left the school unable to use email or access services during the main exam period. This can have a profound impact on children’s wellbeing and educational achievement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese examples are by no means exhaustive. Many attacks, for instance, directly target businesses and charities that are too small to attract attention. The impact on a small business, in terms of business disruption, lost reputation and the psychological cost of facing the consequences of an attack \u003ca href\u003d\"https://academic.oup.com/cybersecurity/article/%206/1/tyaa023/6047253?login\u003dfalse\"\u003ecan be devastating\u003c/a\u003e. As an example, a survey in 2021 found that \u003ca href\u003d\"https://atlasvpn.com/blog/31-of-us-companies-close-down-after-falling-victim-to-ransomware\"\u003e34% of UK businesses that suffered a ransomware attack\u003c/a\u003e subsequently closed down. And, many of the businesses that continued operation still had to lay off staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eIt began with floppy disks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe origins of ransomware are usually traced back to the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://medium.com/@alinasimone/the-bizarre-pre-internet-history-of-ransomware-bb480a652b4b\"\u003eAIDS or PC Cyborg Trojan\u003c/a\u003e virus in the 1980s. In this case, victims who inserted a floppy disk in their computer would find their files subsequently encrypted and a payment requested. Disks were distributed to attendees and people interested in specific conferences, who would then attempt to access the disk to complete a survey - instead becoming infected with the trojan. Files on affected computers were encrypted using a key stored locally on each target machine. A victim could, in principle, have restored access to their files by using this key.

Thousands of victims saw their files encrypted by ransomware that could not be reverse engineered. The private keys, used in encryption, were held by the attacker and victims could not restore access to their files without them. Ransoms of around US$300-600 were demanded and it is estimated the criminals \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28661463\"\u003egot away with\u003c/a\u003e around US$3 million.

This also has the effect of compartmentalising risk – the arrest of cyber criminals using ransomware no longer threatens the entire supply chain, allowing attacks launched by other groups to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have also seen a movement away from mass phishing attacks, like CryptoLocker, which reached more than 250,000 systems, to more targeted attacks. That has meant an increasing focus on organisations with the revenue to pay large ransoms. Multinational organisations, legal firms, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/alert-targeted-ransomware-attacks-on-uk-education-sector\"\u003eschools, universities, hospitals and healthcare providers\u003c/a\u003e have all become prime targets, as well as many small and micro businesses and charities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA more recent development in ransomware, such as Netwalker, REvil/Sodinokibi, has been the threat of double extortion.

They then have the potential to leak or post potentially sensitive and important information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn example of this occurred in 2020, when one of the largest software companies, Software AG, was hit with a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252490395/Software-AG-caught-in-double-extortion-ransomware-hit\"\u003edouble extortion ransomware\u003c/a\u003e called Clop.

In particular, with standard ransomware, there is a relatively straightforward incentive for a victim to pay a ransom for access to the private key if that would allow decryption of the files, and they cannot access the files through any other means. The victim “only” needs to trust the cyber criminal will give them the key and that the key will work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e‘Honour’ among thieves?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut with data exfiltration, by contrast, it is not obvious what the victim gets in return for paying the ransom. The criminals still have the sensitive data and could still publish it any time they want. They could, indeed, ask for subsequent ransoms to not publish the files.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, for data exfiltration to be a viable business strategy the criminals need to build a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4336/10/2/26\"\u003ecredible reputation\u003c/a\u003e of “honouring” ransom payments.

Where instructed, they will facilitate negotiated ransom payments. Within this ecosystem, some ransomware criminal gangs have developed a reputation for not publishing data (or at least delaying publication) if a ransom is paid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore generally, the encryption, decryption or exfiltration of files is typically a difficult and costly task for criminals to pull off. It is far simpler to delete the files and then claim they have been encrypted or exfiltrated and demand a ransom. However, if the victims suspect that they won’t be getting the decryption key or encrypted data back then they won’t pay the ransom. And those that do pay a ransom and get nothing in return may disclose that fact. This is likely to impact the attacker’s “reputation” and the likelihood of future ransom payments. Simply put, it pays to play “fair” in the world of extortion and ransom attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo in less than ten years we have seen the ransomware threat evolve enormously from the relatively low scale CryptoLocker, to a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://cybersecurityventures.com/global-ransomware-damage-costs-predicted-to-reach-250-billion-usd-by-2031/\"\u003emulti-million dollar business\u003c/a\u003e involving organised criminal gangs and sophisticated strategies.

These stakes are vulnerable to extortion by ransomware criminals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCryptocurrencies rely on a decentralised blockchain that provides a transparent record of all the transactions that have taken place using that currency. The blockchain is maintained by a peer-to-peer network rather than a central authority (as with conventional currency). In principle, the transaction records included in the blockchain are immutable, verifiable and securely distributed across the network, giving users full ownership and visibility into the transaction data. These properties of blockchain rely on a secure and non-manipulable “consensus mechanism” in which the independent nodes in the network “approve” or “agree” which transactions to add to the blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil now, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have relied on a so-called “proof-of-work” consensus mechanism in which the authorisation of transactions involves the solving of complex mathematical problems (the work).

Here, transactions are approved by validators who have staked money and are financially rewarded for validating transactions. The role of inefficient work is replaced by a financial stake. While this addresses the energy problem, it means that large amounts of staked money becomes involved in validating crypto-transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEthereum\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe existence of this staked money provides a novel threat to some proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies.

The Ethereum project was co-founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 to overcome shortcomings with Bitcoin. On September 15 2022, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/merge/\"\u003eThe Merge\u003c/a\u003e, moved the Ethereum network from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, making it one of the first prominent proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe proof-of-stake consensus mechanism in Ethereum relies on “validators” to approve transactions. To set up a validator there needs to be a minimum stake of 32ETH, which is currently around US$60,000 (around £43,000). Validators can then earn a financial return on their stake from operating a validator in accordance with Ethereum rules.

While validators receive rewards for obeying the rules, there are financial penalties for validators that are seen to act maliciously. The basic objective of penalties is to prevent exploitation of the decentralised blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two forms of penalties, the most severe of which is slashing. Slashing occurs for actions that should not happen by accident and could jeopardise the blockchain, such as proposing conflicting blocks are added to the blockchain, or trying to change history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSlashing penalties are relatively severe with the validator losing a significant share of their stake, at least 1ETH. Indeed, in the most extreme case the validator could lose all of their stake (32ETH). The validator will also be forced to exit and no longer act as a validator.

After all, what is to stop the criminals asking for another ransom?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne solution we have found – which harks back to the fact that ransomware has in fact become a kind of business operated by criminals who want prove they have an “honest” reputation – is a smart contract.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis automated contract can be written so that the process only works if both sides “honour” their side of the bargain. So, the victim could pay the ransom and be confident that this will resolve the direct extortion threat. This is possible through the Ethereum because all the steps required are publicly observable on the blockchain – the deposit, the sign to exit, the absence of slashing, and the return of the stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunctionally, these smart contracts are an \u003ca href\u003d\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/escrow\"\u003eescrow system\u003c/a\u003e in which money may be held until pre-agreed conditions are met. For instance, if the criminals force slashing before the validator has fully exited, then the contract will ensure that the ransom amount is returned to the victim. Such contracts are, however, open to abuse, and there’s no guarantee that an attacker-authored contract can be trusted. There is potential for the contract to be automated in a fully trusted way, but we have yet to observe such behaviour and systems emerge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe staking pools threat\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis type of “pay and exit” strategy is an effective way for criminals to extort victims if they can obtain the validator signing keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how much damage would a ransomware attack like this do to Ethereum? If a single validator is compromised then the slashing penalty – and so maximum ransom demand – would be in the region of 1ETH, which is around US$1,800 (about £1,400). To leverage larger amounts of money the criminals, therefore, need to target organisations or staking pools that are responsible for managing large numbers of validators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemember, that given the high entry costs for individual investors, most of the validating on Ethereum will be run under “staking pools” in which multiple investors can collectively stake money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo put this in perspective, Lido is the largest staking pool in Ethereum with around 127,000 validators and 18% of the total stake; Coinbase is the second largest with 40,000 validators and 6% of the total stake. In total, there are 21 staking pools operating more than a 1,000 validators. Any one of these staking pools is responsible for tens of millions of dollars of stake and so viable ransom demands could also be in the millions of dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProof-of-stake consensus mechanisms are too young for us to know whether extortion of staking pools will become an active reality. But the general lesson of ransomware’s evolution is that the criminals tend to gravitate towards strategies that incentivise payment and increase their illicit gains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most straightforward way that investors and staking pool operators can mitigate the extortion threat we have identified is by protecting their signing keys. If the criminals cannot access the signing keys then there is no threat. If the criminals can only access some of the keys (for operators with multiple validators) then the threat may fail to be lucrative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo staking pools need to take measures to secure signing keys. This would involve a range of actions including: partitioning validators so that a breach only impacts a small subset; step up cyber security to prevent intrusion, and robust internal processes to limit the insider threat of an employee divulging signing keys.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class\u003d\"align-center \"\u003e\n \u003cdiv class\u003d\"placeholder-container\" style\u003d\"--aspect-ratio-percent:67.50663129973475%;--background-color:#2a314c\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg alt\u003d\"Concept using blocks with locks and keys printed on them to show encryption keys being compromised.\" class\u003d\"lazyload\" data-src\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/543207/original/file-20230817-17-s3whx1.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;fit\u003dclip\" data-srcset\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/543207/original/file-20230817-17-s3whx1.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d405\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/543207/original/file-20230817-17-s3whx1.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d30\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d405\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/543207/original/file-20230817-17-s3whx1.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d15\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d405\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/543207/original/file-20230817-17-s3whx1.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d509\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/543207/original/file-20230817-17-s3whx1.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d30\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d509\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/543207/original/file-20230817-17-s3whx1.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d15\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d509\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d3 2262w\" sizes\u003d\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n  \u003cspan class\u003d\"caption\"\u003eWhat happens when hackers gain access to secret keys?\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class\u003d\"attribution\"\u003e\u003ca class\u003d\"source\" href\u003d\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/intruder-gains-access-secrets-hacker-hacking-2249792687\"\u003eShutterstock/Andrii Yalanskyi\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe staking pool market for cryptocurrencies like Ethereum is competitive. There are many staking pools, all offering relatively similar services, and competing on price to attract investors. These competitive forces, and the need to cut costs, may lead to relatively lax security measures. Some staking pools may, therefore, prove a relatively easy target for criminals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, this can only be solved with regulation, greater awareness and for investors in staking pools to demand high levels of security to protect their stake.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, the history of ransomware suggests that high profile attacks will need to be seen before the threat is taken seriously enough. It is interesting to contemplate the consequences of a significant breach of a staking pool. The reputation of the staking pool would presumably be badly affected and so the staking pool’s viability in a competitive market is questionable. An attack may also have implications for the reputation of the currency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the most serious, it could lead to a currency collapsing.

Then investors can make more informed decisions over which staking pools and currencies to invest in.

Governments are not impressed","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Millions of people worldwide are lining up to stare into a silver sphere about the size of a bowling ball so their irises can be scanned in exchange for online identity verification and “free” cryptocurrency. The silver spheres, known as “Orbs”, are part of the Worldcoin platform, which officially launched in July 2023 after an 18-month testing phase. Led by Sam Altman (chief executive of OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT) and entrepreneur Alex Blania, Worldcoin offers users a “digital passport” known as World ID and small allocations of a cryptocurrency token also called Worldcoin (WLD), “simply for being human”. Worldcoin aims to provide a “proof of personhood” to distinguish humans from artificial intelligence (AI) systems online. However, critics say the company is essentially bribing people to hand over highly sensitive biometric data. Governments are taking note: the Worldcoin platform has already been suspended in Kenya, and is under investigation in several other countries. Users can download the WorldApp on their mobile phone, then find their “nearest Orb”. The Orb uses iris scans to uniquely identify a person. Once the person has their iris scanned, they receive a World ID which will function as an online ID much like a Google or Facebook login. World ID is meant to be different because it can prove the user is human – and more private, because it does not link to other personal information about the user. Despite the “digital passport” label, World ID is not intended to reveal or verify a user’s identity in the conventional sense. It merely establishes the user as “a unique and real person”, rather than a bot. In most countries, the user is also entitled to units of WLD cryptocurrency once their iris scan is complete. The Worldcoin website currently lists 60 Orb locations worldwide, particularly in Europe, Asia, North America and South America, and notes there will also be Orb “pop-ups”. At the time of writing, there appear to be no Orb locations in Australia, so people in Australia cannot earn WLD tokens “for being human”. But they can purchase the WLD cryptocurrency via certain cryptocurrency exchanges and download the World App, which also functions as a cryptocurrency wallet. Altman is a key player in the AI boom that supposedly makes Worldcoin necessary, so critics have suggested he is “simply profiting from both AI’s problem and solution”. When the Worldcoin platform officially launched, after signing up some 2 million users in a testing phase, Altman said the Orbs were scanning a new user every eight seconds. In Kenya, the launch saw “tens of thousands of individuals waiting in lines over a three-day period to secure a World ID”, which Worldcoin attributed to “overwhelming” demand for identity verification. Independent reporting suggests the promise of “free” cryptocurrency was a more common motive. In most locations, Worldcoin offers a “genesis grant” of 25 units of its WLD cryptocurrency when users scan their irises. (The value of WLD fluctuates, but the grant has been worth around US$50, or $A75, over the past month.) People queuing for the Orb in Kenya told the BBC “I want to register because I’m jobless and I’m broke,” and I really like Worldcoin because of the money. I’m not worried about the data. As long as the money comes. Orb operators are also paid for each user they sign up. Critics have labelled this strategy of paying people to scan their irises as dystopian and equivalent to bribery. Offering money for sensitive data arguably makes privacy – a human right – a luxury only the wealthy can afford. People experiencing poverty may risk future harms to meet their immediate survival needs. Worldcoin uses irises for verification because every iris is unique and therefore difficult to fake. But the risks of handing over such data are very high. Unlike a driver’s licence or a passport, you cannot replace your iris if the data is compromised. Surveillance whistleblower Edward Snowden has criticised Worldcoin for “cataloguing eyeballs”, and tweeted about the unacceptable risks: Don’t use biometrics for anything. […] The human body is not a ticket-punch. Worldcoin claims the iris scans are deleted after being converted into a unique iris code, which becomes the user’s World ID. The World ID is then stored on a decentralised blockchain, with the aim of preventing fakes or duplicates. However, the iris scan is only deleted if the user opts for the “Without Data Storage” option (which may mean they need to return to an Orb to re-verify in the future). If the user selects the “With Data Storage” option, Worldcoin states the iris scan is sent via encrypted communication channels to its distributed data stores where it is encrypted at rest. In either case, the user must simply trust the company to delete the biometric data, or appropriately secure it against misuse. There have been many instances in which Silicon Valley companies have promised to secure data and to strictly limit its use, only to break those promises by disclosing the data to other companies or government agencies or failing to secure it against attack. Journalist Eileen Guo also points out that Worldcoin has not yet clarified whether it still uses stored biometric data to train AI models and whether it has deleted biometric data collected during its test phase. And despite the supposed security of biometric scanning, there have already been reports of fraudulent uses of the Worldcoin system. For example, black market speculators are alleged to have persuaded people in Cambodia and Kenya to sign up for Worldcoin and then sell their World IDs and WLD tokens for cash. Regulators in several countries are taking action. The Kenyan government has now suspended Worldcoin’s activities, stating regulatory concerns surrounding the project “require urgent action”. The Communications Authority of Kenya and Office of the Data Protection Commissioner say they are concerned about the offer of money in exchange for consent to data collection; how securely the data are stored; and “massive citizen data in the hands of private actors without an appropriate framework”. The German privacy watchdog is investigating Worldcoin’s business practices with support from the French privacy regulator, which called Worldcoin’s data practices “questionable”. The UK Information Commissioner’s Office has announced it will investigate Worldcoin, referring to the high risk of processing special category biometric data. While there are no Orbs in Australia yet, the federal privacy regulator has previously found some companies in breach of the privacy law for failing to obtain valid consent for the use of biometric data and collecting it when it was not reasonably necessary.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Katharine Kemp, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-08-08T20:05:49Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eMillions of people worldwide are lining up to stare into a silver sphere about the size of a bowling ball so their irises can be scanned in exchange for online identity verification and “free” cryptocurrency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe silver spheres, known as “Orbs”, are part of the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/07/1077250/worldcoin-officially-launched-why-its-being-investigated/\"\u003eWorldcoin platform\u003c/a\u003e, which officially launched in July 2023 after an 18-month testing phase.

Oherwydd hyn, a phryderon ynghylch allyriadau carbon cryptoarian, fe gwympodd yr asedau\u0027n llym yn 2022, gan golli gwerth $2 triliwn (£1.5 triliwn). Ond er bod cryptoarian yn aml yn cael sylw, nid syniad newydd yw hwn. Roedd gweithwyr yng Nghymru canrifoedd yn ôl yn aml yn cael eu talu mewn ffyrdd oedd yn wahanol i arian cyffredin. Tocynnau materol oedd yr arian cyfredol hynny, oedd yn cynrychioli ac yn gysylltiedig â gwerth arian go iawn. Toceiddio yw’r broses o gynrychioli ased sy’n bodoli eisoes ar gyfriflyfr drwy gysylltu’r gwerth economaidd neu’r hawliau sy’n deillio o’r asedau â “thocyn”. Gall tocynnau o\u0027r fath fod yn ddigidol neu yn faterol. Mae arian digidol wedi\u0027i gynllunio i weithredu fel cyfrwng cyfnewid fesul rhwydwaith cyfrifiadurol. Dydy\u0027r dechnoleg ddim yn ddibynnol ar unrhyw awdurdod unigol, fel llywodraeth neu fanc, i gynnal y rhwydwaith. Eto, mae hyn yn debyg i sut y defnyddiwyd tocynnau materol gan gwmnïau mwyngloddio Cymru. Tua diwedd y 18fed ganrif, roedd darnau arian Prydain mewn cyflwr truenus oherwydd prinder darnau arian a chopr. Yn ystod y Chwyldro Diwydiannol, bu ymfudiad o bobl o gefn gwlad i ganolfannau mwyngloddio a gweithgynhyrchu. Roedd byw mewn trefi yn golygu bod angen arian. Ond roedd y gallu i dalu cyflogau yn amhosibl i fusnesau heb newid bach. Gyda\u0027r mewnlifiad o weithwyr newydd yn defnyddio arian, agorwyd siopau newydd i ateb y galw, gan greu mwy o swyddi a oedd angen cael eu talu mewn darnau arian. Er bod cynhyrchu darnau arian ffug yn anghyfreithlon, ac yn gosbadwy trwy farwolaeth, nid oedd yn anghyfreithlon i gynhyrchu tocynnau y gellid eu defnyddio yn lle darnau arian. Dechreuodd y cyfnod mawr cyntaf o gynhyrchu tocynnau yn ystod y Chwyldro Diwydiannol cyntaf yn 1787 pan gafodd tocyn Cwmni Mwyngloddio Parys ei gynhyrchu. Roedd y cwmni hwn yn cloddio copr ar Fynydd Parys ar Ynys Môn. Defnyddiodd y cwmni fwyn copr Parys i gynhyrchu tocynnau y gellid eu cyfnewid am geiniogau swyddogol yn unrhyw un o siopau neu swyddfeydd y cwmni. Cwmni Mwyngloddio Parys oedd y cyntaf yn y byd i ddosbarthu tocynnau. Roedd y tocynnau yn cael eu hystyried fel “tocynnau blaenllaw” yr 18fed ganrif gan arbenigwyr arian y cyfnod. Yn fuan, roedd bron pob tref ym Mhrydain yn cynhyrchu\u0027r fath docynnau. Cafodd hyn ei ysgogi’n rhannol gan brinder arian y llywodraeth a gwelliannau mewn gweithgynhyrchu darnau arian gan fathdy Soho Matthew Boulton yn Birmingham, oedd hefyd yn cynhyrchu tocynnau. Erbyn troad y 19eg ganrif, mae\u0027n debyg bod cyfanswm cyflenwad a chyflymder cylchrediad y tocynnau, darnau arian tramor ac amnewidion eraill yn fwy na rhai o ddarnau arian swyddogol y wlad. Gwelwyd y broses toceiddio mewn gwledydd eraill, yn enwedig yn yr Unol Daleithiau. Roedd gwersylloedd mwyngloddio a thorri coed yn y 19eg ganrif fel arfer yn eiddo i un cwmni. Roeddent yn cael eu rhedeg mewn lleoliadau go anghysbell, lle yr oedd y cyfle i gael gafael ar arian parod yn wael. Byddai\u0027r fath gwmnïau yn aml yn talu eu gweithwyr mewn “sgrip”, hynny yw, tocynnau. Doedd gan y gweithwyr ddim fawr o ddewis ond prynu nwyddau mewn siopau a oedd yn eiddo i\u0027r cwmni. Trwy ychwanegu at bris nwyddau, gallai\u0027r cwmni gynyddu eu helw a gorfodi teyrngarwch gweithwyr. Tra bod cynhyrchu tocynnau gan Gwmni Mwyngloddio Parys wedi’i sbarduno gan y Chwyldro Diwydiannol cyntaf, mae poblogrwydd Bitcoin a chryptoarian arall wedi’i gyflymu gan y pedwerydd Chwyldro Diwydiannol. Er bod mwy na 200 mlynedd rhwng y ddau gyfnod, mae gan brofiad y tocynnau gwreiddiol wersi pwysig ar gyfer cryptoarian heddiw. Yn gyntaf, er mwyn i gryptoarian lwyddo, mae angen ecosystem gref arnynt. Bydd ecosystem effeithiol yn cynnwys dau brif beth – ffyrdd i unigolion gronni\u0027r crypto/tocynnau, galw a defnydd am y crypto sy\u0027n trwytho â gwerth, ac amgylcheddau lle gellir cyfnewid am nwyddau a gwasanaethau. Yn ail, er mwyn i cryptoarian fod yn llwyddiannus ac yn gynaliadwy yn y tymor hir, rhaid iddynt gynnal eu pwrpas gwreiddiol o gael ecosystem sy\u0027n parhau i fod yn annibynnol o un cwmni neu lywodraeth. Mae ymdrechion i gloi cryptoarian i un sefydliad yn sicr o fethu. Cymerwch, er enghraifft, fethiant Facebook i lansio cryptoarian rhai blynyddoedd yn ôl. Fe fethodd tocynnau cwmnïau mwyngloddio Cymru pan gaeodd y pyllau, y chwareli neu’r siopau. Arweiniodd hynny at fethiant un neu fwy o dair cydran allweddol yr ecosystem. Fe gollodd y pobl gyda\u0027r tocynnau eu harian, sy\u0027n wers i ni heddiw.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Edward Thomas Jones, Laurence Jones, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-06-27T16:00:56Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eMae\u0027r farchnad cryptoarian wedi gweld nifer o rwystrau diweddar: o gwymp y system \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.ft.com/content/c10bc6f7-abbe-45dc-9367-042186c3336f\"\u003eTerra/Luna ym mis Mai 2022\u003c/a\u003e i fethiant un o gyfnewidfeydd crypto mwya\u0027r byd \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.ft.com/content/913ff750-d1f4-486a-9801-e05be20041c1\"\u003e(FTX) fis Tachwedd diwethaf\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOherwydd hyn, a phryderon ynghylch \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci/ghg\"\u003eallyriadau carbon cryptoarian\u003c/a\u003e, fe gwympodd yr asedau\u0027n llym yn 2022, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-30/does-crypto-owe-anyone-an-apology-after-2-trillion-of-losses\"\u003egan golli gwerth $2 triliwn\u003c/a\u003e (£1.5 triliwn).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnd er bod cryptoarian yn aml yn cael sylw, nid syniad newydd yw hwn.

The global cryptocurrency market has seen a number of recent setbacks: from the collapse of the Terra/Luna system in May 2022 to the failure of FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world. Because of these factors, and other concerns over cryptocurrencies’ carbon emissions, these assets lost US$2 trillion in value (£1.5 trillion) in 2022. But while cryptocurrencies get a lot of attention today, in some ways they are not a revolutionary concept. Hundreds of years ago, workers in Wales were often paid with alternative currencies instead of money. These currencies were physical tokens that represented and were linked to the value of real money. Many cryptocurrencies work in a similar way, acting as digital tokens that represent a ledger of financial assets (this is known as “tokenisation”). Digital currencies are also not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain their network of exchange. Again, this is similar to how physical tokens were used by Welsh mining companies. Towards the end of the 18th century the coinage of Britain was in a deplorable state due to the severe shortages of silver and copper coins. During the Industrial Revolution people migrated from the countryside into mining and manufacturing centres. But living in towns required money, and the ability to pay wages was impossible for businesses without small change. With an influx of new workers using money, new shops were opened to meet demand, creating more jobs that required payment in coins. Although the production of counterfeit coins was illegal and punishable by death, it was not illegal to produce tokens with other designs which could be used instead of coins. The first great era of token production during the first Industrial Revolution began in 1787 with the issue of the Parys Mining Company token. This company mined at Parys Mountain on the Welsh island of Anglesey. It briefly produced more copper than any other mine in the world during the Industrial Revolution. It also used the high-quality ore from its mine to produce tokens which could be exchanged for official coin at full value at any one of its shops or offices. This made the Parys Mining Company the first company in the world to issue tokens. These were described as the “premier tokens” of the 18th century by that era’s coin experts. Soon, practically every town in Britain was producing its own tokens. This was driven in part by a shortage of government coinage and improvements in coin manufacturing by Matthew Boulton’s Soho Mint in Birmingham, who also turned his hand to tokens. By the turn of the 19th century, the total supply and fast circulation of tokens, foreign coins and other substitutes probably exceeded those of the official coin of the country. The process of tokenisation was subsequently seen in other countries, in particular the United States. Mining and logging camps in the 19th century US were typically owned and operated by a single company, often in remote locations with poor access to cash. These companies would often pay their workers in “scrip”, or tokens. The workers, given the limited places they could spend scrips, had little choice but to purchase goods at company-owned stores. By placing large mark ups on goods, the company could increase their profits and enforce employee loyalty. While the production of tokens by the Parys Mining Company were spurred on by the first Industrial Revolution, the adoption and popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has been hastened by the fourth Industrial Revolution. Although they are more than 200 years apart, the history of these tokens have important lessons for today’s cryptocurrencies. First, for cryptocurrencies to succeed there needs to be various ways for individuals to accumulate the crypto/tokens, plus a demand and use for the crypto that means it holds its value, and trusted environments where exchange for goods and services can take place. And second, for cryptocurrencies to be successful and sustainable in the long term they must uphold their original purpose of having an ecosystem that remains independent of a single company or government. Efforts to lock cryptocurrencies to a single organisation do not look positive, for example Facebook’s failed attempt to launch a cryptocurrency, announced in 2019. The tokens of Welsh mining companies inherently failed when the closures of the mine or shops led to the removal of one or more of the three components of the ecosystem. And then people left with the tokens lost their money, a lesson for us today.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Edward Thomas Jones, Laurence Jones, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-06-27T16:00:54Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou can also read this article \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/dyma-beth-allair-byd-crypto-ei-ddysgu-or-arian-cyfredol-oedd-yn-cael-ei-dalu-i-weithwyr-yng-nghymru-canrifoedd-yn-ol-205424\"\u003ein Welsh\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe global cryptocurrency market has seen a number of recent setbacks: from the collapse of the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.ft.com/content/c10bc6f7-abbe-45dc-9367-042186c3336f\"\u003eTerra/Luna system in May 2022\u003c/a\u003e to the failure of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.ft.com/content/913ff750-d1f4-486a-9801-e05be20041c1\"\u003eFTX\u003c/a\u003e, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of these factors, and other concerns over cryptocurrencies’ \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci/ghg\"\u003ecarbon emissions\u003c/a\u003e, these assets \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-30/does-crypto-owe-anyone-an-apology-after-2-trillion-of-losses\"\u003elost US$2 trillion in value\u003c/a\u003e (£1.5 trillion) in 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut while cryptocurrencies get a lot of attention today, in some ways they are not a revolutionary concept.

This isn’t the first time Binance and Coinbase have caught the SEC’s attention – it’s not even the first time this year. But the latest charges are much more serious, including accusations that the exchanges are operating without the correct registration. Both cases boil down to whether or not cryptocurrency tokens should be classed as “securities”, like stocks, and regulated in the same way. Binance and Coinbase have spoken out in support of regulation. And many crypto firms believe that by taking legal action instead of creating clear rules, the SEC has failed to provide the industry with enough guidance, leading to uncertainty for people and businesses. Since Gary Gensler became chair of the SEC in April 2021, he has regularly testified before Senate committees on the need for more staff to regulate cryptocurrencies, calling the market a “wild west”. On the other hand, he has also said he has no plans to ban cryptocurrencies, while the SEC approved the first Bitcoin ETF in 2021, as well as Coinbase’s stock exchange listing that same year. But now the SEC has filed 13 charges against Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao, as well as a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance’s US affiliate (Binance is based in the Cayman Islands). The SEC has also accused both Binance and Coinbase of operating unregistered exchanges, and offering the sale of unregistered securities in the form of crypto tokens. Binance has pledged to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC’s “misguided and conscious refusal” to provide guidance and clarity on regulation to the cryptocurrency industry. Coinbase’s chief legal officer said in a statement to CNBC about the charges that “the SEC’s reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America’s economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance”. He called for legislation that “allows fair rules for the road to be developed transparently and applied equally, not litigation”. These cases are similar to another brought against a crypto company called Ripple Labs by the SEC in December 2020. It argues that XRP, Ripple’s cryptocurrency token, is an unregistered security. Ripple disputes this and expects to spend US$200 million (£156 million) fighting the suit, according to its CEO. He argues such cases are preventing US innovation around the blockchain technology that powers crypto trading. At the heart of this case is the question of whether Ripple’s token satisfies the Howey test, which would deem it a security, just like a stock or a bond, for regulation purposes. The test sets out three key criteria for deciding whether a financial product should come under securities regulations: According to the SEC, the first criterion is easily satisfied with crypto because fiat money or other digital assets are being exchanged. Likewise, the “common enterprise” test is also easily met when trading cryptocurrencies. The third criterion largely turns on whether digital assets come with an “expectation of profit to be derived from the efforts of others”. The most recent SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase go after the lifeblood of the cryptocurrency industry: the exchanges or platforms on which people trade, as opposed to the individual digital assets or tokens. These platforms enable investors to buy and sell cryptocurrencies easily without the need for expert knowledge of how blockchains work. The lawsuits have had an immediate and significant impact on crypto values. Coinbase customers pulled about US$1.28 billion from the exchange after the news broke, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Coinbase’s parent company, Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O), saw its shares close down US$7.10, or 12.1%, at US$51.61, after falling as much as 20.9% earlier on the day the charges were announced. In the meantime, customers withdrew around US$780 million from Binance and its US affiliate in the 24 hours following the lawsuit, according to Nansen. The Bitcoin market has rallied since, although Binance.US has stopped trading in a number of its cryptocurrencies. These latest lawsuits look like US regulators are drawing a line in the sand. If successful, these cases will limit US investors’ access to assets on these platforms and will also create further market uncertainty for companies and people. Research shows around 17% of people in the US have traded, invested in or used a cryptocurrency. If the crackdown by regulators cuts their access, these people may be able to use centralised exchanges in other countries, decentralised exchanges, or other means to trade cryptocurrencies. But regulators in other major financial markets could follow the SEC’s lead when it comes to crypto rules. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority recently announced new regulations for cryptocurrency firms operating in the country. This includes measures to ensure investors know the risks involved, that adverts are clear and not misleading, as well as a ban on “refer a friend” bonuses. But these rules will only affect the marketing of cryptocurrencies in the UK, so it’s a relatively small step. Cryptocurrency providers seem to want regulation to provide legitimacy and clear parameters in which to work. Given the borderless nature of cryptocurrencies, regulators need to align internationally or exchanges will simply move to “friendlier” jurisdictions. Global leadership is needed to establish how – and if – cryptocurrencies should be regulated. Without this, regulators like the SEC will struggle to corral the growing global crypto market.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Andrew Urquhart, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-06-16T14:52:20Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the cryptocurrency platform Coinbase shortly after launching a lawsuit against the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t the first time Binance and Coinbase have caught \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/what-binances-us-lawsuit-says-about-the-future-for-cryptocurrency-regulation-202930\"\u003ethe SEC’s attention – it’s not even the first time this year\u003c/a\u003e.

But a crash in public trust in cryptocurrencies like TerraUSD – and therefore a massive drop in their market value – doesn’t mean their underlying technology is also worthless. In fact, there are plenty of other uses for this type of system, which does not rely on centralized storage and where many people can participate securely, even if they don’t all know each other. As a computer scientist exploring new technologies for future smart communication network technologies, I, along with many engineers and developers, have shown that blockchain technology is a promising solution to many challenging problems in trust and security of next-generation network-based applications. I see several ways blockchains are proving themselves useful that aren’t tied to cryptocurrency. Modern global supply chains require a huge amount of information for the massive number of products being shipped around the world. They suffer from limits on data storage capacity, inefficient paper processes, disjointed data systems and incompatible data formats. These traditional centralized data storage methods cannot efficiently trace the origin of problems, like where a poor-quality product came from. Storing information on a blockchain improves integrity, accountability and traceability. For example, IBM’s Food Trust uses a blockchain system to track food items from the field to retailers. The participants in the food supply chain record transactions in the shared blockchain, which simplifies keeping track. Data ownership and privacy are top concerns in the health care industry. Current centralized systems cannot meet all the diverse needs of patients, health service providers, insurance companies and governmental agencies. Blockchain technology enables a decentralized system for access control of medical records where all stakeholders’ interests are protected. Blockchain systems not only allow health care service providers to securely share patients’ medical records but also enable patients to track who has accessed their records and determine who is authorized to do so. Banking and finance benefit from integrating blockchain networks into their business operations. Instead of trying to develop cryptocurrencies with new or different capabilities, the financial sector has recognized that blockchain systems are a reliable way to store information about traditional currencies like the dollar, euro and yen, as well as financial products. Blockchains provide consumers with the convenience of being able to monitor their transactions as they are processed, almost in real time from anywhere. Banks also benefit from blockchains, with the opportunity to conduct business between institutions more efficiently and securely. Today’s manual process of recording property rights is burdensome and inefficient. Traditional paper documentation is time-consuming, labor intensive, not transparent and vulnerable to loss. Blockchain technology eliminates inconvenience, inefficiency and errors, and reduces the cost by migrating the entire process into a digital form. Blockchain systems allow owners to trust that their deed is accurate and permanently recorded. Remote access is particularly meaningful to people living in areas without sufficient governmental or financial infrastructure. Validating votes and maintaining voter privacy seem like conflicting requirements. Blockchain systems hold promise as a means to facilitate a fair and transparent modern voting system. Because it’s almost impossible to tamper with a blockchain-enabled voting system, it can maintain a transparent electoral process. In the November 2018 midterm elections in West Virginia, a blockchain-based voting system was used and found to be secure and reliable. A smart city embeds information and communication technologies into its facilities, infrastructure and services to provide its residents a convenient, intelligent and comfortable living space. A smart city is essentially a network of many devices that can communicate with each other to share data. Connected devices can include people’s smartphones, vehicles, electrical meters, public safety monitoring systems and even homes. These systems have performance, security and privacy requirements that centralized information systems cannot handle. Blockchain is a key networking technology for building smart cities because it’s able to optimize operations, enhance security guarantees and increase mutual trust among participants. The future of information technology is all about decentralization. Today’s centralized architecture fails to meet the increasingly diverse needs of people who want freedom to personalize their own services, control their digital assets and more easily participate in democratic processes. Blockchain is a key enabling technology for building any secure and durable decentralized information system.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Yu Chen, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-06-06T12:30:55Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003ePeople hear a lot about blockchain technology in relation to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which rely on blockchain systems to keep records of financial transactions between people and businesses.

Countries such as Sweden, China, and India have establish pilot digital currencies – respectively, the e-krona, e-yuan and e-rupee – via their central banks. In the finance sector, these are known as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The purpose, scale and status of such efforts vary considerably. In Sweden, the goal is to investigate the potential transition from banknotes to a digital currency, and the e-krona remains in the starting blocks. In China, the “digital renminbi” started to roll out in 2020, and its goal is to allow the state to better control the retail economy. India launched an e-rupee pilot in 2022 and its purpose is to facilitate a broad range of transactions. Meanwhile, the United States is exploring the potential repercussions of establishing its own digital currency. Along the same lines, the European Union is currently toying with the idea of launching its own digital currency, the e-euro. As the European Central Bank (ECB) explains, it would provide a digital alternative to existing payment methods with the goal of increasing the security and stability of the EU’s monetary system. The e-euro would be held in digital wallets, with transactions facilitated by the use of blockchain. A crucial difference between the e-euro (a CBDC) and cryptocurrencies is that its overall quantity – the number in circulation – would not be capped. Because bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies aren’t issued by central banks, the number in circulation is limited by the fact that creating new ones requires “mining”, an energy-intensive process that involves solving extremely complicated math problems. Not the case with the e-euro, as it would be regulated by the European Central Bank and be linked directly to the euro itself – there will be no exchange rate, it would simply be the euro in another format. While there is a superficial similarity between the e-euro and “stablecoins” – cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to a major currency – the e-euro would be issued and controlled from a public entity. This will ensure stability in valuations and regulation. The 1 million euro question is why is the ECB would consider a digital currency. While we all have a centuries-long familiarity with physical currencies, digital ones have some advantages: Less resource intensive. A central bank digital currency doesn’t require printing, validation, circulation, monitoring and replacement, and thus would have a considerably lower ecological footprint. That it will be issued rather than mined adds to its energy efficiency. The International Monetary Fund estimates that a CBDC’s payment system for clearance and settlement could use hundreds of thousand of times less energy than physical currencies and cryptocurrencies while maintaining low transaction costs. Increased banking access. Because a digital euro would be directly managed by central banks, it would eliminate the need for intermediaries such as private financial institutions. It thus has the potential to reduce economic exclusion, such as in the cases of “the unbanked” – low-income people without bank accounts. The ECB would create and sustain the required infrastructure, making the e-euro available to all. For example, while private institutions would require a minimum credibility score to open an account, governments could facilitate access to money by opening digital wallets as part of a social policy agenda. Economic sovereignty. It can protect the euro from competing CBDC and other cryptocurrencies and thus defend Europe’s economic sovereignty. It will also allow governments to monitor transactions and so reduce tax avoidance and money laundering . Given the potential advantages of central bank digital currencies, what is holding countries back? Everything depends on how CBDCs are be designed and implemented, and some challenges that might overshadow any potential. Pushing back against private digital currencies. Imagine a world where private digital currencies like bitcoin or Facebook’s libra become the means for a substantial share of world’s financial transactions. In this world, the value of the means of exchange would be entirely determined by supply and demand or by the private venture – for example, Facebook itself. The introduction of CBDCs would enable central banks to determine the value of money itself and thus help ensure their country’s monetary sovereignty. People will still be able to choose between national currencies or those supported by private firms, but with the e-euro, Europe will at least be on an equal footing. Balancing security and privacy The basic principle of tangible money is anonymity. In its cash format, money can be exchanged for goods or services without necessarily disclosing one’s identity with every transaction. A fully secure digital currency would require that all transaction information be reported to the authorities, while a fully private one disclose no information. The former would give too much power to central authorities, while the latter would encourage tax avoidance and other nefarious behaviour. The traceability of blockchain can assist in tracking back the full financial history, but should the identity of the actor be public information? The e-euro is likely to operate in a semi-anonymous format to preserve a balance between security and privacy. More stability, less speculation. The initial idea of digital currencies was that they would become decentralized means of exchange, governed by the forces of supply and demand. However, they shortly became speculative assets, subject to vertiginous spikes and brutal crashes. Instead, a major currency should reflect the conditions of the real economy rather than speculation about its future state. So is the e-euro something that we need or want? This depends on how it will be designed and regulated. For this particular venture, given the complexity of EU regulation, the devil is in the details.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Iordanis Kalaitzoglou, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-05-31T14:07:29Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIn a bid to play catch up with technology companies and younger generations of consumers, central banks are finally starting to take digital currencies seriously.

According to Canadian manufacturers and exporters, counterfeiting — or the sale of products that purport to be something they are not — costs Canada between $20 billion and $30 billion annually. Canada is not the only country struggling with counterfeiting — the practice is prevalent in many other countries and across different industries. A 2017 World Health Organization study found that around 10 per cent of medicines sold in developing countries may be deceptively counterfeit. Similarly, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that 20 of 47 items purchased from third-party sellers such as Amazon, eBay and Sears Marketplace were counterfeits. Examples included counterfeit versions of 3M N95 masks on Amazon. Given the scale of this ongoing issue, Canadian governments and industries must come together to design new strategies that will protect Canadians while maintaining the country’s competitive advantage in the global marketplace. Several diverse factors contribute to the persistence of counterfeit goods in Canada. The first relates to consumer behaviour, as some buyers may intentionally buy (or fail to avoid) counterfeit goods out of shrewdness or economic necessity. Second, in terms of product quality, fakes can be very similar to the real thing. For example, the Canadian Intellectual Property Council reported that a counterfeit version of a particular Procter \u0026 Gamble shampoo was so close to the original even the company’s own sales force couldn’t tell the difference. Third, Canadian laws on counterfeit goods are notoriously lax, hindering effective enforcement. In fact, the Office of the United States Trade Representative has placed Canada on its watchlist of countries offering the weakest intellectual property (IP) protections. A fourth factor stems from outsourcing production to overseas suppliers. This leads to a form of counterfeiting called the “third shift.” After a business outsources production, the supplier uses the business’ IP rights to produce counterfeit products in the same factory the original product is made. Canadian home product manufacturer Umbra has been plagued by numerous suppliers using a third shift to reproduce its products. Finally, although some customers may rely on review systems to assess the authenticity of items they buy online, these systems are far from reliable. Counterfeit sellers have found ways to manipulate the review system — by purchasing fraudulent five-star reviews, for example. In light of these difficulties, Canada needs a carefully thought-out approach to mitigate counterfeiting. Because the source of counterfeit products is often the same factory that produces the original product, one remedy is to provide supplier factories with limited quantities of raw materials. Hewlett-Packard does this by providing its suppliers with a certain number of printheads that are used to manufacture ink cartridges for the company. Another solution is to allocate parts to different suppliers so that no one supplier has all the parts needed to build a particular product. At the same time, many emerging market governments are stepping up enforcement efforts to strengthen IP protections. In 2020, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation released an IP enforcement plan called Iron Fist to better protect the IP rights of various manufacturers. Similarly, India’s IP strategy is to “put greater emphasis on trademark enforcement.” The Philippine government’s recent IP legislation aims to “ensure efficient and expeditious adjudication of IP cases” and make “IP litigation less costly and faster.” For these governments, addressing IP protection is critical to ensuring manufacturers continue to feel comfortable outsourcing operations to their countries. As such, Canada should prioritize and incentivize outsourcing to countries that embrace IP protections. Businesses can also use technologies, such as radio-frequency identification or holograms, on their products to help customers identify counterfeits. Recently, blockchain technology has been considered as a promising solution to counterfeiting. Several blockchain-based applications have been launched with the aim of tagging products with unique identifiers that can’t be duplicated. Blockchain solution provider BlockPharma helps patients check the authenticity of their medicines, while luxury goods giant LVMH Group has partnered with blockchain firm ConsenSys and Microsoft to authenticate products. This tech-focused strategy aligns with the fact that governments around the world are increasingly encouraging blockchain adoption. The U.K. government, through Innovate UK, has pledged the equivalent of C$24 million to fund blockchain companies and the European Union Intellectual Property Office uses blockchain for anti-counterfeit. The many factors that increase Canada’s risk concerning counterfeits, including weak laws and IP protections, make this a challenging policy issue. However, anti-counterfeit strategies and the advent of new technologies like blockchain present opportunities for Canadian policymakers and industry leaders to develop an effective plan to combat counterfeiting. Together, Canada’s business and political leaders can build consumer trust while further building Canada’s global advantage.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hubert Pun, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2023-03-05T17:20:15Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eCounterfeiting is a chronic problem faced by Canadian consumers.

The uses for this technology are only likely to grow. There are some innovative uses of AI by businesses that may point to how people will be using the technology in future. The AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT is a high-profile example. Microsoft recently invested US$10 billion (£8.2 billion) investment in the chatbot’s parent company showing how seriously these online tools are being taken. It was seen by some journalists as the start of an “AI war” between Microsoft and Google. The latter company has been incorporating AI into its search engine to improve the answers people get. Jasper.ai is another forward-thinking use of AI. This online service generates written content for blogs, social media posts and letters. Meanwhile, Meta, the company that owns Facebook, is working on AI-powered software that can generate video from a text prompt, such as “teddy bear painting a portrait”. This is regarded as the next step on from online tools that generate images from text, such as DALL-E and Stable Diffusion.

An expert explains why it\u0027s so impressive The “metaverse” is intended to make the online world more like the real one, through the use of virtual reality (VR) headsets. Instead of interacting with a two-dimensional profile on social media, you would don your VR headset to be represented by an avatar in a 3D virtual world. Your avatar would be able to communicate with other ones in a space modelled on the real world. Online shops could take the form of 3D virtual spaces so customers could browse in much the same way they would in their everyday lives. A new wave of advanced VR headsets could help facilitate the metaverse. These could include advanced features such as eye tracking — which can make interactions with 3D worlds more instant and realistic — and facial expression detection, which would ensure 3D avatars replicate their users’ demeanours. Apple and Qualcomm are developing new VR headsets that could launch in 2023, but details of their features are being kept under wraps. YouTube and Meta are both building libraries of 360-degree video and images, as well as computer-generated objects and backgrounds that can be used to build the 3D environments that your avatar would explore in these virtual worlds. Read more: What is the metaverse, and what can we do there? The owners of 360-degree video and computer-generated landscapes designed for use in the metaverse will want to sell their digital creations. To prevent unauthorised use, a kind of token called an NFT can provide these items of digital content with certificates of authenticity and ownership. These non-fungible tokens allow the content to be bought and sold with confidence, something that’s increasingly happening with the use of cryptocurrency. In 2022, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter all introduced NFTs to their user and advertiser bases. Visa and Mastercard have also made buying NFTs possible with their credit and debit cards. Despite a recent drop in the NFT market, forecasts by the US stock exchange Nasdaq suggest the tokens could perform well in 2023. Read more: NFTs in the art world: A revolution or ripoff? A kind of digital record, or ledger, called a blockchain could help underpin private networks of people online, providing a safe space for them free from trolls, stalkers and fraud. Permission to view information can be restricted to a small number of people and the record of activity provided by blockchain can’t be changed. This means any unauthorised activity on the network is instantly traceable. And because information is stored across a network of computers rather than a single server, it is more difficult to hack. An example of an emerging type of online community that could make use of blockchain is a DAO (decentralised autonomous organisation). These networks have discarded the top-down management used elsewhere in favour of a more democratic form of governance with no central authority. A social platform called Mastodon shares many aspects with DAOs. It was recently in the news when more than a million users fled Twitter to the platform in the wake of Elon Musk’s takeover. Read more: Cryptocurrency-funded groups called DAOs are becoming charities – here are some issues to watch Businesses have taken note of the rise of social media influencers and are adopting their approach to reach target audiences. They are making use of what’s called an employee advocate, or “workfluencer”. Companies have realised that employees’ social media profiles and posts may better convey the brand than corporate accounts. When crafted thoughtfully, social media posts by employees can seem significantly more authentic to other users than corporate PR. People have grown more honest about day-to-day work life, rather than only producing stories on professional milestones and achievements. Organisations are likely to build procedures to encourage teams and employees to communicate and distribute material on the company’s behalf.

In early November 2022, the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, was valued at more than US$30 billion. By Nov. 14, FTX was in bankruptcy proceedings along with more than 100 companies connected to it. D. Brian Blank and Brandy Hadley are professors who study finance, investing and fintech. They explain how and why this incredible collapse happened, what effect it might have on the traditional financial sector and whether you need to care if you don’t own any cryptocurrency. In 2019, Sam Bankman-Fried founded FTX, a company that ran one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. FTX is where many crypto investors trade and hold their cryptocurrency, similar to the New York Stock Exchange for stocks. Bankman-Fried is also the founder of Alameda Research, a hedge fund that trades and invests in cryptocurrencies and crypto companies. Within the traditional financial sector, these two companies would be separate firms entirely or at least have divisions and firewalls in place between them. But in early November 2022, news outlets reported that a significant proportion of Alameda’s assets were a type of cryptocurrency released by FTX itself. A few days later, news broke that FTX had allegedly been loaning customer assets to Alameda for risky trades without the consent of the customers and also issuing its own FTX cryptocurrency for Alameda to use as collateral. As a result, criminal and regulatory investigators began scrutinizing FTX for potentially violating securities law. These two pieces of news basically led to a bank run on FTX. Large crypto investors, like FTX’s competitor Binance, as well as individuals, began to sell off cryptocurrency held on FTX’s exchange. FTX quickly lost its ability to meet customer withdrawals and halted trading. On Nov. 14, FTX was also hit by an apparent insider hack and lost $600 million worth of cryptocurrency. That same day, FTX, Alameda Research and 130 other affiliated companies founded by Bankman-Fried filed for bankruptcy. This action may leave more than a million suppliers, employees and investors who bought cryptocurrencies through the exchange or invested in these companies with no way to get their money back. Among the groups and individuals who held currency on the FTX platform were many of the normal players in the crypto world, but a number of more traditional investment firms also held assets within FTX. Sequoia Capital, a venture capital firm, as well as the Ontario Teacher’s Pension, are estimated to have held millions of dollars of their investment portfolios in ownership stake of FTX. They have both already written off these investments with FTX as lost. In traditional markets, corporations generally limit the risk they expose themselves to by maintaining liquidity and solvency. Liquidity is the ability of a firm to sell assets quickly without those assets losing much value. Solvency is the idea that a company’s assets are worth more than what that company owes to debtors and customers. But the crypto world has generally operated with much less caution than the traditional financial sector, and FTX is no exception. About two-thirds of the money that FTX owed to the people who held cryptocurrency on its exchange – roughly $11.3 billion of $16 billion owed – was backed by illiquid coins created by FTX. FTX was taking its customers’ money, giving it to Alameda to make risky investments and then creating its own currency, known as FTT, as a replacement – cryptocurrency that it was unable to sell at a high enough price when it needed to. In addition, nearly 40% of Alameda’s assets were in FTX’s own cryptocurrency – and remember, both companies were founded by the same person. This all came to a head when investors decided to sell their coins on the exchange. FTX did not have enough liquid assets to meet those demands. This in turn drove the value of FTT from over $26 a coin at the beginning of November to under $2 by Nov. 13. By this point, FTX owed more money to its customers than it was worth. In regulated exchanges, investing with customer funds is illegal. Additionally, auditors validate financial statements, and firms must publish the amount of money they hold in reserve that is available to fund customer withdrawals. And even if things go wrong, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation – or SIPC – protects depositors against the loss of investments from an exchange failure or financially troubled brokerage firm. None of these guardrails are in place within the crypto world. As a result of this meltdown, the company Binance is now considering creating an industry recovery fund – akin to a private version of SIPC insurance – to avoid future failures of crypto exchanges. But while the collapse of FTX and Alameda – valued at more than $30 billion and now essentially worth nothing – is dramatic, the bigger implication is simply the potential lost trust in crypto. Bank runs are rare in traditional financial institutions, but they are increasingly common in the crypto space. Given that Bankman-Fried and FTX were seen as some of the biggest, most trusted figures in crypto, these events may lead more investors to think twice about putting money in crypto. Though investment in cryptocurrencies has grown rapidly, the entire crypto market – valued at over $3 trillion at its peak – is much smaller than the $120 trillion traditional stock market. While investors and regulators are still evaluating the consequences of this fall, the impact on any person who doesn’t personally own crypto will be minuscule. It is true that many larger investment funds, like BlackRock and the Ontario Teachers Pension, held investments in FTX, but the estimated $95 million the Ontario Teachers Pension lost through the collapse of FTX is just 0.05% of the entire fund’s investments. The takeaway for most individuals is not to invest in unregulated markets without understanding the risks. In high-risk environments like crypto, it’s possible to lose everything – a lesson investors in FTX are learning the hard way.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"D.

But it is not only regulators that bear responsibility for protecting people, the industry should also look at new models that could help. The recent collapse of FTX – which has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US, but was valued at US$32 billion earlier this year – has had significant repercussions for the entire cryptocurrency industry. Even the most established digital currency, Bitcoin, hit a two-year low following the FTX woes. Cryptocurrencies allow traders or investors to buy and sell without the need for banks and brokerages. Blockchain technology enables peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions to happen on exchanges such as FTX and its rival Binance without these middlemen. Instead, transactions are authenticated through consensus by a group of validators, typically called miners. Miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to do this, otherwise known as the proof of work system used by Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies. But when it comes to organising these transactions, Binance and its peers use the same “limit order book” model as any traditional exchange such the New York Stock Exchange. This means there is a centralised structure that matches buyers and sellers, with market makers supplying liquidity and charging traders for transactions. This kind of structure has exacerbated recent events in the crypto space to some extent. FTX’s centralised model allowed it to make loans to distressed crypto firms earlier this year. It also used exchange-issued tokens (FTT) to round out its sister company’s books. This increases the risk of exposure to a market collapse. But an emerging model, decentralised exchanges, operates under different rules for pricing cryptocurrencies and for governance that could reduce such risks. They allow investors to buy and sell tokens at an algorithmically determined price. This automated model does not rely on professional market makers, instead individual investors supply liquidity and collect a portion of fees from trades. Like many decentralised exchanges, Uniswap, which launched in 2018, has a governance token called UNI that individual users of the exchange can use to cast votes in decisions about how the exchange operates. In principle, no centralised entity can manipulate system decisions voted through by owners of these coins. This helps the users of the exchange to retain control over what’s happening with their funds. Estimates suggest that up to 49,000 addresses on the Ethereum blockchain hold UNI tokens and 60% of tokens are held by investors. Another issue that plagued FTX in its final days was that it is custodial, which means it had the right to suspend withdrawals of cryptocurrency by investors. FTX’s decision to ban withdrawals by investors meant many people have been refused access to money they used to trade on the exchange. Decentralised exchanges are non-custodial, so they allow individual investors full access to their crypto wallet balances and they can withdraw or deposit liquidity or stop trading at any time with no risk of their assets being frozen by the exchange. One downside of decentralised exchanges versus centralised models such as FTX and Binance, however, is that they don’t allow traders to exchange fiat (traditional currencies issued by governments or countries) for crypto – they can only trade different cryptocurrencies on the exchange. The size of any trade will depend on the size of the liquidity pool, so if the latter is too small, a trader could find it difficult to make their desired transaction happen. Which type of exchange is likely dominate crypto trading in the future depends on several factors. As some customers have withdrawn their crypto deposits from FTX over the past week, approximately 60% of the outflows reportedly went to FTX rival Binance. In the short term, the outflows of investors from FTX to Binance will increase its market share of crypto trading. This additional liquidity on Binance will help it to continue to dominate because it will be able to offer lower transaction costs. But when activity is concentrated in fewer exchanges, more customers are exposed to the risk of any individual crypto provider or large trader failing. And the industry is only becoming more concentrated following recent market failures. Greater concentration means greater risk of contagion. And over time, decentralised exchanges will be able to become more competitive and lower their transaction costs too. This is in part due to the development of “scaling solutions” – protocols (or sets of rules) that increase activity and transaction speeds without affecting decentralisation. This will also help to bring down the amount investors must pay to validate their transactions on the blockchain, making it less costly to trade. And while traditional financial markets are heavily regulated, crypto is not, something that looks likely to change following FTX’s recent difficulties, as well as the events of this year. The importance of developing more official structures for the cryptocurrency market has become even more apparent. Regulators have already started to investigate FTX lending products and management of customer funds after its collapse. But what else can they do?  As Binance’s CEO has recently suggested on Twitter (above), one way to prevent a repeat of the FTX failure would be to monitor crypto exchange assets in real time rather than relying on annual reports with (in some cases) gross inaccuracies. This is already possible. An independent third party can provide “proof of reserves”. This means the organisation publishes audit reports to provide an independent review of the balance sheet of an exchange, tracking the flows of money in and out of investors’ exchange wallets. This would flag up potential systemic failures due to unexpected activity, such as the use of exchange reserves to make loans to crypto firms, as described already with FTX. Financial regulators also need to adopt an appropriate risk assessment framework for cryptocurrencies. This should include independent audits and stress-testing of on-chain data (information about transactions on a blockchain network). Regulations could be imposed to restrict the use of an exchange’s tokens to make loans to crypto firms. More customer protection could also prevent exchanges from suspending withdrawals, leaving traders unable to access money held by an exchange that is in trouble. Even amid the “crypto winter”, all is not lost for crypto. Appropriate regulations and new models could help the industry to recover and strengthen, perhaps even encouraging further adoption of decentralised finance in mainstream financial markets.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ganesh Viswanath-Natraj, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-11-14T17:04:21Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe founder of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, has called for more regulatory clarity after a week of crypto market chaos and a year in which investors are estimated to have lost \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/11/crypto-peaked-in-nov-2021-investors-lost-more-than-2-trillion-since.html\"\u003eUS$2 trillion\u003c/a\u003e (£1.7 trillion).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We do need to increase the clarity of regulations and the sophistication of regulations in the crypto space,” Zhao said to \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/binance-ceo-says-crypto-industry-needs-clarity-regulations-2022-11-14/\"\u003ea gathering of G20 leaders\u003c/a\u003e at a summit in Bali.

While microcredentials are becoming more popular, the concept is hardly new: A driver’s licence or the St. John Ambulance certificate could be considered as microcredentials, attesting respectively to a person’s driving skill or their competency in administering first aid. Blockchain technology is appropriate for microcredential implementation. Blockchain can best be described as a digital ledger that records information that can be shared among a community of users. Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are the best-known examples of blockchain, but blockchain has uses beyond financial transactions. Student records stored in blockchain for security limit access only to legitimate users, such as institutional administrators and potential employers selected by students or job seekers. Traditionally, institutions own and control certifications like degrees, but that could shift with “digital degrees” and microcredentials that rely on blockchain. Besides providing effective security and privacy for users, blockchain can also facilitate the maintenance and dissemination of the credentials, while ensuring that access is readily available for students under their control. Because of its immutability, blockchain can be used to attest to and verify students’ accomplishments. This is important for students seeking to have their credits recognized whether because they are studying to obtain new professional accreditation, studying in multiple institutions or because they are moving for study or employment. Blockchain is distributed, meaning that multiple copies of the same information are stored on different computers. So, blockchain is not controlled by any central authority and the “blocks” in the “chain,” linked chronologically, are shared in a P2P (peer-to-peer) network, which can be accessed from any node or point on the network. These blocks are immutable, as any change to the original leaves the first iteration intact and accessible. When students or job seekers want to have credits transferred between institutions, gatekeepers — for example, post-secondary institutions or employers — typically insist on receiving copies of diplomas and degrees directly from each institution. As more students gain credentials from multiple institutions, this process becomes increasingly untenable. Students need to control this process and blockchain can provide a solution. In 2019, McMaster University announced it was awarding “digital degrees” using blockchain to Faculty of Engineering students after the university implemented microcredentials using blockchain to securely validate students’ learning. Some post-secondary institutions are implementing pilot projects with eCampus Ontario and industry partners to award microcredentials using blockchain. Microcredentials are now offered by post-secondary institutions, sometimes in partnership with corporations to target labour market needs. These may come in the form of “digital badges.” Digital badges are easily verifiable testaments to when, where and how skills have been mastered. Meta data in digital badges allows viewers to click on the badge to learn things like criteria for earning the badge, the date it was issued or when it expires. Certification by blockchain begins when a trusted institution issues the microcredential and creates a blockchain. The student then sends a public key password to the institution, requesting a transcript be sent to a potential employer. The institution then adds a block onto the blockchain and sends the micro-credential, which is verified and forwarded to the potential employer. The learners can keep private keys to their credentials in an offline digital wallet. Maintaining the privacy of the data is essential. With blockchain, the ownership of the microcredential rests with the individual, not the institution. Blockchain supports more control for students and has the capability of further democratizing education. It empowers students to maintain control of their now-secure credentials and allows them to be confident their acquired skills and knowledge will be valued. However, there are some ethical and logistical concerns. Right now, when a person seeks to transfer credits through traditional channels, they can choose which documents or certifications to share with employers: mistakes, or aspects of one’s past credentials and experience deemed less salient or undesirable can be addressed or ignored. But blockchain is immutable and this immutability can cause its own problems when mistakes cannot be erased. Read more: Protecting the \u0027right to be forgotten\u0027 in the age of blockchain Students cannot omit blocks from the chain that they do not feel are appropriate or that could damage their reputation. So, how can they create different narratives for diverse purposes or highlight and/or hide different experiences? What happens if someone wants or needs to start anew? Is there a right to forget? What if a student loses their key? The New York Times reports that lost passwords have locked millionaires out of their bitcoin fortunes. Will students and workers fare any better when it comes to academic and professional records? Who will respond to these problems within institutions? These are questions post-secondary institutions and our society at large will increasingly need to navigate.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Rory McGreal, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-10-03T18:13:05Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003ciframe style\u003d\"width: 100%; height: 100px; border: none; position: relative; z-index: 1;\" allowtransparency\u003d\"\" allow\u003d\"clipboard-read; clipboard-write\" src\u003d\"https://narrations.ad-auris.com/widget/the-conversation-canada/why-blockchain-could-mean-fewer-hassles-for-students-and-workers-proving-their-credentials\" width\u003d\"100%\" height\u003d\"400\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMicrocredentials — attestations of proficiency in \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.collegesinstitutes.ca/policyfocus/micro-credentials\"\u003ea specific skill or knowledge base\u003c/a\u003e that are certified by an authority — can provide evidence of a person’s skills to employers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile microcredentials are becoming more popular, the concept is hardly new: A driver’s licence or the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.sjayork.ca/certificate-information-reprints\"\u003eSt. John Ambulance certificate\u003c/a\u003e could be considered as microcredentials, attesting respectively to a person’s driving skill or their competency in administering first aid.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlockchain technology is \u003ca href\u003d\"https://auspace.athabascau.ca/handle/2149/3655\"\u003eappropriate for microcredential implementation\u003c/a\u003e.

It offers people an interactive social experience where users are represented by avatars. Users can teleport through different virtual social worlds, participate in events and make transactions using cryptocurrencies. By 2026, it is predicted that 25 per cent of people will spend at least one hour a day in the metaverse. There, they’ll be able to participate in activities such as working and shopping, and 30 per cent of firms will have their products and services ready for the metaverse. The metaverse — which includes blockchains and cryptocurrencies — is still in its early stages. As its possibilities expand, it’s important to consider the potential threats and dangers as the metaverse introduces risks related to legislation, property, control, fraud, privacy threats, ethics and security. As researchers interested in forensic accounting and digital fraud, we have attempted to identify the risks that are unique to the metaverse. The metaverse appears to be a foray into developing new models of conducting business online. And as such, can we anticipate the related risks? Are current laws applicable to the metaverse? How are we protected from fraud in the metaverse?  While the metaverse offers new opportunities for firms and customers, as a nascent technology, it comes with multiple risks. Breaches in ethics are possible. For example, do firms consider whether their code of ethics has been updated to account for expansion into the metaverse? How do customers and employees behave in the metaverse? Is sensitive information protected? Legal issues will relate to intellectual property rights, the regulation of virtual assets, privacy and gambling. Firms considering using the metaverse should anticipate intellectual property rights, in particular those related to terms of service agreements and end-user license agreements. The metaverse can bring many fraud risks, such as market manipulation, cyber breaches and attacks, privacy breaches, money laundering, corporate espionage and identity theft. Unlike traditional social media platforms, users have no guarantee that the data they share is only shared with those they choose to share it with in the metaverse. That means user identities can be tracked and revealed As one researcher explains: “We cannot just turn off who can follow our avatars in the metaverse as we can do in the traditional social media.” Personal information, such as biometric data, can be collected through the metaverse and in turn used for marketing purposes. Organizations using the metaverse need to ensure data is anonymized and users cannot be identifiable. The rapid development of the metaverse has also brought risks related to cryptocurrencies, which are already subjected to very little official regulation. Scams could potentially flourish in the metaverse — and at worse, become normalized as a metaverse experience. Risks in the metaverse can be mitigated by corporations and governments implementing controls that ensure users and administrators are protected. These are steps that can be taken to deter, prevent and detect fraud in the metaverse. In our research on identifying potential fraud in the metaverse, we identified two sets of actions: macro, which take place at the government level, and micro, which affect corporations. At the government level: Specific regulation is needed for the metaverse, possibly in the form of a new Metaverse Act that encompasses metaverse transactions and actions; Increased oversight by government bodies, such as financial authorities; Establishment of an international and global authority to oversee the metaverse; Co-operation with businesses to share information that will reduce risks and prevent malicious use and unethical behaviour and misinformation in the metaverse; Regulatory bodies should require or encourage organizations to disclose how they mitigate metaverse risks, what resources they have, and how they protect users from identity theft, misinformation, cyber threats and privacy breaches. At the level of individual corporations or organizations active in the metaverse, here are some steps that can be taken: Adopt a comprehensive internal approach within different departments (for example auditing, marketing and finance departments) to identify weaknesses when processes are implemented in the metaverse; Implement measures that regulate avatar behaviour on different platforms to ensure users conform to community standards; Employment of artificial intelligence to combat fraud and scams; Update codes of ethics and whistleblowing programs to protect whistleblowers and facilitate whistleblowing channels; Ensure that an adequate program is in place to mitigate and respond to metaverse threats. Boards of directors, governance bodies and management should be trained and able to co-ordinate efforts to combat the emergence and the expansion of crime in the metaverse. Training and education are the first steps in establishing an efficient metaverse anti-fraud program.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nadia Smaili, Audrey de Rancourt-Raymond, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-09-07T19:38:58Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003ciframe style\u003d\"width: 100%; height: 100px; border: none; position: relative; z-index: 1;\" allowtransparency\u003d\"\" allow\u003d\"clipboard-read; clipboard-write\" src\u003d\"https://narrations.ad-auris.com/widget/the-conversation-canada/we-need-to-anticipate-and-address-potential-fraud-in-the-metaverse\" width\u003d\"100%\" height\u003d\"400\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe metaverse is a virtual online world that people can access in a variety of ways, including through virtual and augmented reality.

That’s both good news and bad","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Cryptocurrencies have become popular in African and other developing countries. That’s according to a policy brief released recently by UNCTAD, a United Nations agency. Significant proportions of Kenya (8.5%), South Africa (7.1%) and Nigeria’s (6.3%) populations are using these digital currencies. In June, the Central African Republic adopted bitcoin as a legal tender. The report warns that widespread use of unregulated digital currencies poses danger to the continent’s financial system. In an interview with The Conversation Africa, Iwa Salami, an expert in financial technology law and regulation, examines the future of digital currencies in Africa. Cryptocurrencies have gained acceptance among a large proportion of the low-income population that was, previously, financially marginalised. Most banks in Africa were not accessible to this segment. Even when they were, low-income account holders were discouraged by high transaction costs. Another factor is economic stagnation compounded by debt crises and political instability in African economies since the era of independence. This has resulted in weak currencies ravaged by inflation in countries like Kenya and Nigeria. Cryptocurrencies promised to address both financial exclusion and the problem of weak domestic currencies. Cryptocurrency gives everyone with access to a mobile device and internet connectivity the opportunity to engage in activities similar to those conducted through financial institutions and intermediaries. That includes payments, sending remittances and making investments. Investment is particularly inviting to the technically savvy. It gives them the opportunity to hold assets that aren’t affected by rising inflation and depreciating domestic currencies. Cryptocurrencies are also quicker, cheaper and easier to use than conventional methods. That’s because the technology facilitates peer-to-peer transactions rather than relying on intermediaries. These currencies were more accessible than traditional banks during the pandemic and lockdowns. This further drove their use and growth across Africa. This can facilitate economic activity in African countries. People with no access to banks and banking services are able to pay for goods and services using cryptos. Crypto transactions are also believed to be a more secure way of transacting. Unless someone gains access to the private key for your crypto wallet, they cannot sign transactions or access your funds. The system also facilitates transparency. All cryptocurrency transactions take place on the publicly distributed blockchain ledger. There are tools that allow anyone to look up transaction data – including where, when, and how much of a cryptocurrency someone sent from a wallet address. First, cryptocurrencies are very complex. They require a bit of technological astuteness to embrace. A significant proportion of the adult population in sub-Saharan Africa (34.7%) is illiterate and may not be able to grasp it. This, to a certain extent, turns the financial inclusion argument on its head. Secondly, although it is argued that the blockchain is a more secure way of transacting, the downside, of course, is that if you lose your private key there’s no way to recover your funds. This is a threat that does not exist if you have a bank account. Thirdly, cryptocurrencies have had a history of volatility, (as is currently being experienced in the crypto market). This has adversely affected retail investors, especially those who do not understand this type of asset class. Another issue of profound concern to African states is the potential threat to monetary sovereignty. Should crypto ever be more widely used than domestic fiat currency, national monetary agencies such as central banks may not be able to steer their economies to a path of growth using monetary policy. Such policy is, after all, primarily administered through domestic currencies. An associated threat is the weakening of effective capital controls in African states. These are needed to prevent capital flight from domestic economies. Any weakening can result in significant volatility in currency rates and the rapid depreciation of domestic currencies. Read more: Decentralised finance calls into question whether the crypto industry can ever be regulated There are also threats to financial stability. This could arise from significant exposure that financial institutions, like banks, have to crypto firms such as through loans. Regulation in some African countries, such as Nigeria addresses this by restricting transactions between banks and crypto assets service providers. Despite the ongoing downturn in the market, cryptocurrency represents the future of finance and financial transactions. And there are indications that cryptocurrencies are here to stay which is seen from their increasing recognition by countries. At one extreme, the governments of El Salvador and the Central African Republic have adopted bitcoin as legal tender, although the implementation and impact of this on their broader economies have been faced with severe criticisms. Others, such as Nigeria, have recognised the need for state representation of digital currencies in the form of central bank digital currencies. Many other countries are now exploring this option. It is important to note, however, that the uptake of central bank digital currencies has been very low in developing countries that have rolled them out. There are also ongoing investigations by countries into the economic impact of central bank digital currencies and whether adoption is the right approach. Read more: Nigeria\u0027s digital currency: what the eNaira is for and why it\u0027s not perfect But if cryptocurrencies are to live up to their promise, both on the African continent and elsewhere, there must be a globally coordinated and holistic approach to regulation, since transactions are global. Although some action on this front is emerging, the current fragmented approach to regulation across the world is not ideal.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Iwa Salami, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-07-25T13:57:22Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eCryptocurrencies have become popular in African and other developing countries.

In the food and grocery industry, however, trust has become an essential element for increasingly demanding consumers after a decade of scandals such as the horsemeat fraud in 2013 and the Pret à Manger mislabeling in 2016. This year, examples of Nestle’s Buitoni Pizza and Ferrero’s Kinder were found to be contaminated with E. coli. For food-industry supply chains, the two key trust enhancers are traceability and transparency. Traceability requires cooperation and sharing of information between different actors of the supply chain, ensuring efficiency and reducing risk. Transparency includes disclosure, knowledge sharing, and clarity. It has become one of the key value drivers for food, alongside more traditional factors such as price and taste. The blockchain functions as a distributed ledger of all transactions that have been executed between users belonging to a network, thus serving as a secure and transparent information storage and transmission technology. It thus has the potential to provide the trust enhancers required by the food industry. Through the consensus mechanism, the blockchain network also bypasses the need for an intermediary and automates the trust in the whole system, disrupting the way transactions and processes occur compared to the current traditional system. Today, new consumer demands are pushing companies to rethink the way they engage and communicate their information to stakeholders, shedding light onto every step of the supply chain. Among the various existing traceability options, blockchain has particularly gained popularity because it allows real-time tracking and visibility and access to every transaction in the supply chain process. A number of companies have begun to adopt blockchain, including the retail industry. In 2017, IBM has launched its first version of the Food Trust followed by a commercial version released in 2020 after 18 months of testing. Designed exclusively for businesses, the platform aims to help food companies ensure traceability and brings together distributors, suppliers, manufacturers and other stakeholders in the food chain, aiming to connect these players through an immutable and shared record of food system data. – It was the American giant Walmart that started the trend in early 2018 with the aim of optimising food quality and traceability. Carrefour followed suit in Europe and started to gradually integrate the technology across several food supply chains by launching a food blockchain in the sectors of chicken, eggs, tomatoes, and milk production. Simply scan your product via a QR code and you will find all the traceability information about the product in question such as the location of the hatchery, the date, the details of the breeding and slaughterhouse, the batch number of the slaughter and the day of its departure to Carrefour, as well as the delivery in your local supermarket and the use-by date. A study we conducted on a French retail leader that integrates blockchain into some of its products shows traceability systems have become more efficient over time. The technology allows the management of product identification, the secure sharing of data – without possible alteration – between the actors of the supply chain, and a faster recovery of data. The blockchain is a distributed ledger of all the links in the production chain where each party records and signs its information on a transparent, secure and immutable blockchain platform. All this information is then aggregated on a database and then put in place on an easy-to-access interface via the QR code of each product. The video below is a use case of the blockchain at Carrefour and applied to several products. Food traceability technology can track food across all phases of its supply chain, allowing customers to see the complete history of food items and information such as certifications, harvest dates, packaging dates, and temperature data via a simple QR product scan. The blockchain presents itself as a promising technology offering many features to guarantee trust, traceability, as well as product quality and food waste reduction. The biggest challenge for its expansion remains its technological complexity, however. Companies would need to build technological and human skills to successfully implement it within an organisation. The technology could also benefit from more processing speed that is needed to scale it up, a more affordable data storage, and reduced energy usage.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ghassan Paul Yacoub, Maria Castillo, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-06-16T20:44:25Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eDespite attempts to label the blockchain as a disruptive \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.economist.com/leaders/2015/10/31/the-trust-machine\"\u003e“trust machine”\u003c/a\u003e, the tangible business applications of this nascent technology have yet to take shape in practice and be more visible for customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the food and grocery industry, however, trust has become an essential element for increasingly demanding consumers after a decade of scandals such as the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/15/horsemeat-scandal-the-essential-guide\"\u003ehorsemeat fraud\u003c/a\u003e in 2013 and the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/03/pret-a-manger-to-bring-in-full-labelling-teenagers-death-natasha-ednan-laperouse\"\u003ePret à Manger mislabeling\u003c/a\u003e in 2016.

Thousands of virtual worlds already exist, some gaming oriented, like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home\"\u003eFortnite\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.roblox.com/\"\u003eRoblox\u003c/a\u003e, others more open-ended, like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.minecraft.net/en-us\"\u003eMinecraft\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://animal-crossing.com/new-horizons/\"\u003eAnimal Crossing: New Horizons\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond virtual worlds, the list of metaverse technologies typically includes avatars, nonplayer characters and bots; virtual reality; cryptocurrency, blockchain and non-fungible tokens; social networks from Facebook and Twitter to Discord and Slack; and mobile devices like phones and augmented reality interfaces. Often included as well are principles like interoperability – the idea that identities, friendship networks and digital items like avatar clothes \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-metaverse-2-media-and-information-experts-explain-165731\"\u003eshould be capable of moving between virtual worlds\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is that humans don’t categorize by laundry lists. Instead, decades of research in cognitive science has shown that \u003ca href\u003d\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-97828-003\"\u003emost categories are “radial,” with a central prototype\u003c/a\u003e. One could define “bird” in terms of a laundry list of traits: has wings, flies and so on. But the prototypical bird for North Americans looks something like a sparrow. Hummingbirds and ducks are further from this prototype. Further still are flamingos and penguins. Yet all are birds, radiating out from the socially specific prototype.

Virtual worlds are prototypical for the metaverse. Other elements of the laundry list radiate outward and won’t appear in all cases. And what’s involved will be socially specific. It will look different in Alaska than it will in Addis Ababa, or when at work versus at a family gathering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhose idea of essential?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis matters because one of the most insidious rhetorical moves currently underway is to assert that some optional aspect of the metaverse is prototypical. For instance, many pundits define the metaverse as \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/metaverse-stocks/metaverse-crypto/\"\u003ebased on blockchain technology\u003c/a\u003e and cryptocurrencies. But many existing virtual worlds use means other than blockchain for confirming ownership of digital assets. Many use national currencies like the U.S. dollar, or metaverse currencies pegged to a national currency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother such rhetorical move appears when Clegg uses an \u003ca href\u003d\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*_dujMK5Pp2ZZO1EdLrvfpg.png\"\u003eimage of a building\u003c/a\u003e with a foundation and two floors to argue not only that interoperability will be part of “the foundations of the building” but that it’s “\u003ca href\u003d\"https://nickclegg.medium.com/making-the-metaverse-what-it-is-how-it-will-be-built-and-why-it-matters-3710f7570b04\"\u003ethe common theme across these floors\u003c/a\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Clegg’s warning that “without a significant degree of interoperability baked into each floor, the metaverse will become fragmented” ignores how interoperability isn’t prototypical for the metaverse.

Left unsaid in Clegg’s essay is the “foundation” of Meta’s profit model: tracking users across the metaverse to \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.markettradingessentials.com/2021/07/heres-how-zuckerberg-thinks-facebook-will-profit-by-building-a-metaverse/\"\u003etarget advertising and potentially sell digital goods\u003c/a\u003e with maximum effectiveness. Recognizing “metaverse” as a radial category reveals that Clegg’s claim about interoperability isn’t a statement of fact.

It’s the conceptual work that will fundamentally shape design, policy, profit, community and the digital future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClegg’s essay concludes optimistically that “time is on our side” because many metaverse technologies won’t be fully realized for a decade or more. But \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/97779/you-are-not-a-gadget-by-jaron-lanier/\"\u003eas the VR pioneer Jaron Lanier has noted\u003c/a\u003e, when definitions about digital technology get locked in they become difficult to dislodge.

Whereas with today’s bank accounts, there is always the outside possibility that customers are unable to withdraw money because of a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bankrun.asp\"\u003ebank run\u003c/a\u003e, that can’t happen with CBDCs because all deposits would be 100% backed by reserves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday’s retail banks are required to keep little or no deposits in reserve, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/details/further-details-about-banking-sector-regulatory-capital-data\"\u003ethough they\u003c/a\u003e do have \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2022/html/ssm.pr220210%7E6455538b07.en.html\"\u003eto hold\u003c/a\u003e a proportion of their capital (meaning easily sold assets) as protection in case their lending books run into trouble. For example, eurozone banks’ minimum requirement is 15.1%, meaning if they have capital of €1 billion (£852 million), their lending book cannot exceed €6.6 billion (that’s 6.6 times deposits).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn an era of CBDCs, we assume that people will still have bank accounts – to have their money invested by a fund manager, for instance, or to make a return by having it loaned out to someone else on the first person’s behalf. Our idea is that the 100% reserve protection in central bank wallets should extend to these retail bank accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat would mean that if a person put 1,000 digital euros into a retail bank account, the bank could not multiply that deposit by opening more accounts than they could pay upon request. The bank would have to make money from its other services instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt present, the ECB holds about 25% of EU members’ government debt. Imagine that after transitioning to a digital euro, it decided to increase this holding to 30% by buying new sovereign bonds issued by member states.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo pay for this, it would create new digital euros – just like what happens today when \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/quantitative-easing-now-looks-permanent-and-has-turned-central-banks-into-pseudo-governments-130098\"\u003equantitative easing (QE)\u003c/a\u003e is used to prop up the economy. Crucially, for each unit of central bank money created in this way, the money circulating in the wider economy increases by a lot more: in the eurozone, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ebbox201706_07_1.en.pdf?f307ee1c10fc673686926c27caa18c7a\"\u003eit roughly triples\u003c/a\u003e. This is essentially because QE drives up the value of bonds and other assets, and as a result, retail banks are more willing to lend to people and firms. This increase in the money supply is why QE can cause inflation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf there was a 100% reserve requirement on retail banks, however, you wouldn’t get this multiplication effect. The money created by the ECB would be that amount and nothing more. Consequently, QE would be much less inflationary than today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe debt benefit\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo where does national debt fit in? The high national debt levels in many countries are predominantly the result of the global financial crisis of 2007-09, the eurozone crisis of the 2010s and the COVID pandemic. In the eurozone, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/countries-by-national-debt\"\u003ecountries with very high debt\u003c/a\u003e as a proportion of GDP include Belgium (100%), France (99%), Spain (96%), Portugal (119%), Italy (133%) and Greece (174%).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne way to deal with high debt is to create a lot of inflation to make the value of the debt smaller, but that also makes citizens poorer and is liable to eventually cause unrest. But by taking advantage of the shift to CBDCs to change the rules around retail bank reserves, governments can go a different route.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe opportunity is during the transition phase, by reversing the process in which creating money to buy bonds adds three times as much money to the real economy. By selling bonds in exchange for today’s euros, every one euro removed by the central bank leads to three disappearing from the economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndeed, this is how digital euros would be introduced into the economy. The ECB would gradually sell sovereign bonds to take the old euros out of circulation, while creating new digital euros to buy bonds back again. Because the 100% reserve requirement only applies to the new euros, selling bonds worth €5 million euros takes €15 million out of the economy but buying bonds for the same amount only adds €5 million to the economy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, you wouldn’t just buy the same amount of bonds as you sold. Because the multiplier doesn’t apply to the bonds being bought, you can triple the amount of purchases and the total amount of money in the economy stays the same – in other words, there’s no extra inflation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, the ECB could increase its holdings of sovereign debt of EU member states from 25% to 75%. Unlike the sovereign bonds in private hands, member states don’t have to pay interest to the ECB on such bonds. So EU taxpayers would now only need to pay interest on 25% of their bonds rather than the 75% on which they are paying interest now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eInterest rates and other questions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn added reason for doing this is interest rates. While interest rates payable on bonds have been meagre for years, they could hugely increase on future issuances due to inflationary pressures and central banks beginning to raise short-term interest rates in response. The chart below shows how the yields (meaning rates of interest) on the closely watched 10-year sovereign bonds for Spain, Greece, Italy and Portugal have already increased between three and fivefold in the past few months.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMediterranean 10-year bond yields\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class\u003d\"align-center zoomable\"\u003e\n \u003ca href\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/463300/original/file-20220516-13-netjya.png?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d1000\u0026amp;fit\u003dclip\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class\u003d\"placeholder-container\" style\u003d\"--aspect-ratio-percent:56.10079575596817%;--background-color:#5ea9ab\"\u003e\n   \u003cimg alt\u003d\"Chart showing Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece 10 year bond yields over time\" class\u003d\"lazyload\" data-src\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/463300/original/file-20220516-13-netjya.png?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;fit\u003dclip\" data-srcset\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/463300/original/file-20220516-13-netjya.png?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d336\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/463300/original/file-20220516-13-netjya.png?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d30\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d336\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/463300/original/file-20220516-13-netjya.png?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d15\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d336\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/463300/original/file-20220516-13-netjya.png?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d423\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/463300/original/file-20220516-13-netjya.png?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d30\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d423\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/463300/original/file-20220516-13-netjya.png?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d15\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d423\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d3 2262w\" sizes\u003d\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n  \u003cspan class\u003d\"caption\"\u003eGreece \u003d yellow; Italy \u003d blue; Portugal \u003d turquoise; Spain \u003d orange.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class\u003d\"attribution\"\u003e\u003ca class\u003d\"source\" href\u003d\"https://www.tradingview.com\"\u003eTrading View\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing several years of immense shocks from the pandemic, the energy crisis and war emergency, there’s a risk that the markets start to think that Europe’s most indebted countries can’t cover their debts. This could lead to widespread bond selling and push interest rates up to unmanageable levels. In other words, our approach might even save the eurozone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ECB could indeed achieve all this without introducing a digital euro, simply by imposing a tougher reserve requirement within the current system. But by moving to a CBDC, there is a strong argument that because it’s safer than bank deposits, retail banks should have to guarantee that safety by following a 100% reserve rule.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote that we can only take this medicine once, however. As a result, EU states will still have to be disciplined about their budgets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of completely ending fractional reserve banking in this way, there’s also a halfway house where you make reserve requirements more stringent (say a 50% rule) and enjoy a reduced version of the benefits from our proposed system. Alternatively, after the CBDC transition ends, the reserve requirement could be progressively relaxed to stimulate the economy, subject to GDP growth, inflation and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if other central banks do not take the same approach? Certainly, some coordination would help to minimise disruption, but reserve requirements do differ between countries today without significant problems. Also, many countries would probably be tempted to take the same approach.

It turns out that legal ownership in the metaverse is not that simple.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe prevailing but legally problematic narrative among crypto enthusiasts is that NFTs allow true ownership of digital items in the metaverse for two reasons: decentralization and interoperability. These two technological features have led some to claim that \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.ft.com/partnercontent/crypto-com/nfts-the-metaverse-economy.html\"\u003etokens provide indisputable proof of ownership\u003c/a\u003e, which can be used across various metaverse apps, environments and games.

In fact, the current ownership of metaverse assets is not governed by property law at all, but rather by contract law. As a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user\u003db8cRIfIAAAAJ\u0026amp;hl\u003den\"\u003elegal scholar\u003c/a\u003e who studies property law, tech policy and legal ownership, I believe that what many companies are calling “ownership” in the metaverse is not the same as ownership in the physical world, and consumers are at risk of being swindled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003ePurchasing in the metaverse\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you buy an item in the metaverse, your purchase is recorded in a transaction on a blockchain, which is a digital ledger under nobody’s control and in which transaction records cannot be deleted or altered. Your purchase assigns you ownership of an NFT, which is simply a unique string of bits. You store the NFT in a crypto wallet that only you can open, and which you “carry” with you wherever you go in the metaverse. Each NFT is linked to a particular virtual item.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is easy to think that because your NFT is in your crypto wallet, no one can take your NFT-backed virtual apartment, outfit or magic wand away from you without access to your wallet’s private key. Because of this, many people think that the NFT and the digital item are one and the same. Even experts conflate NFTs with their respective digital goods, noting that because \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/18/technology/nft-guide.html?referringSource\u003darticleShare\"\u003eNFTs are personal property\u003c/a\u003e, they allow \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/the-metaverse-is-money-and-crypto-is-king-why-youll-be-on-a-blockchain-when-youre-virtual-world-hopping-171659\"\u003eyou to own digital goods in a virtual world\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n \u003cdiv class\u003d\"placeholder-container\" style\u003d\"--aspect-ratio-percent:56.25%;--background-color:#fff\"\u003e\n  \u003ciframe class\u003d\"lazyload\" data-src\u003d\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uIllSiXVfmI?wmode\u003dtransparent\u0026amp;start\u003d0\" frameborder\u003d\"0\" allowfullscreen width\u003d\"100%\" height\u003d\"400\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n  \u003cspan class\u003d\"caption\"\u003eNFTs and the hype about the metaverse have sparked a virtual land rush.\u003c/span\u003e\n \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, when you join a metaverse platform you must first agree to the platform’s terms of service, terms of use or end user license agreement. These are legally binding documents that define the rights and duties of the users and the metaverse platform. Unfortunately and unsurprisingly, almost no one actually reads the terms of service. In one study, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2018.1486870\"\u003eonly 1.7% of users found and questioned a “child assignment clause\u003c/a\u003e” embedded in a terms of service document. Everyone else unwittingly gave away their first-born child to the fictional online service provider.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is in these lengthy and sometimes incomprehensible documents where metaverse platforms spell out the legal nuances of virtual ownership. Unlike the blockchain itself, the terms of service for each metaverse platform are centralized and are under the complete control of a single company. This is extremely problematic for legal ownership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInteroperability and portability are defining features of the metaverse, meaning you should be able to carry your non-real-estate virtual property – your avatar, your digital art, your magic wand – from one virtual world to another. But today’s virtual worlds are not connected to one another, and there is nothing in an NFT itself that labels it as, say, a magic wand. As it stands, each platform needs to link NFTs to their own proprietary digital assets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eVirtual fine print\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder the terms of service, the NFTs purchased and the digital goods received are almost never one and the same. NFTs exist on the blockchain. The land, goods and characters in the metaverse, on the other hand, exist on \u003ca href\u003d\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3682090\"\u003eprivate servers running proprietary code\u003c/a\u003e with secured, inaccessible databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis means that all visual and functional aspects of digital assets – the very features that give them any value – are not on the blockchain at all. These features are completely controlled by the private metaverse platforms and are subject to their unilateral control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of their terms of service, platforms can even legally delete or give your items away by delinking the digital assets from their original NFT identification codes.

Nevertheless, bitcoin transactions are consuming more energy than ever before – the same amount as the whole of Thailand. With a carbon footprint equivalent to the Czech Republic’s (around 114 million tonnes per year), bitcoin is cancelling out other climate wins. The global take-up of electric vehicles, for example, is estimated to have prevented 50 million tonnes of CO₂ so far. That’s less than half of bitcoin’s emissions for a single year. And the problem’s getting worse. The growth of bitcoin “mining” powered by fossil fuels is outpacing greener alternatives, causing bitcoin’s carbon footprint to swell five-fold in just two years. But, according to campaign groups Greenpeace and the Environmental Working Group, all this can be easily fixed with a simple update to bitcoin’s software. Their campaign, called Change the Code Not the Climate, launched recently and calls on bitcoin software developers to switch the network from its currently wasteful system for verifying transactions to a more climate-friendly alternative. The switch, they claim, would reduce bitcoin’s carbon footprint by 99.9%. But it’s unlikely to happen soon – and here’s why. Bitcoiners don’t trust bankers, taxmen and other meddling middlemen. Because there are no banks with bitcoin, the job of keeping the books straight is given to a global network of specialist computers. The owners of these computers compete for bookkeeping tasks in return for the transaction fees paid by network users. They also get a few newly minted bitcoins as a thank you. This competition is known as Proof of Work (PoW) mining. It works like an ever-expanding game of hungry hippos. The more players that join the contest, the more work each hippo needs to do in order to win anything. If a new hippo with green intentions joins the game, everyone at the table has to work harder. Players powered by coal in Kazakhstan, or fossil gas in Texas, then belch out extra smog. The higher the bitcoin price, the more the dirty hippos are prepared to waste on coal and gas until their costs for doing so are equal to their reward. And so, Proof of Work is proof of waste. And this is waste by design: Bitcoiners call this inefficiency “the feature, not the bug”. Greenpeace hopes the bitcoin community could learn to love Proof of Stake (PoS) instead. With the network running on PoS, bitcoin’s bookkeepers would need to stake a prescribed minimum number of bitcoins as a security deposit. If they validate fraudulent transactions, they lose their stake. This disincentive keeps the network secure. A number of blockchains, including Cardano, EOS, and TRON already use a PoS system, where token holders vote for the most qualified block producers. While bitcoin currently uses millions of mining computers, these PoS networks usually maintain an assembly of around 20 machines using a comparably minuscule amount of energy, taking turns to receive bookkeeping rights. For bitcoin, coding these changes would be straightforward. Greenpeace claims that only 30 people – the largest mining outfits, exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, and code developers – would need to agree the switch to PoS. But this ignores the fact that everyone would need to run the upgraded software. On average, to successfully mine bitcoin once per week requires shelling out around US$1.8 million (£1.4 million) on hardware. Most miners are protective of these investments and conservative when it comes to amending the software code that underwrites their winnings. For this reason, Chris Bendiksen, a commentator at the cryptocurrency website CoinShares, puts the chance of Bitcoin ever moving to PoS at 0%. “There is no appetite among Bitcoiners to destroy the security of the protocol by making such a move”, he says. Bitcoin is no stranger to coding stalemates. An amendment to fix intermittent congestion issues and stabilise transaction fees was proposed in 2016. Despite being a relatively simple fix, the change split the bitcoin community, with the vast majority continuing to support the slower, more expensive status quo. Even if some users were prepared to ditch PoW, the original bitcoin network would continue in some form. This PoW version would keep the name, branding, super-rich disciples, and polluting PoW miners. The PoS offshoot could end up as just another disappointing experiment. Another PoW heavyweight network, Ethereum, has been promising a shift to PoS since birth. But this migration has remained just around the corner for several years. Starting a PoS network from scratch is another option. But there is already a BitcoinPoS cryptocurrency. Aside from an early flurry of interest, it’s attracted few supporters. Read more: Bitcoin isn\u0027t getting greener: four environmental myths about cryptocurrency debunked Many Bitcoiners scoffed at the Greenpeace campaign. After all, much of the funding for this marketing mission comes from billionaire venture capitalist Chris Larsen, co-founder of rival cryptocurrency Ripple. Larsen’s Ripple was also an original member of the UN-backed Crypto Climate Accord, an organisation convened in April 2021 to promote more sustainable cryptocurrency trading. In response, prominent bitcoin advocates established the Bitcoin Mining Council – a public relations group aiming to “defend bitcoin against uninformed and hostile energy critics”, like Larsen. Some argue governments in Europe and North America should follow China’s lead and ban PoW mining. Retaliatory campaigns from bitcoin advocates are ramping up, and their greenwashing appears to be winning. The European Parliament recently rejected a bill to ban PoW mining across the EU. The UK government also fears an exodus of crypto trading talent for other financial centres. Research I have led suggests that effective regulation of bitcoin will not come from charity appeals. A globally coordinated ban, led by governments, is likely to prove the most effective solution. Don’t have time to read about climate change as much as you’d like?

Cryptocurrencies now inhabit an increasingly prominent niche in the global financial landscape, offering “pastime” opportunities for young investors, channelling donations to Ukraine’s war effort or simply providing cheaper and faster alternatives to mainstream banking. In Aotearoa New Zealand, the Reserve Bank recently decided to investigate crypto as part of a wider conversation about how New Zealanders will pay and save in the future. So far, crypto has benefited from light regulation in New Zealand, but it’s essential we have a clear picture of all pros and cons, including the risk of criminal behaviour and climate change impacts. Cryptocurrencies offer a variety of investment and transaction benefits, but concerns about dangers are also growing. Crypto’s volatile track record presents significant risk to investors (alongside significant reward) and the relative anonymity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and others is proving attractive to organised crime, money laundering and tax evasion. Read more: Crypto theft is on the rise. Here\u0027s how the crimes are committed, and how you can protect yourself To date, crypto has largely avoided the traditional forms of financial regulation banks face and it has capitalised on its ability to eschew territorial borders, being everywhere and nowhere at once. As calls for effective regulation get louder and major markets in the US, EU and Asia seek to subject crypto to greater oversight, it is particularly important to highlight crypto’s growing but often hidden environmental impact.  How do companies with only virtual assets contribute to environmental damage? The answer is data mining. Cryptocurrencies and assets use blockchain technology. In essence, transactions are verified and recorded on a blockchain, a public digital ledger that contains information about all transactions. Blockchain technology ensures the integrity of crypto transactions, but it does so by using huge amounts of electricity. Bitcoin’s annual electricity consumption is more than three times that of New Zealand. This is due to blockchain’s distributed nature and use of cryptography and complex processing, which require considerable computational power. Read more: Bitcoin: China\u0027s crackdown isn\u0027t enough – only a global effort can stop crypto\u0027s monstrous energy demand Verifying transactions, or mining, is so energy intensive it has caused concerns about the resilience of some countries’ electricity supply. Earlier this year, Kazakhstan cut off crypto miners because of the country’s energy crisis. When the electricity used by crypto comes from fossil fuels, the connection to climate change becomes clearer. Recent developments in the US are setting a worrying trend. Crypto’s colossal energy needs may be met by electricity from coal-fired power stations, at a time when the energy sector should pivot towards renewables.  In Kentucky, a new crypto “blockchain farm” is being built close to four coal-fired power plants, for easy energy supply. Meanwhile, another coal-fired power station in Montana has been brought back from the brink of closure after agreeing to act as the sole electricity supplier to a Bitcoin mining company, Marathon, adding hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The need to act decisively on climate change has never been more urgent. Last year, New Zealand announced its new Nationally Determined Contribution to cut emissions by 50% on 2005 levels by 2030 as part of collective efforts to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This is an improvement on the previous pledge, but Climate Action Tracker still rates New Zealand’s overall contribution to climate change mitigation as “highly insufficient”. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released last month, details the impacts of overshooting the 1.5°C target. For Australasia, these include increased heat-related deaths and disease for people and wildlife, loss of livelihoods and a drop in income from agriculture and loss of low-lying coastal areas as a result of rising sea levels. Insufficient action on climate change now will have serious consequences, including close to home. According to a recent survey, most New Zealanders accept the need to take action to combat climate change. But all too often people’s lifestyle decisions still seem disconnected from their environmental impacts. Confusion remains around what people can meaningfully do to make positive change. Read more: Cryptocurrency has an impact on economies. That\u0027s why some are afraid of it – and some welcome it Regarding crypto, to make informed and responsible choices, New Zealanders need a clear picture of how our consumer and investment decisions affect the planet. Public and private sectors should explore more environmentally friendly blockchain technology based on “proof-of-stake” which uses less energy because of lower processing requirements. Indeed, the European Parliament considered banning the more energy-hungry “proof-of-work” mechanism Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies use. While it backed off the proposal, cryptocurrencies will likely face further scrutiny as the EU tries to tackle the climate crisis. Aotearoa also needs a future-facing regulatory framework to limit the use of energy-hungry encryption and support a safer and more sustainable model for consumers and the planet.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nathan Cooper, Michael Dizon, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-03-30T00:39:57Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eSince its debut in 2009, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen explosive growth and some dramatic downturns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCryptocurrencies now inhabit an increasingly prominent niche in the global financial landscape, offering “\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e0dc602-af91-4253-a230-c1598781b3b4\"\u003epastime\u003c/a\u003e” opportunities for young investors, channelling \u003ca href\u003d\"https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/latest-crypto-news/\"\u003edonations to Ukraine’s war effort\u003c/a\u003e or simply providing cheaper and faster alternatives to mainstream banking.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Aotearoa New Zealand, the Reserve Bank recently decided to \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/news/2021/07/reserve-bank-confirms-consultations-key-to-the-future-of-how-new-zealanders-pay-and-save\"\u003einvestigate crypto\u003c/a\u003e as part of a wider conversation about how New Zealanders will pay and save in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo far, crypto has benefited from light regulation in New Zealand, but it’s essential we have a clear picture of all pros and cons, including the risk of criminal behaviour and climate change impacts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"slot clear\" data-id\u003d\"17\"\u003e\n \u003cdiv class\u003d\"inline-promos-skeleton\"\u003e\n  \u003ch5\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cbutton\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCryptocurrencies offer a variety of investment and transaction benefits, but concerns about dangers are also growing.

This was no lost Matisse or rarely seen Van Gogh. Instead, it was a composite collection of digital art by the then relatively unknown artist Beeple. What makes this piece, Everydays: the First 5000 Days, truly remarkable, is that it was sold as a non-fungible token (NFT). In the year since that sale, NFTs have gone from a relatively obscure tech-world phenomenon to the mainstream. NFTs are tokens that exist on a secure record-keeping system called a blockchain. These tokens are akin to certificates of ownership a gallery might give to an art collector, but for digital items. Celebrities such as Eminem and Jimmy Fallon have helped raise the profile of NFTs through the Bored Ape Yacht Club profile picture collection. These collections have become so popular that Twitter now allows users to use their NFTs as their profile image. For the collectors, NFTs are arguably a digital extension of benign hobbyist pursuits. In recent generations, collectors may have sought rare Magic The Gathering cards or obscure stamps. Today, those with an impulse to own rare items are attracted to a world where rarity can be transparently recorded and easily verified. For the creators, NFTs provide a clear path toward monetisation. Artists have historically struggled to make money from their work, but NFTs are sold through marketplaces that provide creators with royalties. The Ethereum economy sustained by NFTs earned its creators US$3.5 billion (£2.7 billion) in 2021. Despite their growing popularity, NFTs still baffle most people. This is because we are not used to the concept of owning digital art. After all, can’t I just right-click and save an image to my own computer? I could, naturally, but this would be to miss the point. As with all currencies, NFTs have value because of the meaning a community ascribes to them. In the online culture NFTs belong to, “on-chain” blockchain items are meaningful – and some have more value than others. The characteristic missed by the right-click perspective is that when you own an item on the blockchain, everyone in your community can see this. This can translate into prestige, for example, when outrageously wealthy entrepreneurs bid on rare NFT items, like Beeple’s work or a rare cryptopunk. Or it can simply be a sign to other community members that you belong. Popular attention is not always positive. As NFTs grow, so has the proliferation of cash grabs and scams, especially from social media influencers. Elsewhere I have called this the trash moat that surrounds legitimate projects in the cryptocurrency and NFT world. YouTubers Logan and Jake Paul, in particular, are notorious for their litany of low-quality NFT “rug pulls”, when a crypto project is abandoned by their creators once the money flows in. Melania Trump, to pick another example, has released several NFT projects. However, blockchain analysts were able to uncover how one of these projects was bought by none other than the creator of the NFT themselves. This practice, known as wash trading, involves NFT creators buying their own works either to save face due to a lack of interest or to generate hype around an influencer or artist and boost the price of the next sale. Yet another capacity of NFTs has emerged in their potential for fundraising. In what started as a meme, ConstitutionDAO was created by a group of cryptocurrency enthusiasts to buy a rare copy of the US constitution that was on auction at Sotheby’s. This group sold a token in exchange for the cryptocurrency Ether that was then used to bid on the constitution. Within a week, ConstitutionDAO raised US$47 million (£35.8 million). This was not enough to win the auction, but it revealed just how financially powerful this corner of the web has become. Perhaps the harshest critiques of NFTs come from the socially conscious art world that sees the infrastructure of NFTs as the problem. NFTs mostly exist on the Ethereum blockchain, which relies on vast computational resources to function, generating a huge carbon footprint. Ethereum is transitioning away from its current mechanism to another, which will hopefully alleviate this concern. Perhaps the more subtle defence of NFTs resides in how they push the medium of digital art in interesting directions. Damien Hirst’s The Currency playfully challenges the collector to choose whether to keep the NFT (the digital token) or exchange it later for a physical artwork. This forces the collector to make a bet on the future: physical or digital, which retains the most value? This places NFTs in a curious spot. They appear at once a benign hobbyist pursuit, a means to value and make money from scarce digital art, a cash grab for unscrupulous influencers and celebrities, a new mechanism for online fundraising and an explored avenue for legitimate art. However you view them, NFTs have crossed fully into the mainstream and deserve our attention.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Paul Dylan-Ennis, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-03-10T11:48:43Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eOne year ago, an artwork was sold for \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million\"\u003eUS$69 million\u003c/a\u003e (£52.6 million) by the prestigious auction house \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.christies.com/features/Monumental-collage-by-Beeple-is-first-purely-digital-artwork-NFT-to-come-to-auction-11510-7.aspx?sc_lang\u003den\"\u003eChristie’s\u003c/a\u003e.

They’re free, pretty much. So it’s tough for charities to fundraise with them. That is, until 2017 when non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, came along. Unlike regular pieces of digital media, NFTs can’t be so easily copied. And for as long as they have existed, there have been conservation charities using them for fundraising. A cartoon drawing of a cat-turtle named Honu raised US$25,000 (£18,485) for ocean conservation charities in 2018. Rewilder is a non-profit organisation using NFT auctions to raise funds to buy land for reforestation. The charity claims to have raised US$241,700. There have been various cartoon apes sold for US$850,000, with the money going to orangutan conservation charities. The most expensive NFT to date, a picture of some small grey balls, sold to multiple buyers for US$92 million in December 2021. With many UK charities in dire straits, it’s no surprise some want a piece of the crypto action too. Recently, WWF UK joined the NFT circus with its Tokens for Nature collection. But before the fundraiser had even started, the project sparked a backlash from environmentalists online who worried about its carbon footprint. Within just a few days, the sale was terminated. The NFAs (or Non-Fungible Animals) project aimed to raise lots of money and awareness about endangered animals. The number of rare animal images available for sale corresponded to the estimated number left in the wild. There were 290 Giant ibis NFAs, for example. An ibis jpeg would have raised about US$400 through a single sale . According to one estimate, NFTs generate more carbon emissions than Singapore as a result of their energy consumption. Most NFT creators use a technology called Ethereum, which is a blockchain system similar to Bitcoin that involves an energy-intensive computer function called mining. Specialist mining computers take turns validating transactions while guessing the combination of a long string of automatically generated digits. The computer that correctly guesses the combination first wins a reward paid in a cryptocurrency called ether. Unlike regular NFTs though, WWF claimed that its NFAs were “eco-friendly”. In its sustainability statement, the charity suggested the sale of all 8,000 or so NFAs would have a similar carbon footprint to a pint of milk, or a half-dozen eggs. The reason for this negligible impact they claimed was a clever blockchain application called Polygon, which would have allowed WWF’s project fewer direct interactions with the Ethereum blockchain. WWF wouldn’t then need to take as much responsibility for its share of Ethereum’s monstrous carbon footprint. So why the Twitter tantrums? WWF’s assumption was a tricky one. That’s because Polygon depends on Ethereum contracts to carry out essential services, such as moving assets between Ethereum and Polygon and creating checkpoints between the two. According to Alex de Vries of the cryptocurrency monitoring website, Digiconomist, the footprint of WWF’s project was actually around 2,100 times more (12,600 eggs) than the estimate provided by the charity. There are also second-order effects to consider. Ethereum’s carbon emissions are not related directly to the number of transactions occurring on the network. PoW mining is what gives Ethereum its dirty reputation. By pumping up the hype around NFT markets, the collection could drive up the price of Ethereum. This would encourage more PoW mining, increasing the network’s overall carbon footprint. Initial buyers of NFAs would purchase them from WWF’s dedicated website. But buyers can relist their artwork on the popular NFT marketplace, OpenSea. OpenSea is currently the number one gas guzzler on the Ethereum network, responsible for nearly 20% of actions on the blockchain. WWF is not the first charity to reevaluate its position on crypto-giving. In 2021, Greenpeace stopped accepting bitcoin donations after seven years. Friends of the Earth soon followed. The WWF furore forced the wildlife charity, International Animal Rescue to park its NFT fundraising plans indefinitely. Internet nonprofits Mozilla and Wikipedia have also reconsidered their crypto-giving strategies on climate change grounds.  There are multiple NFT-friendly blockchains that don’t cause carbon headaches. Even so, research shows it’s difficult for charities to fundraise using NFTs without getting their hands dirty. Charities should be mindful of growing public disapproval of blockchain projects. Some argue the technology is driven by predatory marketing tactics. Others claim blockchain is a platform for Ponzi schemes, grift, and multi-level-marketing arrangements. According to OpenSea, 80% of the NFTs minted through its site are spam, scams, or otherwise fraudulent. Research also shows cryptocurrencies can restrict the work of conservation charities. In 2018, WWF partnered with blockchain developers, AidChain. To improve transparency in the donor tracking process, AidChain encouraged WWF to pay their service providers in a cryptocurrency called AidCoin. Using an Ethereum smart contract, donors could then track and manage how funds were spent. Platforms like this can allow non-expert crypto donors to encode concrete conditions to their donations. Break the conditions – lose the funds. Great for the donor. Lousy for the charity’s conservation experts. Before reacting to crypto-giving hype, conservation charities such as WWF need to do their homework. Animal jpegs and cryptocurrencies may seem a harmless way to fundraise. But mindlessly jumping on the blockchain bandwagon could tie their hands while longstanding donors take their support elsewhere. Don’t have time to read about climate change as much as you’d like?

The first port of call should be changing how transactions on the blockchain operate – a move which could cut its energy usage by 99.99%. A cryptocurrency is a digital representation of value that, unlike traditional money, isn’t issued by any central bank or agency. Cryptocurrencies are powered by blockchain technology, which allows the exchange of virtual coins like bitcoin and ether. Cryptocurrency mining is the process of creating new coins by solving complex mathematical problems. The mining process also validates transactions on the cryptocurrency’s network, proving that they’re genuine. Crypto transactions are validated in two main ways: using either a “proof of work” or “proof of stake” mechanism. Proof of work requires miners around the world to compete to complete a maths puzzle. The winner is rewarded with a predetermined amount of cryptocurrency and the ability to validate their transaction. In proof of stake, cryptocurrency owners validate blockchain transactions based on the number of coins they stake. In other words, cryptocurrency owners are required to put up their own cryptocurrency as collateral for the opportunity to successfully approve transactions. Proof of work is more secure than proof of stake, but it’s slower and consumes more energy. The mining activities of pioneering blockchains like Bitcoin are based on proof of work and thus use enormous amounts of energy. But switching transactions to proof of stake has the potential to dramatically cut emissions. Although renewable energy is now being used to power some cryptocurrency activities, that energy could surely be put to better use elsewhere: for example, to power homes or businesses. Instead, if blockchain transactions were verified through proof of stake – a move that Ethereum is planning to make – their energy consumption could be reduced to 0.01% of its original value. The estimated power needed to run the Bitcoin network across the world is an extraordinary 7.46 gigawatts (GW) per year. For comparison, in 2020 an average-sized nuclear plant produced around 1GW of electrical power in a year. The energy required for just one bitcoin transaction could power the average US home for more than 70 days. As the US committee heard, a bitcoin transaction adds around 400kg of CO² to the atmosphere (assuming it’s powered by an energy mix typical of the UK, of which around two-thirds comes from fossil fuel). Read more: Crypto countries: Nigeria and El Salvador\u0027s opposing journeys into digital currencies – podcast Together, Bitcoin and Ethereum mining operations emit more than 70 million tonnes of CO² into the atmosphere. That’s the same as the annual exhaust emissions of over 15.5 million cars. One cryptocurrency mining firm is even seeking to restart operations at two coal-fired power plants in Pennsylvania to generate more energy. The main concern raised by the US committee was that, given the potential for a dramatic increase in cryptocurrencies’ value, their required energy consumption – and environmental impact – is likely to keep growing. This is partly thanks to the boom in related markets like decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are largely based on the Ethereum blockchain. DeFi is a financial system using blockchain technology to let users make transactions and investments without going through a central mediator, while NFTs are unique pieces of digital media stored on the blockchain. Although DeFi only launched in 2017, its value already hit £85 billion in November 2021. And NFTs’ total sale value grew from £74 million in 2020 to £29.6 billion in 2021. Also, since NFTs are most commonly created on the Ethereum blockchain – which uses proof of work to verify transactions – it takes a lot of energy to create one. And as NFTs feature prominently in the growing metaverse, their energy demand is only set to increase. Read more: How Covid broke supply chains, and how AI and blockchain could fix them It sounds contradictory, but adopting blockchain technology could actually have a positive effect on the environment over the long term. This is because it could allow companies to automate many of their complex payment systems, reducing the number of commuting employees and resulting in fewer transport-related emissions. While the extent of this transformation is very hard to predict, it’s becoming clear that as blockchain technology grows, its benefits will too. For example, as developments in blockchain continue to break new ground in business and finance, we’re seeing cryptocurrency accelerate financial inclusion for those who’ve historically been excluded from participating in formal financial systems. As more businesses enter the metaverse, governments and regulators should aim to ensure that environmental implications are minimised without stifling innovation. Requiring blockchains to adopt proof of stake would be a good start. Don’t have time to read about climate change as much as you’d like? Get a weekly roundup in your inbox instead.

Bloomberg’s Lorcan Roche Kelly called Bitcoin “the first true religion of the 21st century.” Bitcoin promoter Hass McCook has taken to calling himself “The Friar” and wrote a series of Medium pieces comparing Bitcoin to a religion. There is a Church of Bitcoin, founded in 2017, that explicitly calls legendary Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto its “prophet.” In Austin, Texas, there are billboards with slogans like “Crypto Is Real” that weirdly mirror the ubiquitous billboards about Jesus found on Texas highways. Like many religions, Bitcoin even has dietary restrictions associated with it. So does Bitcoin’s having prophets, evangelists and dietary laws make it a religion or not? As a scholar of religion, I think this is the wrong question to ask. The dirty secret of religious studies is that there is no universal definition of what religion is. Traditions such as Christianity, Islam and Buddhism certainly exist and have similarities, but the idea that these are all examples of religion is relatively new. The word “religion” as it’s used today – a vague category that includes certain cultural ideas and practices related to God, the afterlife or morality – arose in Europe around the 16th century. Before this, many Europeans understood that there were only three types of people in the world: Christians, Jews and heathens. This model shifted after the Protestant Reformation when a long series of wars began between Catholics and Protestants. These became known as “wars of religion,” and religion became a way of talking about differences between Christians. At the same time, Europeans were encountering other cultures through exploration and colonialism. Some of the traditions they encountered shared certain similarities to Christianity and were also deemed religions. Non-European languages have historically not had a direct equivalent to the word “religion.” What has counted as religion has changed over the centuries, and there are always political interests at stake in determining whether or not something is a religion. As religion scholar Russell McCutcheon argues, “The interesting thing to study, then, is not what religion is or is not, but ‘the making of it’ process itself – whether that manufacturing activity takes place in a courtroom or is a claim made by a group about their own behaviors and institutions.” With this in mind, why would anyone claim that Bitcoin is a religion? Some commentators seem to be making this claim to steer investors away from Bitcoin. Emerging market fund manager Mark Mobius, in an attempt to tamp down enthusiasm about cryptocurrency, said that “crypto is a religion, not an investment.” His statement, however, is an example of a false dichotomy fallacy, or the assumption that if something is one thing, it cannot be another. There is no reason that a religion cannot also be an investment, a political system or nearly anything else. Mobius’ point, though, is that “religion,” like cryptocurrency, is irrational. This criticism of religion has been around since the Enlightenment, when Voltaire wrote, “Nothing can be more contrary to religion and the clergy than reason and common sense.” In this case, labeling Bitcoin a “religion” suggests that bitcoin investors are fanatics and not making rational choices. On the other hand, some Bitcoin proponents have leaned into the religion label. McCook’s articles use the language of religion to highlight certain aspects of Bitcoin culture and to normalize them. For example, “stacking sats” – the practice of regularly buying small fractions of bitcoins – sounds weird. But McCook refers to this practice as a religious ritual, and more specifically as “tithing.” Many churches practice tithing, in which members make regular donations to support their church. So this comparison makes sat stacking seem more familiar. While for some people religion may be associated with the irrational, it is also associated with what religion scholar Doug Cowan calls “the good, moral and decent fallacy.” That is, some people often assume if something is really a religion, it must represent something good. People who “stack sats” might sound weird. But people who “tithe” could sound principled and wholesome. For religion scholars, categorizing something as a religion can pave the way for new insights. As religion scholar J.Z. Smith writes, “‘Religion’ is not a native term; it is created by scholars for their intellectual purposes and therefore is theirs to define.” For Smith, categorizing certain traditions or cultural institutions as religions creates a comparative framework that will hopefully result in some new understanding. With this in mind, comparing Bitcoin to a tradition like Christianity may cause people to notice things that they didn’t before. For example, many religions were founded by charismatic leaders. Charismatic authority does not come from any government office or tradition but solely from the relationship between a leader and their followers. Charismatic leaders are seen by their followers as superhuman or at least extraordinary. Because this relationship is precarious, leaders often remain aloof to keep followers from seeing them as ordinary human beings. Several commentators have noted that Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto resembles a sort of prophet. Nakamoto’s true identity – or whether Nakamoto is actually a team of people – remains a mystery. But the intrigue surrounding this figure is a source of charisma with consequences for bitcoin’s economic value. Many who invest in bitcoin do so in part because they regard Nakamoto as a genius and an economic rebel. In Budapest, artists even erected a bronze statue as a tribute to Nakamoto. There’s also a connection between Bitcoin and millennialism, or the belief in a coming collective salvation for a select group of people. In Christianity, millennial expectations involve the return of Jesus and the final judgment of the living and the dead. Some Bitcoiners believe in an inevitable coming “hyperbitcoinization” in which bitcoin will be the only valid currency. When this happens, the “Bitcoin believers” who invested will be justified, while the “no coiners” who shunned cryptocurrency will lose everything. Finally, some Bitcoiners view bitcoin as not just a way to make money, but as the answer to all of humanity’s problems. “Because the root cause of all of our problems is basically money printing and capital misallocation as a result of that,” McCook argues, “the only way the whales are going to be saved, or the trees are going to be saved, or the kids are going to be saved, is if we just stop the degeneracy.” [Explore the intersection of faith, politics, arts and culture.

In his book “God Is Not One,” religion professor Stephen Prothero highlights the distinctiveness of world religions using a four-point model, in which each tradition identifies a unique problem with the human condition, posits a solution, offers specific practices to achieve the solution and puts forth exemplars to model that path. This model can be applied to Bitcoin: The problem is fiat currency, the solution is Bitcoin, and the practices include encouraging others to invest, “stacking sats” and “hodling” – refusing to sell bitcoin to keep its value up. The exemplars include Satoshi and other figures involved in the creation of blockchain technology. So does this comparison prove that Bitcoin is a religion? Not necessarily, because theologians, sociologists and legal theorists have many different definitions of religion, all of which are more or less useful depending on what the definition is being used for. However, this comparison may help people understand why Bitcoin has become so attractive to so many people, in ways that would not be possible if Bitcoin were approached as a purely economic phenomenon.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Joseph P.

Because your ID will be linked to your wallet, you won’t need to remember login information for all the websites and virtual worlds that you visit – just connect your wallet with a click and you are logged in. ID-associated wallets will also be useful for controlling access to age-restricted areas in the metaverse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYour crypto wallet could also be linked to your contacts list, which would allow you to bring your social network information from one virtual world to another. “Join me for a pool party in FILL IN THE BLANK-world!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt some point in the future, wallets could also be associated with reputation scores that determine the permissions you have to broadcast in public places and interact with people outside of your social network. If you act like a toxic misinformation-spreading troll, you may damage your reputation and potentially have your sphere of influence reduced by the system.

And if the latest Matrix film has left you wondering whether we are really living in a simulation, we talk to a philosopher on the long history of that idea.  Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy and its most populous country. El Salvador is a small republic in central America. But despite their many differences, they have two economic problems in common. First, a large proportion of their populations don’t have access to bank accounts. Second, their economies rely heavily on remittances, money sent back by people living abroad. But the money transfer companies that facilitate these cash flows can be slow and costly. In 2021, both countries turned to the fast-moving world of digital currencies in an effort to tackle these, and other problems. But they’ve taken very different routes. Nigeria banned bank trading of cryptocurrencies in February and then launched its own central bank digital currency, the eNaira, in October. Nigeria was only the second country in the world to launch a central bank digital currency, after The Bahamas. More may soon follow suit, including China, which in January expanded the pilot of its digital yuan to more areas, including the major cities Shanghai and Beijing. Nigeria’s decision to launch its own digital currency came as a surprise to many, says Iwa Salami, reader and associate professor in law at the University of East London in the UK and an expert on digital currencies. Initially, eNaira wallets are only available for people with bank accounts, but the plan is to extend access to anyone with a phone number in the future. One of the questions, Salami says, is whether Nigeria will be able to “fully achieve financial inclusion in the way that it’s been promoted.” There are a number of risks involved, she says, including to financial stability if those with eNaira wallets start using them as a deposit account. “Therefore, rather than using commercial banks, people actually use eNaira wallets to store their savings, which then means that the relevance of banks becomes redundant,” she says. Read more: Nigeria\u0027s digital currency: what the eNaira is for and why it\u0027s not perfect While Nigeria opted to create its own central bank digital currency, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt a cryptocurrency as legal tender. The US dollar has been El Salvador’s currency since 2001, when it abandoned its currency, the colón. But in September 2021, El Salvador added bitcoin to its list of official currencies. Erica Pimentel, an assistant professor at the Smith school of business at Queen’s University in Ontario, Canada, says there were geopolitical reasons for the decision, as well as an aim to increase financial inclusion and speed up remittances. “We see El Salvador standing up and saying we don’t want the dollar anymore, we want to be masters of our own domain,” she says. In November, the government of El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele announced plans for a Bitcoin City. Pimentel says it’s “a city built from scratch, whose economy is centred on bitcoin mining and is powered by a volcano.” She talks us through the risks involved with El Salvador’s embrace of bitcoin, and says other countries will be closely watching what happens. From virtual currency, we turn to virtual brains, and the question of whether or not we’re living in a simulation, a little like that in The Matrix. Benjamin Curtis, senior lecturer in philosophy and ethics at Nottingham Trent University in the UK, explains the long history of this idea. He tracks versions of this question posed by ancient Greek philosophers, to René Descartes in the 17th century and how it evolved with the modern computing era. Curtis says when The Matrix film first came out in 1999 it “certainly introduced these ideas to a much wider audience”.

El Salvador is a small republic in central America. But despite their many differences, they have two economic problems in common. First, a large proportion of their populations don’t have access to bank accounts. Second, their economies rely heavily on remittances, money sent back by people living abroad. But the money transfer companies that facilitate these cash flows can be slow and costly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2021, both countries turned to the fast-moving world of digital currencies in an effort to tackle these, and other problems.

Initially, eNaira wallets are only available for people with bank accounts, but the plan is to extend access to anyone with a phone number in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the questions, Salami says, is whether Nigeria will be able to “fully achieve financial inclusion in the way that it’s been promoted.” There are a number of risks involved, she says, including to financial stability if those with eNaira wallets start using them as a deposit account. “Therefore, rather than using commercial banks, people actually use eNaira wallets to store their savings, which then means that the relevance of banks becomes redundant,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e Read more: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/nigerias-digital-currency-what-the-enaira-is-for-and-why-its-not-perfect-171323\"\u003eNigeria\u0027s digital currency: what the eNaira is for and why it\u0027s not perfect\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Nigeria opted to create its own central bank digital currency, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt a cryptocurrency as legal tender. The US dollar has been El Salvador’s currency since 2001, when it abandoned its currency, the colón. But in September 2021, El Salvador \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/07/el-salvador-bitcoin-experiment-nayib-bukele\"\u003eadded bitcoin\u003c/a\u003e to its list of official currencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eErica Pimentel, an assistant professor at the Smith school of business at Queen’s University in Ontario, Canada, says there were geopolitical reasons for the decision, as well as an aim to increase financial inclusion and speed up remittances. “We see El Salvador standing up and saying we don’t want the dollar anymore, we want to be masters of our own domain,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn November, the government of El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele announced plans \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-59368483\"\u003efor a Bitcoin City\u003c/a\u003e. Pimentel says it’s “a city built from scratch, whose economy is centred on bitcoin mining and is powered by a volcano.” She talks us through the risks involved with El Salvador’s embrace of bitcoin, and says other countries will be closely watching what happens.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom virtual currency, we turn to virtual brains, and the question of whether or not we’re living in a simulation, a little like that in The Matrix. Benjamin Curtis, senior lecturer in philosophy and ethics at Nottingham Trent University in the UK, explains the long history of this idea. He tracks versions of this question posed by ancient Greek philosophers, to René Descartes in the 17th century and how it evolved with the modern computing era. Curtis says when The Matrix film first came out in 1999 it “certainly introduced these ideas to a much wider audience”.

This role may now have been overtaken by non-fungible tokens, the blockchain-based means to claim unique ownership of easily copied digital assets. The latest NFT mania involves fantastic amounts of money being paid for “Bored Apes”, 10,000 avatars featuring variants of a bored-looking cartoon ape. Last month rapper Eminem (real name Marshall Mathers) paid about US$450,000 in Ethereum cryptocurrency to acquire Bored Ape No. 9055 – nicknamed EminApe, because its khaki and gold chain resembles what Eminem wears. It purportedly joins more than 160 other NFTs in the rapper’s collection. The Bored Ape character seems derivative of the drawings of Jamie Hewlett, the artist who drew Tank Girl and virtual band Gorillaz. According to the creators, each variant is “generated from over 170 possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing, and more”. They say every ape is unique “but some are rarer than others”. So what does Eminem now own? He has an electronic version of an image, which he is using for his Twitter profile. But then so does anyone who copies it from the internet. The only difference is that he has a record in a blockchain that shows he bought it. He also gets to be a member of the “Bored Ape Yacht Club” a members-only online space whose benefits and purpose beyond being a marketing gimmick are unclear. That’s about it. The intellectual property (such as it is) remains with the creators. He is not entitled to any share of merchandising revenue from the character. He can only profit from his purchase if he can find a “greater fool” willing to pay even more for the NFT. Which is unlikely. While publicity given to the rapper’s purchase certainly seems to have boosted demand, the average price paid for Bored Ape NFTs so far in 2022 is about 83 Ether (currently about US$280,000). Eminem may have been prepared to pay much more for the one that looked more like him; but would anyone else? NFTs are a highly speculative purchase. The basis of the market is proof of unique ownership, which only really matters for bragging rights and the prospect of selling the NFT in the future. NFT mania arguably combines the most tawdry and avaricious aspects of collectibles and blockchain markets with celebrity culture. Eminem’s monster payment in particular has lent credibility to the idea these NFTs have value. But he is not the only celebrity who has helped attract attention to the Bored Ape NFTs. Others to buy into the hype include basketball stars Shaquille O’Neal and Stephen Curry, billionaire Mark Cuban, electronic dance music DJ Steve Aoki, YouTuber Logan Paul and late-night television host Jimmy Fallon. These well-publicised purchasers effectively act as a form of celebrity endorsement – a tried and true marketing tactic. It is a graphic example of the power of media culture to stoke “irrational exuberance” in financial markets. There has been a shift away from traditional investments and sources of investment advice. With prices disconnected from any future cash flows, there is less interest in forecasts from technical experts. Instead people turn to social media and “doing their own research”. One survey in mid-2021 (polling 1,400 investors aged 18 to 40) suggested about a third of Gen Z investors regard TikTok videos as a source of trustworthy investment advice. This has opened up the field for celebrity influencers.

Cryptocurrency markets work in essentially the same manner. For existing investors to profit, new buyers have to be drawn into the market. So too NFTs, with something illusory attached to the digital assets. Some light on the worth of this attachment compared to the economics of NFTs themselves may come from the interesting (and also highly profitable) experiment by the (now not so) “young British artist” Damien Hirst – himself a master self-promoter. Hirst’s well-publicised “The Currency” project has involved selling NFTs for 10,000 similar but unique dot paintings. The twist is that at the end of a 12-month period those who have bought the NFT must decide if they want the digital token or the physical artwork. If they keep the NFT the artwork will be destroyed. Read more: Damien Hirst\u0027s dotty \u0027currency\u0027 art makes as much sense as Bitcoin There’s virtually nothing humans can’t turn into a market. But increasingly there are speculative bubbles in things with absolutely no fundamental value. NFTs have joined Bitcoin and celebrity meme-based cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu as examples of tokens with no intrinsic worth, which speculators just buy in the hope the price will keep rising. Even Dogecoin, started as a satire on these excesses, is now valued at US$20 billion and promoted in Ponzi-like ways. Read more: What is Bitcoin\u0027s fundamental value? That\u0027s a good question Some studies have suggested tweets or Facebook posts can now drive stock prices. Elon Musk’s tweets certainly seem to have a large impact on cryptocurrency prices. We now appear to be in the monster of all speculative bubbles. The creators of assets like NFTs will do well. It is not so clear about the holders. Nor will the impact of NFT crashes be restricted just to the NFT market. Speculators, particularly if they have borrowed heavily, may need to liquidate other assets as well. This is all likely to make all financial markets more volatile. The larger the bubble becomes, the wider the contagion when it bursts.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"John Hawkins, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2022-01-13T01:33:24Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eComedian Robin Williams once called cocaine “God’s way of telling you you are making too much money”.

The pattern was first observed for ventilators: demand spiked everywhere and the supply chain was disrupted. This was because production of the devices spanned multiple countries, with each part dependent on other parts manufactured in different locations. The longer the chain and the more complex the dependence, the greater the exposure of any point to the disruption of another one, and to mandated shutdowns. Now, two years since Covid first hit, this pattern has affected almost every sector of the global economy. “Supply chain issues” have become so widespread that they are now a running joke, affecting everything from furniture to groceries. But why has Covid had such a severe effect on how we receive products and goods? In recent decades, supply chains became lean, and they lengthened as they became more cost-efficient: more and more steps were added in the manufacture and transportation of any given product in the name of speed and cost. This means there are more and more places where something can go wrong between you ordering something online and it arriving to your door. Today, downstream suppliers – such as those who provide vehicle control systems to your car manufacturer – depend on upstream suppliers – such as chip manufacturers – to deliver on time so they can in turn deliver on time to you. With long chains, risks are now shared between multiple entities all around the world. Supply chain problems have a knock-on financial effect known as trade credit contagion. This is where firms delay payments to suppliers because their customers delay payments to them. The pay-on-delivery model can lead to cancelled or delayed shipments which can in turn lead to bankruptcies. While a high proportion of trade credit risk remains uninsured today, a post-pandemic world may see insurance and reinsurance firms fill in this protection gap. Researchers are currently working to develop methodologies to identify vulnerabilities in global supply chains and to understand their trade credit contagion risks. The goal is to make these systems more robust overall. How can we design ways to design insurance and reinsurance contracts in order to effectively share the risk and mitigate vulnerabilities? How can reliable trade credit lead to fewer delays in supply chains and replace the familiar predicament we face now, of paying for something in advance with an unknown delivery date? Artificial intelligence and complex network theory are helpful in identifying the structures that could pose systemic risk. They help us ask: which patterns of connections are likely to lead to delay and trade credit contagion and which are more robust? Using these tools, we can create large-scale simulators of global supply chains responding to a wide variety of shocks and then use machine learning techniques to detect the problematic parts of the chain. This knowledge can then be used in market designs that strengthen the system before another pandemic or disaster occurs. Other novel technologies such as blockchain bring the promise of using high quality data to analyse supply chain dependencies. blockchain technology uses real-time data and transparent verification carried out by multiple parties. In combination with other features, such as smart contracts, this could lead to timely resolution in cases of disputes along the supply chain. My research involves using blockchain to streamline record-keeping and payments. This problem is challenging because the adoption of blockchain depends both on the specifics of the technology and the cost. The problem of adopting technology in the presence of positive externalities (whereby firms adopting the technology in turn improve the operations of external parties) is an old one in economics, but now these externalities are systemic in nature: the effects propagate along the chains. The cost of the technology depends on how many firms adopt it, and each one faces business specific costs based on its position in the supply chain, its risk tolerance and its costs to insure these risks. Real-time recording keeping, the traceability of transactions, and the immutability of blockchain can all help supply chains become more efficient. This is all the more true if we consider the full length of the chain, where transactions need to be verified by several parties: participants in the supply chain, insurance and reinsurance firms. Trade credit insurance is likely to grow after the pandemic. It may rely on private-public partnerships – the pandemic has shown that governments become important players when they impose shutdowns in certain areas. These funds can be used to make up for payment delays, reduce losses and jump-start critical production where necessary. But not all links in a chain can be insured, and an important challenge is to identify the most important stages under different shock scenarios. Supply chains can also be rewired – large-scale algorithms can identify which suppliers need to be replaced and which new ones need to emerge. In a few years, supply chains may look different, as the overall goal shifts from minimising costs, as was the case before the pandemic, to minimising delays and trade credit risks. The end consumer will drive the need to rewire the network, as demand shifts. Ultimately, the flexibility of the customer determines the resilience of the supply chain.

This problem is challenging because the adoption of blockchain depends both on the specifics of the technology and the cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem of adopting technology in the presence of positive externalities (whereby firms adopting the technology in turn improve the operations of external parties) is an old one in economics, but now these externalities are systemic in nature: the effects propagate along the chains.

For one, new crypto applications like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) gained ground, with sales of these digital assets setting new records at major auction houses. Secondly, Bitcoin made strides towards mainstream acceptance with major websites like Expedia and Microsoft accepting the coin as a means of exchange. Third, in September, El Salvador became the first country in the world to accept bitcoin as legal tender. There are many more examples of how the market for cryptocurrencies has expanded just in the last year. With this uptick of activity, what’s ahead in 2022 for cryptocurrencies? We believe there are three main areas where cryptocurrencies will gain steam in the next year: greater acceptance of Bitcoin as a means of payment, increased regulatory scrutiny and a rise in NFT activity. Understanding what motivates individuals to adopt Bitcoin has been a challenge for researchers. A recent study suggests five main factors contribute to someone’s likelihood of using Bitcoin: Other studies have added more nuances to this argument by considering gender, age and educational level as equally important factors. The conditions in the crypto space have made it increasingly likely that Bitcoin will become mainstream in the near future. First, there’s increased activity in online communities like Twitter and Reddit, where even crypto novices can exchange information with seasoned investors to obtain word-of-mouth advice about price predictions and trading strategies. Second, there has been an explosion of new crypto-exchanges — or trading platforms where one can exchange fiat currency for crypto — and major investments into the technological infrastructure of existing exchanges. These infrastructure investments have expanded access to crypto markets and also piqued the interest of institutional investors. The last year has seen institutional players like the European Investment Bank (EIB) — the lending arm of the European Union — take a stance on crypto. In April, the EIB issued a 100 million euro digital bond on the Ethereum blockchain. Goldman Sachs, Banco Santander and Société Générale were also involved in the issuance. Research has pointed to institutional adoption as a turning point for widespread crypto adoption, and it would appear we’re quickly heading there. Altogether, the increased availability of points of sale that accept Bitcoin as a means of exchange and institutional investment in the space will likely lead to greater acceptance of Bitcoin as a method of payment in 2022. After cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi) is widely regarded as the next frontier in fintech. DeFi provides the opportunity to create decentralized systems that rely on distributed ledger technology to facilitate peer-to-peer loans, create new financial securities like stablecoins or even offer new models of corporate governance. Regulators also appear to be increasingly paying attention. In November, the European Council — the body that defines the political priorities of the European Union — announced its position on the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, which will provide increased regulatory clarity over cryptoassets and DeFi. In the same month, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States produced a joint statement announcing that they would produce a set of policy directives on crypto. Researchers have pointed to a lack of regulation as a major barrier to mainstream crypto acceptance. Increased government oversight, coupled with the move by several countries to consider digital versions of their national currencies, are likely to result in a lot more regulatory activity in 2022. The year 2021 brought a new wave of sales of NFTs. An NFT can offer proof of ownership of, for instance, digital art in the same way a physical canvas can offer proof of ownership of a Vincent Van Gogh painting. Although NFTs began as a way to formalize ownership of digital art, they have since expanded to include other types of digital property, including digital real estate. Sales of NFTs are setting new records — a recent one raised US$17.1 million at Sotheby’s. As a result, the auction house launched Metaverse, an NFT-only marketplace to facilitate sales of digital works. As new NFT applications emerge, this space will likely continue to grow in 2022. Despite these investment opportunities, we urge crypto investors to be skeptical of claims they read in online communities. At a minimum, crypto enthusiasts must do their due diligence before investing. What is sure to emerge in 2022 are new frauds and schemes. Take, for instance, the SquidGame crypto that capitalized on the popular Netflix show but was a fraud. Or the fake Banksy NFT that sold for 244,000 British pounds. Research on the behaviour of retail investors has found some are highly susceptible to the “fear of missing out.” Therefore, it may be difficult to turn down a tip from your hair stylist or your best friend’s cousin on the next hot crypto opportunity. However, crypto investors should educate themselves on the technology and the basics of financial markets if they want to prudently get involved. Crypto, after all, remains speculative and is not for everyone.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Erica Pimentel, Bertrand Malsch, Nathaniel Loh, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-12-13T16:38:52Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe year 2021 was marked by several major breakthroughs for cryptocurrencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one, new crypto applications like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) gained ground, with sales of these digital assets setting \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html\"\u003enew records\u003c/a\u003e at major auction houses.

More than 60 central banks have already entered the digital currency race since 2014. No details have been released in Kenya, but the central bank governor, Patrick Njoroge, commented that the bank was working with other global regulators and financial institutions to explore the use of digital currencies. The shift towards digital currencies has been used by some central banks to formulate and implement regulations to manage the use of cryptocurrencies. For example, Nigeria has launched its official digital currency, the eNaira. The World Economic Forum estimates that a third of Nigerians use or own cryptocurrencies. Kenya is one of the top three markets for Bitcoin, one of the more popular cryptocurrencies. Read more: Nigeria\u0027s digital currency: what the eNaira is for and why it\u0027s not perfect Cryptocurrencies currently operate as unregulated digital money even though they are accepted and used by the virtual community. The cryptocurrency market has grown significantly over the past 10 years. This has raised alarm bells because they are distributed directly from one network to the other. This enables participants to interact and confirm payments without involving intermediaries such as banks. The reason that central banks see the launch of official digital currencies as useful as a first step in regulating crytopcurrencies relates to the fact that both use blockchain technology. A blockchain is a public ledger that allows instant copying, sharing and synchronisation of data across different computers, sites, countries and organisations. Over 88% of the digital currencies that have been launched use blockchain technology. It also underpins cryptocurrencies. The launch of a central bank digital currency would mark Kenya’s official entry into blockchain-based digital assets and currencies. But Kenya, alongside many other countries, does not have a framework for managing cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, there’s a growing body of evidence that the Kenyan central bank can draw on to design a comprehensive regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. We explored the parameters of what a regulatory environment in Kenya would look like in a paper published in 2020. My colleagues and I sought to explain, in depth, the benefits and challenges of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies. Our analysis was based on the discussion from other parts of the world. Our insights could be used to guide the central bank’s research and adoption of digital currencies. Though popular, cryptocurrencies are not fully accepted across the world. Some people regard them as scams. In some instances, hackers have managed to steal the currencies and exchange them for legal tender. This is because comprehensive, global governance structures on cryptocurrencies are not yet in place. The World Economic Forum has recently created a Global Future Council on Cryptocurrencies. The team is expected to evaluate challenges and opportunities of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and blockchain technologies. The group will also assess what it will take to achieve the key aims of digital currencies. The World Economic Forum is rooting for the rollout of central bank digital currencies through distributed ledger technology, itself a blockchain technology. The ledger technology gives central banks a toehold into gaining sight of transactions. The distributed ledger technology, coupled with a regulatory oversight, has the effect of cushioning the central banking community from risks linked to receipts, payments, hardware and software systems. At the moment, the structures for digital currencies have not yet been developed in Kenya. Yet the rest of the world has already ventured into these currencies, and have structures in place in support of the innovation. The World Economic Forum is developing a central bank digital currency policy toolkit. This is a document that guides central banks on how they can develop digital currencies that suit their monetary policies. Kenya can make use of the guidelines to create its own official digital currency that doesn’t compromise its monetary policy and financial stability. In addition, a central bank digital currency would need to coexist with, and complement, the existing notes and coins. The Central Bank of Kenya is a reputable organisation that demonstrated objectivity and care to its entire citizen by warning them about cryptocurrencies. However, with the trend of stable coins and piloting of central bank digital currencies around the world, the government should actively engage in research on these digital currencies and provide a framework around these technologies. With the use of blockchain technology, a central bank digital currency can be developed that would open the door to transformational innovations. Businesses and individuals can use them to add novel transactions to the existing chain of activities. And, because blockchain encourages direct sharing of a network in which an individual can interact and confirm payments without contacting any intermediary, it could boost financial inclusion in Kenya. The adoption of digital currencies will change the financial market and improve the money transfer landscape in the eastern African region. It’s no surprise therefore that the Governor of Tanzania’s Central Bank Florens Luoga has also just announced that the country plans to launch its own digital currency soon.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Dorothy Muthoka-Kagwaini, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-12-02T14:23:58Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eKenya’s central bank has been \u003ca href\u003d\"https://kenyanwallstreet.com/cbk-in-discussions-over-digital-currency/\"\u003emulling\u003c/a\u003e the official use of a digital currency.

More multimillion-dollar sales of these digital assets that exist on a blockchain and are maintained on networked computers soon followed. At the same time, art museums have faced substantial financial shortfalls accelerated by a decline in visitors and donations induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many have considered taking drastic measures, such as selling treasured artworks, to plug budget gaps. Can NFTs generate the revenue many museums sorely need? Some are issuing their own tokens, including the British Museum and the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. The Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami accepted an early NFT from a donor. There’s even an NFT of entire museum called the Museum of Digital Life. Yet, more than six months into this disruption of the art world, museums have generally engaged very little with NFTs. As researchers who examine both the finances of nonprofit organizations and the growth in NFTs, crypto-assets and other associated blockchain applications, we see four primary reasons why museums have failed to turn the NFT craze into a financial windfall.  The people running museums have expertise encompassing art, education and curation. NFTs are an entirely different realm that’s quite detached from art and have more in common with crypto-currency than typical artworks like paintings and sculptures. What sets NTFs apart from crypto-currencies like bitcoin and ethereum, which are designed to be interchangeable, is that each NFT represents a unique asset. Figuring out how NFTs must be treated, held and valued is hard, and the ability to quickly mint NFTs for auction is not something that may come naturally to museum staff. What’s more, NFTs are typically bought and sold with crypto-currencies, and not many organizations – including museums – regularly make transactions using them. On top of any missing financial know-how and a culture that seeks to minimize risks, there are legal complexities and insurance complications. So we can understand why museums have not rushed into the NFT market.  The connection between the ownership of a piece of art and an NFT associated with that artwork can be confusing. Although it may appear otherwise, the NFT is a separate asset from the art itself. The owners of the art retain ownership even after any NFTs derived from that art are minted and sold. This separation may mean that the owner of the art has no particular ability to turn an affiliated NFT into a big payoff. Much like the value of a painting has little to do with what the paint, canvas and frame are worth, an NFT’s financial value is subjective. It depends on what others are willing to pay. The creators of the underlying art, such as musicians and artists who retain control over their work, can – and do – mint NFTs connected to them. Once art is held in a museum collection, however, the value of NFTs is less clear. Much like an author-autographed copy of a book can be more valuable than a book without that signature, an NFT minted by an artist of a popular artwork can attract interest from collectors. On the other hand, a book signed by the publisher or an NFT minted by a museum is bound to be less appealing to collectors. An artist-minted NFT that a museum holds could fetch more interest. Stated another way, even if a museum possesses valuable artwork, that does not mean minting NFTs is a guaranteed revenue stream. One underlying reason the market for NFTs tied to artwork has thrived is because buyers view purchasing and holding an NFT as a means to interact with and financially support the artist. More broadly, the ethos is one of decentralization, and NFT buyers are less likely to be enthusiastic about an intermediary joining the fray. An example of the ethos built around supporting artists is the prevalence of smart contracts that secure royalties for the artist that will flow every time an NFT tied to one of their works is sold. In fact, the monetization often touted as the primary upside for museums seeking to jump into the NFT market may not be as simple as initially appears. First, museums need to see whether monetizing their existing collections would in any way undermine public access to collections – potentially violating their missions and bylaws. Second, they must have protocols in place to ensure that proceeds from sales tied to the collection are correctly reinvested. And there’s a risk that this process could inadvertently lead to pieces of the collection being treated as financial instruments if income is being generated from them rather than solely serving as items on display for the public. Moving forward, it remains to be seen whether NFTs will financially benefit brick-and-mortar museums, rather than creating new opportunities for virtual ones.  Though the high prices they can fetch are eye-catching, there are countless cases of NFTs that quickly become worthless. And, as with crypto-currencies, there’s lots of volatility. The value of several NFTs have undergone massive and dramatic losses, including ones issued by Grimes, A$AP Rocky and John Cena. Relying on NFTs to raise cash may be risky, and the boards of museums may determine that it’s inappropriate for their charitable organization to own them. That means museums may be forced to quickly liquidate any NFT they mint or receive – even if that sale will make the NFT less valuable to the institution. Also, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about what valuable NFTs can do for an art museum’s primary goals. They are neither physical in nature nor works of art. Even digital artwork that can be displayed is separate from any NFT derived from it. To be sure, NFTs are still new. Banks and other traditional financial institutions initially stood on the crypto-currency sidelines but have slowly assumed a bigger role in those markets. It is certainly possibly that something similar will occur with traditional institutions in the art world as the NFT market matures.

An artist-minted NFT that a museum holds could fetch more interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStated another way, even if a museum possesses valuable artwork, that \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/why-would-anyone-buy-crypto-art-let-alone-spend-millions-on-whats-essentially-a-link-to-a-jpeg-file-157115\"\u003edoes not mean\u003c/a\u003e minting NFTs is a guaranteed revenue stream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e3.

Second, they must have protocols in place to ensure that proceeds from sales tied to the collection are correctly reinvested.

It joins the Bahamas and the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank in being among the first jurisdictions in the world to roll out national digital currencies. The Conversation Africa’s Wale Fatade asks Iwa Salami what a digital currency is and whether Nigeria can achieve its aims of introducing the currency. A digital currency is a means of payment or money that exists in a purely electronic form. Central bank digital currencies are issued and regulated by the nation’s monetary authority, or central bank, and backed by the government. They are different from existing electronic central bank money, which is provided by central banks but can only be used by banks and selected financial institutions. When financial institutions pay each other, they pay in reserves from accounts held with a central bank. Before central bank digital currencies, the only way consumers could use money that is a direct liability of a central bank was with physical cash. Existing digital retail payment from customer deposits accounts in banks are based on money that is the liability of the institution providing the account, not a central bank. A central bank digital currency is a direct liability on the central bank and is available to all households and businesses giving them access to electronic central bank money. It can be transferred or exchanged using technologies such as blockchain. Blockchain is a system of storing records of transactions across a network of computers. Nigeria’s digital currency will be the digital form of the Naira and will be used just like cash. A central bank digital currency is not a cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are not currencies in most countries since they are not a generally accepted form of payment. Although they are still widely referred to as cryptocurrencies, they are best described as digital assets, or crypto-assets. The Bahamas, Saint Lucia, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda are among the seven countries that have launched central bank digital currencies. The Central Bank has given several reasons for launching the eNaira. It is to: promote and facilitate financial inclusion enable direct welfare disbursements to citizens facilitate diaspora remittances reduce the cost of processing cash improve the availability and usability of Central Bank money increase revenue and tax collection support a resilient payment system improve the efficiency of cross-border payments. The introduction of the eNaira will enable peer-to-peer payments, cutting out ‘middle men’ or the use of intermediaries, such as financial institutions. One is its potential to disrupt existing banking systems. This could occur if citizens decide to hold digital currency instead of keeping their physical Naira in a bank account. This would mean that banks would not have money to grant loans and other financial products. It could result in banks raising their interest rates as an incentive for customers to keep deposits within the banks. But then interest charged on loans would also go up to cover interest on savings. However, since the eNaira is non-interest bearing and the Central Bank can place transaction and balance limits on certain eNaira wallets, this risk is minimised. The second risk is operational. For example, if IT systems were to fail or if there were technological glitches, or cyber-attacks. These can compromise user privacy. The Central Bank will need robust technology and IT security systems. Closely linked is reputational risk to the Central Bank if the operational risks materialise. They are likely to have a huge impact on its credibility and reputation both domestically and globally. When the Central Bank takes on this new function – issuing the eNaira and maintaining a central ledger of all transactions – it might find it harder to perform its key function of ensuring a safe and sound financial system since its focus could be diverted towards managing the eNaira system in addition to carrying out its other functions in the domestic economy. A possible way to lighten this burden is through creating synthetic central bank digital currencies. This idea was put forward in 2019 in an International Monetary Fund paper. In such a system, the central bank does not directly manage the system, but outsources tasks to private institutions. Financial institutions issue the digital currency, which is fully backed by central bank money. Closely linked is the risk of the system being used to launder money and finance terrorism. Financial institutions would need strong systems for combating these threats, supported by national legal infrastructure. Another risk is around data protection and privacy. The Central Bank claims that the: eNaira system is built with deep considerations around privacy and data protection and in compliance with the National Data Protection Regulations. However, as the system is designed in line with the guidelines to prevent the illicit flow and use of funds which require identifying transacting parties and the details of their transactions, proper systems need to be in place to ensure that the privacy rights of users of the eNaira system are not violated. There’s also a need to educate people about the eNaira. Although the central bank says there are ‘campaigns to deepen the understanding of eNaira amongst the population’ it is unclear what this entails. Citizens need to know the difference between the digital representation of cash deposits in bank accounts and the eNaira in digital wallets. Nigeria could certainly pull this off, provided the technology infrastructure and the technological know-how are in place. It is stated that the eNaira shall be administered by the central bank through the Digital Currency Management System to mint and issue eNaira but it appears this system has been built by Bitt, a global financial technology company. It provides digital currency and stablecoin solutions to central banks, financial institutions and ecosystem participants worldwide. As such, the maintenance of the eNaira system would very much depend on the technological strength of this company and the extent to which they are retained to provide a maintenance framework for the system. Another issue is the electricity crisis and lack of widespread access to the internet across the country. These should be immediate priorities for the Central Bank, and the government, to resolve for the eNaira system to be successful. It is good to see that there’s a plan for the system to be usable while offline. Another challenge that the poor may have in accessing the eNaira system is the difficulty of attaining digital identity. The eNaira design plans to use the existing Bank Verification Number and National Identity Number regime. Getting the documents needed for these is expensive and cumbersome. As Nigeria has the largest population on the continent, spearheading this process could signal the start of a regional monetary integration. If central bank digital currency arrangements could work together across the continent it could solve the challenge of the inconvertibility of African currencies. This could help intraregional trade, which has been challenging to achieve in Africa. With the African Continental Free Trade agreement now operational, the successful launch of the eNaira might be a step towards regional monetary integration in Africa and potentially a regional central bank digital currency.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Iwa Salami, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-11-10T12:03:19Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNigeria \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/10/25/nigeria-becomes-first-african-nation-to-roll-out-digital-money\"\u003erecently\u003c/a\u003e became the first African country to introduce a digital currency.

The fact that ether fuels the platform – even being referred to as \u003ca href\u003d\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/\"\u003egas fees\u003c/a\u003e – gives it a utility and an intrinsic value that bitcoin does not have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy ethereum 2.0\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEthereum has several major problems, however.

It’s the same problem that has brought a lot of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-what-elon-musks-u-turn-on-tesla-payments-means-for-future-of-crypto-160891\"\u003enegative publicity\u003c/a\u003e to bitcoin, because it uses a lot of electricity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://cbeci.org/index/comparisons\"\u003eBitcoin is currently\u003c/a\u003e using as much power as the whole of the Philippines, although its supporters \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-energy/\"\u003eargue that\u003c/a\u003e much of this is power that would otherwise be wasted – for example, oil rigs burning off natural gas because it’s not profitable to sell it. Proponents also point out that the network is shifting towards using much more renewable power over time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt any rate, the eventual creation of an ethereum 2.0 will solve these problems by moving the platform’s system of validation from “\u003ca href\u003d\"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/\"\u003eproof of work\u003c/a\u003e” to “proof of stake”.

Blockchain offers a solution","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Ghana’s current system of land administration generates a lot of conflicts for a number of reasons. Firstly, under Ghana’s customary land tenure system, multiple people can hold interest in the same land. This means that they cannot unilaterally sell or register it without the knowledge of the other parties or claimants. However, because the current land administration system is opaque and weakly coordinated, people are able to do that. Read more: Ethiopia\u0027s blockchain deal is a watershed moment -- for the technology, and for Africa Secondly, Ghana laws require land owners to register their property with the Lands Commission. But concerns exist that the process is cumbersome and involves a lot of cost, including alleged bribe payments. As a result, many land buyers, after receiving their allocation notes, rarely complete the title or deed registration process. Finally, even in cases where land buyers follow through with the title registration process, there is some evidence that title documents can be manipulated or tampered with at the land secretariats. This means that land records in the country don’t reflect the reality. Land that’s already sold can misleadingly be captured in the Land Commission’s records as ’available’ or ’vacant’. Ghana’s ineffective land administration system has serious implications. For example, several parcels of land are unavailable for development due to ownership challenges. It also clogs up the country’s courts – a recent study suggested that about 57% of all court cases in Ghana are land related. And it can lead to violence. The fact that it can take an average of 10-20 years for the courts to resolve land conflicts, combined with a general lack of faith in the justice system, means that developers and individual land owners tend to opt for private protection by hiring armed gangs (popularly called ‘land guards’) to use force to ward off rivalry. To address the problems, we have designed a framework for managing land transactions. If built and implemented, it would make it possible for potential land buyers to authenticate or verify the status of lands they want to acquire – whether the property is registered with the Lands Commission or has been deregistered from the commission’s records. The framework integrates blockchain technology into the sale and purchase of stool lands in Ghana to make the processes more transparent, and the related transaction records impossible to tamper with. Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. It is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Blockchain has become more widely known due to its use in Bitcoin as a ledger for financial transactions that are secured with encryption, verified and recorded by network nodes (also called a digital cryptocurrency). But the technology can be put to many different uses, such as the one we are proposing around land acquisition. For this to be possible, the government would need to help build a blockchain-enabled land register. The Lands Commission is already making headway in digitising manual land records in the country. All that needs to be done is for the blockchain technology to be layered onto the ongoing land digitisation to create a blockchain-enabled land register in the country. The register could contain information such as the locations, co-ordinates and boundaries of lands; names of the caretaker chiefs or queen mothers; details of existing allocation notes or title holders such as their contact details (phone numbers and e-mails); and other legal interests attached to specific lands. Currently, if someone wants to buy land in Ghana, they contact the owner (who may be a chief, queen mother or a private person). After paying the determined price, the owner gives the relevant documents (such as a land allocation note) to the buyer to begin the title or deed registration process. The problem with the current land sale and purchase process is that it is done offline. And the person selling the land might not be the only owner or the appropriate owner, which is why the process frequently breeds conflicts. A blockchain land register would deal with these problems because land sale and purchase processes would move from offline to online. In the first stage of the land acquisition, the potential buyer or the purported land owner might initiate the purchase or sale of the land on the online blockchain-enabled land acquisition platform. And since the platform would contain the contact details (such as phone numbers and e-mails) of those who had an interest in the land, the system would automatically notify them that someone wanted to sell or buy their land (stage 2). In stage 3, if the person who initiated the sale of the land was not the true owner or the only owner, the appropriate parties notified about the transaction in stage 2 would have the opportunity to dispute and halt the transaction. The process would revert to stage 2 for resolution. If approved, the transaction would proceed to stage 4, where a purchase or sale document or a land allocation note would be issued. The buyer could then use the allocation note, as proof of transfer or purchase or sale of the land, to begin the deed or title registration process. The allocation note could contain information such as the name of the stool and the chief (or queen mother – whatever the case might be) in charge of the jurisdiction; details of the land seller and buyer, their (digital) signatures and those of their witnesses, and the terms and conditions under which the land was bought or sold. A blockchain-enabled land acquisition system would stop the unilateral sale of co-owned land because all relevant parties would be notified of any transaction initiated on their land. This would give them the opportunity to halt the transactions in real-time if it were being conducted on their blind side. It would also prevent the multiple sale or purchase of the same land because when someone sold or bought land, the records would be captured and stored on the blockchain system. Being an online platform, it would be publicly accessible to anyone. Therefore, potential land buyers could easily verify the status of land by just logging onto the blockchain land acquisition platform to see whether the land they wanted to acquire had been sold already or not or whether the person trying to sell it to them was the true or the sole owner. Finally, blockchain records are also tamper-proof, which mean they can’t be manipulated.

An expert on bitcoins and blockchains explains the risks and rewards of DeFi","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Fervent proponents of cryptocurrencies and the blockchains they run on have promised a lot. To them, these technologies represent salvation from corporate power over the internet, government intrusions on liberty, poverty and virtually everything else that ails society. But so far, the reality has mostly involved financial speculation with popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and dogecoin, which soar and plunge with alarming regularity. So what are cryptocurrencies and blockchain good for? As an expert on emerging technologies, I believe that decentralized finance, known as DeFi, is the first solid answer to that question. DeFi refers to financial services that operate entirely on blockchain networks, rather than through intermediaries like banks. But DeFi comes with a host of risks as well that developers and regulators will need to address before it can go mainstream. Traditionally, if you want to borrow US$10,000, you first need some assets or money already in the bank as collateral. A bank employee reviews your finances, and the lender sets an interest rate for the repayment of your loan. The bank gives you the money out of its pool of deposits, collects your interest payments and can seize your collateral if you fail to repay. Everything depends on the bank: It sits in the middle of the process and controls your money. The same is true of stock trading, asset management, insurance and basically every form of financial services today. Even when a financial technology app such as Chime, Affirm or Robinhood automates the process, banks still occupy the same intermediary role. That raises the cost of credit and limits borrower flexibility. DeFi turns this arrangement on its head by re-conceiving of financial services as decentralized software applications that operate without ever taking custody of user funds. Want a loan? You can get one instantly by simply putting cryptocurrency up as collateral. This creates a “smart contract” that finds your money from other people who made a pool of funds available on the blockchain. No bank loan officer necessary. Everything runs on so-called stablecoins, which are currencylike tokens typically pegged to the U.S. dollar to avoid the volatility of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. And transactions settle automatically on a blockchain – essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is distributed across a network of computers – rather than through a bank or other middleman taking a cut. Transactions made this way can be more efficient, flexible, secure and automated than in traditional finance. Moreover, DeFi eliminates the distinction between ordinary customers and wealthy individuals or institutions, who have access to many more financial products. Anyone can join a DeFi loan pool and lend money to others. The risk is greater than with a bond fund or certificate of deposit, but so are the potential returns. And that’s just the beginning. Because DeFi services run on open-source software code, they can be combined and modified in almost endless ways. For example, they can automatically switch your funds among different collateral pools based on which currently offers the best returns for your investment profile. As a result, the rapid innovation seen in e-commerce and social media could become the norm in traditionally staid financial services. These benefits help explain why DeFi growth has been meteoric. At the recent market peak in May 2021, over $80 billion worth of cryptocurrencies were locked in DeFi contracts, up from less than $1 billion a year earlier. The total value of the market was $69 billion as of Aug. 3, 2021. That’s just a drop in the bucket of the $20 trillion global financial sector, which suggests there is plenty of room for more growth. At the moment, users are mostly experienced cryptocurrency traders, not yet the novice investors who have flocked to platforms like Robinhood. Even among cryptocurrency holders, just 1% have tried DeFi. [Over 109,000 readers rely on The Conversation’s newsletter to understand the world. Sign up today.] While I believe the potential of DeFi is exciting, there are also serious causes for concern. Blockchains can’t eliminate the risks inherent in investing, which are the necessary corollary of the potential for returns. In this case, DeFi can magnify the already high volatility of cryptocurrencies. Many DeFi services facilitate leverage, in which investors essentially borrow money to magnify their gains but face greater risk of losses. Moreover, there isn’t any banker or regulator who can send back funds transferred in error. Nor is there necessarily someone to repay investors when hackers find a vulnerability in the smart contracts or other aspects of a DeFi service. Almost $300 million has been stolen in the past two years. The primary protection against unexpected losses is the warning “investor beware,” which has never proved sufficient in finance. Some DeFi services appear to violate regulatory obligations in the United States and other jurisdictions, such as not barring transactions by terrorists, or allowing any member of the general public to invest in restricted assets like derivatives. It’s not even clear how some of those requirements even could be enforced in DeFi without traditional intermediaries. Even highly mature, highly regulated traditional financial markets experience shocks and crashes because of hidden risks, as the world saw in 2008 when the global economy nearly melted down because of one obscure corner of Wall Street. DeFi makes it easier than ever to create hidden interconnections that have the potential to blow up spectacularly. Regulators in the U.S. and elsewhere are increasingly talking about ways to rein in these risks. For example, they are starting to push DeFi services to comply with anti-money laundering requirements and considering regulations governing stablecoins. But so far they have only begun to scratch the surface of what may be required. From travel agents to car salespeople, the internet has repeatedly undermined the bottleneck power of intermediaries. DeFi is another example of how software based on open standards can potentially change the game in a dramatic way. However, developers and regulators will both need to up their own performance to realize the potential of this new financial ecosystem.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Kevin Werbach, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-08-05T12:47:27Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eFervent proponents of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/cryptocurrencies-blockchains-and-their-dark-side-4-essential-reads-103567\"\u003ecryptocurrencies and the blockchains\u003c/a\u003e they run on have promised a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo them, these technologies represent salvation from \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.usv.com/writing/2016/08/fat-protocols/\"\u003ecorporate power over the internet\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://time.com/5486673/bitcoin-venezuela-authoritarian/\"\u003egovernment intrusions on liberty\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/22/blockchain-bitcoin-energy-decentralized-finance-development-poverty/\"\u003epoverty\u003c/a\u003e and virtually everything else that ails society.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut so far, the reality has mostly involved \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/210308-the-future-of-banking-cryptocurrencies-are-still-mostly-about-speculation-not-payment-11860149\"\u003efinancial speculation\u003c/a\u003e with popular cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and dogecoin, which \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/01/after-bitcoins-wild-first-half-these-are-the-5-biggest-risks-ahead.html\"\u003esoar and plunge\u003c/a\u003e with alarming regularity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what are cryptocurrencies and blockchain good for?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"slot clear\" data-id\u003d\"17\"\u003e\n \u003cdiv class\u003d\"inline-promos-skeleton\"\u003e\n  \u003ch5\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cbutton\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an \u003ca href\u003d\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user\u003dWhzTfGwAAAAJ\u0026amp;hl\u003den\u0026amp;oi\u003dao\"\u003eexpert on emerging technologies\u003c/a\u003e, I believe that decentralized finance, known as DeFi, is the first solid answer to that question. \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-defi-and-why-is-it-the-hottest-ticket-in-cryptocurrencies-144883\"\u003eDeFi refers to financial services\u003c/a\u003e that operate entirely on blockchain networks, rather than through intermediaries like banks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut DeFi comes with a host of risks as well that developers and regulators will need to address before it can go mainstream.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is DeFi?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraditionally, if you want to borrow US$10,000, you first need some assets or money already in the bank as collateral.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA bank employee reviews your finances, and the lender sets an interest rate for the repayment of your loan.

A blockchain expert explains","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency linked to an asset like the U.S. dollar that doesn’t change much in value. The majority of the dozens of stablecoins that currently exist use the dollar as their benchmark asset, but many are also pegged to other fiat currencies issued by governments like the euro and yen. As a result, the price of stablecoins is meant to fluctuate very little, unlike high-profile cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum that are prone to sudden ups and downs. The first stablecoin, created in 2014, was Tether, which many other stablecoins are modeled after. Users receive one token for every dollar they deposit. In theory, the tokens can then be converted back into the original currency at any time, also at a one-for-one exchange rate. As of May 11, 2022, there were about US$83 billion in Tether outstanding, or a bit less than half of the $172 billion market capitalization of all stablecoins worldwide. The next-largest is known as USD Coin, which has a market cap of about $49 billion. Originally, stablecoins were primarily used to buy other cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, because many cryptocurrency exchanges didn’t have access to traditional banking. They are more useful than country-issued currencies because you can use them 24 hours a day, seven days a week, anywhere in the world – without relying on banks. Money transfers take seconds to complete. Another useful feature of stablecoins is that they can work with so-called smart contracts on blockchains, which, unlike conventional contracts, require no legal authority to be executed. The code in the software automatically dictates the terms of the agreement and how and when money will be transferred. This makes stablecoins programmable in ways that dollars can’t be. Smart contracts have given rise to the use of stablecoins not only in seamless trading but also lending, payments, insurance, prediction markets and decentralized autonomous organizations – businesses that operate with limited human intervention. Collectively, these software-based financial services are known as decentralized finance, or DeFi. Proponents hold that moving money via stablecoins is faster, cheaper and easier to integrate into software compared with fiat currency. Others say the lack of regulation creates big risks for the financial system. In a recent paper, economists Gary B. Gorton and Jeffery Zhang draw an analogy to the middle of the 19th century era when banks issued their own private currencies. They say stablecoins could lead to the same problems observed in that era, when there were frequent runs because people couldn’t agree on the value of privately issued currencies. A reminder of those risks came in May 2022 as a so-called algorithmic stablecoin known as TerraUSD, or UST, plunged in value. Algorithmic stablecoins use a complex system of burning, or creating tokens for profit, to maintain their peg. As a result of these issues, regulators have taken greater interest in them recently. The Conversation U.S. publishes short, accessible explanations of newsworthy subjects by academics in their areas of expertise.

Fungibility is one of the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/education/economic-lowdown-podcast-series/episode-9-functions-of-money#:%7E:text\u003dThe%20characteristics%20of%20money%20are,%2C%20limited%20supply%2C%20and%20acceptability.\"\u003eessential properties\u003c/a\u003e of any currency according to traditional economics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut is it what it seems? By creating 10,000 individual units that mimic real currencies, Hirst is highlighting with the unique markings of each work that even fungible currencies have some non-fungible properties – for example, most currencies will have different serial numbers and issue dates on each note. This helps to underline that money is a concept that becomes ever harder to pin down when you look at it more closely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class\u003d\"align-center zoomable\"\u003e\n \u003ca href\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/411867/original/file-20210719-19-1mionf9.jpeg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d1000\u0026amp;fit\u003dclip\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class\u003d\"placeholder-container\" style\u003d\"--aspect-ratio-percent:66.71087533156499%;--background-color:#a16459\"\u003e\n   \u003cimg alt\u003d\"Damien Hirst\u0027s The Currency overlaid with paintbrushes and twenty pound notes\" class\u003d\"lazyload\" data-src\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/411867/original/file-20210719-19-1mionf9.jpeg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;fit\u003dclip\" data-srcset\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/411867/original/file-20210719-19-1mionf9.jpeg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d400\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/411867/original/file-20210719-19-1mionf9.jpeg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d30\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d400\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/411867/original/file-20210719-19-1mionf9.jpeg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d15\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d400\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/411867/original/file-20210719-19-1mionf9.jpeg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d503\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/411867/original/file-20210719-19-1mionf9.jpeg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d30\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d503\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/411867/original/file-20210719-19-1mionf9.jpeg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d15\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d503\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d3 2262w\" sizes\u003d\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n  \u003cspan class\u003d\"caption\"\u003eYours for roughly £10 per dot.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class\u003d\"attribution\"\u003e\u003ca class\u003d\"source\" href\u003d\"https://www.alamy.com/cash-and-brushes-placed-on-top-of-spot-painting-seen-on-blurred-ipad-damien-hirsts-digital-art-which-sold-as-nft-currency-stafford-united-kingdo-image434978450.html?pv\u003d1\u0026amp;stamp\u003d2\u0026amp;imageid\u003d279FE17D-CC11-47AA-91C5-C94CE69C5A9E\u0026amp;p\u003d1396470\u0026amp;n\u003d5\u0026amp;orientation\u003d0\u0026amp;pn\u003d1\u0026amp;searchtype\u003d0\u0026amp;IsFromSearch\u003d1\u0026amp;srch\u003dfoo%3Dbar%26st%3D0%26sortby%3D2%26qt%3Ddamien%2520hirst%2520the%2520currency%26qt_raw%3Ddamien%2520hirst%2520the%2520currency%26qn%3D%26lic%3D3%26edrf%3D0%26mr%3D0%26pr%3D0%26aoa%3D1%26creative%3D%26videos%3D%26nu%3D%26ccc%3D%26bespoke%3D%26apalib%3D%26ag%3D0%26hc%3D0%26et%3D0x000000000000000000000%26vp%3D0%26loc%3D0%26ot%3D0%26imgt%3D0%26dtfr%3D%26dtto%3D%26size%3D0xFF%26blackwhite%3D%26cutout%3D%26archive%3D1%26name%3D%26groupid%3D%26pseudoid%3D1267149%26userid%3D%26id%3D%26a%3D%26xstx%3D0%26cbstore%3D1%26resultview%3DsortbyPopular%26lightbox%3D%26gname%3D%26gtype%3D%26apalic%3D%26tbar%3D1%26pc%3D%26simid%3D%26cap%3D1%26customgeoip%3DGB%26vd%3D0%26cid%3D%26pe%3D%26so%3D%26lb%3D%26pl%3D0%26plno%3D%26fi%3D0%26langcode%3Den%26upl%3D0%26cufr%3D%26cuto%3D%26howler%3D%26cvrem%3D0%26cvtype%3D0%26cvloc%3D0%26cl%3D0%26upfr%3D%26upto%3D%26primcat%3D%26seccat%3D%26cvcategory%3D*%26restriction%3D%26random%3D%26ispremium%3D1%26flip%3D0%26contributorqt%3D%26plgalleryno%3D%26plpublic%3D0%26viewaspublic%3D0%26isplcurate%3D0%26imageurl%3D%26saveQry%3D%26editorial%3D%26t%3D0%26filters%3D0\"\u003emundissima/Alamy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe work further contests our sense of what money is by raising questions about another of its essential properties – that of a medium of exchange. A work by a famous artist would rarely be thought of as a medium of exchange. Instead, it would normally be treated as a scarce store of value, like gold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHirst is asking if it really has to be this way. By producing 10,000 works in the style of a currency, he is clearly having fun by showing how money is malleable and can shapeshift depending on the context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is art?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat matters most, physical or digital art? Hirst is not the first to ask this question in the context of NFTs. A few months ago, a company called Injective Protocol \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56335948\"\u003ebought a 2006 work\u003c/a\u003e by Banksy called Morons, which satirises an art auction, for US$95,000. It then burned the piece live on Twitter so that only a digital version survived on an NFT. It then sold the NFT for US$380,000.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/nft-art-the-bizarre-world-where-burning-a-banksy-can-make-it-more-valuable-156605\"\u003epreviously discussed\u003c/a\u003e how the people at Injective had cleverly decided to play on our preference for the physical over the digital. By destroying the physical version and then claiming the NFT signature would stand in for the artwork, it drew attention to the benefit that an NFT cannot be destroyed by vandals such as themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n \u003cdiv class\u003d\"placeholder-container\" style\u003d\"--aspect-ratio-percent:56.25%;--background-color:#fff\"\u003e\n  \u003ciframe class\u003d\"lazyload\" data-src\u003d\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C4wm-p_VFh0?wmode\u003dtransparent\u0026amp;start\u003d0\" frameborder\u003d\"0\" allowfullscreen width\u003d\"100%\" height\u003d\"400\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt a time when there had been an \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/nfts-are-much-bigger-than-an-art-fad-heres-how-they-could-change-the-world-159563\"\u003eexplosion in demand\u003c/a\u003e for NFT art and other collectibles, with \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/a-token-sale-christies-to-auction-its-first-blockchain-backed-digital-only-artwork-155738\"\u003esome trading hands\u003c/a\u003e for millions of pounds, this was a comment on the persistent question concerning whether NFTs really imply ownership. For many, the puzzle is why someone would feel that owning a digital version rather than an “actual” artwork constitutes ownership at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly, Hirst gets it. He is approaching the question of ownership by distilling it down to its purest economic and commercial form – literally the artwork as money. When people express puzzlement at NFTs, really what they mean is how can you spend money on something so valueless? The idea that digital ownership is equivalent to physical ownership is still unacceptable to the majority of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat Hirst is highlighting is how the “puzzle” is easily solved by recognising that there are two communities interested in his artwork: those who value his traditional physical pieces and those who value his NFT pieces. He does this, I think, to show how value never makes sense when it is removed from the cultural community that has ascribed that value to it. Each community is a mystery to the other. Zoom out, however, and they are closer than they imagine, ultimately bonding as fans of Hirst.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor most people, the puzzle is still the NFT community. This culture is populated by passionate blockchain enthusiasts and crypto-natives, young people who grew up with cryptocurrencies. For them, a blockchain wallet stores their value. This can mean fungible currencies like bitcoin or ether, but also, more and more, their art collection. These collections represent their tastes and interests and tell us a little about who they are, and what they value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA particularly clear-cut example of this would be someone who, after the year has passed, decides to claim the NFT of Hirst’s work and reject the physical version. What better move to signal commitment to a blockchain future? When the year is up and we see how many people chose to keep the NFT, it might even give an interesting indication of to what extent this new digital generation is becoming the dominant one.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"LINK":"https://theconversation.com/facebook-often-removes-evidence-of-atrocities-in-countries-like-syria-and-myanmar-but-we-can-preserve-it-164364","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"The Conversation","IMAGE":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/411229/original/file-20210714-13-1xfzf2r.jpeg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026rect\u003d835%2C0%2C3997%2C3997\u0026q\u003d45\u0026auto\u003dformat\u0026w\u003d240\u0026h\u003d240\u0026fit\u003dcrop","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Facebook often removes evidence of atrocities in countries like Syria and Myanmar – but we can preserve it","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Imtiaz Khan, Ali Shahaab, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-07-15T14:30:49Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eNearly half of the world’s population \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world\"\u003eowns a smartphone\u003c/a\u003e.

Instead, the platform was accused of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-45449938\"\u003ewhipping up hate\u003c/a\u003e in the country, while \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-41364633\"\u003edeleting the posts\u003c/a\u003e of Rohingya activists, presumably deeming their evidence of atrocities to have been “shared for sadistic pleasure or to celebrate or glorify violence”. Facebook has admitted it was “\u003ca href\u003d\"https://about.fb.com/news/2018/08/removing-myanmar-officials/\"\u003etoo slow to act\u003c/a\u003e” in Myanmar, but that better technology and more content reviewers are now in place to prevent the spread of hate in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis subjective censorship is not unique to Myanmar. In the recent conflict between Gaza and Israel, Facebook silenced dissident views, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/9/26/is-facebook-neutral-on-palestine-israel-conflict\"\u003eblocking editors’ accounts\u003c/a\u003e at the Gaza-based Shehab News agency. YouTube has also been accused of routinely \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theintercept.com/2017/11/02/war-crimes-youtube-facebook-syria-rohingya/\"\u003eremoving evidence\u003c/a\u003e of atrocities during the Arab Spring and the Syrian civil war. That content is mistakenly flagged by algorithms as violating YouTube’s guidelines, something the platform’s parent company Google accepts “\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/chemical-weapons-in-syria-youtube-algorithm-delete-video\"\u003edoesn’t always get it right\u003c/a\u003e” but takes “incredibly seriously”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo address this problem, the United Nations Human Rights Council has in recent years established a mechanism to collect, consolidate, preserve and analyse evidence related to serious international crimes. For Syria it’s called \u003ca href\u003d\"https://iiim.un.org/faq/\"\u003eIIIM\u003c/a\u003e and for Myanmar it’s the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://iimm.un.org/what-is-the-independent-investigative-mechanism-for-myanmar/\"\u003eIIMM\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese situation-specific mechanisms have adopted the approach of traditional news outlets, where experienced investigators strategically select individuals and their evidence. Material is selected based on its ability to be used as evidence in court proceedings in the future, where perpetrators of atrocities may be held to account.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElsewhere, global citizen journalism organisations such as \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bellingcat.com/\"\u003eBellingcat\u003c/a\u003e have taken a different approach. They collect evidence from different social media platforms and use a network of volunteers to analyse and investigate it. It was \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45665380\"\u003eBellingcat\u003c/a\u003e, for instance, behind \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/09/26/skripal-suspect-boshirov-identified-gru-colonel-anatoliy-chepiga/\"\u003ethe unmasking\u003c/a\u003e of the Russian man accused of poisoning Sergei and Yulia Skripal in the UK city of Salisbury in 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv data-react-class\u003d\"Tweet\" data-react-props\u003d\"{\u0026quot;tweetId\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1045189449770881024\u0026quot;}\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFlawed systems\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLaudable as they are, these approaches have their flaws. One of them is that they’re centralised. This increases the risk that citizens’ identities could be exposed (via a hack, for instance) which often deters people from coming forward and providing evidence in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCentralised systems are also susceptible to compromise, subjectivity, discrimination or even destruction. The computer hard drive containing evidence from the whistleblower Edward Snowden \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/jan/31/snowden-files-computer-destroyed-guardian-gchq-basement-video\"\u003ewas destroyed\u003c/a\u003e by the Guardian, under the supervision of officials from the UK intelligence agency GCHQ, in 2013. More recently, Israel’s armed forces \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-tower-housing-ap-al-jazeera-collapses-after-missile-strike-witness-2021-05-15/\"\u003ebombed\u003c/a\u003e the offices of Associated Press and Al Jazeera in Gaza in May 2021, destroying any evidence the news agencies may have been storing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s clear we need a decentralised platform, without gatekeepers or potential single points of failure, to properly preserve people’s digital evidence of atrocities. This could be seen as similar to Wikipedia: distributed and under no one’s direct control.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, unlike Wikipedia, such a platform must be able to guarantee anonymity to protect citizens from exposure and future retribution. Once evidence is uploaded, it needs to be time-stamped and made immutable, so that no one (including the evidence provider) can edit or delete the evidence. The platform itself also needs to be resistant to any form of cyberattack, so that it can’t be taken down. All this requires engagement with new technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eRobust evidence preservation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, creating a distributed website is relatively easy. Conventional websites use what’s called a hypertext transfer protocol (\u003ca href\u003d\"https://techterms.com/definition/http\"\u003eHTTP\u003c/a\u003e), which keeps the website’s files stored on a central server or computer. But there are alternative, peer-to-peer protocols (like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://hackernoon.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ipfs-20673fedd3f\"\u003eIPFS\u003c/a\u003e, for instance) which enable a website’s files to be stored across many computers. This means no authority can shut it down. Similarly, IPFS can also be used to store evidence-related files in a distributed and decentralised fashion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaking evidence-sharing anonymous simply requires the website to be integrated with an evidence drop box area supported by \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.torproject.org/\"\u003eTor\u003c/a\u003e, which creates free and open-source software for anonymous communication. News outlets such as the Guardian and the New York Times already use Tor for \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/05/guardian-launches-securedrop-whistleblowers-documents\"\u003eanonymous file drops\u003c/a\u003e. Citizens should also be encouraged to use \u003ca href\u003d\"https://vpnoverview.com/privacy/anonymous-browsing/tor/\"\u003eTor’s anonymous browser\u003c/a\u003e to shield themselves from corporate tracking and government surveillance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, unlike centralised systems, the evidence uploaded anonymously to this distributed file system (IPFS) must remain immutable and indestructible. This can be achieved by engaging with the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp\"\u003eblockchain\u003c/a\u003e network, which is the technology behind \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2020/blockchain-structure-and-cryptocurrency-prices\"\u003ecryptocurrencies\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlockchain is an open-source distributed ledger or database system in which an updated copy of the records is available to all stakeholders at all times across the globe. This makes it almost impossible for a single person or company to hack everybody’s ledger, ensuring security against cyberattacks. The database stores cryptocurrency transaction data – but blockchain could also store digital evidence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFighting injustice and atrocities\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe evidence-drop website we propose means victims and witnesses can upload their evidence \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.icj.org/on-video-how-can-the-un-respond-effectively-to-crimes-under-international-law-in-situations-of-crisis/\"\u003eduring a crisis\u003c/a\u003e and, when situation is favourable, see it used by investigative journalists or by prosecutors at the International Court of Justice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch a website would empower ordinary citizens and whistleblowers to fight injustice and atrocities. At the same time, it would put psychological pressure on perpetrators, who’d know evidence exists of their crimes which cannot be destroyed, altered or invalidated. This shift of power and mindset could reconfigure the relationship between oppressor and oppressed, overturning the “new normal” of atrocities that appears to have taken hold across the world.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"LINK":"https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-alternatives-could-provide-a-green-solution-to-energy-guzzling-cryptocurrencies-163409","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"The Conversation","IMAGE":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/410791/original/file-20210712-15-1kq5y30.jpeg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026rect\u003d1634%2C0%2C3997%2C3997\u0026q\u003d45\u0026auto\u003dformat\u0026w\u003d240\u0026h\u003d240\u0026fit\u003dcrop","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Bitcoin alternatives could provide a green solution to energy-guzzling cryptocurrencies","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The cryptocurrency bitcoin now uses up more electricity a year than the whole of Argentina, according to recent estimates from the University of Cambridge. That’s because the creation of a bitcoin, in a process called mining, is achieved by powerful computers that work night and day to decode and solve complex mathematical problems. The energy these computers consume is unusually high. Police in the UK recently raided what they believed to be an extensive indoor marijuana-growing operation, only to discover that the huge electricity usage that had aroused their suspicions was actually coming from a bitcoin-mining setup. Thousands of similar setups, around 70% of which are currently based in China, continue to demand more and more energy to mine bitcoins. This has understandably prompted environmental concerns, with Elon Musk tweeting in May 2021 that Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin as payment for its vehicles on account of its poor green credentials. But there are thousands of other forms of cryptocurrency, collectively termed “altcoins”, which are far greener than bitcoin – and to which investors are now turning. Many of them are attempting to use less environmentally damaging technology to produce each coin, which may ultimately herald a greener future for cryptocurrencies. Of the thousands of “altcoins” in the market, ethereum, solarcoin, cardano, and litecoin have shown promising potential as greener alternatives to bitcoin. Let us take the example of litecoin as an example of how they’re doing it. Litecoins are very similar to bitcoins, except that they reportedly only require a quarter of the time to produce. Where sophisticated and powerful hardware with a colossal energy demand is needed to mine bitcoins, litecoins can be mined with standard computer hardware which requires far less electricity to run. Other alternatives, such as solarcoin, aim to encourage real-world green behaviours. One solarcoin is allocated for every megawatt hour that’s generated from solar technology, rewarding those who’ve invested in renewable energy. Different cryptocurrencies also use different processes to complete transactions. Bitcoin uses what’s called a “proof-of-work” protocol to validate transactions, which requires a network of miners to compete to solve mathematical problems (the “work”). The winner – and the person who mints a new bitcoin – is usually the competitor with the most computing power. While proof-of-work is credited for being relatively secure, making it difficult and costly to attack and destabilise, it’s incredibly power-hungry. The way it forces bitcoin miners to compete with an ever-expanding arsenal of high-tech computers means it has inevitably come to demand more and more electrical power. But there are alternatives to this form of mining. Ethereum, which is the world’s second largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin, now uses a different protocol, called “proof-of-stake”. This protocol was specifically designed to address environmental concerns about the proof-of-work system, and it does this by eliminating competition between miners. Without the competition, there’s no computing power arms race for miners to participate in. Given the increasing environmental scrutiny that cryptocurrency is now facing, it’s likely that any new altcoins will adopt ethereum’s system over bitcoin’s. Investors will likewise look to the green credentials of altcoins when deciding which cryptocurrency they’ll convert their bitcoin into. Despite the criticisms levelled against bitcoin for its shocking energy inefficiencies, the traditional financial system is far from green itself. In the five years since the Paris Agreement on climate change, for instance, it’s reported that 60 of the world’s biggest banks have provided $3.8 trillion (£2.7 trillion) to fossil fuel companies – not very planet-friendly. One report found that 49% of financial institutions don’t conduct any analysis of how their portfolio impacts the climate. Then there’s the sector’s electricity use. Where cryptocurrencies have the potential to run without the oversight of large financial institutions, the banking sector is built upon a huge amount of infrastructure which naturally burns through a great deal of electricity. Banks themselves use plenty of computers and servers, as well as thousands of air-conditioned offices and fuel-guzzling vehicles. It’s difficult to estimate exactly how much energy is required to support all this activity, but one recent report found that the banking system consumes more than twice the electricity that bitcoin does. So while bitcoin is rightly getting a battering for its outrageous energy consumption, there’s ultimately a need for all our financial systems to be green and sustainable. Banks can do this by reconsidering their portfolios and working towards net zero carbon emissions. But cryptocurrencies offer a different path to greener finance – and the altcoins that concentrate on their environmental credentials may well clean up the technology’s reputation for excessive energy use.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Sankar Sivarajah, Kamran Mahroof, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-07-12T15:14:02Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe cryptocurrency bitcoin now uses up more electricity a year than the whole of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56012952\"\u003eArgentina\u003c/a\u003e, according to \u003ca href\u003d\"https://cbeci.org/cbeci/comparisons/\"\u003erecent estimates\u003c/a\u003e from the University of Cambridge.

But the infrastructure behind internet-based cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, dogecoin and ethereum is more like a rusty travelling circus. And right now, that circus is on the road. Bitcoin relies on a network of millions of specialist machines, known as miners, around 70% of which are currently based in China. Like a never-ending game of Hungry Hippos, each player hammers their mining machines 24/7 to try and scoop up as many bitcoins as possible. With only a few hippos, its easy for everyone to be a winner. But with around 2.5 million miners chasing an ever-shrinking number of prizes, the game is becoming increasingly difficult. Bitcoin’s booming popularity has caused its electricity demand to swell. With no central planning, a perpetual arms race for equipment continues, creating 15,000 tonnes of burned out electronic waste annually. To maximise profits, mining machines are often crammed into shipping containers, with operators ready to up sticks at a moment’s notice to find the cheapest sources of energy. During China’s summer rain season, hydro power plants in the south-western provinces generate so much energy that miners can mop up the leftovers. But in the winter dry season, many miners unplug and hit the road, heading for the coal-fired power plants scattered across China’s vast northern territories.  Recent crypto price increases have encouraged some Chinese bitcoiners to mine coal and restart idle power plants without permission, endangering lives and threatening President Xi Jinping’s climate goals. Bitcoin’s energy demand has more than doubled in a year from 55 terawatt-hours (TWh) to 125 TWh. The network now has a carbon footprint similar to the whole of Poland. Chinese regulators closed down all the country’s crypto exchanges in 2017. Even so, rocketing demand for bitcoin elsewhere means the network’s energy use in China is predicted to peak by 2024 at around 300 TWh. That’s equivalent to the total energy demand of the UK. With a crypto circus in tow, Beijing’s commitments to cut carbon emissions by 65% before 2030 would be near impossible to meet. In an attempt to reduce bitcoin’s environmental impacts in China, the coal-dependent province of Inner Mongolia recently banned bitcoin mining and set up a hotline to report suspected transgressors. But on average, mining just one bitcoin per day requires a US$1.8 million (£1.3 million) investment in specialist equipment. Expulsions from the province could force some highly invested bitcoiners underground, while forcing others to find new places to park up in neighbouring countries which don’t have China’s seasonal glut of renewable energy. To prevent an influx of Chinese miners chasing cheaper electricity, Iran’s President recently clamped down on new oil-fuelled mining, which authorities blame for increasing urban smog. The Black Sea territory of Abkhazia is trying to hold back foreign miners as officials there are forced to introduce rolling blackouts due to energy shortages. Bitcoin mining has been blamed for overloaded electricity lines and power station fires, leaving some areas without power for days. UK authorities have also paid the price for bitcoin’s boom. In May 2021, officers from West Midlands Police in the UK, believing they were raiding an illegal cannabis farm in Sandwell, instead discovered around 100 bitcoin mining machines running off an improvised connection to the electricity supply. The outdated machines were so inefficient that they could only turn a profit with stolen energy. These thefts raise energy prices for everyone else, causing fuel poverty and risking public safety.  Demand for mining machines has caused computer chip shortages, hurting more useful industries struggling back to work post-COVID. UK carmakers have cut production while smartphone companies have delayed future launches. The price of specialist chips used by the likes of Intel and Apple have increased by around 70% so far in 2021, with knock-on effects for UK consumers. Even universities and hospitals are affected by bitcoin’s second-order effects. According to the insurer, Hiscox, around 4,500 organisations fell victim to cyber attacks every day in the UK in 2018. Many of these involve ransomware payments, 98% of which are paid in bitcoin. Some argue that to slow the increase in ransomware attacks, authorities need to crack down on cryptocurrency exchanges that enable bitcoin ransoms to be paid. Others claim that cryptocurrencies and ransomware are now so entwined that the only way to fight the latter is to ban cryptocurrencies altogether. To clean up the crypto industry, a UN-backed Crypto Climate Accord and the Bitcoin Miners Council were established. These groups urge bitcoin miners in the US to only use leftover renewable energy. But it’s not possible to give a higher price to bitcoins produced using only renewables, because bitcoins are designed to be fully interchangable. Research shows that new miners joining the competition in North America have encouraged miners where there are no renewables to use more machines and work harder, increasing the network’s overall carbon footprint. For regulatory purposes, bitcoin should be considered similar to the global trade in Chinese tiger parts. Banning tiger hunting in the UK is pointless, but banning the sale of tiger parts is useful. Likewise, when UK-based investors are allowed to speculate on bitcoin, they encourage an environmentally disastrous global industry that has so far failed to benefit anyone except criminals and some early speculators. Cracking down on crypto exchanges or banning the import and use of mining equipment could be a relatively easy win for the UK as it prepares to host the 2021 UN climate summit. Doing nothing about the problem would negate the UK’s progress in other areas. Thanks to tax relief schemes and infrastructure investment, electric car registrations increased by 41% in 2020, preventing the release of around 50 million tonnes of CO₂ a year. Meanwhile, bitcoin mining causes nearly 60 million tonnes of CO₂ annually. China appears committed to putting its own house in order, but bitcoin’s social and environmental impacts urgently need a global response.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Peter Howson, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-06-04T14:34:18Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eHuge concrete data centres, permanently plugged into power plants and telephone exchanges, maintain much of online life.

What has not been fully exploited is the unique features of blockchain technology that can improve the lives of people and businesses. These include the fact that it is an open source software. This makes its source code legally and freely available to end-users who can use it to create new products and services. Another significant feature is that it is decentralised, democratising the operation of the services built on it. Control of the services built on the blockchain isn’t in the hands of an individual or a single entity but involves all those connected to the network. In addition, it enables peer to peer interaction between those connected to the network. This is key as it enables parties to transact directly without using intermediaries or third parties. Finally, it has inbuilt security. Data stored on it is immutable and cannot be changed easily. New data can be added only after it is verified by everyone in the network. Unfortunately, bitcoin, the project that introduced blockchain technology, has hogged the limelight, diverting attention from the technology’s underlying potential benefits. Bitcoin has been embroiled in massive controversies, attracting a host of criticisms. These include the fact that it’s speculative and volatile, and that it doesn’t provide any utility. Its price is driven largely by what investors think of it rather than any intrinsic value. This is unlike other asset classes from which value can be derived such as gold (jewellery), real estate (rent), stocks and bonds (interest). There is also an argument that it is bad for the environment because it uses so much electricity. In addition, developments and projects in the crypto-assets space since the launch of bitcoin have been largely driven by commercial interest and investment returns. Little attention has been given to its potential to contribute to the social and economic welfare of people. But this is slowly changing. A few companies have begun showcasing blockchain capabilities to various African countries. Unlike most other cryptocurrency blockchains which focus on private sector use in developed regions like Europe and North America, their approach has been to target the governments and public institutions in the developing world. In April the Ethiopian government confirmed that it had signed a deal to create a national database of student and teacher IDs using a decentralised digital identity solution. The deal involves providing IDs for 5 million students across 3,500 schools which will be used to store educational records. This is the largest blockchain deal ever to be signed by a government and has been making waves in the crypto-asset industry. I believe that the deal marks a watershed moment for the use of blockchain and the crypto-asset industry, and for African economies because it offers the promise of blockchain being used for real socio-economic change. The deal means that blockchain technology will be used to provide digital identity to millions of Ethiopians. Digital identity – missing in most African countries – is the first step to real financial inclusion, which in turn has been shown to carry a host of benefits. What makes this promising is that it is the first main blockchain project focused on serving the African market with goals that align with developmental agendas set out under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals as well as the African Union Agenda 2063 goals. There are three companies behind the deal. The first is Cardano, which has been at the forefront of showing how its core technology can be used to the benefit of governments. Cardano is technically owned by the Cardano Foundation, a Swiss non-profit organisation. Cardano commissioned the software company IOHK and a Japanese software company, Emurgo, to develop and maintain the Cardano blockchain. Cardano is’t alone in trying to power the future of finance by establishing a financial system characterised by peer to peer transactions. Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation after bitcoin, is also pursuing this path. Both projects have a shared history as their CEOs (Vitalik Buterin and Charles Hoskinson) were founders of Ethereum but went their separate ways due to a business disagreement. Cardano, IOHK and Emurgo have been showcasing how Cardano blockchain and its core technology can be used to the benefit of African countries. In the case of the Ethiopian deal, a decentralised digital identity solution, Atala Prism, is being used. The project will build digital identity solutions on the Cardano blockchain. The idea is to start by granting primary, secondary and university students a digital identity that can track their educational, career and future progress. Since the launch of bitcoin, the crypto-asset industry has had an eventful history, with dramatic episodes. The exponential rise and drastic fall in the price of bitcoin, particularly from 2017, has also added to concerns about it. Then there was the proposed launch of private global stablecoins such as proposed by Facebook Libra, now called Diem. And fierce opposition of western governments for their fear of potential loss of monetary sovereignty. This resulted in a drive led by China to launch central bank digital currencies. Many countries are now exploring this option. More intriguing has been the growth in a decentralised finance industry. A full-blown financial system now appears to be running in the form of non-custodial finance as transactions happen on a peer to peer basis rather than through financial intermediaries like banks. But claims that a cryptocurrency could deliver financial inclusion (since it facilitates the peer to peer exchange of value) have not been met. This is because currencies like bitcoin are far less accessible to those who need financial inclusion the most – such as those located in very poor, and economically disadvantaged countries. The bitcoin network is not managed by any corporate entity because of its decentralised open source network and therefore doesn’t have a profit driven mission. Nevertheless the cryptocurrency is now mostly desirable for its ability to make people rich. Given the increasing doubts and concerns about the bitcoin network, surely the right approach would be to shift focus away from it and instead to put energy into blockchain projects promising real contributions to the world? It is clear that new technologies such as blockchains hold huge promises to help achieve inclusive growth in economies such as those in Africa. They could be used, for example, in facilitating the continent’s free trade agreement through the institution of regional digital currencies, powered by blockchain. These could promote intra-regional trade and could, indeed, be the answer to the currency inconvertibility problems – the inability to exchange one African currency for another – which has long plagued trade in the region. The Ethiopian deal should be one that African governments monitor closely.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Iwa Salami, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-05-20T06:57:39Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eAt the launch of bitcoin \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2017/12/06/a-short-history-of-bitcoin-and-crypto-currency-everyone-should-read/?sh\u003d109a213f2792\"\u003ein 2009\u003c/a\u003e the size of the potential of the underlying technology, the blockchain, was not fully appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat has not been fully exploited is the unique features of blockchain technology that can improve the lives of people and businesses.

Others for money. The world record for most money paid for a sports-related item goes to the original Olympic manifesto written in 1892 by International Olympic Committee founder Pierre de Coubertin. It changed hands in 2019 for US$8.8 million. In second place is the New York Yankees jersey worn by legendary American baseball player Babe Ruth, sold in 2012 for USA$4.4 million. As in all markets for collectibles, scarcity equals value. Which is why sport organisations, memorabilia sellers and collectors are getting excited about non-fungible tokens – or NFTs – a blockchain-enabled technology that proves unique ownership of digital content. NFTs open up a huge new market to sell limited-edition images, videos and artwork. They also enable the original licensees – be it sports organisations or individual athletes – to share in resale profits. NFTs are already sweeping the art market. In March, auction house Christie’s sold an NFT of a work by American digital artist Mike Winkelmann, known as Beeple, for US$69 million. Auction house Sotheby’s last month sold a single pixel for $US1.36 million. Could we see similar NFT values in the sports collectibles market? Quite possibly. Though tangible items such as uniforms, balls and bats will likely continue to be prized collectibles, collectors are already paying big bucks for digital versions of old favourites such as trading cards. Leading the game is the US National Basketball Association, which began selling limited-edition “Top Shots” – digitally packaged and NFT-authenticated video highlight clips – in October 2020. Like traditional trading cards, these are sold in “packs”. Some videos are common, others rare. One such rare “moment” – in reality about half a moment – of basketball superstar LeBron James dunking reportedly changed hands in April for US$387,000. Who knows what someone might pay for that moment in decades to come? It might be millions more. Or much much less. Because this market, for all its early promises of rich rewards, is not without its downsides, with potential for significant environmental and social costs. Something is fungible when it has a standardised and interchangeable value. It is replaceable by something else just like it. Cash is the obvious example. Non-fungible essentially means something unique, non-replaceable. So NFTs are essentially digital certificates, secured with blockchain technology, that authenticate an item’s provenance – that it is a limited edition or one of kind – and enable it to be bought and sold as such. An NFT provides scarcity of digital content that can be relatively easily copied – a photo of Indian cricket great Sachin Tendulkar making a world-record score, for example, or a video of tennis No. 1 Ash Barty winning at Wimbledon. Read more: What are NFTs and why are people paying millions for them? The potential riches are evident from the NBA’s Top Shot sales, which accounted for US$500 million in transactions in the first three months of the year. This was a third of the total US$1.5 billion in NFT transactions, according to DappRadar, which tracks blockchain markets. Last month San Francisco-based NBA team the Golden State Warriors was the first US professional sports team to issue its own NFT collection, which includes limited-edition digital versions of championship rings and ticket stubs. Individual athletes are also selling their own branded items in NFT form. NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes, for example, is selling signed digital artwork. Champion skateboarder Mariah Duran and paralympian Scout Bassett are among a group of elite women athletes who will release NFTs this month. Expect to see many more selling NFTs in the wake of the Toyko Olympics. But there are some big downsides. The first is environmental – because of the energy used in blockchain verification processes. Of course, making and transporting physical goods has a range of environmental impacts, but by one calculation the carbon footprint of selling an NFT artwork is almost 100 times that of selling and transporting a print version. In February, French digital artist Joanie Lemercier cancelled the sale of six works, and urged others to do the same, after calculating those sales would use the same amount of electricity in ten seconds as his studio used in two years. Eliminating this downside of NFTs will depend on more efficient technology and more renewable energy. Read more: NFTs: why digital art has such a massive carbon footprint The second is social – of people only seeing NFTs as a way to make money. As in any market where prices are rising rapidly, there is the danger of a speculative bubble. Here, the risk is that buyers spend big on virtual items that may end up being virtually worthless when the bubble bursts. Last year also saw large and continuing market growth in traditional sport collectibles such as trading cards, along with retail investment in cryptocurrencies and stock markets more generally. So, while the value attached to NFTs may prove to be enduring, it is possible some part of the early interest in sport NFTs is driven by “irrational exuberance” and patterns of people spending more time and money online due to the COVID pandemic. Read more: NFTs are much bigger than an art fad – here\u0027s how they could change the world There are likely to be many more sport organisations and athletes peddling their digital wares in the near future. It is though, difficult to predict whether sales will continue this trajectory, how and when this trend might “normalise”, or if NFTs indeed represent a speculative bubble. Particularly for fans playing in this market, care should be taken to not let emotions trump prudence and good judgment.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Adam Karg, Kathleen Wilson, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-05-05T07:08:24Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eSome buy sporting memorabilia for love.

Bitcoin is worth six times what it was 12 months ago, and the joke currency Dogecoin has seen a hundredfold increase in price. A boom in “non-fungible tokens”, or NFTs – tradable tokens based on the same technology as cryptocurrency – is transforming the art market. With this growth has come renewed scrutiny, with critics attacking Bitcoin in particular as a speculative bubble that uses vast amounts of electricity and produces no real value. A new cryptocurrency called Chia, which has just begun trading, sets out to remedy these flaws while upholding cryptocurrency’s promise of a secure, decentralised form of payment. Chia is the brainchild of Bram Cohen, who invented the BitTorrent peer-to-peer filesharing system. He claims it will be more reliable than other cryptocurrencies, and more environmentally friendly too. Unlike traditional currencies such as the dollar or euro, which are issued by central banks and rely on trust in governments, cryptocurrencies rely on a decentralised database called a blockchain, secured by sophisticated cryptographic tools. The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, released in 2009, and today there are at least 5,922 cryptocurrencies available. Bitcoin is still by far the biggest; the total value of all Bitcoin now in existence is some US$1.2 trillion. Read more: Demystifying the blockchain: a basic user guide Despite this booming popularity, very few retailers accept cryptocurrency as payment. Governments around the world are also exploring digital currencies. The Bank of England is hiring a dedicated team to explore the possibilities in this area, while the Australian Stock Exchange is reviewing applications for a cryptocurrency-based exchange-traded fund. Germany is one of the frontrunners in embracing crypto, and is heavily investing in blockchain solutions for institutional investment. Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies use a system in which currency is created or “mined” using computers to solve mathematical puzzles. These are known as “proof of work” systems — solving the puzzle is proof that your computer has done a certain amount of work.

Bitcoin mining has helped create shortages of graphics processors, and by some estimates it is more energy-intensive than copper mining and uses more electricity than some entire countries.  Chia runs on a system that should use less energy, called “proof of space and time”. In this system, users need to show they have reserved a specific amount of hard drive space at a precise time. So Chia won’t use huge amounts of electricity, and won’t see miners buying up every graphics card in sight. But the requirement for hard drive storage space may lead to other drawbacks. Even before its official launch, Chia has used more than an exabyte of data storage. That’s the equivalent of about a million of the 1 terabyte hard drives you might find in an average desktop computer. According to the South China Morning Post, hard drive prices in China have begun to soar as Chia miners stockpile storage. The price of 12-terabyte drives has increased by 59% since Chia was announced in February this year, and most professional-quality hard drives with more than 8 terabytes of capacity are sold out. Vietnam is also seeing hard drive shortages as a result of China’s Chia craze. We may well see similar effects in other countries in the not too distant future. At present, Chia lacks the name recognition and celebrity endorsements that have helped the likes of Bitcoin and Dogecoin to soar, but it has a clear cost advantage. We can expect cryptocurrency miners will be inclined to try Chia, as a cheaper option than established cryptocurrencies. Eventually, hard drive manufacturers may also revise their prices to increase their own revenue. Time will tell how Chia ends up performing on the market. If it takes off, we can expect a boom in hard drive prices. But on the flipside, it might also mean graphics processor prices come back down.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Mohiuddin Ahmed, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-05-04T19:10:35Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIt has been a big year for cryptocurrency.

How could technologies like blockchain that provide data to producers, distributors and consumers be part of the solution? Big data applications may present opportunities to address inefficiencies from farm to table and improve global food security. Blockchain, a linked decentralized database that stores auditable data throughout entire supply chains, may change the game for food producers across the globe. With global-scale food systems such as seafood, nearly 40 per cent of which is traded globally, data transparency and traceability through technologies like blockchain are important for socially and environmentally conscious decision making and to facilitate trust among stakeholders. Blockchain technologies can be used to consolidate information on the quality of the seed, track how crops grow and record the journey once it leaves the farm. In Canada, for example, Grain Discovery - an online blockchain marketplace - is an example of data being leveraged by those involved in the food system to grow and market globally competitive crops. The data could enhance transparency in supply chains by providing immutable records from production to consumption. Such data have the potential to facilitate information transfer throughout every step of the supply chain. And if blockchains are implemented with proper validation, it can prevent illegal and unethical production and distribution that undermines sustainability and community food security. For example, Wal-Mart, Tsinghua University and IBM’s chain-based food traceability platforms have aided in tracing pork and mango in China and U.S. respectively, with positive results in creating trust and transparency in the supply chains. This transparency also means consumers could make informed decisions to protect vulnerable producers and the environment. Access to product data may allow consumers to reward producers who employ good practices, such as rural smallholder farmers and fishermen who are among the most food-insecure groups.  Currently, there is little evidence supporting the claim that blockchain and big data technologies are contributing to global food security. Even though the average farm is projected to generate 4.1 million data points by 2050, up from 190,000 data points in 2014, increases in global food security have not been impressive. Part of the challenge is how blockchains have been implemented until now. The corporate control of blockchains and big data platforms could even undermine food security. For example, IBM and Walmart have teamed up to track produce from farm to fork. Producers and processors along the supply chain are required to input information into IBM’s blockchain for the process to be entirely transparent to consumers. However, there is skepticism around IBM’s definition of blockchain, as privately owned blockchains can be tampered with more easily and are less secure. This is because security of private blockchains are still highly dependent on permissions and controls set by private organizations. Corporate-owned, centralized databases of information do not meet the traditional definition of a blockchain, which is based on democracy and trust. Traditional blockchains are decentralized and democratized in order to ensure trust between users. Corporate control of supply chain information could also leave out small-scale farmers that lack the required size, scale and technological know-how to participate. This division between large and small food producers can contribute to global food insecurity, and many researchers believe that small, as well as large farms, are required to feed the world’s growing population. Before blockchain and other data technologies can help address food security, a number of challenges need to be addressed. The implementation of blockchains must be be decentralized to include small farmers and rural people. This will enable sustainable and equitable food systems and allow consumers to make informed decisions. However, as blockchains place additional responsibility on the end users, challenges such as limited digital literacy among the world’s poor and infrastructure constraints may undermine true decentralization. Also, they must be integrated into broader food security promotion strategies to make them sensitive to social and environmental values critical to tackling food insecurity among diverse groups. The untapped potential of harnessing big data through a transparent and decentralized food distribution system may support sustainable food production and provide accountability for food production. This is crucial for efficient food systems and food security in the future. But it is important that these innovations are deployed equitably so that all stakeholders along the value chain may benefit.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Abdul-Rahim Abdulai, Carling Bieg, Evan Fraser, Sarah Marquis, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-04-11T11:47:58Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eGlobal food supply chains proved brittle during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading for calls to boost the resilience of global food supply chains through improved efficiency in production, distribution and consumption of nutritious food.

For some collectors, the limit lies somewhere in the region of hundreds of millions of dollars. What about a work of art that has no tangible form, and exists only as a digital token that’s no more “real” than a JPEG file? Welcome to the strange world of crypto art collectibles, also known as NFTs. Like Bitcoin, NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are cryptocurrencies. But whereas individual bitcoins all have the same value, NFTs are more like baseball cards. Each token has a different value and they can’t be used to buy things. They exist on your computer as digital representations of artworks, songs, films and games, among other things. NFTs have been around since 2017, when the first mainstream experiment in crypto-collectibles emerged: CryptoKitties. The average price for one of these cat cards was about US$60 back then. But that’s chicken feed compared to current takings. Rights to a single digital image recently sold at auction for US$69.3 million (£50.2 million). CryptoPunk 7804 (a crudely drawn alien with a pipe) sold for US$7.5 million. A house on Mars was purchased for US$500,000. A digital house that is, not one that you might live in. Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey, recently sold his first ever tweet as an NFT for just under US$3 million. “But how can someone buy a tweet?”, you may ask. After all, anyone’s free to click on, look at, print out and frame the tweet as many times as they like. When you buy an NFT, you’re buying a unique certificate of ownership, which is locked away on an immutable distributed database known as a blockchain. The creator of the artwork generally retains the copyright and in most cases, you own little more than bragging rights. Creators are also likely to pass the costs for creating your NFT files (or “minting” them) on to you (around US$100 as I write this). Most of the time, what you’ll also be responsible for is an enormous carbon footprint. Because they depend on a blockchain, NFTs use a lot of energy. Most creators still use Ethereum, a blockchain secured using a similar proof-of-work system to Bitcoin. This involves an energy-intensive computer function called mining. Specialist mining computers take turns guessing the combination to a digital lock (a long string of random digits). The computer that correctly guesses the combination wins a reward paid in a cryptocurrency called Ether. The digital lock resets roughly every 15 seconds, and the competition continues. Ethereum uses about 31 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity a year, about as much as the whole of Nigeria. It’s very difficult to calculate exactly how much responsibility the NFT industry should take for Ethereum’s carbon emissions. Ethereum was going to run with or without NFTs. But with the growing demand for digital art, NFT buyers and sellers are becoming liable for an increasing share of Ethereum’s total energy use, and some artists are starting to think twice. The French digital artist, Joanie Lemercier, recently cancelled the sale of six works after calculating the associated energy costs. The sale would use, in just ten seconds, enough electricity to power the artist’s entire studio for two years.  ArtStation, a site for digital artists to showcase their portfolios, recently developed an NFT marketplace. But within hours of telling the world about the planned launch, widespread condemnation on social media forced ArtStation to scrap the project. Alternative technologies exist that enable NFT markets without the carbon headache. Sidechains use negligible amounts of energy to process NFTs because these transactions occur on a more centralised platform where costs (and carbon footprints) are much lower. Damien Hirst is due to release a collection of NFTs called The Currency Project using the Palm sidechain. Hirst will still be accepting payment in Bitcoin though, so his NFTs could still come with hefty carbon baggage. NFT enthusiasts argue that the increasing popularity of blockchain technology, with its voracious appetite for energy, provides incentives for upgrading energy grids from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Similar arguments have been made by the airline industry: in order to fund the efficiency innovations that could make aviation greener, people should fly more, not less. For NFTs, evidence shows this approach is unlikely to work. Due to the competitive nature of proof-of-work mining, booming NFT markets are encouraging the construction of reliable coal-fired power stations, so that crypto miners don’t have to suffer intermittent access to renewable generation. Some NFT creators are trying to have their crypto-cake and eat it by using carbon offsets. Buying offsets funds conservation work, with each carbon credit purchased equivalent to one tonne of carbon saved, which is either stored in a tree or theoretically prevented from escaping into the atmosphere through some sort of industrial innovation. The Offsetra company provides an emissions calculator and sells carbon credits to offset emissions caused by NFT transactions. The NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway recently auctioned eight carbon net-negative NFTs “inspired by Earth and the climate crisis”. The artworks received 60 carbon credits. Each offset was itself an NFT. NFT carbon credits (or any carbon credits for that matter) depend on clever accounting and a belief that carbon, like NFTs on a blockchain, can be immutably locked away in trees forever. It cannot. Nifty’s website explains that offsets make sense for neutralising our unavoidable emissions, “after we’ve done all attainable actions” to reduce our carbon footprint. But does acquiring bragging rights to a digital image that anyone with an internet connection can enjoy constitute an unavoidable part of one’s carbon footprint?","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Peter Howson, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-04-01T13:42:40Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eHow much would you be willing to pay for a one-of-a-kind work of art?

The issue is that perceptions of what the buyer is paying for are not easily framed in legal terms. NFT marketplaces do not always accurately describe the value proposition of the goods they are selling. The truth is that the value of any NFT is speculative. Its value is determined by what someone else is willing to pay for it and nothing else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTurning something as ephemeral as a tweet into an item that can be sold requires two things: making it unique and proving ownership. The process is the same for cryptocurrencies, which turn strings of bits into virtual coins that have real-world value. It boils down to cryptography.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eKeys and blocks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCryptography is the technique used to protect privacy of a message by transforming it into a form that can be understood only by the intended recipients. Everyone else will see it as only an unintelligible sequence of random characters. This message manipulation is enabled by a pair of keys, public and private keys: You share your public key with your friend, who uses it to transform his message to you into an unintelligible sequence of random characters. You then use your private key to put it back into its original form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe special mathematical properties of these two crypto keys are widely used to provide secrecy and integrity. \u003ca href\u003d\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/\"\u003eTwo crypto keys\u003c/a\u003e play the role of digital signatures and are commonly used in blockchain to enable both authentication and anonymity for transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlockchain is a crucial technology for creating NFTs. It uses cryptography to chain blocks into a growing list of records. Each block is locked by a cryptographic hash, or string of characters that uniquely identifies a set of data, to the previous block. The transaction records of a chain of blocks are stored in a data structure called a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://blockonomi.com/merkle-tree/\"\u003eMerkle tree\u003c/a\u003e. This allows for fast retrieval of past records. To be a party in blockchain-based transactions, each user needs to create a pair of keys: a public key and a private key.

This week, Elon Musk said he’s selling a tweet of his as an NFT, which contains a song about NFTs. The bidding on Musk’s tweet has already topped $1 million and millions more are pouring into the market — he has since tweeted, “Actually, doesn’t feel quite right selling this. Will pass.” And sites like NBA Top Shot (where you can buy, sell and trade digital NBA cards) have individual cards selling for over US$200,000.  It might sound ridiculous but the explosive market of crypto-collectibles and crypto-art is no joke. I investigate cryptocurrencies and have academic publications on Bitcoin markets. To help you understand what an NFT is and why they’re becoming so popular, here’s an explainer to make sense of it all. A non-fungible token (NFT) is a digital file with verified identity and ownership. This verification is done using blockchain technology. Blockchain technology, simply put, is an un-hackable system based on the mathematics of cryptography. So, that’s why you hear a lot of “crypto” when referring to NFTs — crypto-art, crypto-collectibles, etc. Fungibility is the ability of an asset to be interchanged with other individual assets of the same kind; it implies equal value between the assets. If you own a fungible asset you can readily interchange it for another of a similar kind. Fungible assets simplify the exchange and trade processes, and the best example would be (you guessed it) money. This is where I can explain and emphasize the “non-fungibility” property of NFTs. The main difference between NFTs and Bitcoins is the fact that Bitcoins are limited, and fungible (you can trade one Bitcoin with another and both have the same value and price). NFTs are unique but unlimited, and non-fungible (no two artworks are the same). While NFTs can appreciate in value (just like real estate), they cannot be interchanged for another NFT. While not directly related to NFTs, it’s important to mention some properties of money. Among many properties, money has to be fungible (one unit is viewed as interchangeable as another), and divisible (can be divided into smaller units of value). NFTs are not fungible nor (easily) divisible. For example, a single dollar is easily convertible into four quarters or ten dimes, but currently you cannot divide one NFT (although the blockchain technology behind may allow it in future). In fact, fungibility and divisibility are part of five requirements for a currency to exist in a regulated economy. The importance of NFTs lies in providing the ability to securely value, purchase and exchange digital art using a digital ledger. NFTs started in online gaming, later with Nike’s patenting of its authenticity (CryptoKicks) and then by the famous Christie’s auction embracing NFT valuation of a digital art piece. NFTs are commonly created by uploading files, such as digital artwork, to an auction market. Just like any other form of art, NFTs are not mutually interchangeable, making them more like “collectible” items. The platform (typically Ethereum) allows the digital art to be “tokenized” and for the ownership to be safely stored using a decentralized, open-source blockchain (that is, anyone can check the ledger), featuring smart contract functionality. This means the traditional role of a “middle man” for selling the art is now digitized. No, owning the NFT doesn’t grant you the copyright to the art; they are distinct from one another. The ownership of the NFT is established using a digital ledger, which anyone can access because it is stored openly. This ledger tracks who owns an NFT and ensures that the NFT can’t be duplicated or tampered with, essentially a “smart contract.” It is undeniable that digital assets and blockchain technology are changing the future of trade. As a result, NFTs are also at the helm of this positive growth. However, just like other examples in history (e.g. the Dutch Tulip, the dotcom bubble, etc.), certain valuations may see the need for future corrections depending on socio-economic desires and the chance of a bubble. Every generation has its own niche attachment to certain valuations whether for vanity or other reasons. NFTs are currently very popular among younger generations, but whether this generation will have the economic power to purchase or find use for them in the future, is both a social and economic question. For NFTs the true potential is yet to be uncovered. Whether big industry players in art, design or fashion will buy into it or not is also yet to be seen. One thing is for sure, NFTs did open the door for many digital artists to be identified and valued, and the smart contract functionalities of the blockchain technology will be used in future valuations of many assets.

With no barrier to entry, everyone is free to become a blockchain artist – and it shows. But this is a naïve reading of what is going on. Much blockchain art is sought after for reasons beyond aesthetics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, many NFTs, such as Cryptopunks, are sought after because of their age, like blockchain antiques. The most expensive Cryptopunk \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.one37pm.com/grind/money/most-expensive-nfts\"\u003esold for US$1,608,032\u003c/a\u003e(£1,161,481) and it is, on the surface, little more than crudely-drawn pixel art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCryptopunks are the oldest NFTs and it’s the data about them – their “metadata” – such as their longevity on the blockchain, that is desired. You have to look past the art and look at the medium to get what is going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther NFTs, such as the Nyan Cat meme which sold for US$600,000, are already widely distributed memes. But they’re prestigious specifically in their NFT form because the creator has “signed” the work on the blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBurning art\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut why would someone want to destroy the original art?

By removing the physical piece from existence and only having the NFT, we can ensure that the NFT, due to the smart contract ability of the blockchain, will ensure that no one can alter the piece and it is the true piece that exists in the world. By doing this, the value of the physical piece will then be moved onto the NFT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo most, this probably sounds like gibberish. I suspect the collective are acting a little provocatively by inverting our usual preference for the physical over the digital. However, their argument follows perfect blockchain logic. They argue if we have a piece of art and an NFT, then most people will consider the former the “real” art.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo invert this they’ve decided to burn what many would consider a piece of art that is objectively valuable, a Banksy, and leave only the NFT. Unlike physical art that can be burnt or shredded or broken, an NFT is a digital token that lives on an immutable blockchain. It can’t be destroyed and should therefore, according to their logic, be perfectly safe from vandals – such as themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the “real” art work gone the NFT now stands in for the real work. What they are hinting at, of course, is that this is a potential transition from “real” to NFT in general and their stunt highlights this. Intriguingly, their act also suggests they have themselves become artists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy burning the real piece they transform it into the NFT-only piece. To see the value in NFTs, we have to look past the art itself and at the blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, it’s interesting that the collective decided to pick a Banksy piece of art to destroy, considering the artist \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/banksy-i-was-in-the-room-when-his-painting-shredded-and-enhanced-his-brand-104660\"\u003eshredded a piece of his own art live\u003c/a\u003e in 2018, immediately after it was sold at auction.

Despite the steep price tag, anybody can watch or (with a simple right-click) save a copy of the videos, which show a cherub ascending over Mars, Earth, and imaginary landscapes.

Read more: A token sale: Christie\u0027s to auction its first blockchain-backed digital-only artwork NFTs are digital certificates that authenticate a claim of ownership to an asset, and allow it to be transferred or sold. The certificates are secured with blockchain technology similar to what underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A blockchain is a decentralised alternative to a central database. Blockchains usually store information in encrypted form across a peer-to-peer network, which makes them very difficult to hack or tamper with. This in turn makes them useful for keeping important records. Read more: Blockchain is useful for a lot more than just Bitcoin The key difference between NFTs and cryptocurrencies is that currencies allow fungible trade, which means anyone can create Bitcoins that can be exchanged for other Bitcoins. NFTs are by definition non-fungible, and are deployed as individual chains of ownership to track a specific asset. NFTs are designed to uniquely restrict and represent a unique claim on an asset. And here’s where things get weird. Often, NFTs are used to claim “ownership” of a digital asset that is otherwise completely copiable, pastable and shareable – such as a movie, JPEG or other digital file. Online, it’s hard to say what authenticity and ownership really mean. Internet culture and the internet itself have been driven by copying, pasting and remixing to engender new forms of authentic creative work. At a technical level, the internet is precisely a system for efficiently and openly taking a string of ones and zeroes from this computer and making them accessible on a that computer, somewhere else. Content available online is typically what economists call “non-rivalrous goods”, which means that one person watching or sharing or remixing a file doesn’t in any way impede other people from the doing the same. Constant sharing adds up to a near-infinite array of material to view, share, copy or remix into something new, creating the economies of abundance on which online culture thrives. TikTok is built around reimagining common audio loops with seemingly endless but unique accompanying visual rituals, which are themselves mimicked in seemingly endless variations. On Twitter, tweets are only valuable to the extent they are retweeted. Fake news only exists insofar as Facebook’s algorithm decides sharing them will increase engagement via driving more sharing. The life and longevity of digital content has depended on its ability to spread. The internet’s pioneering cyber-libertarians had a motto to describe this: information wants to be free. Attempts to stop information spreading online have historically required breaking aspects of technology (like encryption) or legal regimes like copyright. NFTs, however, bring code and culture together to create a form of control that doesn’t rely on the law or sabotaging existing systems. They create a unique kind of “authenticity” in a otherwise shareable world. Nearly 40 years ago, Canadian science-fiction writer William Gibson famously described cyberspace as a “consensual hallucination” in which billions of users agreed that the online world was real. NFTs take this to the next level: they’re a consensual hallucination that this string of ones and zeroes is different and more authentic than that (identical) string of ones and zeroes. NFTs work by reintroducing a mutual hallucination of scarcity into a world of abundance. There is no shortage of buyers: the NFT market is already worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Even humble sports trading cards will never be the same. The real function of NFTs is to create a clear delineation between ordinary creators and consumers of online content and those privileged enough to be paid to produce content or claim to own “authentic” work. The internet decentralised content creation, but NFTs are trying to recentralise the distribution of culture. NFTs facilitate the exchange of fungible money for non-fungible authenticity. It’s a well-known move that occurs in all sorts of industries, and one with a long history in, well, art history. Read more: After GameStop, the rise of Dogecoin shows us how memes can move markets How the culture-code of NFTs will evolve is anyone’s guess, but at the moment, it is opening a lot of new ways to make new money change hands. At first take, it might seem that this presents artists everywhere with a recourse to get paid for their otherwise copy-pastable work. Yet creating normative rules around paying for content online has not so far gone smoothly: think of the lacklustre payments musicians receive from streaming services like Spotify. NFTs have also been criticised for their profligate energy consumption, because they depend on a lot of computer power to encrypt their tokens. According to the online calculator at CryptoArt, the computations required to create NFTs for each of Grimes’ animations would have used enough electricity to boil a kettle 1.5 million times – and resulted in around 70 tonnes of CO₂ emissions. I’m not sure that cost for future generations was priced into the current market value, or any appreciation as tokens cryptographically change hands. Other than their tonnes of CO₂ emissions, what’s real about NFTs is how their creation of technical scarcity enables a new cultural agreement about how something can be authentic and who controls that authenticity. NFTs create new forms of hierarchy, power and exclusion on the wider web. They have already created a new type of haves and have-nots.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Luke Heemsbergen, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-03-04T23:01:26Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eA couple of days ago, the musician Grimes sold some \u003ca href\u003d\"https://niftygateway.com/profile/grimes\"\u003eanimations\u003c/a\u003e she made with her brother Mac on a website called Nifty Gateway.

He posted the 5,000th one in January, and has now packaged them into an enormous digital collage titled Everydays: The First 5000 Days, which will be auctioned online by Christie’s on February 25. The work will be sold in purely digital form, as a 21,069 × 21,069-pixel JPEG file and a “non-fungible token” or NFT. NFTs use blockchain technology to give the successful bidder unquestioned ownership of the work. Read more: Blockchain is useful for a lot more than just Bitcoin NFT artworks are becoming a serious business. Last year, Beeple made US$3.5 million on an NFT auction. But the entry of a global blue-chip auction house like Christie’s into this domain may mark a new stage for blockchain technology, as a widespread tool for both maintenance and transformation of digital art markets. Christie’s claims the sale of Everydays is the first time a major auction house has offered a purely digital artwork. Christie’s has sold digital works before, including videos (such as Ryan Trecartin’s A Family Finds Entertainment in 2013) and software-based installations (such as teamLab’s Ever Blossoming Life – Gold in 2018). But these were accompanied by physical trappings, such as certificates of authenticity or fancy hard drives to house the digital files. This time, however, it’s simply the image file and an accompanying NFT. NFTs support claims to an artwork’s value. While the JPEG file of Everydays may be copied, the collector’s blockchain-based record of ownership will allow them to display the work (and to resell it) on a number of online platforms. Christie’s has teamed up with one such platform, Makersplace, for the deal. Makersplace uses an open standard smart contract for its NFTs, which means the work can be sold in many other places in the the increasingly complex NFT ecosystem. NFTs are useful in the digital art market because they enable claims to authenticity and scarcity, despite the ease with which digital works can ordinarily be copied. Artists and galleries have tried to create scarcity via limited-edition works and to assure authenticity with certificates, but NFTs seek to automate this process. NFTs record ownership on a blockchain, which is a decentralised alternative to a central database. Built through cryptography and peer-to-peer networks, blockchains are resistant to tampering and hacking, which makes them useful for storing important records. Vince Tabora from US tech website Hacker Noon has written an accessible explainer of how blockchain is different from older ways of storing and organising data. Ever since blockchains were described in the white paper published by pseudonymous Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, the idea of a “trustless” way to keep secure public records has evolved into a so-called “confidence machine”, fuelling a considerable amount of hype. Simultaneously, voices have emerged to encourage more nuanced and critical engagement with blockchain’s possibilities and limitations.MoneyLab Reader 2: Overcoming the Hype and There is No Such Thing as Blockchain Art are two key publications exploring these tensions across varied cultural domains. Carnegie Mellon Researchers have described potential use-cases for the art industry, including securing artwork provenance (see Verisart) or enabling secure forms of fractional ownership (see Maecenas). And Christie’s is no stranger to new technology. The company has hosted regular Art+Tech Summits since 2018 (the inaugural topic being blockchain). In 2018, Christie’s proudly announced it was “the first auction house to offer a work of art created by an algorithm”, with the sale of the AI-generated painting Portrait of Edmond Belamy for more than 40 times its estimate. So by selling Everydays as “the first purely digital work” to be offered by a major auction house, Christie’s is reinforcing its self-described “position at the forefront of innovation in the art world”. At the same time, Christie’s upcoming auction is only the tip of the NFT-collecting iceberg. Industry publication Coindesk estimates the total value of the NFT market to be US$250 million. Platforms such as Opensea, Nifty Gateway and SuperRare host a rapidly expanding range of digital collectibles to buy and sell by a growing community of collectors. Beyond art, digital collectibles include virtual trading cards, artefacts and attire for virtual gaming worlds. They also underpin games such as CryptoKitties, in which NFTs serve to secure the “unique genome” of each kitty in the game. These examples reflect the uptake of NFTs across different digital subcultures, providing collectors with claims to uniqueness that were previously considered impossible in the online realm. Artists and other creative practitioners may also benefit from blockchain-backed systems. Researchers at RMIT published a paper on how blockchain infrastructures could help Australia’s creative economy in 2019. They note how blockchains could support artists in trading, creating contracts, getting their work discovered, sharing resources – and making money to support their livelihoods. Artists themselves are also searching for new ways to use blockchain and other “distributed ledger” technologies. Over the past decade, Furtherfield in London has worked with artists to explore the possibilities and limitations, partnering most recently with Goethe Institute and Serpentine Galleries for The DAOWO Sessions: Artworld Prototypes. Other notable projects include Artists Re: Thinking the Blockchain, which showcases how artists have a stake in this technological shift, and DisCo Coop, Trojan DAO and Black Swan DAO, which examine how new tools for organisation can challenge the value systems of the traditional art market, rather than further solidify them. This reexamination of art in light of blockchain has also been happening in Australia. In 2019, Baden Pailthorpe and I worked with the Bitfwd community to curate a project called Blocumenta, which brought together local artists, designers and hackers to examine how blockchain could affect the arts, culture and heritage in the Asia-Pacific. More recently, Nancy Mauro-Flude and I co-curated an event called Economythologies – MoneyLab#X, which was co-presented by several universities, galleries and arts organisations. We presented a program of talks, performances and artworks that considered how blockchain’s uprooting of legacy economic systems and narratives opens space to imagine different ways to value, design and organise our creative and cultural practices. At this stage it’s hard to say exactly what blockchain will mean for art. For now, perhaps we should let Beeple have the last word: bruh, i just learned wtf an NFT is like two weeks ago, not gonna act like i have a ton of intelligent shit to say here. this crypto space seems super interesting though and i see a ton of potential to do some weird shit nobody has done yet… Read more: Friday essay: The Australian art market has flatlined.

While this presents an opportunity to reduce costs for businesses and consumers alike, it may also make some professions, like accounting, obsolete. What can financial professionals do to reposition and rebrand themselves in the face of potential extinction? They’re not the first to be replaced by technology, after all. Over the past two decades, travel agents have been replaced by sites like Expedia and Priceline, while taxi drivers are being supplanted by Uber. What’s different here is that accounting and finance are considered elite professions. These vocations are highly paid and require high levels of education and training, raising questions about how other professions might fare in the face of technological disruption. How do professions at risk of extinction reassert their value in order to stand a chance at survival? The first thing professions need to do is reassess their value proposition. What does their profession do better than anyone else? How can this expertise be repackaged in order to appeal to new clients or customers, or develop new service lines? As an example, accountants have long been aware that technology has the potential to disrupt their profession. Some are suggesting that blockchain may replace auditing altogether. However, auditors have been able to successfully repackage their expertise to expand into new areas like awards ceremonies, business school rankings or even sustainability reports. To do this, the accounting profession had to figure out where its strengths lie and how these might be combined with other forms of expertise to create something new. One place auditors are doing so is in the area of sustainability assurance, which involves auditing a client’s social, economic and environmental performance. This could mean, for instance, assessing and verifying an industrial client’s reported greenhouse gas emissions. Some auditors are recognizing that while they don’t possess the scientific know-how to validate the science behind sustainability reports, they are able to engage experts from those areas so that, together, they can create a new business line. Read more: How blockchain can democratize green power While accountants have been unable to entirely eliminate the threat of technological extinction, some have been able to revive their position in the market by finding new buyers for their services. Blockchain technology poses a unique challenge because it was designed to upend the traditional financial order. The cryptocurrency Bitcoin is created, distributed, traded and stored with the use of blockchain, essentially a decentralized, peer-to-peer ledger system that is changing the way money is exchanged. More recently, a new blockchain use called decentralized finance (also referred to as “DeFi”) has introduced financial applications that aim to eliminate traditional financial intermediaries like banks. Although the probability of banks being replaced by blockchain-based applications is unlikely in the short term, the trend could take hold in the long run. As a result, several banks have developed platforms that allow their clients to trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether or Ripple. Global financial services company J.P. Morgan has developed a digital coin that provides instantaneous payments between institutional clients. The high-profile financial institution’s embrace of blockchain-based products represents an abrupt departure from comments made by the company’s CEO in 2017, when he called Bitcoin a fraud. This change in sentiment reflects a broader shift in regulators’ and bankers’ attitudes towards cryptocurrencies — and blockchain, more broadly. Recognizing that blockchain technology isn’t going away, bankers are instead looking for ways to leverage their status as trusted financial brokers to provide confidence to customers wishing to experiment with cryptocurrencies. Like the accountants expanding into sustainability assurance, bankers are leveraging their strongest advantage — their reputation as trusted intermediaries — to create a new product for the digital age. However, the shift to providing services in the blockchain sector requires a high degree of upskilling in the area of information technology. My research on auditing suggests that many accountants are refraining from taking on clients in the blockchain sector because they feel they lack the technological competence to do so. Professional groups like Chartered Professional Accountants (CPA) Canada (the national organization representing the Canadian accounting profession) have called on the next generation of CPAs to become data masters. This may not be realistic. Becoming data experts while maintaining an accountant’s foundational knowledge in tax, financial reporting and auditing may end up producing a generation of jacks-(and janes)-of-all trades who are masters of none. The reality is that technological disruption threatens all professions and the prospect of extinction is real. The best way to fight back is to focus on what a profession does best — and get even better at it. While it may be tempting to try to turn finance professionals into data scientists, this could do more harm than good by detracting from what profession’s key areas of expertise, making it even more likely that a profession will become an endangered species. Instead, financial professionals need to focus on finding new uses for their skills.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Erica Pimentel, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-01-25T17:51:53Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://hbr.org/2017/03/how-blockchain-is-changing-finance\"\u003eBlockchain technology threatens\u003c/a\u003e to upend the financial sector.

By 2025, more than 100 million learners are estimated to be capable of higher education but won’t have access to it either because they cannot afford the costs, or because courses aren’t available in their region. Courses aren’t available because communities or institutions lack the technological infrastructure, lack suitable content or students lack the internet connectivity. There also aren’t enough qualified instructors in broad disciplines who can teach online. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has declared that free digitalized teaching and learning materials known as open educational resources are essential for increasing access for global learners. These materials are key to supporting the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 4 of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all. The technology known as blockchain has also been recognized as an important resource to help achieve strategic development goals. Through the use of blockchain, it could be possible to ensure the availability of more affordable, equitable and quality educational content internationally. In the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions globally have quickly pivoted to online learning, and are examining their long-term strategies. The UNESCO Institute for Information Technologies in Education (IITE) and collaborators have been supporting educational institutions transitioning to online learning using open educational resources. Online learning, probably in different formats blended with classroom learning, is here to stay. This change ensures the continuing importance of blockchain and open educational resources. However, there are challenges in using blockchain in education. Policy-makers concerned with development in conjunction with educators should explore ways to address challenges in disseminating open educational resources with blockchain while advocating for the internet infrastructure necessary required to support it. Read more: Demystifying the blockchain: a basic user guide UNESCO defines open educational resources as teaching/learning materials that are in the public domain or openly licensed and allow users to reuse, adapt and redistribute at no cost. Open educational resources are not limited to textbooks, lessons or curriculum. They can also be educational games, podcasts, videos and applications. They substantially reduce the cost of content to students. They have also been used to empower teachers and learners through increased timely access to quality content, which improves learning. Blockchain can be described as a digital ledger or database that is distributed on a network. This technology isn’t controlled by any central authority and so open educational resources as the “blocks” in the “chain” can be securely and effectively shared in a public network. Blockchain can support the dissemination of open educational resources on a global scale. Blockchain has become more widely known due to its use in Bitcoin as a ledger for financial transactions that are secured with encryption, verified and recorded by network nodes (also called a digital cryptocurrency). Bitcoin is based on blockchain, but the technology has many other uses. What’s relevant to understand is that blockchain can be used to securely facilitate collaborations among two or more people. The original records cannot be deleted or changed. All changes can be easily traced as each new block in the chain is time-stamped. This matters because some authors of open educational resources express fear of not being attributed or being plagiarized. This fear is reduced with the use of blockchain, because the blocks in the chain cannot be altered. The original creator can always be determined, no matter how much a resource is changed. Adaptations require the creation of a new block that is automatically linked to the original. The block-encapsulated open educational resources are incorruptible. When every block in the iteration of a resource is time-stamped and recorded, plagiarism becomes obsolete. The tracing features of blockchain allow authors to see if or when their work is being misused and allows them to challenge any improper usage. Transactions cannot be hidden, and so every adaptation of the original source is traceable. New versions of the source can be uploaded. Trackability is maintained as each block or ledger is distributed on the network. This means that resources created with blockchain will have permanence online that preserves all content adaptations. All resources preserved as blockchain records are secured and permanent. This can become very important if an institution disappears, or if a creator moves on to work elsewhere or retires. Another positive dimension of using blockchain is that it helps overcome the fact that many quality open educational resources are hard to find on the web, and are wasted because of this. To date, there has been no efficient means of disseminating open educational resources that allows for maximum accessibility. Blockchain can effectively support accessibility to open educational resources, housed in publicly available, distributed global knowledge databases. Applying blockchain in education has its own challenges. These include the difficulty of changing established systems, legal questions on the ownership of the data, limitations in storage space and the need for privacy protection. Recent news on Bitcoin has focused on the total loss of access to the blockchain if a password cannot be retrieved. This human element of remembering passwords could prove a significant inhibitor of the use of blockchain in education. In addition, like other online databases, blockchain is vulnerable to unexpected failures. The persistence of blockchain can also become a hindrance: If unwanted, fake, unscientific or illegal content is accidentally or maliciously added to a blockchain, it cannot be removed. There is also a lack of people skilled in implementing blockchain. As well, the speed, and particularly the high energy cost of creating and maintaining blockchain are also concerns. Using blockchain technology to house open educational resources can be a tremendous asset in fulfilling the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 4 of improving access to quality, affordable education globally. But more research and political will is needed to overcome barriers in implementing this technology.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Rory McGreal, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2021-01-19T19:12:13Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eImproving quality of life for people globally means investing in education.

These will require some different thinking, particularly when it comes to agriculture. Wandile Sihlobo, the chief economist of the Agricultural Business Chamber of South Africa, explains to Michael Aliber, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Fort Hare, what that new thinking might look like. You have argued that governments should use the post-COVID environment to think differently about agriculture. What should be done differently? African governments should have a fresh look at agriculture. This involves embracing technology (information technology, mechanical and biotechnology) and also private sector partnerships. There also needs to be confidence in the citizenry to manage their land parcels. This will involve the granting of title deeds or tradable long-term leases in various African countries. And in the case of better seeds, the evidence from South Africa is there for many countries to observe and learn. The economic recovery from the pandemic therefore presents an opportunity for governments to explore available technologies that could help in the registration of land rights. These include global positioning systems, mapping and blockchain technologies. This will help solve disputes and also with the tradability of land rights. This process can be piloted on agricultural land. The proper recording and confirmation of land rights will encourage individual entrepreneurs to invest in their farmland and thereby trigger the commercialisation and growth of the agricultural sector. There are also examples of technologies that various countries could use to document land. Examples include the use of drones in India, and aerial photography in Rwanda. This would help change the troubling statistic that roughly 90% of rural land in Africa is not formally documented. How would you envisage overcoming the concern that ambitious rights formalisation and documentation strategies tend to extinguish secondary rights, often held by women? The overall intention is to ensure formalisation of land rights, with the objective of attracting investments in the agricultural sector and unlocking its potential. Africa has, indeed, a history of disadvantaging women on land matters. Any strategy for the formalisation of land rights will have to be well thought out and transparent. The aim should be to ensure that there isn’t bias towards men and politically connected individuals as has been observed in land reform cases in South Africa. Are you perhaps placing too much faith in technology? To date, South Africa is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa that has embraced biotechnology. This is primarily because it’s the only country in the region that has adopted the use of genetically engineered cotton, maize and soybean seeds. Other countries that have done so include the US, Brazil and Argentina. In these countries, the use of the genetically engineered seeds has seen lower insecticide use, more environmentally friendly tillage practices and improvements in crop yields. How productive is sub-Saharan African agriculture relative to other regions of the world? What can be done to improve yields? There is compelling evidence of the increase in yields within the sub-Saharan Africa region. Consider South Africa. It produces about 16% of sub-Saharan Africa maize, according to the International Grains Council. But it uses a relatively small area of land – an average of 2.5 million hectares since 2010. In contrast, countries such as Nigeria planted 6.5 million hectares in the same production season but only harvested 11 million tonnes of maize. Nigeria’s output equates to 15% of the sub-Saharan region’s maize production. South Africa began planting genetically engineered maize seeds in the 2001/02 season. Before its introduction, average maize yields were around 2.4 tonnes per hectare. That has now increased to an average of 5.9 tonnes per hectare as of the 2019/20 production season. Meanwhile, the sub-Saharan Africa region’s maize yields remain negligible, averaging below 2.0 tonnes per hectare. While yields are also influenced by improved germplasm (enabled by non-GM biotechnology) and improved low- and no-till production methods (facilitated through herbicide tolerant GM technology), other benefits include labour savings, reduced insecticide use, and improved weed and pest control. These labour-saving benefits, also for small-scale livelihood farmers, were also observed in a research study in the KwaZulu Natal province of South Africa. Other countries like Kenya and Nigeria are increasingly field-testing genetically engineered crops. They should accelerate the process, and when it meets their scientific standards, should embark on commercialisation as part of the recovery from the economic slump caused by the pandemic. Each country will have its domestic regulatory process which safeguards consumers and farmers. But these need not be too prohibitive to the extent that they disadvantage farmers. A case in point is Zimbabwe, where the importation of genetically engineered maize has recently been permitted but planting by domestic farmers is prohibited. But high yield – that is the amount produced per unit area – typically means high input costs, which is one reason why small-scale farmers’ uptake of these technologies is limited. Also, won’t the emergence of larger and more commercially oriented and technologically capable African farmers result in agriculture absorbing less and less labour? Africa’s smallholder farmers will generally struggle to access some technologies because of the associated costs. But if the goal is to ensure that the African continent can compete globally with the likes of the US, Brazil and Argentina, among others, then the focus should be on commercialisation of farmers and encourage the economies of scale on the continent. There have to be trade-offs. These include job losses in certain subsectors such as grains as farmers would be adopting more technologies. But there are potential gains in other subsectors such as horticulture. If supported and developed to scale, these could create large numbers of jobs. Again, a case in point is South Africa, where there were job losses in field crops but horticulture created many jobs. The key is to ensure job mobility so that people can progressively move to higher paying jobs in agro-processing and other subsectors. In sum, this is not to mean we should move away from smallholder farming per se. We need a mixed farming system. Where conditions allow, commercialisation at large scale should be encouraged. This is precisely the case in Brazil, where there is a mixed farming system.

These labour-saving benefits, also for small-scale livelihood farmers, were also observed in a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X16000498?via%3Dihub\"\u003eresearch study\u003c/a\u003e in the KwaZulu Natal province of South Africa.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther countries like Kenya and Nigeria are increasingly field-testing genetically engineered crops.

But these need not be too prohibitive to the extent that they disadvantage farmers. A case in point is Zimbabwe, where the importation of genetically engineered maize has \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2020-02-09-zimbabwes-decision-to-lift-a-ban-on-gm-maize-imports-could-benefit-south-africa-in-the-near-term/\"\u003erecently been permitted\u003c/a\u003e but planting by domestic farmers is prohibited.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut high yield – that is the amount produced per unit area – typically means high input costs, which is one reason why small-scale farmers’ uptake of these technologies is limited. Also, won’t the emergence of larger and more commercially oriented and technologically capable African farmers result in agriculture absorbing less and less labour?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfrica’s smallholder farmers will generally struggle to access some technologies because of the associated costs. But if the goal is to ensure that the African continent can compete globally with the likes of the US, Brazil and Argentina, among others, then the focus should be on commercialisation of farmers and encourage the economies of scale on the continent. There have to be trade-offs. These include job losses in certain subsectors such as grains as farmers would be adopting more technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there are potential gains in other subsectors such as horticulture. If supported and developed to scale, these could create large numbers of jobs. Again, a case in point is South Africa, where there were job losses in field crops but horticulture created many jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key is to ensure job mobility so that people can progressively move to higher paying jobs in agro-processing and other subsectors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn sum, this is not to mean we should move away from smallholder farming per se.

Three years after the bubble that inflated its value from US$5,000 to US$20,000 in less than three months burst in spectacular fashion, plunging more than 80%, the cryptocurrency is again on the verge of a record high. In recent days it has been trading above US$19,000, up from US$10,000 in October and US$5,900 in March. The price of Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, has also surged over the past few months, up from less than US$250 in July to about US$600. There are wild reports that by the end of 2021 Bitcoin could surge to US$100,000, or even US$318,000. Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile, so perhaps by the time you read this the value might have gone up. Or down again. So what is going on? Is this another speculative bubble, fuelled by the “greater fool theory”? Not necessarily. Unlike the 2017 bubble – when there was a lot of noise and excitement based on not very much actual mainstream adoption – there’s more substance to cryptocurrency price rises this time. Indicative of the change is the stance of JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the US. In October analysts at the bank’s global asset management arm tipped a “doubling or tripling” in Bitcoin’s price. Clearly something has changed, because back in September 2017 the bank’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, called the cryptocurrency a “fraud” and “worse than tulip bulbs”, and said he would fire any employee trading it for being “stupid”. Read more: Tulip mania: the classic story of a Dutch financial bubble is mostly wrong Three basic trends can be discerned behind this change of heart. First, there is the economic impact of COVID-19 and governments pumping massive amounts of money into economies. With investments such as property, savings and bonds less attractive, investors have been looking to assets with better prospects. Money has been flooding towards traditional “safe-haven” assets such as gold as well as stocks aligned with the digital economy. Among the most favoured stocks: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Etsy, PayPal and Zoom. Bitcoin offers aspects of both. Read more: In gold we trust: why bullion is still a safe haven in times of crisis The dramatic increase in online shopping and cashless payments due to COVID-19 has also accelerated interest in digital money. Central banks – including the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, Swiss National Bank and the Bank of England – are pushing ahead to develop their own digital currencies (known as “central bank digital currencies” or CBDCs). Leading the pack is the People’s Bank of China, which is piloting a digital renminbi. Cryptocurrencies are also becoming more usable through so-called “stablecoins” with values pegged to central bank currencies (the US dollar and the like) as well as improved wallets making it easier to swap tokens. There are indications these trends will converge. China’s Digital Currency Electronic Payments system will have some level of support for Ethereum applications. Paypal already allows US users to buy Bitcoin through their Paypal accounts, and will enable Paypal payments with Bitcoin next year. Second, the technology that supports cryptocurrencies is maturing. One of the biggest problems for cryptocurrencies becoming mainstream is the sheer amount of energy-intensive computing processes required to make transactions secure (which is important as you don’t want the same token spent twice). The carbon emissions from Bitcoin mining have been estimated as more than that of a country such as Sri Lanka. Ethereum has embarked on a major technical upgrade (called Eth2) transitioning the blockchain to a “proof-of-stake” mechanism that does away with energy-intensive computing processes. This should allay concerns of those holding back on environmental grounds and allow it to scale up. Whole new layers are also being developed that will allow blockchain technologies to be used in financial markets. The latest is decentralised finance (known as defi), using blockchain to build completely digital and automated financial markets. These include decentralised exchanges and derivatives trading without traditional intermediaries such as stock markets or banks. This is only possible using blockchain infrastructure – and cryptocurrency. Third – as illustrated by the changed stance at JPMorgan Chase – institutional investors are now embracing cryptocurrency. US cryptocurrency asset manager Grayscale Investments last month surpassed $US10 billion in cyrptocurrency assets for institutional investors. This week global financial services company Guggenheim Partners (managing more than US$275 billion in assets) announced it could invest up to $US530 million in Bitcoin through Grayscale. As Rick Rieder, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest investment funds manager (more than US$7.4 trillion in assets under management) declared, “cryptocurrency is here to stay”. So what does this mean for you as a potential retail investor? Does buying cryptocurrency offer you a chance to make a fortune, like the guy said to have turned a US$3,000 investment in Bitcoin into US$25 million? Not really. It’s still a gamble. The opportunity was earlier in the year when prices were much lower, and when the markets were filled with uncertainty and confusion. Now you just risk buying high and selling low. All cryptocurrencies remain volatile and speculative assets. Many people have been burned badly in the past by coming in at the top. Read more: More than 1,000 cryptocurrencies have already failed – here\u0027s what will affect successes in future Maybe this time is different, and the Bitcoin bubble won’t burst. But if so it will be because cryptocurrency is becoming staid economic infrastructure, not the latest get-rich meme. There are no guarantees. Bet only what you can afford to lose.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jason Potts, Ellie Rennie, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-12-03T19:04:22Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eBitcoin is back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree years after the bubble that inflated its value from US$5,000 to US$20,000 in less than three months burst in spectacular fashion, plunging more than 80%, the cryptocurrency is again on the verge of a record high.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn recent days it has been trading above US$19,000, up from US$10,000 in October and US$5,900 in March.

Particularly confusing to many is the furore over postal ballots, which the US president, Donald Trump is insisting will lead to large-scale voter fraud – despite a complete lack of evidence to back this. And yet this issue has become a central feature of the debate. Citizens of Estonia, a small nation in Baltic region, will perhaps be particularly perplexed: since 2005, Estonians have been able vote online, from anywhere in the world. Estonians log on with their digital ID card and vote as many times as they want during the pre-voting period, with each vote cancelling the last. This unique technological solution has safeguarded Estonian voters against fraud, use of force and other manipulations of remote voting that many American voters are apprehensive about in the 2020 US election. Voting online is just the start. Estonia offers the most comprehensive governmental online services in the world. In the US, it takes an average taxpayer with no business income eight hours to file a tax return. In Estonia, it takes just five minutes. In the UK, billions of pounds have been spent on IT, yet the NHS still struggles to make patient data accessible across different health boards. In Estonia, despite having multiple private health service providers, doctors can collate and visualise patient records whenever and wherever necessary, with consent from patients – a real boon in the country’s fight against coronavirus. Branding itself the first “digital republic” in the world, Estonia has digitised 99% of its public services. And, in an era when trust in public services are declining across the globe, Estonia persistently achieves one of the highest ratings of trust in government in the EU. The Estonian government claims that this digitisation of public services saves more than 1,400 years of working time and 2% of its GDP annually. The foundation of this digital republic dates back to 1997, a time when only 1.7% of world population had internet access, a start-up called Google had just registered its domain name and British prime minister John Major was celebrating the launch of 10 Downing Street’s official website. Meanwhile, the government of the newly formed state of Estonia envisaged the creation of a digital society, where all citizens would be technologically literate and governance would be paperless, decentralised, transparent, efficient and equitable. The young post-Soviet government decided to ditch all communist-era legacy technologies and inefficient public service structure. In a radical move, the government – which had an average age of 35 – also decided not to embrace western technologies. Neighbouring Finland offered an analogue telephone exchange as a gift and the Estonian government declined, envisaging communicating over the internet rather than analogue telephone. The government of Estonia launched a project called Tiigrihüpe (Tiger Leap) in 1997, investing heavily in development and the expansion of internet networks and computer literacy. Within a year of its inception almost all (97%) of Estonian schools had internet access and by 2000, Estonia was the first country to pass legislation declaring access to the internet a basic human right. Free wi-fi hotspots started being built in 2001, and now cover almost all populated areas of the country. The government also understood that, in order to create a knowledge based society, information needs to be shared efficiently while maintaining privacy. This was a radical understanding, even in the context of today, when for most countries, data sharing among different organisations’ databases is still limited. It is predicted that by 2022, 93% of the world’s total data collected or stored will be such “dark” or siloed data. Two decades ago, in 2001, Estonia created an anti-silo data management system called X-Road through which public and private organisations can share data securely while maintaining data privacy through cryptography. Initially developed by Estonia, the project is now a joint collaboration between Estonia and Finland. A large number of Estonian government and financial institutions using X-Road came under cyber-attack from Russian IP addresses in 2007. This attack made clear how vulnerable centralised data management systems are, and so Estonia required a distributed technology that is resistant to cyber-attack. Addressing this need, in 2012 Estonia became the first country to use blockchain technology for governance. Distributed ledger technology, commonly known as blockchain, is the underpinning technology of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The technology has moved on significantly since its inception in 2009 and is now used for a variety of applications, from supply chains to fighting injustice. Blockchain is an open-source distributed ledger or database system in which an updated copy of the records is available to all stakeholders at all times. Due to this distributed nature, it is almost impossible for a single person or company to hack everybody’s ledger, ensuring security against cyberattacks. Deploying blockchain technology not only ensures protection against any future attacks, but also poses many other benefits to Estonians. For example, in most countries citizens have to fill in many different forms with the same personal information (name, address) when they need to access public services from different government agencies. In Estonia, citizens only need to input their personal information once: the blockchain system enables the relevant data to be immediately accessible to the required department. This might scare people worried about data privacy. But citizens, not the government, own their personal data in Estonia. Citizens have a digital ID card and approve which part of their information can be reused by which public service. Estonians know that even government officials can’t access their personal data beyond what is approved by them for the required public service. Any unauthorised attempt to access personal data will be identified as invalid: indeed, it is a criminal offence in Estonia for officials to gain unauthorised access to personal data. This transfer of ownership and control of personal data to individuals is facilitated by blockchain technology. This should be an inspiration for the rest of the world. It is true that most countries do not have similar circumstances to post-Soviet Estonia when the Tiger Leap was introduced. But the same futuristic mindset is required to address the challenge of declining trust. Minor amendments were made to this article on October 12 to make some of the context behind X-Road clearer.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Imtiaz Khan, Ali Shahaab, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-10-07T14:39:42Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003ePeople around the globe have been watching the build up to the US election with disbelief.

For example, in most countries citizens have to fill in many different forms with the same personal information (name, address) when they need to access public services from different government agencies.

But citizens, not the government, own their personal data in Estonia. Citizens have a digital ID card and approve which part of their information can be reused by which public service. Estonians know that even government officials can’t access their personal data beyond what is approved by them for the required public service. Any unauthorised attempt to access personal data will be identified as invalid: indeed, it is a criminal offence in Estonia for officials to gain unauthorised access to personal data. This transfer of ownership and control of personal data to individuals is facilitated by blockchain technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis should be an inspiration for the rest of the world.

But chances are you’re thinking about it now. The COVID-19 crisis has put food supply chains under incredible stress, and stories on shortages of everything from meat to baking ingredients have been plentiful. But even with the increased recent attention, most supply chains remain murky. Consumers can play a key role in lifting that cloud. Supply chain transparency has sporadically received widespread attention before. In the 1990s, Nike was famously the target of global consumer boycotts due to concerns about working conditions in its manufacturing plants. This consumer activism forced the company to make major changes, such as establishing minimum working ages, conducting regular factory audits and publishing where Nike products are made. Despite progress, calls for consumer action on dangerous working conditions in supply chains for a range of products continue. The COVID-19 crisis highlights the prospect of greater consumer engagement in the food supply chain. Browsing the shelves at your grocery store, you may come across a bewildering array of claims related to a product’s characteristics or origins. There are, for example, nearly 150 different eco-labels on food that certify claims about a product’s environmental and social characteristics. Seafood, beef, coffee and bananas are just some of the many products covered by eco-labels. Many claims of where products come from or other characteristics, however, rest on weak foundations. But consumers can push companies for continued innovation to illuminate the invisible parts of the supply chain and strengthen the credibility, transparency and veracity of their claims. Read more: Supply chain innovation can reduce coronavirus food shortages In many cases, this can be done with existing technology. Blockchain, chemical footprinting and drones are becoming more reliable as they become cheaper. They are also increasingly being used in supply chain auditing and eco-labelling, and there’s scope to do much more. Consider the example of the Marine Stewardship Council that provides fishery and seafood traceability certification programs. The council’s eco-label is “only applied to wild fish or seafood from fisheries that have been certified to (the MSC’s) standard.” It uses state-of-the-art DNA testing to ensure the traceability of certified seafood, resulting in mislabelling rates of under one per cent, an impressive statistic since mislabelling of seafood can average 30 per cent. DNA testing is not applicable to all foods, but it is rarely used despite its potential in improving supply chain integrity. Most supply chain certifications draw only sparingly on the latest technologies. Instead, they rely heavily on in-person audits, which can be ineffective. Our recent research has shown that technology-enhanced auditing can improve the timeliness and veracity of audit data collection and analysis, which can in turn strengthen the credibility of supply chain certifications advertised to consumers. In another study, we’ve further found that the COVID-19 crisis can help accelerate the use of technology in supply chain audits. Technology can also increase the resilience of supply chains, so they are better able to respond to shocks like a global pandemic. For example, technologies such as sensors, satellite imaging and cloud computing can improve visibility deep into the supply chain and improve co-ordination between suppliers and buyers. Real-time supplier monitoring can provide early warnings of potential problems such as working conditions, inventory shortages or production breakdowns. These technologies cannot, of course, eliminate the possibility of future shortages, but they can make supply chains less likely to break. Consumers can play a more active role in driving improvements throughout supply chains. Purchasing decisions are one key lever. For example, consumers have indicated a willingness to pay a premium for products made under good working conditions, but the lack of trustworthy information on those conditions is a barrier. Consumers can also actively push for the sharing of more and better quality information to reduce mislabelling and other undesirable activities, such as the trade of endangered species. Going further, consumers can get more directly involved in supply chain monitoring. For example, in addition to satellite imaging, Global Forest Watch has used crowd-sourcing to monitor forest change. Unilever, which makes dozens of products you’ll find at your local grocery store, has used Global Forest Watch to better understand deforestation in its supply chain. And in the near future, consumers might even be able to validate the content of food labels by using simple portable technologies. No matter how they engage, consumers need to take a more active role in promoting and demanding greater supply chain transparency. Read more: DNA barcodes — sci-fi tech to safeguard environment The pandemic has more people thinking about supply chains than ever before. This increased awareness presents a chance for consumers to become more engaged in where and how products they buy are produced. Consumers need to push for more transparency and higher veracity information on where products come from, but they also need to take greater responsibility for what they buy and to participate wherever they can in supply chain monitoring.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Cory Searcy, Pavel Castka, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-07-27T20:32:35Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eSix months ago, you may not have thought much about where your groceries were produced.

This is not surprising, considering that 99 per cent of Canadian households have access to broadband internet and 94 per cent of online Canadian adults have an account on at least one social media platform, making Canada one of the most connected countries in the world. However, as we increasingly rely on these platforms to connect us and mediate our relationships, we are also creating more data about our interests and habits. This treasure trove of data about us and the people in our network is being used by a wide variety of stakeholders, including social media platforms and many third parties. In this context, it is not surprising that social media users are becoming increasingly uncomfortable with how much data is being collected about them and how it is being used. For example, in our survey of 1,500 Canadians, 65 to 66 per cent of respondents said they are uncomfortable with marketers, government, financial institutions and political parties accessing information about them or posted by them on social media. This lack of comfort is one of the signals telling us that Canadians’ online data are not adequately protected under the current Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). PIPEDA is 20 years old, and bringing it in line with the principles set forth in Canada’s new Digital Charter is one of the stated priorities for this government. However, the process has been delayed first by the federal election and now by the pandemic. The pandemic itself has also escalated the development and deployment of emerging data-greedy digital tools and techniques such as contact tracing and facial recognition, making a revamp of PIPEDA more critical than ever. Read more: Police should not have access to data from coronavirus contact tracing apps A new privacy and data protection regulation should also account for emerging technologies and their applications that will drive our digital economy in a near future. When the European Union enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, it found itself in conflict with a whole class of emerging technologies that are based on blockchains. Blockchain is the same technology used to create Bitcoin, but it is not limited to just cryptocurrencies. It also powers social media sites like Steemit, Minds and Memo, which give users more control over their personal data. The decentralized nature of these blockchain-based sites makes it challenging to comply with GDPR, which assumes that there is a single data controller (either a person or legal entity) that collects personal data from individuals and is responsible for protecting such data. In peer-to-peer blockchain networks, the ledger that stores all data is distributed across multiple nodes and is not controlled by a single entity. In effect, this constitutes “joint controllership,” which is challenging to apply and interpret within the GDPR framework. The decentralized design also conflicts with GDPR’s principle of data minimization, requiring data controllers to minimize the amount and types of data collected and stored about individuals. Another design feature of blockchains to protect data from modification or deletion contradicts the “right to be forgotten” provision of GDPR, which assigns people the right to request deletion of their personal data “without undue delay.” Current regulations will need new guidelines that address decentralized, user-driven data collectives like blockchain-based social media sites. But even though these efforts are still underway in the EU, here in Canada there are a couple of lessons we can learn from this example. First, it is crucial to make sure that updating PIPEDA does not only focus on today’s technologies but also what is on the horizon. This is because emerging technologies such as blockchains are changing the power dynamics between data controllers and subjects by creating new ways for user data to be created, collected, accessed and shared. The second lesson is that ensuring flexibility and accountability to allay Canadians’ concerns about the ways that personal data is used will require creativity in working with all stakeholders, including users, governments, platform providers, data brokers, data-driven industries, app developers, researchers, civil society groups and others. Doing so will allow Canada to foster the next wave of digital innovation while still protecting and empowering Canadians’ data rights.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Anatoliy Gruzd, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-07-26T11:27:25Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eWith so many of us stuck at home due to the pandemic, people have been spending a lot \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Blog/The-Next-Evolution-of-Media-Consumption\"\u003emore time\u003c/a\u003e online in general and on social media in particular.

Four years after the signing of the Paris Agreement, most experts predict global warming will exceed the agreed thresholds, with disastrous consequences. As much as the world faces a climate crisis, it also faces a climate governance crisis: we know what must be done to halt climate change but we do not know yet how to get there. New mechanisms are evidently needed. Blockchain is one technology that has the potential to boost global cooperation for climate action, as I explore in new research. Blockchain is a data structure that stores information as a series of cryptographically linked blocks, which are distributed simultaneously to all participants in a network. The information stored on a blockchain is tamper-resistant. This is useful for generating a single source of truth for any kind of information. Blockchain technology provides the building blocks for what are known as decentralised autonomous organisations, which have been discussed (and criticised) as potential alternative governance mechanisms at the national level. But the benefits of such a decentralised organisation at the international level would be much higher. Imagine a decentralised climate organisation, based on blockchain, in which states, companies, and individuals participate and whose interactions are facilitated by so-called smart contracts. These contracts are pieces of computer code running on top of the blockchain, which makes them virtually unstoppable. A common token — let us call it greencoin — allows climate commitments by states to be linked with the flourishing ecosystem of transnational climate initiatives and individual climate action. Such an organisation would help get the world together to act against climate change in three ways. Coordinated action against climate change requires better information. One important task is to ensure that different stakeholders do not claim carbon credits for the same carbon-offsetting activity, such as two companies paying for the same forest to be planted. To avoid such double-counting, a publicly shared digital ledger of carbon credits, as currently piloted by the Pacific Alliance nations, would offer a more cost-effective solution than a central agency settling transactions of carbon credits. Read more: Double counting of emissions cuts may undermine Paris climate deal Another (more challenging) task would be to verify that carbon-offsetting activities have actually occurred. Blockchain technology, combined with information feeds such as internet-of-things devices, could tap new information sources. Meanwhile, smart contracts offer an efficient way to reward critical tasks like verifying emission reductions and adaptation measures at the local level. Climate change is an area ripe with broken promises. Consider the decision by US President Donald Trump to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. In other countries, worries have grown that the COVID-19 pandemic will thwart government efforts to honour their climate-related commitments. Through smart contracts, blockchain technology could mitigate the risk of backsliding, provided that states underpinned their commitments with a monetary deposit. If states fail to comply with their emission reduction targets, their deposit could be taken and redistributed as greencoins to those that have abated carbon emissions, for example by planting trees, or other climate action. More effective enforcement of commitments through smart contracts is only possible where resources have been staked upon commitments. An added benefit of eliminating uncertainty around enforcement is to entice more ambitious climate commitments from those who are concerned about being cheated upon by more powerful bodies. Business as usual will not be enough to confront the impending climate crisis. A decentralised climate organisation would allow progressive transnational bodies to “buy” pro-climate transformation in laggard countries. For example, transnational corporations including Apple, Google and Walmart, ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, and other firms criticised the US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Under a decentralised climate organisation, they could have devised smart contracts offering compensation to affected workers in exchange for more robust commitment by the US government to decarbonise the economy.  A related benefit of this approach would be to make their demands transparent, which would help less powerful bodies hold corporations to account on their climate-related pledges. For example, Microsoft recently announced it would invest US$1 billion to become a carbon-negative enterprise. This is all very well, but it could be rhetoric. If Microsoft underpinned this pledge by a smart contract with an appropriate stake, it would become inevitable, with huge benefits for everyone whose fortunes depend on powerful players like Microsoft following through on their promises. A decentralised climate organisation would combine the resources of billions and unite their efforts in combating climate change. Anyone in a blockchain network connected to the system could earn greencoins by planting trees (like “mining” in the Bitcoin system). This would be profitable because greencoins have real value — they would be linked to the international commitments by states that have staked monetary resources on them. People could also purchase greencoins to support climate action. By increasing the exchange value of greencoins, these people would provide incentives for more rapid tree-planting. Blockchain technology is ideally suited to settle these transactions automatically, provided appropriate systems for verification and the incentive system underlying effective decentralised verification are in place. Blockchain-based climate governance has undeniable theoretical benefits, but there would be significant obstacles to its realisation. While the blockchain ensures that once-recorded data is tamper-resistant, it can do little to ensure that the data that is brought onto the blockchain can be trusted. Start-ups like Chainlink have proposed decentralised networks of information feeds as a promising solution to this problem, but for some applications, suitable solutions are hard to find. A blockchain-based climate organisation might not come to fruition if key players decided not to join. Powerful states or companies might be especially unwilling to participate in a system that makes broken promises immediately transparent and that automates the punishment process. But as long as there was enough momentum, they might slowly be incentivised to get involved. A virtual entity for climate governance would also require people to accept to be governed by algorithms. And at the moment, this might be the hardest challenge of all.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Bernhard Reinsberg, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-06-11T12:13:08Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe world has failed to halt global warming.

Recent scandals have ranged from modern slavery in Vietnamese fisheries to the persistent problem of child labour in the cocoa industry. Perhaps the most well known fraud was the UK’s horsemeat scandal of 2013, where up to 60% of products labelled as beef were actually horse. UK supermarkets have also been found selling contaminated chicken on numerous occasions, while a longstanding issue of romaine lettuce in the US causing E coli only recently ended. Such scandals have made the public much more interested in the food supply chain, not to mention the impact of food production on the environment. Food manufacturers can give consumers detailed information on where our foods have come from using blockchains – the tamper-proof online technology for logging information that is the basis of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Some manufactures are doing this, but many have been slow to adopt this technology for various reasons. There are suggestions that coronavirus could be the gamechanger – but will it be? Certain jurisdictions such as the EU now require that food products be traceable to source. In the absence of blockchains, the most common way of doing this has been to use digital tagging systems such as RFID (radio frequency identification) or QR (quick response) codes. They enable vendor firms to know where products have been and when, but they don’t let them see what actually happens at each node in a supply chain. As a result, consumers receive little information about their food beyond nutritional content and the country of production. This points to a competitive advantage for manufacturers offering richer and more reliable information to vendors and consumers, which is why some have been combining digital tagging with blockchains. Firms like Wal-Mart have been conducting high-profile trials that have reduced to a matter of seconds the time it takes to trace a product’s origin. Yet they have been reticent to share most of the results. This has made it harder for the industry to learn, which has not helped this technology to move forward. To this end, we’ve just published some new research that looks at some blockchain trials by some other players in this space. One case study comes on the back of various Chinese infant formula scandals beginning in 2008 that killed at least 18 babies, affected 300,000 and destroyed confidence in a product that many parents relied upon. The culprit was a chemical called melanine, but it was difficult to ascertain where in the supply chain it was being added to the formula. To reassure parents, Nestlé hired Shanghai-based blockchain developer Techrock to incorporate the technology into its NAN A2 baby formula. They first created product packaging with an inbuilt RFID chip and antenna. Then the firms throughout Nestlé’s supply chain recorded data on a public blockchain, including details of ingredients, where they came from, and where the product was produced. Once the formula was on supermarket shelves, consumers could scan the chip using mobile phones to get all the information – even including a picture of what the package should look like. The products are also designed so that the antenna breaks when they are opened, to reassure customers that products haven’t been tampered with. We looked at two similar systems in farming and fisheries that also allow consumers to scan products using phone apps. In farming, Australian consumers get access to information on various grain products overseen by commodity management platform Agridigital. Farmers and other operators record where grain was grown, when and where it was milled, and where and how it was transported to supermarket shelves. RFID tags are then used to monitor the movement of products. The blockchain makes sure the data meets best practice – if not, it can’t be labelled as organic, for example. A partnership between World Wildlife Fund and Fijian blockchain provider TraSeable focuses on sustainable fisheries. This time, data is recorded on where fish are caught, the route that boats take, catch logs and crew details. Once fish are unloaded, they are tracked to stores with QR tags. These trials show how blockchains can make supply chains more visible for consumers, though a number of issues need to be solved if they are to be universally adopted. Supply chains need to be as digitised as possible. Many systems still rely on people to record and enter data. This makes the system fallible and less trustworthy, and calls into question all the data stored on that blockchain. There are no agreed standards or governance. The industry is going to have to move towards one system, particularly so that consumers can check many products using one smartphone app. Some food companies may still be reluctant to use blockchains because they don’t trust them, and also because adopting these systems will inevitably come at a price. For cheaper products like fresh produce, companies may fear that consumers won’t pay a necessary price premium. Blockchains are potentially useful in the coronavirus crisis. For example, they are already used to collect and securely share data on factory conditions in the meat industry. With numerous processing plants closed because of outbreaks in places like Germany and the US, these systems can potentially make it easier to share data on working conditions to ensure that suppliers are minimising risks. This could give consumers peace of mind that workers in plants have been tested. There have been some media reports that such uses are spurring on the adoption of these systems. It’s an interesting development, though it’s too early to say whether it will be a gamechanger. There is little evidence, for example, that meat can carry the virus, so the technology’s benefits in this regard may be limited. For now, we need to watch developments closely, while continuing to address the other challenges around getting the industry fully onside.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Michael Rogerson, Glenn Parry, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-05-18T17:23:43Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eFood supply chains were vulnerable long before the coronavirus pandemic.

In farming, Australian consumers get access to information on various grain products overseen by commodity management platform Agridigital. Farmers and other operators record where grain was grown, when and where it was milled, and where and how it was transported to supermarket shelves. RFID tags are then used to monitor the movement of products. The blockchain makes sure the data meets best practice – if not, it can’t be labelled as organic, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA partnership between World Wildlife Fund and Fijian blockchain provider TraSeable focuses on sustainable fisheries.

Supply chains need to be as digitised as possible. Many systems still rely on people to record and enter data. This makes the system fallible and less trustworthy, and calls into question all the data stored on that blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are no agreed standards or governance.

Movies such as Outbreak, Contagion and Virus are looking more like documentaries every day. As we battle COVID-19, a major issue that will only increase is disruption to supply chains. This disruption has been as devastating as it has been swift. There is unprecedented demand for some products (hand sanitiser has never been so popular), just as production of other products grinds to a halt due to lack of parts. Our research concerns managing supply chains in a crisis and using technologies such as Artificial Intelligence , 3D Printing and blockchain. These technologies, which also seemed like science fiction just a short time ago, can help the world recover from one crisis and be better prepared for the next one. There are a number of challenges these technologies can address. One of these is predicting how people respond to unprecedented events. Unexpected surges in demand for hand sanitisers, for example, have led to perfume factories in France switching to the production of hand gels for hospitals to increase supply. Decision makers struggle to predict where and when the demand will come, as well as how much of it there will be. It is here where AI can help by identifying patterns and predicting what will happen next. It helps decision makers cope with information overload by capturing and aggregating data from a variety of sources. These techniques are helping to identify high-risk patients in Chicago, even when testing is limited. Another challenge is maintaining supply, especially when supply chains are reliant on one source that is affected by unexpected disruption. Italy’s battle with the pandemic naturally means supplies of pasta are disrupted elsewhere. This is where 3D printing comes in. 3D printing involves making things layer by layer, directly from digital files. It allows things to be made where and when they are required, without the the expensive tools or moulds that mass production requires. While it might cost more to make a single product, 3D printing can make manufacturing faster and more responsive to changing demand – even for pasta.  So if car factories, for example, take advantage of 3D printing then it suddenly becomes a lot more feasible for them quickly switch to making ventilators for hospitals, as is being suggested by the UK government. However, this assumes they can access reliable designs and parts lists for these specialised and highly technical products. To this end, efforts are underway to create open-source ventilators. Safety testing and certification will be vital or these well-intentioned efforts may do more harm than good. Fake products and medical equipment have already been an issue during this crisis. So being able to track where things are and where they came from to ensure they are genuine is vital. Blockchain can help because it provides an open, distributed record of transactions. Everyone who needs to be able to see the record is able to – but no one is able to either modify or delete it. It ensures that transactions are transparent and traceable, turning a supply chain into a digital “chain” of permanently visible “blocks”. This helps to maintain trust between all relevant parties. For example, in China it is being used to trace and confirm the source of public announcements, helping to eliminate fake information. Additionally, blockchain enables smart contracts, which automatically transfer funds when specified conditions are met. Brooklyn Microgrid uses smart contracts to allow homes with solar panels to sell energy to their neighbours (every unit is automatically counted and paid for). Blockchain also helps to minimise price inflation, ensures the right equipment gets to the right people and helps distribute the costs fairly and transparently. This may be vital when privately owned factories make goods for public services and should be reimbursed from taxpayers’ money. Individually, each of these technologies can have an important role in managing supply chain disruption. The greatest value, however, comes when they are combined. This requires investment in skills as well as infrastructure. Private investment from a range of companies is driving development, but coordinated government strategies, from Industrie 4.0 in Germany to Made in China 2025 can help by guiding investments, supporting technology adoption and overcoming a skills shortage. Managing a crisis involves three sets of decisions around preparing, responding and recovering. As the coronavirus pandemic evolves, the focus is now firmly on response. But the recovery may be even more challenging. The unprecedented scale of the impact looks certain to change lives, whether it is how we interact or even having jobs to go back to after self-isolation. Panic buying of protective masks and hygiene products is symptomatic of a lack of trust in institutions and their ability to keep us safe. Yet just as science fiction movies see humans pulling together to save the world, the response to this pandemic has seen institutions collaborating to share resources – from hotel rooms to production lines. Investing in AI, 3D printing and blockchain can help businesses be more responsive to changes in supply and demand and make their supply chains more resilient. By using these technologies in collaboration, we should also be better prepared to predict, respond to and recover from the next crisis that threatens the world.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ahmad Beltagui, Oscar Rodriguez-Espindola, Soumyadeb Chowdhury, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-03-18T14:35:04Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eWhat seemed like science fiction a few short weeks ago is now very real.

This national digital currency would be centralized, meaning that the bank would be able to monitor and regulate the transactions within that network. Cryptocurrency is a decentralized digital currency that relies on the application of cryptography to conduct financial transactions and protect against counterfeit and fraud. Cryptocurrency is an alternative to sovereign currencies that are issued by state governments, like the Canadian dollar. My doctoral research explores how states try to regulate cryptocurrency — a disruptive technology that threatens sovereignty that’s resistant to being controlled by any state unilaterally. The use of cryptocurrencies has broad implications for the global economy as well as the role of the state. As a decentralized, peer-to-peer payment network that allows individuals to share information with one another without the need for a middleman, cryptocurrency circumvents the control central banks have over money supply. Powered by blockchain technology, no single third party is in control of the transactions and data stored on the distributed ledger. As such, the use of cryptocurrency as a means of payment has the potential to undermine the ability of the state to track currency movement. As a result, governments have moved to curtail cryptocurrencies, in some cases referring to them as a direct threat to national security and the stability of the global financial system. This move to classify cryptocurrency as a threat contradicts statements made by Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of Canada and current governor of the Bank of England. Carney challenged the role of the world’s reserve currency, stating that it could be replaced with a digital alternative. In a report commissioned by the Bank of Canada, findings suggest that Canadians now have an increased awareness of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, and an estimated five per cent of Canadians actually own these digital assets. Government-owned digital currencies would likely run on a private blockchain, reducing transparency due to their centralized governance model. Private blockchains attempt to take the advantages of blockchain technology without giving up all of the control. This centralized approach increases the risk of a single point of failure as all of the data is stored in a single system. Read more: Five hurdles blockchain faces to revolutionise banking Storing immense amounts of data in a centralized location has not always been successful, often leading to data breaches and leaks. Furthermore, there would be easier access to data since hackers would only have to compromise a smaller number of nodes, compared to the amount of nodes in a public decentralized network. Traditional cryptocurrencies are decentralized and the transactions are validated and governed through consensus. This means that a majority of the nodes in the network would have to agree that a transaction occurred in order for it to be validated. The Bank of Canada’s exploration has suggested that establishing a digital currency would provide them with the ability to collect more information on Canadian consumers than ever before. These personal details and data could then be shared with third parties, such as law enforcement, which currently require a warrant to investigate the spending habits of an individual. The notion of collecting more information on Canadians through a proposed digital currency raises serious privacy concerns. While cash continues to be the only way to keep your transactions anonymous, the use of cryptocurrency leaves a detailed trail. By inserting themselves into the mix, the Bank of Canada aims to assert a new level of state surveillance in the digital economy. Although some cryptocurrencies provide users with aliases, there is no guarantee that the Bank of Canada’s digital currency would provide citizens with that same level of anonymity. A national digital currency that collects information on consumers has serious privacy implications, and one of the possible outcomes would be to replace physical money entirely. Institutional monitoring through digital currency spending habits raises concerns around the surveillance of minors, undocumented citizens and our right to privacy. As countries prepare to experiment and launch their own national digital currencies, they will also be faced with the issues associated with centralized governance. Every bit of data that the central bank can control, view and share about Canadians and their spending habits are a potential learning advantage for the privileged bankers, but not for the rest of society. Every restriction that the Bank of Canada faces, such as the increased use of decentralized cryptocurrency among the population, is a weakness — hence its experimentation with private distributed ledger technology. The introduction of any centralized cryptocurrency through the Bank of Canada must be subject to scrutiny since it would likely lead to an unprecedented level of state surveillance on Canadians. As we continue to experience more government and institutional monitoring, we must ask ourselves whether central banks are the right institutions to develop new digital currencies. What the Bank of Canada fails to understand is that historically, technology tends towards openness. The Bank of Canada’s approach to digital currency is no exception.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Anwar Sheluchin, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-02-05T23:04:23Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe widespread use of cryptocurrency as an alternative method of payment has led to a growing digital ecosystem over the years.

The data included name, address, email, login, passwords, date of birth, health card number and lab test results. This event would be distressing enough, but it came on the heel of reports that, over a nine-month period in 2019, 19 million Canadians had already had their data breached. Unfortunately, it appears that there is not much individual consumers can do to protect themselves. The only way that consumers can protect themselves is to use strong passwords and authentication, regularly check credit card statements, credit applications and histories, insurance claims and the like. This passes a large portion of the burden onto individual consumers. Read more: LifeLabs data breach: Hackers could still hold health records of 15M Canadians The cost of such data breaches is high for society as a whole, too. The result is an erosion of trust and a reluctance to use services that gather sensitive health information, even if consumers could greatly benefit from receiving a service that diagnoses health risks and supports the maintenance or improvement their overall health. This reluctance may stem from uncertainty about how health data services will store and use their data over time. Recent revelations about how platforms like Facebook and 23andMe use individuals’ sensitive personal data validates concerns that data may be shared with third parties without informed consent, adding to consumer concerns about data theft. Read more: Open sharing of genetic data carries great promise, but not without risks This growing reluctance to share health data is worrisome, as it will hold back research advancements in personalized and precision healthcare which rely upon access to large bodies of data for analysis. Faced with the threat of ongoing data breaches and unauthorized secondary use of their data, some Canadians seem willing to try novel solutions, such as blockchain technology, to address the issue. Read more: Demystifying the blockchain: a basic user guide In recent focus groups run by my research team working within the University of British Columbia’s blockchain research cluster, Blockchain@UBC, consumers expressed their willingness to give blockchain a try. As one focus group participant put it: “ … someone has to start, right? There would be falls and all that and there would be corrections, I’m willing to be on the beta.” Blockchain has moved on significantly from its early association with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and is now envisioned for use in a wide variety of applications, including health care. In the case of sharing personal health data with consent, blockchains allow each individual consumer to manage their own data and how it is shared. Consumers manage their health data as encoded credentials in their personal health wallets, similar to the Apple Pay wallet. They can then share only as much data as needed, using cryptographically encoded and distributed peer-to-peer networks, to fulfill the purpose of the data collection. Using their wallets, consumers can provide their personal health data to labs, research partners, health-care practitioners and others, along with consent that describes how the recipient of their data is allowed to use the data and for what time period. Recipients can be assured that the data they receive is shared with the consumer’s consent, and consumers can be assured that their data will be treated appropriately by the recipient. In some cases, such as in the context of health-care research, consumers may even receive a reward for contributing their data for the advancement of science. The use of a personal health wallet keeps data in the custody and control of consumers, while the use of encryption for data in transit over a distributed peer-to-peer connection between consumers and those with whom they share their data improves privacy and security. There’s no question that there are challenges to using blockchains for health data management, as Blockchain@UBC’s early research results reveal. For one thing, consumers find it difficult to manage their private cryptographic keys — the digital key used to encrypt and decrypt data. These can be long, difficult to memorize and easy to lose. In a truly decentralized blockchain, if consumers lose their keys they could lose access to their health data and not be able to recover it, in the same way that loss of private keys has denied consumers access to their cryptocurrency. Our research indicates that a hybrid approach that gives consumers control over their health data wallets but provides them with a service to recover their private keys in the event of loss may be the best way to ease into the use of blockchains. Ensuring that this approach does not compromise privacy and security is paramount, however. Some participants identified the risk of exclusion of certain groups, such as of the non-tech savvy or older populations. Yet a participant in an older age demographic said, “ … actually today older people have more access to smartphones then they have had in the last five or 10 years. Now it is a one- or two-step procedure.” Another older user said, “I think it will come to a stage that it will be much easier to use for older people.” These early research results indicate that Canadians are open minded about blockchain as a novel way to address secure and privacy-preserving data sharing. There is still much work and research to be done before blockchains would be ready to roll out widely for consumer health data management, but with the recent announcement of a major new project on blockchain-based health data management to be funded by Canada’s Digital Technology Supercluster, there is hope that Canadians will soon have new ways to protect their privacy while improving their health.

This is not to say that cryptocurrencies will die altogether – far from it. But to all the financial romantics who have cheered the rise of bitcoin and other digital currencies over the past decade, there is a reckoning coming. Like it or not, the vision of a world in which these currencies liberate money from the clutches of central banks and other corporate giants is fading rapidly. It is not that these currencies have no place in the future of money. The encrypted blockchain technology that underpins them is extremely difficult for governments to control, so it is unlikely that they will ever be eliminated. In any case, they have a valid role to play as a geopolitical hedge – witness the surge in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies after the latest escalation in tensions between the US and Iran, for instance. But 11 years on from bitcoin’s remarkable beginnings, cryptocurrencies are a long way from supplanting the financial system. At the time of writing, the total value of all the bitcoin in circulation is US$133 billion (£102 billion); in comparison, the market value of all the world’s gold is around US$8 trillion, while the total worth of mainstream currencies worldwide is roughly the same again. The so-called bitcoin maximalists foresee a day when their currency of choice rises into the top league. They point to the bitcoin “halvening” expected in May – the moment every four years when the number of new coins being added to the network is halved – as the next event that will drive prices up. Yet the long-term prospect for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is stasis on the peripheries of the financial system. The chances of a new bitcoin look increasingly slim: it’s several years since ethereum rose to become the prime challenger, before falling back to a fraction of the bitcoin price (click on the chart below to make it bigger). Bitcoin vs altcoins More importantly, a much bigger threat to the current system is afoot – as evidenced by Facebook’s attempts to get its libra digital currency off the ground. JP Morgan has already launched a JPM coin for major institutional clients, while numerous other major banks are set to follow suit. Other tech giants like Amazon, Google and Apple are rumoured to be looking at launching rival currencies as well. Their model is what are known as stablecoins – a sort of crypto hybrid that lives on blockchains but is pegged to mainstream currencies. But aside from this connection to the status quo, these multinationals would be challenging sovereign money. They want to opt out of the clunky system that they have been forced to operate in, with its transaction fees and international payment delays, to present customers with an alluring alternative instead. The reason these companies are not throwing their weight behind bitcoin et al is because today’s cryptocurrencies have at least as many drawbacks as the mainstream system. Their prices are too volatile to act as a serious store of value, for instance, while their ability to process financial transactions is not yet particularly impressive. It has dawned on the corporate giants that as per their products or services, they can make money part of their brand – part of the customer experience. Sell people goods and services, yes, but also offer them a new monetary system to take care of the purchases. It begins to look like almost total control. The state has been late to wake up to this challenge, but has now done so in a powerful and surprising way. The traditional global infrastructure has proved strong enough to derail the corporates at least temporarily with red tape. Yet make no mistake – the goalposts have completely changed, and it will be difficult to present a united regulatory front around the world. Ironically, it is the same lack of global uniform regulatory approval for the existing cryptocurrencies that has hindered their meaningful adoption. The other response under examination is to launch state cryptocurrencies. The likes of China and Russia are in pole position to launch the first within a couple of years. Deutsche Bank recently published a report suggesting that cryptocurrencies could overtake national fiat currencies within ten years, envisaging that these state-backed versions will lead the charge. In short, the future of cryptocurrency lies in either corporate or sovereign digital coins – or more likely, an uneasy cohabitation of the two. The system supposedly under threat from bitcoin and the other so-called bank killers is instead assimilating them. The coins that emerge maybe won’t even use blockchains, acting more akin to Paypal or WeChat Pay than as cryptocurrencies as we know them. Where the previous half century saw the rise of corporates to a size and influence comparable to nation states, the next half century could produce a new paradigm in which they increasingly behave like nation states. When we reflect on the way these companies already manage our data, the way they exert lobbying influence on our governments, the trend is clearly well underway. Call it the next phase of globalisation. Money in 2030 will probably therefore be almost unrecognisable compared to what we use today. The dream of universal people-powered monetary substitutes is being crushed by this unanticipated but in hindsight inevitable institutionalisation. It is from within the multinational world that the “next bitcoin” will emerge – wrapped in the liveries of a corporate brand, if not a sovereign flag. As for the great dream of bitcoin liberation, may it rest in peace.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Gavin Brown, Richard Whittle, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2020-01-06T11:41:34Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003e2020 could well be the year that the cryptocurrency dream dies.

China’s central bank recently accelerated plans for what is currently known as the Digital Currency Electronic Payment (DCEP). It could launch within the next 18 months, while the European Central Bank is looking at something similar. Meanwhile, Russia has been working on a state-backed cryptoruble for several years, and Sweden has its e-krona project. Indeed, several countries have got there already: Senegal and the tiny Marshall Islands now have digital coins that sit alongside their existing currencies, while others such as Venezuela and Ecuador have tried but failed to gain traction. Make no mistake, these developments will completely change the international monetary system. Today’s system dates to the Bretton Woods conference of 1944, in which to create a stable trading environment the Allied nations agreed to peg their currencies to the US dollar and the US agreed to peg the dollar to gold. The dollar has been at the heart of the monetary system ever since, despite Bretton Woods being gradually replaced by free-floating exchange rates after the dollar/gold commitment was abandoned by the Americans in the 1970s. Today, around 40% of international payments and 60% of the world’s total foreign exchange reserves are in US dollars. The euro takes a more minor but still considerable proportion: over 30% of international payments and 20% of reserves. All other currencies are trivial by comparison. American financial dominance means that the Federal Reserve almost acts as the central bank of the world, since whatever its monetary policy committee decides to do with dollar interest rates has huge consequences everywhere. Together with the dollar’s dominance of the SWIFT international payment system, this was pivotal in maintaining the international monetary order for years by reducing transaction costs and speeding up globalisation. In recent years, however, the picture has changed. With heightened tensions between the world’s major powers, many commentators increasingly accuse the Americans of playing the system to their own economy’s advantage without proper regard for the consequences further afield. There are also serious concerns about the US using international payments as a political tool, for instance by leaning on SWIFT to exclude Iranian banks over the uranium enrichment row – despite objections even from the EU. Arguably, dollar dominance is now hindering the deepening of globalisation. Many countries are making moves that are changing this situation, however. The UK, France and Germany have set up INSTEX as an alternative means of trading with Iran, for instance, and six other EU countries have recently joined. There has been a massive rise in the number of bilateral agreements between central banks that allow two countries to swap currencies directly, a large number involving China. Meanwhile, a number of countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, have been repatriating their gold reserves from vaults in the US where they had long been stored. Yet by comparison, major sovereign digital currencies based on blockchain technology would be revolutionary. Blockchains are encrypted ledgers for storing information that are decentralised rather than being under any country’s or company’s control. When applied to international payments, this offers the prospect of much more transparent and cheaper transactions than SWIFT. It could cut the payments time lag from a couple of days to one second, and the cost from 0.01% to almost nothing. It will have the capacity to handle far higher volumes of payments, partly since they won’t require bank accounts or even internet access. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and XRP have been a good experiment in using blockchains for international payments. Yet when countries issue equivalents of their own, these will have even more advantages. They will be backed by states, and completely decentralised cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will not be able to compete with this. While technological change has been incredibly fast in the information era, the system of international payments has lagged behind. But once sovereign digital currencies start taking off, this will suddenly change. Just like smartphones quickly eliminated most old cell phones, no countries will be able to reject blockchain payments for long. So while, for example, the US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin recently said that his country does not see itself launching a digital dollar in the next five years, there will be a moment when the political centre of gravity will shift and everyone will join the revolution. After the 5G network and the Internet of Things really mushroom in the next couple of years, it will be possible to replace the existing system even faster. This will be the beginning of a new international monetary era. Instead of passively accepting US dollars as settlement currency in international trade, buyers and sellers will be able to choose freely from a variety of currencies. We are also likely to see a series of new powerful regional currencies, along with opportunities for the currencies of small countries with high credibility and advanced financial industries. Countries and their central banks will be competing freely with one another in this market, knowing that if they implement policies that devalue their currency, international traders will just choose rival currencies instead. Beyond that, countries will form cryptocurrency unions to regulate currencies and platforms, standardise technology and maintain the stability of the system. New clearing systems will emerge, along with new financial products. In short, it will be a whole new user-centred financial ecosystem. Whenever there are innovations in payment methods, there always follows a surge in demand. China’s Alipay and WeChat Pay are good examples. More recently we are seeing similar explosive demand for the likes of Apple Pay and Amazon Go. Yet these are primarily domestic stories. Sovereign digital currencies should produce a surge in international trade and cooperation. There will be new economic growth as more small players join the global market and consumers enjoy a wider range of goods and services at lower costs. This may seem threatening to those who benefit from the existing system, but it will be more than outweighed by capitalising on what comes next. The question for different countries is whether they embrace change or try and defend the status quo. As Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg told American lawmakers in response to China’s DCEP plan, “while we debate these issues, the rest of the world isn’t waiting”.

While talking about blockchain’s potential for improving how people make payments around the world, Schulman said: We think there’s a lot of promise to blockchain technology … but it really needs to do something that the traditional rails [of the interntional payments system] can’t do. Most people think that blockchain is about efficiency, but the system today is pretty efficient. There are middlemen sometimes in between, but the rails of it are pretty efficient. So we think a lot of the neat stuff that can happen on blockchain is around identity, for example. Schulman was referencing a debate around payments that has been going for a few years. Without getting too technical, the main benefits of blockchain payments are that they are not controlled by middlemen, so there are no fees to pay; and transactions can’t be hacked and changed once they are on the ledger. But at the same time, they are not yet as quick at processing transactions as the traditional system – which as Schulman argues, is fast enough in any case. Regulation is also a major issue: people on either end of a blockchain payment are completely anonymous. This presents major issues for everything from money laundering to being able to reclaim payments if you accidentally credit the wrong address. In short, blockchain-based payments technology is very easy, but policy and regulation are much harder. For PayPal, which relies on the international banking system, there is still no contest. So why was Schulman much more bullish about the prospects for blockchain around online identity? Interestingly, it relates to one of the technology’s weaknesses in payments: anonymity. Much of the cybercrime that takes place results from the fact that we don’t know who we’re talking to. If we could all encrypt our online identities on blockchains so that we could completely trust who were are dealing with, it could overcome this problem. This isn’t just theory: there are numerous interesting developments in the offing. Take the UK government, which like many countries is increasingly moving interactions with the public online. This includes benefits, taxation and other services such as passport and driving licence applications. Yet like all governments, it faces a major challenge from the fact that citizens lack a unique online identifier. This is helping fraudsters to steal nearly £50 billion worth of government services every year in the UK. For this reason, the government is currently exploring blockchain as a potential solution. Another very interesting application, currently being explored by the UK government as part of the same project, is voting systems. Blockchains could provide a way of guaranteeing that every person queuing up to vote is who they say they are – or allow people to vote online, potentially with big benefits to turnout. Australia is looking at idea this, too, having recently trialled allowing voters in South Australia to identify themselves via blockchain technology for a minor council election. Meanwhile, New South Wales conducted a trial earlier in 2019 using a blockchain for identity verification based on people’s driving licences. It enabled participants to prove their identity and age for things like buying alcohol and gambling without the need for a physical ID card. The trials concluded that the technology is not yet mature enough, and that ID-verification can still be achieved better with current technologies. Nonetheless, New South Wales is going ahead with a new large-scale trial of a driver licence registration system based on a blockchain platform at the end of 2019, covering some 140,000 licence holders. Another country to watch closely is China. It sees blockchain products as a good mechanism for regulation. Given the huge market that China represents, if the government decides to sanction (or indeed mandate) the use of online identity underpinned by blockchain it will give a phenomenal boost to the technology. It also raises the worrying prospect of the government being able to monitor all the purchasing transactions of its citizens, were it to introduce a system in which it knew the identities of everyone on the blockchain. Numerous blue-chip tech companies are vying to be part of this blockchain ID future – pointing to the potential for a very big market. IBM is trialling the “alpha” version of IBM Verify Credentials, an ID system underpinned by blockchain technology aimed at both businesses and governments. If typical software industry production cycles for large projects are anything to go by, a market-ready product could be two to three years away. Microsoft, too, is developing blockchain identity systems based on its well established and very successful Azure cloud computing platform. Either of these systems could potentially provide the kinds of services that governments are starting to envisage. As for corporate clients, one application could be online retail, which attracts a lot of cybercrime. These systems might provide a reliable means of identifying a buyer to confirm they are authorised to pay. Presumably this would be underpinned by something akin to transaction fees per payment. Given the hundreds of billions of transactions that take place every day, the potential revenues could clearly be enormous. This is why companies like PayPal cannot stay on the sidelines. Blockchain hype or not, you don’t want to be the Kodak of this industry, if or when encrypted ID becomes the next killer online technology. Until governments of major economies around the world are prepared to significantly overhaul financial systems to accept cryptocurrencies as mainstream payment methods, the less glamorous business of taking an ID-verification cut from billions of payment transactions might be the safer bet. And since this is very similar to the fee-taking business model that made PayPal a giant, it will be very interesting to see what Schulman does next.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Lucian Tipi, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-11-29T15:15:48Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIn \u003ca href\u003d\"https://fortune.com/2019/11/20/paypal-ceo-dan-schulman-libra/\"\u003ean interview\u003c/a\u003e, PayPal’s chief executive, Dan Schulman, recently discussed the prospects for \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/is-blockchain-all-hype-a-financier-and-supply-chain-expert-discuss-106584\"\u003eblockchain\u003c/a\u003e – the encrypted, decentralised online ledger system that underpins Bitcoin and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.wired.com/story/guide-blockchain/\"\u003emyriad\u003c/a\u003e other cutting-edge projects.

According to Coinopsy, which tracks such failures, there are some 1,085 dead coins at the time of writing. That’s a substantial number, even next to the approximately 3,000 still in existence, and senior industry figures expect many of those to fail, too. Why do so many of these projects unravel? You expect many initiatives to come and go in a fledgling market, of course – the 1990s dotcom bubble is the perfect example. But at the same time, cryptocurrency developers have traditionally spent too little time designing the business-use case for their coins and tokens, then only realising after the launch that their idea is yesterday’s news. Time and again, we see launches that copy a previously successful coin – “coin x is the new Bitcoin”, for example. Yet the market already has Bitcoin, and it continues to be in demand – as evidenced by the 18 millionth Bitcoin being mined only last month. We tend to overlook this problem with developers, even while we rightly criticise regulators for not being able to keep up with the fast evolution of the crypto market – despite efforts such as Howey Coin by US regulator the SEC, which was a fake new coin offering designed to teach investors about the risks of putting money into crypto. No doubt these kinds of developer errors will continue. Here are several other themes that we think will have a bearing on future crypto failures: Eleven years ago, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto quietly revolutionised money with the release of his or her now famous white paper that outlined Bitcoin. In the early years after this vision took off, many of those who launched altcoins and tokens were small teams of developers and leftfield entrepreneurs. They had a clear mission to bring the world of traditional finance and central banks to its knees with decentralised units of exchange that were beyond anyone’s control. A few years on, these bank killers have largely been assimilated by the big financial institutions they once sought to challenge. Wall Street is steadily taking charge of the crypto action, professionalising trading with the likes of derivatives and futures products. We may now be entering a phase where only large institutions will be able to generate profit from cryptocurrency design. It seems increasingly likely that the next revolutionary white paper will be generated by a global multi-billion-dollar firm – an ironic full turn of events, to say the least. Many other cryptocurrencies from more humble beginnings will fail in future, simply because they don’t have the resources to compete with these huge institutions. They will be driven by sunk costs and the crypto dream to dominate the future of money, but in many cases it won’t be enough. For a cryptocurrency to be successful, two things need to happen: there has to be a reason why people want to use it, and they have to trust it. People will generally trust a coin or token thanks to the underpinning blockchain technology, the decentralised cryptographic ledger systems on which this industry is built. This means that the basis upon which the market judges if a new launch will stand or fall is mainly its use case. There are now altcoins in existence offering everything from new ways to fund web advertising to units of exchange in the gaming world. But more generally, in a world in which it is no longer enough to simply claim to have launched a better Bitcoin, the market’s attention has pivoted towards stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to avoid the wild volatility of cousins like Bitcoin by being pegged or backed by assets like traditional currencies or precious metals. They are designed to encourage people to use cryptocurrency for everyday buying and selling, while also offering a stable store of value for traders on the many crypto exchanges that don’t deal in traditional currencies. Examples include USD Coin and Tether, both of which are equivalent to US$1. The fact that it takes considerable financial resources and infrastructure to make such coins operational is again likely to favour large institutions – witness Facebook’s attempt to launch the Libra stablecoin, for instance. Many investors have lost money through scams in the crypto world. One recent notorious example is the alleged OneCoin ponzi scam, in which investors were promised guaranteed 300% returns for investing Bitcoin or US dollars with a Nevada-based outfit. The money was supposed to be ploughed into foreign exchange options and altcoins, but was allegedly instead used to pay off other investors in the scheme. Fortune magazine recently speculated that OneCoin may have generated losses in excess of the US$19.4 billion (£15 billion) racked up by Bernie Maddoff’s ponzi victims in 2008. Somewhat different was Bitconnect, an exchange in which investors could swap Bitcoin for Bitconnect coins, which would be lent out with claimed returns of up to 120% per year. After longstanding ponzi accusations, the US authorities stepped in last year and the exchange abruptly closed. Bitconnect coins plunged 96% in value, creating huge losses, though they still exist and trade today. An alternative problem is hackers raiding exchanges. The most infamous example is the Mt Gox attack of 2014, in which over 850,000 bitcoins were stolen and never recovered. More recently the Binance exchange, one of the world’s largest, has been hacked several times, costing investors tens of millions of dollars. One other alarming case was that of Gerald Cotten, the 30-year-old founder of Canadian cryptocurrency exchange Quadriga, who died a year ago. Because nobody had access to his passwords, the investments of 115,000 customers worth US$137m were unrecoverable. When a court-appointed auditor was eventually able to access his account, it turned out the assets had all been sold months before Cotten died. We fully expect these sorts of problems to continue – and this shouldn’t be surprising. We are talking about a toxic combination of anonymous technology that is largely unregulated, poorly understood, and cheap and easy to move around the world – and many people willing to kiss frogs in their search for a lucrative prince.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Gavin Brown, Richard Whittle, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-11-21T13:47:23Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eMany cryptocurrencies have been launched in the past few years, often to great fanfare and celebration, only to fade and fail as the public and investors shun them. \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coinopsy.com/dead-coins/\"\u003eAccording to\u003c/a\u003e Coinopsy, which tracks such failures, there are some 1,085 dead coins at the time of writing.

As well as facing pressure from global regulators, seven of its 28 founding members have left the project – including high profile firms PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, eBay and Stripe. It leaves 21 companies in the Libra Association, the organisation overseeing the cryptocurrency. But Facebook is big enough to launch Libra on its own, so why are these members even needed? After all, it is Facebook’s network of 1.59 billion daily active users that form the foundation of its business case to issue a non-sovereign currency. Why share the spoils? The answer may be twofold. First, by having a council of members this enables Facebook to claim decentralisation status – a key tenet of any cryptocurrency. It’s a far cry from the fully decentralised alternatives of bitcoin et al., but certainly not centralised, so a valid claim. Second, and perhaps primarily, by having a group of high-profile businesses as Libra members it goes some way towards sugarcoating this disruption in the eyes of the world’s regulators, in readiness for the inevitable pushback. Many of the departing members – most being payments firms – stood to lose much of their core business if Libra becomes successful. So, in the face of the project facing additional scrutiny, Libra quickly became a net negative prospect for them and a respectful early withdrawal is entirely rational. But their places are likely to soon be taken up by other prospective members waiting in the wings. There are many companies that will want to capitalise on what could be a revolutionary global money system. Total membership is likely to be expanded as a show of strength. Ben Maurer, Facebook’s blockchain technology lead, explained in June that, “over time, [Libra] is designed to transition the node membership from these founding members, who have a stake in the creation of the ecosystem, to people who hold Libra and have a stake in the ecosystem as a whole”. Read more: Facebook’s Libra: it’s not the ‘crypto’ that’s the issue, it\u0027s the organisation behind it Facebook has already announced that some 1,500 entities have expressed interest. So turning up the dial of decentralisation is the intended objective – publicly, at least. This will help assuage the concerns of regulators that Facebook holds too much power over the new cryptocurrency. The fight for the future of money is on. What is at stake is the ability to extract value from the minting of new currency, known as seigniorage. The stakes couldn’t be higher. The Bank of International Settlements (the bank for central banks) estimates that total global money is approximately US$5 trillion, while the CIA put that figure closer to US$80 trillion in 2017, if “broad money” (which includes the figures in everyone’s bank accounts) is included. In comparison, the market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies at the time of writing is US$215 billion, some 372 times smaller than this latter estimate of total money. Facebook has the reach and the technology to make its cryptocurrency mainstream, but nation states have the regulatory power of veto to retain their monopolistic hold over monetary policy. Presently, their strategy is to spook any potential Libra partners to abandon the project. For example, US senators Sherrod Brown and Brian Schatz sent a letter earlier this month to the CEOs of Visa, Mastercard and Stripe saying any Libra members should expect a higher level of scrutiny not just of this project but also of their core business, too. Read more: Facebook\u0027s libra has staggering potential – state control of money could end But this pressure will only work with some companies – particularly more traditional financial firms that will ultimately lose out to Libra. The goals of the Libra project are big. If Facebook wanted to simply make some extra profits, it could have issued a voucher system, akin to a supermarket reward scheme. See Facebook’s previous attempt at issuing Facebook Credits that were terminated in 2012. This would probably have avoided the regulatory scrutiny it has received with the Libra project and would be well-placed to take off. If Facebook simply charged users for tokens used to play games or purchase content within its applications, then regulators may have been less interested. After all, what is the real difference between purchasing Facebook credit with domestic currency to, say, purchasing credit from Vodafone to top up a prepay phone? But the Libra project is more than this. Its aim is not to create a voucher system for internal use – it is not even to create a rival to a national currency – it is to create a global currency more similar to the euro than the US dollar, to service the under-banked and unbanked as well as threaten the dominance of existing fiat currencies in established markets. The Libra Association provides this possibility because it gives the project clout and legitimacy in front of regulators. It may even be that the financial regulators will in time feel a missed opportunity in not supporting the Libra project further.

The goals of the Libra project are big. If Facebook wanted to simply make some extra profits, it could have issued a voucher system, akin to a supermarket reward scheme.

After all, what is the real difference between purchasing Facebook credit with domestic currency to, say, purchasing credit from Vodafone to top up a prepay phone?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Libra project is more than this. Its aim is not to create a voucher system for internal use – it is not even to create a rival to a national currency – it is to create a global currency more similar to the euro than the US dollar, to service the under-banked and unbanked as well as threaten the dominance of existing fiat currencies in established markets. The Libra Association provides this possibility because it gives the project clout and legitimacy in front of regulators.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt may even be that the financial regulators will in time feel a missed opportunity in not supporting the Libra project further. Cryptocurrencies, and corporate cryptocurrencies especially, continue to evolve and innovate.

I study blockchain technology and its potential use in fighting fraud, strengthening cybersecurity and securing voting. I see promising signs that blockchain-based voting could make it more convenient for people to vote, thereby boosting voter turnout. And blockchain systems can be effective at strengthening the security of devices, networks and critical systems like electricity grids, as well as protecting personal privacy. The few small-scale tests run so far have identified problems and vulnerabilities in the digital systems and government administrative procedures that must be resolved before blockchain-based voting can be considered safe and trustworthy. Therefore I don’t see clear evidence that it can prevent, or even detect, election fraud. There are a few steps in a blockchain-based voting system, which uses technology to mirror the process of in-person voting. First, the system needs to verify a voter’s identity – often by having the user upload a photo of a government-issued ID and then a photo or video self-portrait. The system confirms the ID’s validity, and facial recognition software makes sure the person in the self-portrait is the person on the ID. Then the user is authenticated as eligible to cast a vote. Only at that point does blockchain technology actually enter the process. The system gives each authenticated voter a digital token that represents the person’s vote and a list of the digital addresses to which he or she can send that token. Each address indicates a vote for a particular candidate or an answer to a ballot question. The tokens don’t indicate who cast them, so votes remain anonymous. When a voter sends a token, a record of that act is stored simultaneously on several different computers, making it much harder for hackers to alter the vote records. After casting the ballot by sending the token, the user receives a unique code that they can use to look at the anonymized online vote tally to confirm their vote was counted as they intended. Early results show that blockchain systems may increase voter turnout, though it’s not yet clear why. Many of the tests have been for informal ballots, like student government groups and community projects. However, several election officials in the U.S. have held small-scale trials of blockchain voting, allowing members of the military who are stationed overseas to vote electronically, rather than by mail. In the November 2018 congressional elections, West Virginia allowed 144 voters living overseas to cast ballots from 31 different countries using an app developed by a private company called Voatz, which is involved in many of these trials. Another 200 voters overseas expressed interest in using the system, but their home counties in West Virginia weren’t set up to do so. Based on the results, West Virginia says it plans to continue and expand the trial in the 2020 presidential election. Denver, Colorado, had 119 voters who were overseas use a Voatz system to cast their ballots in municipal primary elections in May. In the city’s June runoff election, 112 voters did so online through a blockchain system. In August, 24 voters cast their ballots from overseas using a Voatz app in a Utah County, Utah, election. The most recent – and largest – use of a blockchain-based voting system was in the city council election in Moscow, Russia, on Sept. 8. Because of concerns that the system was not set up securely, only three of the city’s 20 electoral precincts allowed voters to use a blockchain-based mobile voting app to cast their ballot from anywhere with an internet connection. Again, the evidence showed a boost in voter turnout: The city’s overall turnout rate was around 17% of registered voters. That includes a 90% turnout among the voters who had registered to use the system. However, technological complications barred some people from voting, which led at least one losing candidate to object that he would have won if everything had worked properly. That’s the sort of problem that is most worrying for people who hope using mathematical principles and computerized encryption will help the public have trust in election outcomes. There are several obstacles in the way of blockchain ever becoming useful for large-scale, legally binding voting. One is that most people have little understanding of how blockchain systems work. Another, equally vital, is that even experts don’t have a way to identify every possible irregularity in online voting. Voting on paper, by contrast, is well studied and easily verified and audited. One crucial aspect of a blockchain voting system is the method by which the computer system verifies voters’ identities. When a verified voter establishes an account on the system, that process creates a digital key that identifies them securely when casting a ballot. A more complex key is harder to hack, but also takes more computing resources to verify. It will be important to find a way to protect the integrity of the voting process, without exhausting government budgets buying advanced computing power. The computational power required may make blockchain systems inefficient for voting on a nationwide scale – or even statewide, in populous states like California and Texas. The Moscow election system, for instance, initially assigned keys that were too easily hacked. That opened the possibility of voter impersonation, which is bad enough. But that weakness also violated the principle of a secret ballot by letting outsiders know how each person voted. Other problems with digital voting systems are separate from the underlying technologies. In some cases, government-issued IDs used to verify voters’ identities are many years old. Even when dealing with current images, facial recognition systems, including the one used by Voatz, have high error rates, especially for non-white voters. In addition, hackers may try to trick the system. The phone or computer a voter uses to cast a ballot may not be secure, either – and it’s not safe to assume that the computer networks they communicate over, and the servers the data is stored on, are safe from manipulation or even random errors. Proprietary voting apps like Voatz offer the public no way to know whether voters’ choices are accurately recorded, nor whether these apps truthfully deliver their ballots’ encrypted copy to be counted by election officials. Voatz has claimed that its system has been audited by third parties, but has made few details of that process or its findings available to the public. West Virginia officials who hired Voatz have also refused to reveal information about how its security was evaluated. The company has said it would not release that information because it had a nondisclosure agreement with the auditors, and for fear its proprietary system design might be discovered by competitors. It’s possible that blockchain-based voting could boost voter participation rates, but there’s no evidence yet that it is better at preventing election fraud. With plenty of potential trouble spots outside the system itself, and little public transparency within it, I have to conclude that blockchain voting is not yet safe or ready for service.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nir Kshetri, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-10-18T11:25:19Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eA developing technology called “blockchain” has gotten attention from election officials, startups and even Democratic presidential candidate \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.yang2020.com/policies/modernize-voting/\"\u003eAndrew Yang\u003c/a\u003e as a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.wired.com/story/wouldnt-it-be-great-if-people-could-vote-on-blockchain/\"\u003epotential way to boost voter turnout and public trust in election results\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI \u003ca href\u003d\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user\u003dQx3YMi4AAAAJ\u0026amp;hl\u003den\u0026amp;oi\u003dao\"\u003estudy\u003c/a\u003e blockchain technology and its potential use in \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/blockchain-systems-are-tracking-food-safety-and-origins-106491\"\u003efighting fraud\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/blockchain-could-be-the-answer-to-cybersecurity-maybe-1527645960\"\u003estrengthening cybersecurity\u003c/a\u003e and securing \u003ca href\u003d\"https://doi.org/10.1109/MS.2018.2801546\"\u003evoting\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI see promising signs that blockchain-based voting could make it more convenient for people to vote, thereby boosting voter turnout.

When it comes to money, it goes well beyond bitcoin. Academics have claimed it will “do to the financial system what the internet did to media”. There are many versions of public blockchains in existence, but the majority of them share a basic premise: they offer a secure, decentralised infrastructure to maintain a “single version of the truth”, recording all changes made on the blockchain database since its formation. Enthusiasts predict the technology will do away with the need for banks to act as intermediaries. Whether we buy our groceries online, pay for a service through our mobile phone, or transfer funds abroad, transactions will almost immediately be recorded on the distributed ledger of the blockchain, rather than waiting a couple of days for it to register in our account as banks contact each other on a system invented in the 1970s. A lot of banks and fintechs started experimenting with blockchain in 2015 – trying to capitalise on the speed and transparency it offers. But four years later, the idea that blockchain will remove banks as intermediaries in our payments system still seems a long way off. That’s because there are five basic challenges that the technology has to overcome if it is to be accepted as part of the financial system. Blockchain’s strength is it has no central authority, but this is also a weakness. Who makes the decisions about how the technology works or when it needs updating? If Microsoft Windows needs an update, Microsoft will decide on that and send out an update. But with no central decision-maker, decisions about updates in the world of blockchain become slow and dysfunctional. Public blockchains operate more like communities. There is no systematic way to decide on updates or improvements. Instead they happen through huge debates among ecosystem participants, with groups arguing over issues like the length of a block, the number of transactions it should hold and how quickly they should be chained. Often there is no solution to these debates, with no way to organise these communities and make decisions. Sometimes this can result in a split. That’s what happened in 2016 when 3.6m ether (amounting to roughly US$60m at the time) was stolen on the ethereum cryptocurrency network. Founder Vitalik Buterin agreed to “unwind the theft” by creating a new version of the blockchain and the respective token. This “hard fork” allowed people to reclaim their funds, but some of the community felt it went against the principles of blockchain and so carried on using the “old ethereum”, now known as ethereum classic. Blockchains haven’t figured out how to effectively govern yet. Often, simple majority voting mechanisms are used to make decisions, which means issues are vulnerable to lobbyists or particularly active contributors seizing control. Despite blockchain’s popularity, it is still at a very small scale compared to everyday electronic payments. At the moment, bitcoin’s blockchain does 2,000 transactions every ten minutes, whereas Visa handles more than 65,000 transaction messages every second, and SWIFT – the global messaging system used by banks and financial institutions to transfer payments – deals with approximately 24m messages a day. The “block size debate” over how many transactions each block of a blockchain should handle has raged since the early days of bitcoin in 2009. This must be resolved for blockchain platforms to grow big enough to become part of the world’s financial plumbing. Different blockchains organise information in a plethora of ways. This means feeding information from one to another is not always easy. There is no agreed universal layout of the transaction data structure. In a financial payment, a block will hold the person or company’s name, account information, payment, location address and any other relevant factors. But cryptocurrencies all do this differently, so it would be difficult to move from one currency to another. They need to create standards for the information they contain and how it is systematically laid out. Who should create these standards, though? There needs to be a body taking the lead on this and a general consensus must come to the fore, like the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has done for the internet. There is no liability for the platforms when things go wrong at the moment. For instance, in 2017, Canadian digital currency exchange QuadrigaCX announced that a computer error had led to losses of ether worth US$14m. The ether was trapped in the Ethereum system, but the Ethereum community decided not to take any action in recovering it and so QuadrigaCX had to swallow the loss so no client balances were affected. Surely, liability will need to be cleared up before the public can trust blockchains with their money. For this, we need more regulation in the space of crypto and blockchain in general. Blockchain payments mean all users can see all the transactions, making them easy to audit and trace. Users are pseudo-anonymous, in that they are not obliged to identify themselves in any way, but they can still be traced through their alphanumeric address and use of tokens on the network. This transparency is part of the blockchain’s strength. It means other users can see the amount of bitcoins going from one address to another, but no name is linked to that address. The current system, SWIFT, is a private network infrastructure. It is considered secure and resilient, allowing access only to users who are fully identified and verified as legal entities in the finance sector. Eventually, blockchain’s lack of an identification framework will be problematic for many users and investors as it is a fundamental premise on which the financial system is built. Until these issues are addressed, it is hard to see public (and to some extent private) blockchains becoming the new foundation of our financial system.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Markos Zachariadis, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-10-16T13:00:15Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eBlockchain is touted as the next step in the digital revolution, a technology that will change every industry from \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/how-blockchain-could-help-musicians-make-a-living-from-music-52125\"\u003emusic\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/a-rubbish-idea-how-blockchains-could-tackle-the-worlds-waste-problem-94457\"\u003ewaste\u003c/a\u003e.

Since 2013, Australia’s policy response to climate change has been the Emissions Reduction Fund, which awards government contracts to projects that reduce carbon emissions by planting trees, flaring landfill gas, improving energy efficiency, and other methods. It is supported by a “safeguard mechanism” that imposes a cap on the largest emitters. Under the Emissions Reduction Fund, the government has contracted 192 million tonnes of emissions reductions from 433 projects, at an average price of about A$12. There are mixed views about whether these projects will be delivered and if they will effectively reduce emissions. Read more: Australia\u0027s Emissions Reduction Fund is almost empty. It shouldn\u0027t be refilled The Emissions Reduction Fund has been criticised for its high transaction costs and administrative complexity. It also limits the development of a secondary market, whereby people would be able to trade carbon credits among themselves rather than directly under contract to the government. Despite these criticisms, earlier this year the fund was extended and rebranded as the Climate Solutions Fund. This policy is set for the foreseeable future, but may eventually be replaced with a more open market mechanism. It is important to consider how to improve the current system and lay foundations for future developments. Blockchain is an emerging technology that promises to transform how individuals, industry, and government operate. The current Australian carbon market is ripe for such a technical transformation. Blockchain is a record of transactions, also known as a ledger. It is the design and process of blockchain that distinguishes it from other established ledgers. Blockchain uses online networks to conduct, validate, and record transactions. These can range from simple transactions to more complex smart contracts that only execute when defined conditions are met. Network members can access the distributed ledger and independently verify transactions. Once the network is satisfied that a collection of transactions (known as a “block”) is legitimate, they are added (or “chained”) to the ledger, creating a permanent record. Our research explored how blockchain could be applied to the Australian carbon market. We used a structured design process to consider each technical component of a carbon market blockchain. The key element of our design was a partially decentralised blockchain, featuring smart contracts of the type described above. A regulator would have particular powers to issue and verify carbon credits, and administer decentralised transactions. This decentralisation would be backed by smart contracts that would automate transactions if certain conditions were met. Suppose a company has a government contract to provide a certain amount of emissions reductions by planting trees. Once these reductions were achieved, the blockchain would verify that the activity was complete. The company might then be able to plant more trees, and potentially sell further carbon credits to a non-government client. This could be a company that needed to offset its own emissions that had gone above the levels set in the safeguard mechanism, for example. In this case, the blockchain would allow all parties to transparently see the verified reductions and ensure that no credits were double-counted. Currently the Clean Energy Regulator is intimately involved in every aspect of project monitoring, reporting, and verification. But there is a smarter way. Smart contracts could be programmed according to a project’s particular emissions reduction method (tree planting, improving energy effiency, and so on). Market rules could then be designed to automate the regulator’s functions. As a project met conditions specified in its smart contract - meeting a certain amount of emissions reductions, for instance - it would be verified and issued with the carbon credits it has earned. For projects currently contracted to the Emissions Reduction Fund, an extension could be added to automatically award the credits. Using smart contracts could create a more independent regulator. The regulator would be able to demonstrate transparency and consistency in credit issuing and purchasing. This would remove the uncomfortable conflict of interest that currently exists, whereby the regulator is currently in charge of both issuing and buying the credits. Smart contracts would also create a more effective regulator, with access to real-time information about the performance of projects, rather than having to wait months or years for reporting. This would enable the regulator to more quickly identify non-compliance or suspicious activity in projects. Smart contracts would also speed up processing times for project reporting and encourage more frequent reporting. This would benefit projects by cutting transaction costs and allowing credits to be issued more quickly, thereby improving cash flow. At the scheme level, lower administrative burdens and improved project cash flow would reduce overall project costs. This would in turn lead to more projects, promote more competition in Emissions Reduction Fund auctions, and thus allow the government to save money when buying emissions reductions. Smart contracts would let the government monitor its portfolio of contract projects more closely. This would allow faster reallocation of funds from poorly performing projects. Read more: The future of blockchain according to experts in the energy sector The Australian government often declares its commitment to free markets. But the current system puts all the responsibility for the carbon market squarely on the government’s shoulders. This must be uncomfortable, and an alternative approach would surely be attractive. Introducing a blockchain technology to the market’s processes would boost transparency, security, efficiency, and integrity. It would also reduce costs, increase competitiveness, and improve equity for participants in the market. An Australian carbon market blockchain is an attractive potential solution to some of the problems with the current approach to emissions reductions, and a promising foundation for a more open Australian carbon market in the future.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Sebastian Thomas, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-09-25T20:41:42Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis article and the research it describes were co-authored by \u003ca href\u003d\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/sam-hartmann-b7933267\"\u003eSam Hartmann\u003c/a\u003e, who led the work as a graduate researcher at the University of Melbourne.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2013, Australia’s policy response to climate change has been the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/government/emissions-reduction-fund\"\u003eEmissions Reduction Fund\u003c/a\u003e, which awards government contracts to projects that reduce carbon emissions by planting trees, flaring landfill gas, improving energy efficiency, and other methods.

The launch has raised questions about the difference between Libra and existing cryptocurrencies, as well as the implications of private companies competing with sovereign countries in issuing currencies. Unlike Bitcoin, which has neither an owner nor a controlling body, Libra will be governed by a Swiss foundation comprised of several members that are well-established brands, including Uber, Visa and PayPal. Read more: Facebook’s Libra: it’s not the ‘crypto’ that’s the issue, it\u0027s the organisation behind it Libra operates within a much more controlled environment relative to many other cryptos like Bitcoin and Ether. It also doesn’t run on a blockchain. Instead, the book-keeping of Libra transactions is bestowed upon a set of trusted computing nodes controlled by the members of the Libra foundation. In contrast, Bitcoin is a free-for-all where anybody can join the group of computers that verify transactions. This difference in governance structure has wide-ranging implications for the economic gains and possible risks society faces from a possible widespread adoption of new currencies like Libra. A fundamental issue most fintech companies face today is scaleability. The Visa network can authorize up to 65,000 transactions per second, while Bitcoin typically processes a few hundred thousand a day. Technically, it’s possible to expand the Bitcoin network to a commercially viable scale, but due to the lack of a governing body, several attempts to increase capacity have ended up in endless debates, fights within the community and different camps going their own ways. It’s resulted in the creation of offspring currencies such as BitcoinGold and BitcoinCash. Libra overcomes these struggles by a well-defined governance structure where necessary technical adaptations can be efficiently decided upon in an organized manner. But Libra decision-makers may be tempted to put their own best interests ahead of the consumers’ benefit. Recent revelations about the lack of privacy protections in place at the companies on Libra’s foundation raise concerns about how much trust users can place in Libra when they’re deciding whether to open up their financial transactions to the big internet companies on Libra’s board. Intimate knowledge of people’s purchases, wealth and shopping behaviour has incredible value for advertising and resale to other companies. It will be up to the consortium members to credibly convince the public that they will refrain from monetizing this huge wealth of data that they sit upon. In our traditional financial system, laws and regulators watch over privacy as well as access to the financial system. Laws not only provide privacy protections, they also guard against fraud and ensure that citizens can participate on a level playing field. Rules are created in a democratic process. Banks in western countries cannot easily ban citizens from basic financial services, which are important to join the workforce and get established in society. But currencies issued by private companies do not face the same scrutiny. What if Facebook decides you cannot have Libra because you posted a critical article on the internet? Your legal options would be limited. Bitcoin’s chaotic governance structure has an advantage here. Without a governing body, there is nobody who can lock anybody else out of the system. While this approach ensures equal access, however, it also invites criminals to use Bitcoin for illicit purposes. Centuries ago, promissory notes emerged in China and were brought to Europe by Marco Polo as an early banking service that allowed merchants to travel without large sums of money due to fear they’d be robbed. Banks offered safekeeping for money, allowing the merchant to store the funds and withdraw them whenever and wherever needed. Today, banks still spend billions of dollars on security to protect their clients’ savings. Many credit-card companies provide protection against fraudulent transactions. No such protections exist for cryptocurrencies. No recourse is possible should a hacker gain access to your wallet or if your crypto becomes worthless. With cryptocurrencies, users must once again worry about safekeeping. Often under-appreciated, but of great importance, is government-provided deposit insurance that provides a second layer of security, protecting depositors against the default of the bank. Unlike Bitcoin, where prices fluctuate dramatically within a few days, Libra’s value is tied to a basket of international currencies. As users buy Libra with fiat currency, including Canadian dollars, the Libra foundation will take these dollars and invest them in safe securities. Because Libra is backed with real and stable financial assets, the value of Libra will then also be stable. While this approach sounds great at a first glance, several problems exist that have plagued banking for centuries. Temptations will arise to invest some of the money in riskier securities for a higher return. What if people, for some reason or another, doubt that the assets are there or think that the assets lost value? Long lines of depositors wanting to withdraw their funds from a bank that they rightfully or wrongfully believe to be troubled have been observed ever since the inception of banks. Such bank runs are often self-fulfilling, and Libra is not immune to this problem. When users want to cash out, Libra would have to sell their assets at a large scale, causing the price of these very assets to fall and hence end up with insufficient funds to pay all investors. As users realize what is happening, more will want to cash out, speeding up the vicious circle. Unlike with banks, it’s unclear how possible losses will be covered and how they might be shared among users. Some U.S. money market funds that are in a similar business — investing client’s money in safe short-term assets — found themselves in similar trouble in the 2008 financial crisis and were bailed out by the government. With Libra, it’s unclear which government would come to the rescue, if any. All the money that users will put into Libra will be missed in the traditional banking system, where banks can put deposits to good use by providing loans to productive companies that generate value and employment. The economic consequences therefore could be far-reaching. The foundation for Libra’s model and possible success is the banking sector’s shortcomings and inefficiencies. While Libra might not offer many advantages to users in Western countries, it will open access to financial services for millions of people around the world without bank accounts. Cross-border payments are in the current system ridiculously expensive and slow. Traditional banking often seems bureaucratic and technologically outdated. All these issues could be fixed by banks, but it will take outside pressure of new fintech startups to get it done. [ Deep knowledge, daily.

These entrepreneurs often operate on an informal, micro-enterprise scale, however, and their contribution to economic activity is minimal. This is a shame because, excluding South Africa, most industrial sectors in Sub-Saharan Africa are not dominated by large firms that tend to keep entrepreneurs at bay in more advanced economies, thus presenting opportunities for significant growth. Although foreign multinationals have (and are already playing) a key role in GDP growth in these countries, the tendency to repatriate their earnings ultimately diminishes their contribution to local gross national income (GNI). Furthermore, these businesses are often attracted to larger, better organized markets on the continent, where they can readily capture value using products and processes developed in their home countries. This leads to a scenario where residents in larger African cities have access to much of the same products and services one might obtain in the developed world, while outside these regions, residents are left to deal with the consequences of commercial neglect. Local entrepreneurship therefore offers at least three benefits for African economies: Most of the income generated is retained and reinvested in local communities. Being local, entrepreneurs can more readily navigate the complicated cultural, economic, and infrastructure circumstances, thus contributing to economic activity and social good in underserved regions. At the individual level, entrepreneurship seems to be associated with higher rates of well-being, work satisfaction and overall happiness. Given these potential upsides, it is unfortunate that entrepreneurship on the continent continues to lag. As seems to often be the case, researchers have implicated the usual suspects: inadequate infrastructure, poor education and high levels of corruption. Innovative technologies often upend what we think is practical or even possible. If harnessed, they could provide solutions to some of Africa’s most intractable problems. To cite just three examples, the blockchain, drones and AI have enormous promise. The blockchain technology’s distributed ledger system may be able to reduce corruption in certain activities. My research indicates that firms in the region often tend to cite “informal payments” to government officials as an important business challenge. Any aspect of business-government relationships that can be made more transparent would therefore be favourably received by entrepreneurs in the region. Applying blockchain solutions to government transparency is not a novel idea. To boost government transparency, the government of Canada has started sharing information about research funding through an Ethereum-based blockchain ledger. Similarly, other business-government dealings could be monitored via blockchain, reducing the potential for backroom deals that may disfavour struggling entrepreneurs, and increasing transparency and overall trust in government. As a second example, autonomous vehicles such as drones may be able to solve logistics challenges for e-commerce or other businesses. This is the case with blood delivery in Rwanda, where drones minimise the effect of a difficult terrain and lacking transport infrastructure. Although this does not address the underlying dearth of infrastructure, it is easy to see how with policy support this system can be replicated in other industrial sectors and countries in the region facing similar infrastructural challenges. Artificial intelligence is yet another example of the potential of emerging technologies. AI may be able to bring advanced education to the most remote areas of the continent by adapting world-class courses to student’s strengths and needs. AI has negligible marginal costs, after all, and doesn’t mind living in the pocket of an entrepreneur in the Niger Delta. Read more: AI in schools — here\u0027s what we need to consider  Although these technologies offer solutions for developing entrepreneurship in Africa that were once far-fetched, these solutions will likely remain out of reach without policy measures to optimally apply the underlying technologies at scale. The newly minted African Continental Free Trade Area presents a unique opportunity for policymakers to redefine what it means to be an entrepreneur on the continent. A coherent effort to boost high-potential entrepreneurship on the continent will require leaders to think about questions such as: How can entrepreneurs use autonomous vehicles and blockchain technology to facilitate logistics in the new African Continental Free Trade Area? What is the role of the African Union and national policymakers? How can big data and artificial intelligence help in identifying the most promising entrepreneurial ventures for public support in Africa? What role can the African Development Bank play in supporting the private sector development and commercialisation of innovative technologies in priority sectors such as healthcare and education? Setting Africa on this audacious course will require leadership that is fully oriented to the opportunities and challenges of today’s knowledge economy, leaders who answer the right questions, and have the execution to deliver at local, national and continental levels.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Prince C.

It has given everyone with access to it a platform to express their views and exchange ideas with others instantaneously. But in recent years, internet services such as search engines and social media platforms have increasingly been provided by a small number of very large tech firms. On the face of it, companies such as Google and Facebook claim to provide a free service to all their users. But in practice, they harvest huge amounts of personal data and sell it on to others for profit. They’re able to do this every time you log into social media, ask a question on a search engine or store files on a cloud service. The internet is slowly turning into something like the current financial system, which centrally monitors all transactions and uses that data to predict what people will buy in future. This type of monitoring has huge implications for the privacy of ordinary people around the world. The digital currency Bitcoin, which surfaced on the internet in 2008, sought to break the influence that large, private bodies have over what we do online. The researchers had finally solved one of the biggest concerns with digital currencies – that they need central control by the companies that operate them, in the same way traditional currencies are controlled by a bank. The core idea behind the Bitcoin system is to make all the participants in the system, collectively, the bank. To do this, blockchains are used. Blockchains are distributed, tamper-proof ledgers, which can record every transaction made within a network. The ledger is distributed in the sense that a synchronised copy of the blockchain is maintained by each of the participants in the network, and tamper-proof in the sense that each of the transactions in the ledger is locked into place using a strong encrypting technique called hashing. More than a decade since this technology emerged, we’re still only beginning to scratch the surface of its potential. People researching it may have overlooked one of its most useful applications – making the internet better for everyone who uses it. In order to use services on the internet such as social media, email and cloud data storage, people need to authenticate themselves to the service provider. The way to do this at the moment is to come up with a username and password and register an account with the provider. But at the moment, there’s no way to verify the user’s identity. Anyone can create an account on platforms like Facebook and use it to spread fake news and hatred, without fear of ever being identified and caught. Read more: Now there\u0027s a game you can play to \u0027vaccinate\u0027 yourself against fake news Our idea is to issue each citizen with a digital certificate by first verifying their identity. An organisation like your workplace, university or school knows your identity and is in a position to issue you with a certificate. If other organisations do the same for their members, we could put these certificates on a publicly accessible blockchain and create a global protected record of every internet user’s identity. Since there’d be a means for identifying users with their digital certificate, social media accounts could be linked to real people. A school could create social media groups which could only be accessed if a student had a certificate issued to them by the school, preventing the group being infiltrated by outsiders. A user could ask for a one-time password (OTP) for Facebook by clicking an icon on their mobile phone. Facebook would then look up the user’s digital certificate on the blockchain and return an OPT to their phone. The OTP will be encrypted so that it cannot be seen by anyone else apart from the intended recipient. The user would then login to the service using their username and the OTP, thereby eliminating the need to remember passwords. The OTP changes with each login and is delivered encrypted to your phone, so it’s much more difficult to guess or steal a password. People are often too busy or reluctant to go to a polling station on voting days. An internet voting system could change that. Digital currencies like Zerocash are fully anonymous and can be traced on the blockchain, giving it the basic ingredients for a voting system. Anyone can examine the blockchain and confirm that a particular token has been transferred between two parties without revealing their identities. Each candidate could be given a digital wallet and each eligible voter given a token. Voters cast their token into the wallet of their preferred candidate using their mobile phone. If the total number of tokens in the wallets is less than or equal to the number issued, then you have a valid poll and the candidate with the most tokens is declared the winner. People use search engines everyday, but this allows companies like Google to gather trends, create profiles and sell this valuable information to marketing companies. If internet users were to use a digital currency to make a micropayment – perhaps one-hundredth of a cent – for each search query that they perform, there would be less incentive for a search company to sell their personal data. Even if someone performed a hundred search queries per day they would end up paying only one cent – a small price to pay for one’s privacy.

Facebook’s main game is Calibra","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Amid the hype around Facebook’s plan to launch its own cryptocurrency, Libra, there’s one big question. How is the company going to profit from it? The project relies on developing blockchain technology. But blockchain’s whole raison d\u0027être is to challenge the way corporate capitalism and businesses like Facebook make money. Facebook has also established, with several dozen equally capitalistic partners, the Libra Association, a nonprofit organisation based in Switzerland, to spearhead the venture. Read more: The lowdown on Libra: what consumers need to know about Facebook’s new cryptocurrency After years of copping criticism for questionable business practices, has Facebook decided to take an altruistic turn? Probably not. It’s more likely that blockchain, and even Libra, is a means to a end; it’s about Facebook wanting to be not only the world’s biggest social media platform but also the globe’s go-to marketplace, putting Amazon, eBay, Apple and Google in the shade. To appreciate why this suggestion isn’t also hyperbole, we need to talk not so much about Libra but its companion technology, the “custodial wallet” called Calibra. First, let’s do a quick recap of some fundamentals. In 2008, a person or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a method for transacting over the internet without a trusted third party such as a bank. It uses a distributed ledger known as a blockchain and cryptography to maintain a tamper-proof record of ownership of electronic cash – hence the term cryptocurrency. Blockchain’s core innovation is to do away with the need for trusted entities like banks. So how do people safely send or receive cryptocurrency? Well, they can use a “cryptocurrency wallet”. A cryptocurrency balance is recorded against a blockchain address. Proving ownership depends on a secret code (or “private key”) known only to the owner. The “wallet” is essentially software that allows people to manage their private keys and authorise transactions. Facebook has other ideas for its cryptocurrency. The Libra Association says it wants to “make sending money as easy and cheap as sending a text message”. Tapping addresses and secret codes into a wallet interface every time wouldn’t be that easy. These codes can be long – up to 64 characters, compared to 16 for a credit card. So Facebook will instead provide a “custodial wallet” – Calibra. It will be the custodian of your cryptocurrency, much like a bank is custodian of your money, and thus manage your wallet for you. Facebook can certainly argue that this makes it much easier to use Libra – and it wants to make Libra easy to use so you can buy items through Facebook and its other platforms, such as Whatsapp and Instagram. But this aspect has little to do with the original ideals behind blockchain. It makes Calibra more like a bank, with a record of your electronic payments. It will know everything you buy or sell through its wallet; and it will share “Calibra customer data with managed vendors and service providers — including Facebook”. Why is this important? Because Facebook is in the business of gathering your personal data. It now uses this information to make about 99% of its income from selling advertising – US$14.9 billion in the first quarter of 2019 alone. Its value as an advertising delivery mechanism comes not just from its sheer number of users (1.56 billion daily users, and 2.37 billion monthly users) but from what it knows about them. This goes way beyond basic personal details like your birthdate. Almost everything about Facebook is designed to get you to reveal personal information. You do this through what you post and the posts you like or respond to. You do this even when not directly using Facebook. Lots of online stores report back to Facebook when you visit them, for example. Read more: Explainer: what is surveillance capitalism and how does it shape our economy? Identifying key personality traits can be used to predict purchasing behaviour – or political preference, as demonstrated in the Cambridge Analytica controversy. The British-based political consultancy bragged it effectively swung the US 2016 election to Donald Trump by using Facebook to harvest user data and then directing customised political messages to users’ newsfeeds. Read more: We need to talk about the data we give freely of ourselves online and why it\u0027s useful While there is some scepticism about Cambridge Analytica’s electoral impact, it is generally agreed the process of “micro-targeting” can be very effective for marketers. So the more information Facebook has about you, the more money it can potentially make by influencing you. There’s more. Facebook’s value as an advertising powerhouse has made its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, extremely wealthy – worth an estimated US$73 billion. But that’s less than half of Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, who’s worth US$158 billion. Both companies are in the business of helping merchants sell products. But Amazon’s position as an online marketplace is more lucrative than Facebook’s role as a shop window. Amazon can take a cut from every sale. Its retail business makes up about 80% of its US$950 billion value, which is greater than Facebook’s total value of US$550 billion. What if Facebook could be both the shop window and the cash register? What if it no longer just introduced users to merchants but also became the digital marketplace supporting those merchants? What if it could collect not just social data but also buyer history data? This is what Libra, and more critically, Calibra, could mean for Facebook. Libra’s an important part of this picture.

It’s more likely that blockchain, and even Libra, is a means to a end; it’s about Facebook wanting to be not only the world’s biggest social media platform but also the globe’s go-to marketplace, putting Amazon, eBay, Apple and Google in the shade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo appreciate why this suggestion isn’t also hyperbole, we need to talk not so much about Libra but its companion technology, the “custodial wallet” called Calibra.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBlockchain, but not blockchain\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, let’s do a quick recap of some fundamentals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2008, a person or group calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a method for transacting over the internet without a trusted third party such as a bank. It uses a distributed ledger known as a blockchain and cryptography to maintain a tamper-proof record of ownership of electronic cash – hence the term cryptocurrency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlockchain’s core innovation is to do away with the need for trusted entities like banks. So how do people safely send or receive cryptocurrency? Well, they can use a “cryptocurrency wallet”. A cryptocurrency balance is recorded against a blockchain address. Proving ownership depends on a secret code (or “private key”) known only to the owner. The “wallet” is essentially software that allows people to manage their private keys and authorise transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFacebook has other ideas for its cryptocurrency. The Libra Association says it wants to “\u003ca href\u003d\"https://libra.org/en-US/\"\u003emake sending money as easy and cheap as sending a text message\u003c/a\u003e”. Tapping addresses and secret codes into a wallet interface every time wouldn’t be that easy. These codes can be long – up to 64 characters, compared to 16 for a credit card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class\u003d\"align-center \"\u003e\n \u003cdiv class\u003d\"placeholder-container\" style\u003d\"--aspect-ratio-percent:42.83819628647215%;--background-color:#968a73\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg alt\u003d\"\" class\u003d\"lazyload\" data-src\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/282813/original/file-20190705-51297-eymzk9.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;fit\u003dclip\" data-srcset\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/282813/original/file-20190705-51297-eymzk9.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d257\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/282813/original/file-20190705-51297-eymzk9.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d30\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d257\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/282813/original/file-20190705-51297-eymzk9.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d15\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d257\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/282813/original/file-20190705-51297-eymzk9.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d323\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/282813/original/file-20190705-51297-eymzk9.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d30\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d323\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/282813/original/file-20190705-51297-eymzk9.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d15\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d323\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d3 2262w\" sizes\u003d\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n  \u003cspan class\u003d\"caption\"\u003eCryptocurrency Keys.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class\u003d\"attribution\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"source\"\u003ehttps://en.bitcoinwiki.org/index.php?curid\u003d271198\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Facebook will instead provide a “custodial wallet” – Calibra.

Read more: Facebook\u0027s libra has staggering potential – state control of money could end In the same moment the world is introduced to libra, tensions between the United States and Iran continue to grow, with President Donald Trump increasing US sanctions against Iran. The two are not directly connected, but libra (or other cryptocurrencies) could offer Iran a route round its sanctions. This, of course, is not something Facebook intends – but Iran’s interest in cryptocurrencies could have a serious influence on libra’s future. In their contemporary forms, bitcoin and blockchain have been around for roughly ten years. In this time cryptocurrencies have proliferated wildly. According to the cryptocurrency platform, CoinMarketCap, there are now at least 2,248 different kinds of tokens. Many of these are actively and enthusiastically exchanged and traded by a growing number of people. The recent history of cryptocurrencies, and bitcoin specifically, has not been all that positive. Famously, in 2013, the illicit darknet marketplace Silk Road was shut down following an FBI investigation. The site’s founder, Ross Ulbricht, was imprisoned for life. Silk Road users relied heavily on bitcoin to ensure anonymity, and the libertarian ethos underpinning bitcoin appeared to fit well with Silk Road’s rejection and evasion of authority and regulation. What was so attractive for many about Silk Road, bitcoin and aspects of blockchain technology in general, was the fact that together they enable people to side step the usual legal constraints and regulations that apply online and offline when it comes to financial transactions. The anonymity bitcoin offers enables people to buy and sell just about anything without detection. Read more: The fall of Silk Road isn\u0027t the end for anonymous marketplaces, Tor or bitcoin Silk Road offered a form of freedom to its users they were unlikely to have enjoyed previously. But this, of course, put it at loggerheads with laws and regulations in most countries and jurisdictions. While the Silk Road marketplace is now gone, cryptocurrency and blockchain are attracting more interest than ever before. At the same time governmental oversight of the technology continues to lag behind. Although things may be about to change on that front. Iran has long recognised the benefits of developing capabilities around crypto-assets and blockchain technology to counter US sanctions. This has included attempts to develop its own state-backed cryptocurrency. That Iran might use Facebook’s new cryptocurrency libra to dance around US sanctions, a la Silk Road, is entirely speculative. Given Facebook’s contentious track record on the management of user data in recent years, and the fact that it is yet to convince US lawmakers and financial regulators of the legitimacy of its project, Iran, let alone billions of Facebook users, may not even get a chance to use libra at all. Read more: US-Iran tensions: no route for de-escalation in sight However, the potential for Iran to use libra raises serious questions about the level of control that should be demanded over cryptocurrency use. Robust state or corporate oversight of the technology (or perhaps a troubling blend of the two, as some have argued), could kill, once and for all, the libertarian dream that blockchains and cryptocurrencies have long encapsulated. Facebook may well find stiff opposition to libra based on the vagaries of financial regulations. But it could well face stiffer opposition both politically, from governments who don’t want their foreign policies undermined – and commercially, from users not getting the empowering financial infrastructure they were promised, but, instead, a heavily controlled one. Iran’s interest in cryptocurrencies encapsulates how, in today’s world, the empowerment and transparency that many advocates of cryptocurrencies and blockchains like to think is only a piece of code away is little more than a fantasy. Something always seems to spoil the party. Blockchain has been celebrated as a technology to circumvent authority and regulation – the role of bitcoin in Silk Road and its continued use on the “dark web” since is evidence of this. Put simply, Iran is just another example of wanting to avoid the authorities. But this could be a step too far for authorities. And this could have a serious effect on all cryptocurrencies – not just Facebook’s libra. If the perception in the US and elsewhere is that Iran intends to use the technology, this could require a significant rethink regarding the future of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. It won’t mean the end of them, certainly not. But if this is the moment the technology truly became mainstream, then it could equally be the moment it finally yields to control and regulation – and the end of founder “Satoshi’s vision”.

Now Facebook is launching it’s own cryptocurrency, in association with Visa, MasterCard, Uber and others. The stated aim of Libra is to “enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people”. The announcement has sparked fears that Libra could be a threat to traditional banks, warnings to be cautious, and sceptical commentary of claims that it will help developing countries. But let’s go back to the basics and look at what Libra is, how it compares to other cryptocurrencies and whether you should be concerned about using it when it eventually arrives. Read more: With cryptocurrency launch, Facebook sets its path toward becoming an independent nation Currency is a system of money that is commonly used in exchange for goods and services and, as a result, holds value. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that are secured using cryptography. The more popular recent cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology which uses a cryptographic structure that is difficult to change. One of the key properties of this structure is a distributed ledger that keeps account of financial transactions, which anyone can access. Libra is a new currency that is being proposed by Facebook. It’s considered a cryptocurrency because cryptography will be used to help protect the value of the currency from tampering – such as double spending – and to protect the payment process. Libra has the potential to become successful because of the backing from the Libra Association, which is made up of large international corporations such as Facebook, Uber and Vodafone. MasterCard and Visa have also thrown their hats in the ring, but no traditional banks are on the list. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are quite egalitarian in nature. That’s because there is no single authority that verifies transactions between parties, so anyone could potentially do it. To authorise a Bitcoin transaction you would have to prove that you have done the work, known as a “proof of work”. For Bitcoin, the proof of work is to solve a mathematical puzzle. People who successfully solve the puzzle (proving they have done some work), can add transactions to the blockchain distributed ledger and are rewarded with Bitcoins. The process is known as mining. The good thing about this is that it reduces fraud. Since anyone can potentially mine Bitcoins, it’s harder to collude as you wouldn’t know who the next person to mine a coin would be. And it’s simple to verify that the person is authorised because anyone can check that the puzzle has been solved correctly. Based on the initial descriptions of the currency, it sounds like the difference with Libra is that it will verify transactions using a consensus system known as “proof of stake”, or a variation of this method. Under this system, transactions would be authorised by a group of people who have a stake or ownership in the currency. This makes it easier to predict who the next person to authorise a transaction might be (since there are a relatively small number of authorising group members), and then collude to launder funds without other group members knowing. It appears the criteria to become a founding member of the Libra Association is to contribute a minimum of US$10 million entrance fee, have a large amount of money in the bank and be able to influence a large number of people. Read more: Is Facebook today\u0027s Compuserve? How Libra could hasten its demise Cryptocurrencies affect governments and tax systems since they have little to no transaction costs when money is transferred across borders. So while the low transaction costs would be good for everyday users, the advent of a new cryptocurrency with a potentially very large user base has governments and traditional banks very concerned. While Libra is open source – meaning the source code is available for all to view, use and modify – it’s the members of the association who will be overseeing the currency. Libra could herald a shift away from traditional government taxes and banking fees to a new international monetary system controlled by corporate entities like Facebook and Uber. That’s a concern because of the lack of oversight from regulatory bodies. The backing of software giants means it’s likely that the user interface for Libra coins would be smooth and simple to use. Low transaction costs would benefit users and the Libra Association promises to control the value of the currency so that it does not fluctuate as much as other cryptocurrencies. It’s unclear how they plan to do this. But value stability would be a great advantage in times of uncertainty. The everyday consumer probably wouldn’t know the difference between the “proof of work” and the “proof of stake” mechanisms. But since Facebook has a large database of users that are known to use Libra, it may be able to link Libra transactions to individuals. This could be a privacy concern. (Bitcoin transactions are anonymous because account numbers used in Bitcoin transactions are not linked to an individual’s identity.) Recent cybersecurity breaches have contributed to a growing awareness of the vulnerabilities of IT systems. As with all software, the Libra implementation and management could be vulnerable to attack, which in turn could mean users could lose their money. But that is a risk that all cryptocurrency users face, whether they are aware of it or not.

Make sure you keep your password safe by making sure it is complicated and hard to guess. Look for applications that allow you to use two-factor authentication and make sure it’s turned on.

Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that are secured using cryptography.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more popular recent cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology which uses a cryptographic structure that is difficult to change. One of the key properties of this structure is a distributed ledger that keeps account of financial transactions, which anyone can access.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Libra?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLibra is a new currency that is being proposed by Facebook. It’s considered a cryptocurrency because cryptography will be used to help protect the value of the currency from tampering – such as double spending – and to protect the payment process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLibra has the potential to become successful because of the backing from the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://libra.org/en-US/association-council-principles/#overview\"\u003eLibra Association\u003c/a\u003e, which is made up of large international corporations such as Facebook, Uber and Vodafone. MasterCard and Visa have also thrown their hats in the ring, but no traditional banks are on the list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat’s different about Libra compared with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are quite egalitarian in nature. That’s because there is no single authority that verifies transactions between parties, so anyone could potentially do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo authorise a Bitcoin transaction you would have to prove that you have done the work, known as a “\u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work\"\u003eproof of work\u003c/a\u003e”. For Bitcoin, the proof of work is to solve a mathematical puzzle. People who successfully solve the puzzle (proving they have done some work), can add transactions to the blockchain distributed ledger and are rewarded with Bitcoins. The process is known as mining.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good thing about this is that it reduces fraud. Since anyone can potentially mine Bitcoins, it’s harder to collude as you wouldn’t know who the next person to mine a coin would be. And it’s simple to verify that the person is authorised because anyone can check that the puzzle has been solved correctly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBased on the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://mashable.com/article/facebook-libra-deep-dive/\"\u003einitial descriptions of the currency\u003c/a\u003e, it sounds like the difference with Libra is that it will verify transactions using a consensus system known as “\u003ca href\u003d\"https://blockgeeks.com/guides/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake/\"\u003eproof of stake\u003c/a\u003e”, or a variation of this method. Under this system, transactions would be authorised by a group of people who have a stake or ownership in the currency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis makes it easier to predict who the next person to authorise a transaction might be (since there are a relatively small number of authorising group members), and then collude to launder funds without other group members knowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/2019/06/18/how-to-become-a-founding-member-of-the-libra-association/\"\u003eappears\u003c/a\u003e the criteria to become a founding member of the Libra Association is to contribute a minimum of US$10 million entrance fee, have a large amount of money in the bank and be able to influence a large number of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e Read more: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/is-facebook-todays-compuserve-how-libra-could-hasten-its-demise-119213\"\u003eIs Facebook today\u0027s Compuserve?

To stem the crisis, the World Food Programme (WFP) of the United Nations introduced an electronic voucher system to distribute food aid. People are given debit cards loaded with “e-vouchers” that they can use in certain shops to buy food. But we found that Syrian refugees living in rural Lebanon often have to make difficult choices when buying essential items at the expense of food. Their e-vouchers can only be used in exchange for food, not other essentials like nappies. Refugees have to engage in “grey-area transactions” that work around the e-voucher system, by asking shop owners to sell them the nappies and instead record on the system that they bought food. This places refugees in a vulnerable position – shop owners often charge higher prices for scanning non-food items as food, but refugees have no choice but to depend on shop owners to cooperate. Collective purchasing allows refugees to pool their cash and e-vouchers so that one person can buy non-food items for another and be repaid with food. This allows people a degree of autonomy – they don’t have to rely on shop owners to allow them to buy non-food items using their vouchers. Instead, the community can manage their resources and needs among themselves. Unfortunately, the e-voucher system prevents refugees from buying goods in bulk. Shop owners are advised by the WFP that purchases by refugees should be typical of buying food for a family. If refugees want to buy enough rice for their community and benefit from a wholesale discount, then the shop owner can refuse the transaction. This makes collective purchasing – something refugees often prefer to do when they have cash available – more difficult. The WFP is currently piloting blockchain technology to replace this e-voucher system in Jordan and Pakistan. This is an exciting opportunity to alleviate these problems and help to empower both refugees and the shop owners, but only if the refugees themselves are involved. Rather than using a debit card, under this new system refugees would have a digital wallet that is similar to a bank account that you can access online. And instead of it being hosted by a bank, it’s part of the blockchain. A blockchain is a shared log of transactions, with each user being able to track how much money and goods have been exchanged. This is constantly updated as transactions of food aid and money transfers are agreed between the customer and the shop owner. Each transaction forms a block of new information. The digital ledger is an expanding chain of interconnected blocks of information – hence the name, blockchain. Read more: Beyond Bitcoin: how blockchains can empower communities to control their own energy supply The WFP is using blockchain technology to cut costs on currency exchange and bank transfers. But the blockchain still allows transactions between refugees and shop owners in the same manner as the e-voucher system. If this new and innovative technology mimics the model that came before, the restrictions on what refugees can do will continue and blockchain will mimic paternalistic aid models that focus on efficiently distributing aid, rather than empowering refugees to leverage their own ways of coping with food insecurity. But if aid is designed with input from refugee communities, the technology could give Syrian people in Lebanon more agency when buying the essentials they need to live. Blockchain can write smart contracts, which would allow people to buy items together. These are agreements whose terms are automatically enforced by an algorithm. Smart contracts act like a lock box with two keys that can be used to open it, one key is given for each party involved in the contract. When the smart contract is created, both parties set the conditions that need to be met for them to be able to use the keys to open the lock box. Both keys need to be used for the lock box to open and for the money to transfer to complete the transaction. Before this can happen, both parties must agree that the conditions of the contract have been met. With this, refugee communities can negotiate collective purchases with shop owners and hold them accountable to the agreements they make. Negotiating the terms of the smart contract means that refugees have more of a say over what they consider to be a fair deal. Once the smart contract is in place, the agreed sum of money for the purchase will be placed in a digital wallet – the lock box – that is bound by the terms of the smart contract. The value of items purchased by refugees is deducted once they’ve verified their identity with a retina scan, but the money will only be released to the shop owner if the refugees verify that they received the items. We saw how these smart contracts could rebalance the power disparity between refugees and shop owners. Including refugees in the design process of humanitarian technologies and aid models can ensure they incorporate the values and practices of the people they’re supposed to help. Future innovations must be rooted in the daily lives of refugee communities. These technologies can empower people and make a real difference to their lives, but only if they’re allowed to design how they work.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Reem Talhouk, Andy Garbett, Kyle Montague, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-06-26T12:36:26Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIn Lebanon, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.unhcr.org/en-my/50a9f817b.pdf\"\u003earound 350,000 Syrian refugees\u003c/a\u003e don’t have access to enough safe and nutritious food.

It does not recognise cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in this way, even if communities of enthusiasts have been treating them as a means of exchange for over a decade now. Yet the latest addition to this group, Facebook’s libra, threatens to do something that no other cryptocurrencies have come close to achieving: the state monopoly over the control and issuance of money is now under serious threat. Facebook boasts over half the world population as active monthly users: 2.2 billion on Facebook, 0.8 billion on Instagram and 0.7 billion on WhatsApp. Combined with the fact that 1.7 billion adults worldwide have no bank accounts, a project like this is the perfect petri dish in which to create a truly global currency. The independent Libra Council that Facebook proposes to oversee this new currency from Geneva will become nothing short of a quasi central bank. Consisting of 27 giant corporates plus Facebook, it will vet aspiring applicants who wish to join their ranks for a fee of US$10m (£7.9m); as well as manage the reserve of state currencies and short-term government bonds that will back the libra. This model is very different to the likes of bitcoin, whose exchange rate is driven purely by the supply and demand. In contrast, the Libra Council would be competing in global currency wars against other nation states. Imagine ten years from now if, say, 40% of all US dollars are held on deposit by Facebook/the council to back the issued libra coins, which have by now become widely used across the world. We can hypothesise that US dollars might constitute a 30% weight of libra’s asset-backing basket – to have a steady exchange rate for libra, the idea is to underpin it with a selection of stable and widely traded financial assets. In the likely event that the US experiences a moderate, or even severe economic crisis, Facebook/the council would need to rebalance the basket of assets to defend the value of libra. Let’s say they decided to revise down the US dollar weighting in their reserve to 25% of the basket. This would involve selling huge sums of US dollars and replacing them with, say, euros, and would significantly drive down the value of the dollar. This would be a very negative market signal, encouraging other holders of dollars to dump them as well, thereby exacerbating the fall. And even before this happened, Facebook could potentially use the mere threat as leverage in negotiating with nation states on matters of regulation, taxation and so on. Based on Facebook’s current revenues, it would already be 90th in the world by GDP if it was a nation state, so its power to face off in negotiations with states and trading blocs is formidable even without libra. Read more: Libra: four reasons to be extremely cautious about Facebook\u0027s new currency How do nation states control a global company with unprecedented access to their citizens’ data, its own currency, and perhaps the ability to affect their domestic politics and the strength of their currency on the global markets? It sounds tricky to put it mildly. And by the way, it’s not only Facebook that is entering this space. JP Morgan has just launched a cryptocurrency for institutional customers, while 13 other global investment banks are planning to follow suit with currencies in 2020. Samsung is rumoured to be looking at launching a currency for ordinary customers, while it would not be surprising if other online giants like Amazon and Google were tempted, too. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England and chairman of the Financial Stability Board, told the G20 in 2018 that cryptocurrencies didn’t pose a systemic risk to the global financial system. His assessment might have been based on their current footprint rather than their potential. In fact, the blockchain technology that underpins new currencies like libra has astonishing potential. The ability to significantly move exchange rates is only part of it: if people buy and sell with these currencies, save with them, trade with them, demand for state currencies and bonds could plunge. This would undermine the ability of central banks and governments to buy and sell these assets to set national interest rates. It would emasculate this vital means of managing our economies, leaving only fiscal levers like taxing and spending at the disposal of states. What then? Of course, such a seismic shift in our control of the use of money would first require these new currencies to be widely adopted. Yet the genie has been out of the bottle since the arrival of cryptocurrencies – it will be very difficult to stop it now. If this space comes to be dominated by big listed companies like Facebook and JP Morgan, it is at least arguably preferable to alternatives like bitcoin which are almost unfettered in having no geographic or tax domicile and being pseudo-anonymous in nature. A currency like libra also has the potential to reduce consumer transaction speeds, improve transparency and allow users to store their wealth digitally using a “trusted” consortium of founding institutions. And when it comes to future geopolitical shocks like Brexit, consumers will be able to shield themselves more easily by reducing their exposure to, say, the British pound by holding their wealth in libra or whatever instead. Arguably we are talking about a superior type of money that is better aligned to a younger generation that is comfortable with such new forms of money. Notwithstanding, we need to come to terms with the size of this potential change and its ramifications: Facebook’s impact on our societies has been profound over the previous two decades, and libra may well eclipse that accomplishment. Facebook’s founding mantra of “move fast and break things” seems entirely consistent with the strategy for this currency. The American futurist Stewart Brand famously said that “once a technology rolls over you, if you’re not part of the steamroller, you’re part of the road”. Well, nation states appear not to have been invited to get on board this particular steamroller. That leaves a lot of vulnerable road – watch closely to see what they try and do about it in the months ahead.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Gavin Brown, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-06-26T11:14:56Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe UN \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/how-many-currencies-are-in-the-world.html\"\u003erecognises\u003c/a\u003e 180 currencies worldwide as legal tender, all of them issued by nation states.

How Libra could hasten its demise","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"When Mark Zuckerberg was five years old in 1989, two dominant players in telecommunications made a big announcement. Compuserve (the first major commercial online service provider) and MCI Mail (one of the first commercial e-mail service providers) introduced commercial e-mail relays to the public internet. These relays connected their centralized networks to the public, outside of their direct control. Facebook’s announcement of entering the distributed trust era with Libra, a new cryptocurrency, is the modern-day equivalent. And it’s likely to have the same result. Launched in 1969, Compuserve was an innovator in shared computing. In 1979, it launched Micronet, the first consumer e-mail system. This was quickly followed in 1980 with CB Simulator, the first real-time online chat service. Compuserve quickly added a wide range of consumer information services such as weather, stock quotes and discussion forums. It tied people together globally through its its centrally owned worldwide network. By 1991, Compuserve had more than 500,000 simultaneous online users. In 1995, it was the largest online service with over three million users. It has since been called the “Google of the ‘80s.” But the big difference is that its network was private and centrally controlled. It was not an open network like the public internet. Early coverage of Compuserve and MCI’s gateways described the relatively unknown internet as a worldwide research network of government agencies, universities and commercial firms. This started to legitimize commercial uses of the internet for the general public, but was not without its controversies at the time. Overall, the relays announcement helped give legitimacy and publicity to the emerging public commercial internet. It started the path to weakening the centralized power of Compuserve and MCI. At first, the cutting-edge announcement by Compuserve and MCI gave them an advantage. It also gave them the opportunity to shape some of the initial public conceptions of the public internet. Traditional industries started coming online, giving further legitimacy to internet commerce. But these organizations were designed in a time of centralized control. Their model of charging consumers was based on usage. Compuserve stuck with that old model and as late as 1994 they still charged 15 cents per Internet e-mail received — including for spam. The shift to more distributed production models, where content was produced by people outside of the organization, was a new world. Many, including Compuserve and MCI, eventually lost power to be replaced by new organizations designed for this new content production model. In 1994, a New York Times piece suggested “…it makes more economic sense to forget Compuserve and get an Internet account, where mail is free.” This eventually led to the growth of many modern-day platform companies such as Facebook (created in 2003) and Uber (founded in 2009). Such organizations became dominant powerful companies very quickly, disrupting every major industry. The transition to the Information Age created new distributed business models. Modern platform organizations operate with a business model focused on dominating a central, powerful matchmaking role. The Facebook platform matches advertisers with eyeballs, for example. The Uber model matches riders with drivers.

And so the venture capital funding model focuses on building rapid, sustainable growth of these trusted middlemen. Much of the modern Silicon Valley success story is built around this simple logic. This evolutionary process parallels the recent emergence of what are known as distributed trust technologies such as blockchain. The public internet shifted from central control to a shared infrastructure with distributed production. Now centralized trust is shifting to a shared infrastructure with distributed trust. Distributed trust technologies displace middlemen in transactions, and make us question the role of centralized organizations. Instead of trusting central organizations, people place their trust in the technology itself. Read more: Beyond Bitcoin: The power struggle over trust-based technology The previous disruptors are being disrupted themselves. Facebook’s Libra partners (including Uber, Ebay, Paypal, Spotify, Visa, and Mastercard) read like a Who’s Who of middlemen organizations that are being threatened with disruption by distributed trust. Organizational theory shows that when market conditions change drastically, organizational inertia can give an advantage to new companies or institutions. Old dogs have a hard time learning new tricks. So it’s no surprise that Libra is entering the space with a “permissioned” model of trust. Such models centralize decision power with a select few — the initial Libra partners. They are not truly distributed trust models. They are closer to the distributed production models so familiar to major dominant platforms of the last technological wave. On top of that, Facebook will separately offer a proprietary centrally controlled wallet, Calibra, to facilitate Libra transactions. Read more: Facebook claims Libra offers economic empowerment to billions – an economist is skeptical The Libra white paper promises an eventual relaxing of that centralized control to a “permissionless” model. But it offers no realistic path or requirement to do so. It asks participants to “trust us” that a truly distributed trust model will come in the future. History suggests Facebook’s introduction of Libra will ultimately help legitimize distributed trust technologies. Major players endorsing Libra adds legitimacy to distributed trust technologies. The initial actions of Compuserve and MCI Mail led to government legislation. The increased focus on distributed trust generated by Libra will too. Part of this is due to past breaches of trust by Facebook. In fact, there are already calls for regulation in the United States, Europe and Australia. Regulations and public discourse will help to bring further legitimacy to distributed trust models. Regulators should be cautious about biasing legislation to favour incumbents, however, and ensure an open evolution of the true capabilities of distributed trust. Such legitimacy reduces the major barriers to new business models built on a shared, distributed trust infrastructure. This creates a major opportunity for new forms of organizing designed without the burdens of past organizational inertia. There is a good chance that Libra’s partners will gain short-term power with this move. Technology diffusion processes can reward first movers. But those companies were not initially designed to survive in such distributed trust models, and are plagued by organizational inertia. So the creation of Libra, and the legitimacy it will give to the underlying technologies, paradoxically will ultimately speed the demise of the very same organizations. Bitcoin’s price, for example, has soared since the Libra announcement, even though Bitcoin itself is likely to be eventually disrupted by others. The stars of the modern, platform-based internet are likely to eventually join the ranks of Compuserve and MCI Mail. They will be replaced with the next generation of organizing designed for these new models of distributed trust — and not burdened by the inertia of the centrally controlled past. Perhaps Facebook is the Compuserve of 2019.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Marc-David L.

BeefLedger, a QUT research project with a focus on blockchain and agtech (agricultural technology), tells a different story. It turns out the project generates jobs not usually associated with rural and regional Australia. BeefLedger is a two-year A$1.5 million project that set out to track and protect the authenticity of Australian beef in the rapidly growing Chinese market. It also shows, though, that blockchain and agtech can generate jobs in the creative industries in regional Australia, too. The Australian beef industry is worth more than A$13 billion a year. Around 75% of its output is exported. Yet demand from markets like China will soon exceed our supply capacity. And that opens a door to food fraud, a A$40 billion-a-year problem globally. Food fraud is reducing Australia’s brand value in China. Led by QUT with funding from the Food Agility CRC and industry partners, BeefLedger is designed to protect Australia’s brand integrity by fighting food fraud. As well as verifying food provenance, it eases cross-border logistics and payments. It does this by creating an integrated blockchain-enabled beef provenance and smart contract platform. BeefLedger engages producer communities in rural Australia in new ways. BeefLedger is working with the District Council of Grant and Mount Gambier High School to develop digital video stories about the Limestone Coast and Mount Gambier region. By producing authentic local content that showcases food provenance to consumers, the project opens up regionally branded export opportunities in the Chinese market. This creative content will be used across various platforms to strengthen the brand authenticity of Limestone Coast beef in the Chinese market. Farmers collaborate with students producing this content. In turn, BeefLedger adds value and benefit to the local community.  The students visit farms and feedlots to learn about digital farming (agtech), the Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics. BeefLedger engages students in agricultural science, data visualisation, creative storytelling, and food provenance narrative branding. They also learn about Chinese culture, including food and media consumption practices such as WeChat. Read more: Explainer: what\u0027s the difference between STEM and STEAM? Could a technology and innovation initiative such as BeefLedger become an example of how to arrest the brain drain of young people to metropolitan cities? Might such new career prospects be an incentive even for city slickers to consider regional Australia as their new home? There are about as many opinions as there are experts. – Erin Winick The desire to eliminate middlemen has been around for as long as there have been middlemen. Calling this desire disintermediation has gained currency with the rise of blockchain and other distributed ledger technology. The removal of intermediaries in a supply chain is said to enable frictionless capitalism, where producers have a more direct relationship with consumers. This supposedly leads to more profit for producers and a better deal for consumers. The future of work in a blockchain world remains contested. Some have estimated that blockchain and smart contracts could make 30–60% of jobs redundant. Rebuttals of these dire predictions point to new jobs and new businesses being created. Rather than thinking of disintermediation as killing jobs, we find consumer culture and expectations are creating new ones. Nowhere is this more evident than in the creative industries.  Originally, cultural intermediaries were identified mostly as advertisers and marketers. Today, they are a growing profession filling a range of roles: arts managers, curators and promoters, fashion, food and lifestyle gurus, journalists, DJs and online product reviewers. In China, the latter have become social influencers in an industry worth more than A$12 billion. But when you ask a cultural intermediary what their job is, they are more likely to say: “I am a brand manager / curator / arts worker,” and not, “I am a cultural intermediary.” Cultural intermediation is a theoretical construct to describe a wide range of existing and emerging occupations. The generalisation of entrepreneurialism in neoliberal societies into so many different occupations and areas of practice – the bootstrapping ethos of not searching for but creating one’s job – goes a considerable way to making everyone an intermediary whether they want to be or not. – Peter Conlin We are seeing a third wave of socially engaged cultural intermediaries in the creative city. This includes facilitators, enablers, community workers, activists and social entrepreneurs. It often includes those working in not-for-profit and non-government organisations. The cultural intermediation at play in the BeefLedger project entails brokerage, lateral thinking, conceptual reordering and dot-joining people and community assets. This is the craft so many professionals in the creative industries practise every day just to get a gig: applied creativity. Intermediation and disintermediation cannot be reduced to a simple binary of good or bad. Nor should our understanding of them be confined to sales, marketing or e-commerce. Our work on the BeefLedger project applies creativity across the persistent silos of the 3Cs – Community, Culture and Commerce – towards mutually beneficial results. In fact, digital technology such as blockchain may soon increase demand for professional cultural intermediaries. They bring an ability to articulate commercial aims and objectives in creative and community terms. This then enables a more holistic integration of business, social and regional agendas.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Marcus Foth, John (Jock) McQueenie, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-06-12T20:16:22Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eDigital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are said to make many jobs redundant due to automation.

Technological development in the production of alternative energy has also speeded up the emergence of decentralised systems. These build on large numbers of actors who generate small quantities of energy. But for a decentralised system to be sustainable, a flexible grid is required to accommodate variable renewable energy sources. A flexible grid also enables operators of the electricity system to balance demand and supply. A decentralised energy system also requires an exchange mechanism to link buyers and sellers. In South Africa, the state utility Eskom currently fulfils this role. It effectively acts as a central clearing house. It does this by buying electricity from renewable power projects, adding it to its own generated energy and selling it to consumers. But there are technologies being developed that could do away with the need for a clearing house like this. One is a distributed ledger technology, of which blockchain is an example. The use of this technology would allow small-scale transactions between buyers and sellers to be captured and recorded. In this way, it could facilitate the development of small-scale electricity trading markets. Blockchain has been identified as one of the pivotal technologies alongside Artificial intelligence, Internet of things and Big Data. Interest in applying the blockchain technology to energy markets is slowly picking up. In South Africa 15.6% of the households are not connected to an electricity supply. This is unlikely to change in the near future with centralised power production because it requires major investments to extend power lines to remote communities. For these communities, having their own decentralised grid solutions holds tremendous economic potential. The good news is that South Africa is one of the most suitable places to harness the energy of the sun and convert it to electricity through photovoltaics. The prices for panels have reduced significantly and can be mounted on every shack. Individual storage solutions in contrast are currently unaffordable. So, the ability to sell excess electricity would be ideal. The creation of markets where households can sell their excess electricity would also stimulate demand for photovoltaics across rural Africa. In this way households producing electricity through photovoltaic panels on their rooftops can trade their excess electricity and buy electricity when needed. These trades can be recorded by the blockchain. The exchange mechanism would not be based on South African rands. Instead, the traded electricity units would be converted directly into a blockchain-based crypto-currency. The blockchain currency could then be converted into vouchers to pay for government services or to repay the loans taken to install the photovoltaic panels. In this way blockchain would replace both the current billing and the trading systems. If households see the economic benefit and start installing more capacity than needed by the immediate community, aggregators might bundle up the power generation to respond to demand and sell it again directly to other consumers. These consumers could include nearby factories. For photovoltaic to contribute to the grid security, PV plants must be run by operating systems that allow for better interaction with the electricity grid. They must be able to interact with other renewable energy sources and storage systems. Despite considerable process, these required systems are still under development. If South Africa positions itself well, it could become a test bed for these technologies and thereby benefit from investments in research and development by major international corporations that have an interest in driving these trial runs. The integration of distributed ledger technologies into energy trading would be a logical next step for South Africa. Already in 2011, the National Energy Regulator of South Africa allowed municipalities to connect to their networks small-scale embedded generation of under 100 kW. Two years later, the updated integrated resource plan stressed the need for adaptive energy investments. In particular, rooftop solar PV was identified as an interesting source of energy. The move to a decentralised electricity market with distributed ledger blockchain technology at its core will take much longer in the West. By some estimates as long as 25 years. This is because of their deeply integrated electricity markets and legal systems that can’t be changed easily to create the necessary environment. Nevertheless, interest in attractive reward systems for individual producers is also rising in Europe. On the other hand developing countries might have an advantage. Countries, including South Africa, which have sections of their populations not connected to the electric grid, could make the transition to decentralised electricity markets much quicker. This points to the possibility that the distributed ledger technologies might follow the same path as the diffusion of mobile phones across the African continent. This would enable ways for alternative energy technologies to leapfrog the expensive centralised grid systems. But the transition to decentralised electricity production and trading markets won’t necessarily be smooth. One of the biggest challenges in getting blockchain applications up and running is trust. In most countries consumers have already built trust in the centralised institutions. Not so in South Africa where trust in Eskom is in negative territory. Given this state of affairs, the country could take advantage of the power utility’s challenge by increasing the use of technology in the rural areas and so turning sunshine into income.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Thomas Wolfgang Thurner, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-06-02T09:32:38Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe way energy is produced and distributed is changing rapidly as the industry moves away from carbon-based energy production.

For these communities, having their own decentralised grid solutions holds tremendous economic potential.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe good news is that South Africa is one of the most suitable places to harness the energy of the sun and convert it to electricity through photovoltaics.

The exchange mechanism would not be based on South African rands. Instead, the traded electricity units would be converted directly into a blockchain-based crypto-currency. The blockchain currency could then be converted into vouchers to pay for government services or to repay the loans taken to install the photovoltaic panels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this way blockchain would replace both the current billing and the trading systems. If households see the economic benefit and start installing more capacity than needed by the immediate community, aggregators might bundle up the power generation to respond to demand and sell it again directly to other consumers.

One of the biggest challenges in getting blockchain applications up and running is trust. In most countries consumers have already built trust in the centralised institutions. Not so in South Africa where trust in Eskom is in negative territory. Given this state of affairs, the country could take advantage of the power utility’s challenge by increasing the use of technology in the rural areas and so turning sunshine into income.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"LINK":"https://theconversation.com/cryptocurrencies-are-finally-going-mainstream-the-battle-is-on-to-bring-them-under-global-control-117112","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"The Conversation","IMAGE":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/274363/original/file-20190514-60557-38cbgs.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026rect\u003d296%2C0%2C1514%2C1514\u0026q\u003d45\u0026auto\u003dformat\u0026w\u003d240\u0026h\u003d240\u0026fit\u003dcrop","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Cryptocurrencies are finally going mainstream – the battle is on to bring them under global control","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"The 21st-century revolutionaries who have dominated cryptocurrencies are having to move over. Mainstream financial institutions are adopting these assets and the blockchain technology that enables them, in what is perhaps the most profound development since the birth of cryptocurrencies through the launch of bitcoin a decade ago. JP Morgan Chase has been leading the way, having announced JPM Coin earlier this year, the first cryptocurrency issued by a big international bank. When trials begin in the coming months, each JPM Coin will be redeemable for one US dollar, protecting this cryptocurrency from the volatility characteristic of the likes of bitcoin. One of the main reasons for JP Morgan launching these coins is to offer large corporate clients a way of making international payments in real time. This could gradually replace the current global interbank funds transfer network known as SWIFT, whose wire transfer payments can sometimes take a whole business day to settle. A few weeks later, the IMF and World Bank jointly announced the launch of Learning Coin, a private blockchain and quasi-cryptocurrency designed to help them better understand the technology. Facebook, too, was reported to be interested in launching a cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, financial firm 20|30 became the first company to float on a mainstream regulated trading platform using blockchains, when it issued shares in the form of “equity tokens” similar to a cryptocurrency on the London Stock Exchange. It is all a far cry from the rationale for creating bitcoins and blockchains in the first place: to decentralise finance away from the dollar-dominated system of fiat currencies and to gradually render financial institutions obsolete. Yet this space remains attractive to those seeking to undermine US financial hegemony. Iran and Russia are both looking at launching state-backed cryptocurrencies, in response to US threats to disconnect them from the SWIFT payments system. This would enable these countries to join other blockchain-based payment networks, with the potential to steadily weaken the international payments system. Other threats to global finance from cryptocurrencies abound. Services making it easier to conceal their movement, such as cryptocurrency tumblers, are said to be enabling fraudulent activities. There is growing evidence that cryptocurrencies are financing terrorism; while they are supposedly also vulnerable to rogue states – the UN recently accused North Korea of stealing US$571m (£441m) from five cryptocurrency exchanges in Asia. When you combine these concerns with the steady shift of cryptocurrencies towards the mainstream, it makes many observers very nervous: cryptocurrencies still represent well below 1% of global trading, but they are growing fast. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which oversees international banking, recently warned that cryptocurrencies were a risk to global financial stability, and advised banks to look at their direct and indirect exposure and protect themselves. Cryptocurrency regulation remains a very grey area. These assets are traded on two types of platforms, known as centralised and decentralised exchanges. Centralised exchanges, such as Coinbase or Robinhood, are platforms for connecting buyers and sellers, which enable them to buy or sell digital currencies either for other digital currencies or fiat currencies. The platform takes a fee for each transaction, and the amount of regulation varies from country to country. On decentralised exchanges, such as Block DX, traders sell cryptocurrencies directly between one another. These comprise a much smaller proportion of trading, and tend to be unregulated. They are harder to control – not least because much of the activity occurs on the dark net. The Financial Actions Task Force (FATF), the global standard setter against financial crime, is working towards global regulation of cryptocurrences on centralised exchanges. It recently met with industry representatives from around the world as part of a consultation to finalise global standards. This will inform proposals for regulation due to be announced by the FATF in June. One major aspect is Regulatory Technology (RegTech), which refers to technology that makes it possible to identify cryptocurrency activities such as the identities of traders doing transactions on blockchains. It will be interesting to see what the FATF has to say next month about the adoption of a RegTech global standard, which many would argue is crucial to making cryptocurrencies more transparent. On many other regulatory issues, the world remains a patchwork. France, for example, is looking at banning cryptocurrencies known as privacy coins, which are designed to make it particularly difficult to trace their owners. Ireland has amended its Anti-Money Laundering Bill to include cryptocurrencies, while the UK is moving in a similar direction – going beyond the existing relevant EU regulations. Japan, seen as a world leader on crypto regulation, is introducing new rules capping the amount that traders can borrow from exchanges to trade cryptocurrencies. Mexico and Canada are also looking at regulating cryptocurrency exchanges. The US, meanwhile, recently issued a clarification of the status of cryptocurrencies issued through initial coin offerings. Germany is planning to regulate these, too. These moves are welcome but hardly sufficient in global terms. A single country can impose tough standards on its cryptocurrency exchanges, but when transactions involve another exchange located in another country with no regulation, there’s nothing the domestic authorities in the first country can do to track payments once they have been transferred. Equally, you don’t have to go too far to find holes in the system: the EU regulations on money laundering don’t cater for tumbler services, for instance. Bringing enough countries onboard to make a major difference is not going to be straightforward, particularly with so much acrimony between Russia, China and the West at present. For global regulation to be far-reaching, it would also need to include the entire system – including decentralised exchanges, but they appear to be too problematic to focus on at the moment. All the same, there is clearly a growing desire to take the wildness out of blockchains and cryptocurrencies. These technologies are only going to become more mainstream; and the greater their share of the global economy, the greater their threat to the system as a whole. At least as far as centralised exchanges are concerned, the days of cryptocurrencies ruled by romantic buccaneers and pirates are slowly coming to an end.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Iwa Salami, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-05-16T12:06:55Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe 21st-century revolutionaries who have dominated cryptocurrencies are having to move over.

A single country can impose tough standards on its cryptocurrency exchanges, but when transactions involve another exchange located in another country with no regulation, there’s nothing the domestic authorities in the first country can do to track payments once they have been transferred.

It’s an essential metal for batteries in phones and laptops. There’s also a chance the cobalt was mined by slaves. Almost two-thirds of the cobalt mined around the world comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The central African country has a notorious recent history of human rights abuses, including slave labour. Right now it is all but impossible to know if cobalt from the country is slave-free. It’s the same around the world for many other commodities, from tuna to coffee. Some businesses see a solution in blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, to verify global supply chains. It is the latest promise for a technology that is touted as a solution for unregulated prison economies, climate change and counterfeiting. Maybe it will prove part of the solution. But we can’t put all our hopes on any technology solving a complex social problem. Figuring out if goods are sourced and produced ethically gets increasingly difficult as supply chains become more complex. In the case of cobalt, the supply chain can consist of countless middlemen who buy and mix cobalt from countless different mines. This means it is almost impossible for a cobalt buyer such as a battery maker to trace where the metal comes from. The DRC’s cobalt industry encompasses a wide range of working conditions. Some miners are paid relatively well and work in safe conditions. But around a fifth of the cobalt is dug up by about 110,000 to 150,000 workers in small “artisanal” mines. Those who work in this unregulated sector often earn a pittance and work in unsafe conditions. Working in such mines includes descending into small hand-dug holes that defy even basic safety precautions. Poor construction and ventilation have led to injuries and deaths. As sales of electric cars swells demand for cobalt, these conditions are worsening. It is difficult to know exactly what proportion of the DRC’s cobalt industry uses slave labour. But a 2013 investigation by the Washington-based organisation Free the Slaves, found 866 of the 931 individuals interviewed in three mining communities were slaves. The report identified seven types of slavery, including forced labour and debt bondage. Almost one in four slaves was under 18 years of age. A 2014 report by UNICEF estimated 40,000 children were working in mines in DRC’s south, most of them digging cobalt. It is not just cobalt. The same is true of everything from copper to cocoa. It is hard to know how products are made or where they are sourced from. So how can we ensure supply chains are not tainted by modern slavery? This is where companies are experimenting with blockchain technology. To understand their interest, let’s recap the basics of this technology. Think of blockchain as an online public ledger. Once a transaction occurs, a permanent and unchangeable record of that transaction is created and has to be validated by others in the blockchain. These records are called “blocks” and are chained together chronologically. Blockchain technology can therefore be used to create a verified and tamper-proof record of supply chains from source to end user. The World Wildlife Fund is working with technology partners and a tuna fishing company to use blockchain technology to track tuna from “bait to plate”. A consumer will be able to find out when and where the tuna was caught by scanning a code on the packaging. Read more: Almost every brand of tuna on supermarket shelves shows why modern slavery laws are needed BHP wants to use it to verify copper supplies. Blockchain is also being used to track cotton, fashion, coffee and organically farmed products. Ford and IBM are part of the consortium looking to use the technology to monitor cobalt supplies. It would mean the ability to track the metal from mine to battery. Ethically mined cobalt can be recorded in the blockchain and followed as it moves around the supply chain. While blockchain is promising, we need to address several challenges if it is going to work. A crucial element in any blockchain is the “consensus protocol”. This determines who gets to validate a transaction, whether it be all participants, a majority, a select few or a random selection. In a blockchain dedicated to ethical sourcing it is crucial that workers can attest to their working conditions. There is no guarantee this will happen, especially for marginalised or oppressed workers. Second, it is important to know what standard for ethical sourcing a blockchain upholds. There are several blockchain platforms, so different, potentially less robust, standards could easily develop. This is an issue for other areas of ethical certification, where competing schemes for goods such as coffee exist. Third, we should always question the link between a “block” and its material reality. Finding a way to insert goods made using slave labour into the blockchain would be highly lucrative. Since the integrity of blockchain data depends on humans, it is vulnerable to inaccuracies or fraud. Fourth, blockchain may create a “digital divide”. Larger suppliers with technical experience will have less trouble using this technology, while smaller suppliers may be left out. We need to guard against blockchain becoming a barrier to small suppliers entering the market. As a transparency tool blockchain can – in theory – give insights into where goods came from. But no technology on its own can solve a complex social problem. Ultimately, as with any other technology, the saying “garbage in, garbage out” applies. If humans want to undermine accountability systems, they will find ways of doing so. Just recording transactions is not enough. As part of a comprehensive agenda to tackle the myriad factors underlying modern slavery, though, it may prove a useful tool.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martijn Boersma, Justine Nolan, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-05-02T09:43:53Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThere’s a good chance the device on which you are reading this contains cobalt.

Federal investigators are still trying to determine the cause. In response to food company recalls, more than 150 tons of raw turkey products have flowed back through the supply chain as waste. In an age when companies envision drone pizza delivery and hamburgers prepared by robots, why is it so hard to locate the source of food-borne diseases like this one? As I show in my new book, “Food Routes: Growing Bananas in Iceland and Other Tales from the Logistics of Eating,” the challenge of tracing food-borne illnesses in the United States demonstrates that our high-tech food system is broken in fundamental ways. It also reveals a lag between announcements of new, cool tech advances and applying them to solve real problems. In the meantime people get sick, some die and food piles up in landfills. Unsafe food sickens about 600 million people every year – nearly 10% of the world’s population. Susceptibility to food-borne disease is rising as populations age. In addition, people are taking more medications, which often cause negative interactions with chemicals in highly processed foods. These interactions contribute to food-related illnesses. And the costs of food-borne illnesses are significant – over US$15.6 billion yearly in the United States. Some of the recent increase is due to better tracking of food in the supply chain, which has improved tracing of outbreaks that might have gone unreported in the past. But it’s one thing to detect outbreaks and another to prevent them. Globalization of the food supply chain makes this task more challenging. Ingredients come together from remote parts of the world to make pizza sauce. A simple hamburger patty from McDonald’s contains meat from 100 cows. Some 85% of the seafood Americans eat is imported, mostly from countries with lax food handling practices. Improving the global food system in ways that address food safety offers enormous payoffs, but will require compromises. In response to consumers’ insatiable desire for more personalized, individualized food products, snack companies produce popcorn in dozens of flavors, and bakeries make cupcakes with multiple types of nuts and cookies with and without gluten. Tracking, reporting and recalling contaminated food needs to occur in real time and become more precise, and even predictive, based on a food producer’s track record. But the proliferation of food products makes efforts to track a contaminated nut back through the supply chain ever more challenging. Already, food suppliers are using new digital tools to optimize the journey foods take from source to plate. Companies are embedding packaging with smart sensors that will measure how long individual shipments have been in transit, reducing the need for plastic packaging. For example, as a shipping container of ham hocks moves from Liverpool to New York, a small sensor can send real-time internal temperature measurements to the buyer, documenting that the product has been kept cold throughout transit in conformance with established food safety requirements. GPS tags can track turkeys on poultry farms to monitor where they wander before entering the food supply chain. Paradoxically, however, making the food system more transparent may make it more vulnerable to attacks. Food terrorism – deliberately contaminating food as it travels through the supply chain – could increase as bad actors locate sites where they can trigger food-borne disease outbreaks. On the other hand, new digital tools that can test for contamination are entering the market and will make it easier to identify such breaches. However, sharing data as food travels from farm to plate cuts against ingrained practices in the food industry. Many food processors and logistics companies guard their practices in much the same way that tech companies protect intellectual property. For example, getting turkeys to market faster than the competition may give a poultry company its competitive edge. Moreover, I have seen firsthand that many food companies still maintain records on slips of paper, handwritten and kept on clipboards, reflecting how slow technological change can be. Partnerships between companies will help to modernize the system. For example, IBM and Walmart are utilizing IBM’s blockchain system to track food through the delivery process, starting with mangoes. Origintrail, a supply chain management company, is working with sensor designer TagitSmart to track the movement of wine in southern Europe from vineyard to point of sale as a way of preventing adulteration or counterfeiting. But making food more traceable will take time. Large-scale food manufacturers will need incentives to step out from behind the curtain. In my view, however, the goal should be to find and address supply chain breakdowns, like the current turkey meat crisis, in days, not years.

You wouldn’t be alone. The tech giants are invading our privacy, misusing our data, strangling economic growth and helping governments spy on us. Yet because these few companies own so many of the internet’s key services, it seems there is little people can do to avoid having to interact with them if they want to stay online. However, 30 years after the world wide web was created, a third generation of web technology might offer a way to change things. The DWeb, a new decentralised version of cyberspace, promises to enable better user control, more competition between internet firms and less dominance by the large corporations. But there are still serious questions over whether it’s possible – or even desirable. The first generation of the web lasted from its creation by Sir Tim Berners Lee in 1989 to roughly 2005. It was mostly a passive, “read-only” web with minimal interaction between users. Most of us were merely recipients of information. Then came Web 2.0, a “read-write web” based on social networks, wikis and blogs that let users create and share more of their own content, which increased their participation and collaboration. Web 3.0 is the next step. In part it will be a “semantic web” or a “web of data” that can understand, combine and automatically interpret information to provide users with a much more enhanced and interactive experience. But it could also be a decentralised web that challenges the dominance of the tech giants by moving us away from relying so heavily on a few companies, technologies and a relatively small amount of internet infrastructure When we currently access the web, our computers use the HTTP protocol in the form of web addresses to find information stored at a fixed location, usually on a single server. In contrast, the DWeb would find information based on its content, meaning it could be stored in multiple places at once. As a result, this form of the web also involves all computers providing services as well as accessing them, known as peer-to-peer connectivity. This system would enable us to break down the immense databases that are currently held centrally by internet companies rather than users (hence the decentralised web). In principle, this would also better protect users from private and government surveillance as data would no longer be stored in a way that was easy for third parties to access. This actually harks back to the the original philosophy behind the internet, which was first created to decentralise US communications during the Cold War to make them less vulnerable to attack. Some of the technologies that could make the DWeb possible are already being developed. For example, the Databox Project aims to create an open-source device that stores and controls a user’s personal data locally instead of letting tech companies gather and do whatever they like with it. Zeronet is an alternative to the existing web, where websites are hosted by a network of participating computers instead of a centralised server, protected by the same cryptography that’s used for Bitcoin. There’s even a DWeb version of YouTube, called DTube that hosts videos across a decentralised network of computers using a “blockchain” public ledger as its database and payment system. However, this technology is still in its early stages. And even once it’s ready, it will be difficult to get users to use new, DWeb-based applications. Whereas Web 2.0 provided an obviously more attractive and easy-to-navigate experience to all users in an open marketplace, the DWeb offers something with less obvious benefits, and requires more user responsibility. Yet enough people would have to be tempted to adopt the technology for it to break down the established oligopoly and succeed. The DWeb also comes with some significant legal and regulatory risks. It would make policing cybercrime, including online harassment, hate speech and child abuse images, even more difficult because of its lack of central control and access to data. A centralised web helps governments make large corporations enforce rules and laws. In a decentralised web, it wouldn’t even necessarily be clear which country’s laws applied to a particular website, if its content was hosted all around the world. This concern brings us back to debates from the 1990s, when legal scholars were arguing for and against the influence national laws could have on internet regulation. The DWeb essentially reflects the cyber-libertarian views and hopes of the past that the internet can empower ordinary people by breaking down existing power structures. But this relies on users taking more initiative and responsibility for their data and their online interactions. We’ve seen that large numbers of people are willing to take action when their day-to-day experience of the internet is threatened. However, it’s not yet clear whether the current push for more regulation will align with the DWeb’s principles of responsibility or place internet freedoms at risk. Decentralised systems also don’t necessarily abolish unequal power structures, but can instead replace one with an another. For instance, Bitcoin works by saving records of financial transactions on a network of computers and is designed to bypass traditional financial institutions and give people greater control over their money. But its critics argue that it has turned into an oligopoly, since a large percentage of Bitcoin wealth is owned by a very small number of people. The DWeb certainly has its benefits and the potential to give ordinary internet users more power. But it would require some major shifts in how we perceive the web and our place in it. Whether its benefits will be sufficient to drive enough users away from the tech giants to make it viable remains to be seen. However, with governments becoming keen to increase regulation of the internet, the DWeb might actually offer a more liberal alternative in the long run.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Edina Harbinja, Vasileios Karagiannopoulos, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-03-11T14:47:36Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eHave you recently considered \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.businessinsider.com/deletefacebook-facebook-movement-2018-3?r\u003dUS\u0026amp;IR\u003dT\"\u003edeleting your Facebook\u003c/a\u003e account, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/17/amazon-boycott-customers-holiday-shopping\"\u003eboycotting Amazon\u003c/a\u003e or trying to find an \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/02/how-stop-using-google-search-services\"\u003ealternative to Google\u003c/a\u003e?

All members of a blockchain network can verify whether a transaction occurred or not, rendering clearinghouses or other intermediaries obsolete. The technology originally served as the backbone of bitcoin, the well-known crypto-currency, and later made its way to other industries. In France, blockchain represents a vibrant industry as the nation trailblazes the way for the technology in the hope of becoming a blockchain hub in the European Union. The French minister of finance, Bruno Le Maire, believes that: “The blockchain will offer new opportunities to our startups, for example, with initial coin offerings that will allow them to raise funds through tokens.” In December 2018, two French members of Parliament, Jean-Michel Mis and Laure de La Raudière, submitted a report recommending that the French Government invest 500 million euros on public blockchain endeavors over the next three years in order to build a “blockhain nation”. The unique characteristics of blockchain technology (lower transaction costs, increased transparency and enhanced security) are creating new opportunities for the French electricity sector. A few start-ups such as Sunchain or Evolution Energy are currently establishing blockchain-based projects with the main aim of further decentralizing existing energy systems. Several barriers to the wide adoption of blockchain however are yet to be overcome. In this context, the Energy Market Barometers conducted by Grenoble Ecole de Management (GEM) in December 2018 asked experts for their opinion on where blockchain is headed in the French energy sector. As a first finding, the experts were almost equally split in their opinion on whether blockchain will play a rather important or a rather unimportant role in the French electricity system of tomorrow. To understand the importance of blockchain technology in the energy sector and the challenges that it faces, the experts were asked for their opinion on the viability of specific blockchain applications and the potential benefits, as well as the barriers currently limiting a wider diffusion of the technology in France. According to the experts, the most promising applications of blockchain technology in the electricity sector in the next five years, are “peer-to-peer energy trading” and “electric vehicle charging and sharing”. The blockchain promises to create a system whereby energy prosumers from the commercial sector or private homes can trade electricity without the interference of a central authority. With the continuous growth of electric vehicles, blockchain promises to provide an adequate, publicly available charging infrastructure that tackles the “lack of range” challenge, by enabling individuals to make their private EV charging stations available for public use for a fee. Currently, the majority of players in the blockchain for energy market are trying to enact some form of peer-to-peer energy trading. In 2017, Enedis, working with the French start-up Sunchain and the Departmental Council of Pyrénées-Orientales, launched one of the first P2P energy sharing projects in France. The project, DIGISOL, explored the use of blockchain technology to share solar energy between individuals within the same building (collective auto-consumption). A large-scale deployment of the technology for P2P energy trading however is still inexistent in France. Which blockchain use case do you see as most viable for applying the technology within the energy sector in France in the next five years? Blockchain technology is interesting for its potential to decentralise energy markets and improve flexibility. blockchain enables real-time coordination of electricity supply and demand data that can improve demand-side energy efficiency. blockchain solutions can also be used to accurately monitor and control energy performance in real-time, which will ultimately increase supply side efficiency. In effect, blockchain provides companies with ways to efficiently track energy usage and generation, and to identify network anomalies, which can improve response time in case of a failure or a blackout. In France, ENGIE is exploring the use of blockchain technology to monitor water, natural gas and energy flows. The company has also partnered with different blockchain players, such as LEDGER, which specializes in security and infrastructure solutions for cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications, to develop blockchain for energy market solutions. What potential benefits can blockchain bring to the energy sector in France? However, the experts also identified key barriers that limit the widespread diffusion of blockchain technology. Blockchain solutions are rapidly growing and innovating far ahead of existing regulations. Clear legal definitions and regulatory frameworks are needed in order to clear up the current level of uncertainty that is associated with blockchain. The French government, along with players in the blockchain ecosystem, is still working on establishing favorable regulations and legal frameworks for the technology. In December 2018, the French Accounting Standards Authority established a regulation that defines the accounting rules applicable to Initial Coin Offerings (ICO; a highly popular approach to raise capital in the blockchain space) issuers, ICO investors, and organizations that hold any type of crypto currency or crypto-asset. However, several issues such as intellectual-property, data privacy, and enforceability of contracts remain to be addressed. Current blockchain designs run on algorithms that can consume up to 215 kWh per transaction (i.e., the equivalent of letting an incandescent light bulb of 25W burn for a full year). This is mainly because validating and securing transactions on the blockchain requires huge computing power. For example, the servers that run bitcoin’s software are estimated to use at least 22 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year, which is almost the level of Ireland’s annual electricity consumption. An expansion of blockchain will require additional “data mining” and consequently additional energy consumption. A number of green-mining solutions that use renewable energy sources and more energy-efficient hardware are currently being tested. The green-energy startup Hydrominer, which operates two hydropower mining farms in the Austrian Alps is one example. What are the main barriers that are currently limiting a wider diffusion of blockchain technology within the energy sector in France? Current blockchain designs are extremely difficult to develop, deploy and maintain. For the novice user, making a transaction on the blockchain can be challenging, as it requires technical knowledge and several sophisticated steps. A number of big IT players are currently providing cloud-based blockchain services intended to automate the setup of blockchain infrastructures. Future blockchain applications may need to adopt a plug-and-play infrastructure that is much more user-friendly in order to attain wider diffusion. The energy market barometers conducted in December 2018 among 112 experts from industry, science and public administration in France asked about the role of blockchain technology in the French energy sector.

A large-scale deployment of the technology for P2P energy trading however is still inexistent in France.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhich blockchain use case do you see as most viable for applying the technology within the energy sector in France in the next five years?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class\u003d\"align-center \"\u003e\n \u003cdiv class\u003d\"placeholder-container\" style\u003d\"--aspect-ratio-percent:36.60477453580902%;--background-color:#7fa854\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg alt\u003d\"\" class\u003d\"lazyload\" data-src\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/258761/original/file-20190213-181589-1fdkd5u.png?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;fit\u003dclip\" data-srcset\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/258761/original/file-20190213-181589-1fdkd5u.png?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d220\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/258761/original/file-20190213-181589-1fdkd5u.png?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d30\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d220\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/258761/original/file-20190213-181589-1fdkd5u.png?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d15\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d220\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/258761/original/file-20190213-181589-1fdkd5u.png?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d276\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/258761/original/file-20190213-181589-1fdkd5u.png?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d30\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d276\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/258761/original/file-20190213-181589-1fdkd5u.png?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d15\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d276\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d3 2262w\" sizes\u003d\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n  \u003cspan class\u003d\"caption\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class\u003d\"attribution\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"license\"\u003eAuthor provided (no reuse)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlockchain technology is interesting for its potential to decentralise energy markets and improve flexibility. blockchain enables real-time coordination of electricity supply and demand data that can improve demand-side energy efficiency. blockchain solutions can also be used to accurately monitor and control energy performance in real-time, which will ultimately increase supply side efficiency.

Clear legal definitions and regulatory frameworks are needed in order to clear up the current level of uncertainty that is associated with blockchain. The French government, along with players in the blockchain ecosystem, is still working on establishing favorable regulations and legal frameworks for the technology. In December 2018, the French Accounting Standards Authority established a regulation that defines the accounting rules applicable to Initial Coin Offerings (ICO; a highly popular approach to raise capital in the blockchain space) issuers, ICO investors, and organizations that hold any type of crypto currency or crypto-asset. However, several issues such as intellectual-property, data privacy, and enforceability of contracts remain to be addressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eElectricity consumption\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrent blockchain designs run on algorithms that can consume up to 215 kWh per transaction (i.e., the equivalent of letting an incandescent light bulb of 25W burn for a full year). This is mainly because validating and securing transactions on the blockchain requires huge computing power. For example, the servers that run bitcoin’s software are estimated to use at least 22 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year, which is almost the level of Ireland’s annual electricity consumption. An expansion of blockchain will require additional “data mining” and consequently additional energy consumption.

A historic moment was made on April 23. Peking University‘s former student, Yue Xin, had penned a letter detailing the university’s attempts to hide sexual misconduct. The case involved a student, Gao Yan, who committed suicide in 1998 after a professor sexually assaulted and then harassed her. The letter was blocked by Chinese social networking websites, but an anonymous user posted it on the Ethereum blockchain. In another case, in July, Chinese citizens used blockchain to preserve an investigative story which condemned inferior vaccines being given to Chinese babies. The vaccines produced by Shenzhen-based Changsheng Bio-Tech failed to fight tetanus and whooping cough. The company has also allegedly faked data for about 113,000 doses of human rabies vaccine. A blockchain is a secure database that’s stored in a distributed set of computers. Every addition to the database must be digitally signed, making clear who’s changing what and when. To ensure that only authorized users have access to the information, blockchains use cryptography-based digital signatures that verify identities. A user signs transactions with a “private key,” which is generated when an an account is created. A private key typically is a long and random alphanumeric code, known only to the person who controls the account. Using complicated algorithms, blockchains also create “public keys” from private keys. Public keys are known to the public and make it possible to share information. For instance, a bitcoin wallet address is a public key. Any bitcoin user can send payments to that address. However, only the person with the private key can spend the bitcoin. From researching blockchain and China’s internet control measures, I can see that blockchain systems’ features are in conflict with the goals of the Chinese Communist Party. Truly decentralized blockchains will challenge the ability of authoritarian nations to maintain a tight grip over their populations. Blockchain makes censorship extremely difficult. Yue Xin’s letter, which was written in English and Chinese, and the story about the inferior vaccines have been inserted into the metadata of transactions in the Ethereum blockchain. Each transaction cost a few cents. Since Ethereum transactions are permanent and public, anyone can read the letter. The posts cannot be tampered with. Since they are distributed among many computers in decentralized networks, it is not possible for Chinese internet censors to pressure any company to remove them. The Chinese government has been alarmed about blockchain censorship resistance. Starting in February, a new regulation of the Cyberspace Administration of China requires users to provide real names as well as national ID card numbers or mobile phones to use blockchains. Law enforcement must be able to access data posted on the blockchain when necessary. Blockchain service providers are required to keep relevant records about transactions and other relevant information and report illegal use to authorities. They also need to prevent the production, duplication, publication and dissemination of contents that are banned by Chinese laws. According to the new regulation, blockchain services are also required to remove “illegal information” quickly to stop it from spreading. This requirement is puzzling because, in commonly understood blockchains, information stored is immutable and thus cannot be removed. The Chinese strategy toward modern technology is to balance economic modernization and political control. According to the World Economic Forum, blockchain is among six computing “mega-trends” that are likely to shape the world in the next decade. The Chinese government hopes that blockchain can address the diverse economic and social problems China faces, such as insurance fraud, environmental pollution and food safety. The Chinese government is against truly decentralized blockchain systems such as bitcoin, which relies on users, also known as “nodes” or “peers,” competing to verify transactions. At least tens of thousands of computers from all over the world are connected at any point of time in the bitcoin network. The former head of the People’s Bank of China’s digital currency research institute, Yao Qian, argued against the need for community consensus in which all users engage in transactions and governance related decisions. He favored a multi-center system, in which consensus is managed by several main nodes. Intervention can be applied in case of emergency. If needed, data can be rolled back, and transactions can be reversed. The system can even be shut down. China has been the first nation to rank blockchains. Most blockchains that rank high are developed in China or have strong Chinese connections. It is easier for the government to access and control such blockchains. It is impossible for a Chinese blockchain company to operate and succeed in China without helping the government to achieve its censorship goals. The blockchain most favored by the Chinese government, EOS, uses a model where users vote for representatives. Only the representatives verify transactions and make decisions regarding system updates. All transactions and governance decisions in EOS are processed and approved by only 21 main nodes, known as supernodes. Twelve of the EOS supernodes are in China. This makes it easier for the government to control blockchains, since the penalty of noncompliance with Chinese regulations is high for China-based supernodes. The third-ranked blockchain, Ontology, and the seventh, Neo, have smaller numbers of main nodes: seven each. Censorship can be easily enforced in these blockchain thanks to small numbers of main nodes, mainly in China, involved in transactions and governance decisions. China’s approach to blockchain regulation reflects the tension it faces between using modern technologies to maintain control and using them to stimulate economic growth. The Chinese government wouldn’t allow blockchain implementation without significant modification. Blockchain applications modified to satisfy China’s have lost fundamental elements of the original technology. The new laws, combined with the Chinese government’s indication of its favorite blockchains, could constrain activists’ ability to use blockchains to fight censorship. For instance, the supernodes of EOS froze accounts associated with email scams and stopped them from making transactions. It also reversed transactions that were previously confirmed. These examples illustrate that blockchains are being developed that help suppress contents that are objectionable to the Chinese government. Activists who are vocal against the Chinese government may also be barred from using some blockchains, such as Neo. In this way, China could also emerge as a role model for other authoritarian regimes in developing censorship-enabled blockchain solutions.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nir Kshetri, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-02-25T11:39:12Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThanks to blockchain, internet users have achieved some victories in the fight against China’s strict internet censorship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA historic moment was made \u003ca href\u003d\"https://blog.joincivil.com/uncensored-content-on-ethereum-how-chinese-activists-inspired-civil-f09f095a9e91\"\u003eon April 23\u003c/a\u003e.

But more than becoming a nasty tool for stalkers and harassers, deepfakes threaten to undermine trust in political institutions and society as a whole. The White House recently justified temporarily banning a reporter from its press conferences using reportedly sped up genuine footage of an incident involving the journalist. Imagine the implications of seeing ultra-realistic but artificial footage of government leaders planning assassinations, CEOs colluding with foreign agents or a renowned philanthropist abusing children. So-called fake news has already increased many people’s scepticism towards politicians, journalists and other public figures. It is becoming so easy to create entirely fictional scenarios that we can no longer trust any video footage at face value. This threatens our political, legal and media systems, not to mention our personal relationships. We will need to create new forms of consensus on which to base our social reality. New ways of checking and distributing power - some political, some technological - could help us achieve this. Deepfakes are scary because they allow anyone’s image to be co-opted, and call into question our ability to trust what we see. One obvious use of deepfakes would be to falsely implicate people in scandals. Even if the incriminating footage is subsequently proven to be fake, the damage to the victim’s reputation may be impossible to repair. And politicians could tweak old footage of themselves to make it appear as if they had always supported something that had recently become popular, updating their positions in real time. There could even be public figures who are entirely imaginary, original but not authentic. Meanwhile, video footage could become useless as evidence in court. Broadcast news could be reduced to people debating whether clips were authentic or not, using ever more complex AI to try to detect deepfakes. But the arms race that already exists between fake content creators and those detecting or debunking disinformation (such as Facebook’s planned fake news “war room”) hides a deeper issue. The mere existence of deepfakes undermines confidence and trust, just as the possibility that an election was hacked brings the validity of the result into question. While some people may be taken in by deepfakes, that is not the real problem. What is at stake is the underlying social structure in which we all agree that some form of truth exists, and the social realities that are based on this trust. It is not a matter of the end of truth, but the end of the belief in truth – a post-trust society. In the wake of massive disinformation, even honest public figures will be easily ignored or discredited. The traditional organisations that have supported and enabled consensus – government, the press – will no longer be fit for purpose. New laws to regulate the use of deepfakes will be important for people who have damaging videos made of them. But policy and law alone will not save our systems of governance. We will need to develop new forms of consensus, new ways to agree on social situations based on alternative forms of trust. One approach will be to decentralise trust, so that we no longer need a few institutions to guarantee whether information is genuine and can instead rely on multiple people or organisations with good reputations. One way to do this could be to use blockchain, the technology that powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain works by creating a public ledger stored on multiple computers around the world at once and made tamper-proof by cryptography. Its algorithms enable the computers to agree on the validity of any changes to the ledger, making it much harder to record false information. In this way, trust is distributed between all the computers who can scrutinise each other, increasing accountability. We can also look to more democratic forms of government and journalism. For example, liquid democracy allows voters to vote directly on each issue or temporarily assign their votes to delegates in a more flexible and accountable way than handing over full control to one party for years. This would allow the public to look to experts to make decisions for them where necessary but swiftly vote out politicians who disregarded their views or acted dishonestly, increasing trust and legitimacy in the political system. In the press, we could move towards more collaborative and democratised news reporting. Traditional journalists could use the positive aspects of social media to gather information from a more diverse range of sources. These contributors could then discuss and help scrutinise the story to build a consensus, improving the media’s reputation. The problem with any system that relies on the reputation of key individuals to build trust is how to prevent that reputation from being misused or fraudulently damaged. Checks such as Twitter’s “blue tick” account verification for public figures can help, but better legal and technical protections are also needed: more protected rights to privacy, better responses to antisocial behaviour online, and better privacy-enhancing technologies built in by design. The potential ramifications of deepfakes should act as a call to action in redesigning systems of trust to be more open, more decentralised and more collective. And now is the time to start thinking about a different future for society.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Garfield Benjamin, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-02-06T13:22:11Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIt has the potential to ruin relationships, reputations and our online reality. “Deepfake” artificial intelligence technology promises to create doctored videos so realistic that they’re almost impossible to tell from the real thing.

Business leaders and regular people are also slow to adopt blockchain-based systems because they fear potential government regulations might require them to make expensive or difficult changes in the future. Mistrust and regulatory uncertainty are strange problems for blockchain technology to have, though. The first widely adopted blockchain, bitcoin, was expressly created to allow financial transactions “without relying on trust” or on governments overseeing the currency. Users who don’t trust a bank or other intermediary to accurately track transactions can instead rely on unchangeable mathematical algorithms. Further, the system is decentralized, with data stored on thousands – or more – of internet-connected computers around the world, preventing regulators from shutting down the network as a whole. As I discuss in my recent book, “The Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust,” the contradiction between blockchain’s allegedly trust-less technology and its trust-needing users arises from a misunderstanding about human nature. Economists often view trust as a cost, because it takes effort to establish. But people actually want to use systems they can trust. They intuitively understand that cultures and companies with strong trust avoid the hidden costs that stem from everyone constantly trying to both cheat the system and avoid being cheated by others. Blockchain, as it turns out, doesn’t herald the end of the need for trust. Most people will want laws and regulations to help make blockchain-based systems trustworthy. Bitcoin’s creator wrote in 2009 that “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work.” With government-issued money, the public must trust central bankers and commercial banks to preserve economic stability and protect users’ privacy. The blockchain framework that bitcoin introduced was supposed to be a “trustless” alternative. Sometimes, though, it shouldn’t be trusted. In 2016, for instance, someone exploited a flaw in the DAO, a decentralized application using the Ethereum blockchain, to withdraw about US$60 million worth of cryptocurrency. Fortunately, members of the Ethereum community trusted each other enough to adopt a radical solution: They created a new copy of the entire blockchain to reverse the theft. The process was slow and awkward, though, and almost failed. A new type of investment, called initial coin offerings, further illustrates why blockchain-based activity still requires trust. Since 2017, blockchain-based startups have raised more than $20 billion by selling cryptocurrency tokens to supporters around the world. However, a substantial percentage of those companies were out-and-out frauds. In other cases, investors simply had no idea what they were investing in. The blockchain itself doesn’t provide the kind of disclosure that regulators require for traditional securities. The initial coin offering faucet slowed to a trickle in the second half of 2018 as the predictable abuses of a “wild west” environment became clear. As regulators stepped in, the market shifted toward selling digital tokens under the same rules as stocks or other securities, despite the limits those rules impose. The other reason that regulators have a role to play is security. Blockchain networks themselves are typically very secure, and they eliminate the vulnerability of a single company controlling transactions. However, blockchains identify the owner of an account based on its cryptographic private key, a random-seeming string of numbers and letters. Steal the key, and you’ve got the money. Ten percent of initial coin offerings proceeds has already been stolen. Most users acquire their cryptocurrency through an exchange such as Coinbase, which trades it for dollars or other traditional currencies. They also let the exchanges hold their private keys, because that makes transactions easier and more efficient. However, it also creates a point of vulnerability: If the exchange’s records are breached, the private keys aren’t secret anymore. Some users hold their own keys, and there are new exchanges being developed that don’t require users to give them up. These will never be as convenient, though, because the burden of managing keys and keeping them safe falls on users. Regulation will be needed to protect consumers. Government authorities will also have a role in restricting money laundering, terrorist financing and other criminal uses of cryptocurrencies. The more decentralized a system is, the harder it will be to identify a responsible party to police illicit conduct. Some users may not care, or may see that as a necessary cost of freedom. But networks optimized for criminals won’t ever achieve mainstream success among law-abiding citizens. Ordinary users will be scared off, regulated banks and financial services firms will be prohibited from interacting with them, and law enforcement will find ways to disrupt their activities. Regulators around the world are working to balance the flexibility to transact in new ways through cryptocurrencies with appropriate safeguards. They aren’t all taking the same route, but that’s good. When the state of New York adopted rigid registration requirements called the BitLicense that few companies could meet, other jurisdictions saw the implementation problems and took different paths. Wyoming, for example, adopted a series of bills that clarify the legal status of cryptocurrencies while imposing reasonable protections. New York is now reevaluating the BitLicense, to avoid losing business activity. If people trust blockchain systems, they’ll use them. That’s the only way they’ll see mass-market adoption. The jurisdictions with the best regulation – not the ones with the least – will attract activity. Like any technological system, blockchains combine software code and human activity. It’s not enough to trust the computers – which, after all, are built and programmed by people. For the technology to be used widely and wisely, there must be mechanisms to hold the humans accountable, too.  The Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust.

A financier and supply chain expert discuss","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"This is an article from Head to Head, a series in which academics from different disciplines chew over current debates. Let us know what else you’d like covered – all questions are welcome. Details of how to contact us are at the end of the article. Arturo Bris: Have you ever watched footage from the early 1980s of people trying to explain the internet? They’re sceptical and confused and have no idea how to say “@”, which is comical given what we now take for granted. But that’s where we are with blockchain now. People don’t believe in it because they don’t understand it. Blockchain is a technology with two ingredients: the first is a distributed ledger, meaning a database with identical copies held by everyone in a network. There is no intermediary, no central data depository. The second is a consensus algorithm (and this is the true innovation in the technology): the ability to digitally agree on any change in the data. It is the set of decision rules by which any new entry in the database is accepted and then shared by everyone. The consensus algorithm will be different for every blockchain – some work on a simple majority rule, some (such as Bitcoin) have a subset of members paid to fulfil that role, and others have much more complicated arrangements. The structure of the database is also particular, because it is structure as a sequence of entries (a ledger), not a deposit. If you don’t understand blockchain, get educated, because it’s an amazing new technology that’s going to revolutionise the world. It’s going to monetise and unlock value that today is hidden. The social impact is going to be massive. It’s going to permit new avenues for human interaction that didn’t exist before. Carlos Cordon: I’m not sure about that, Arturo. I, for instance, understand what blockchain is, but I don’t believe that it’s going to have the impact you describe. Blockchain requires having a lot of copies of the same data. This means that you are required to multiply the data storage by, let’s say, 100 times. The same data is stored in 100 places. That might work for something as standard and simple as money: Bitcoin works, for example, because there is just one Bitcoin, not thousands of different products. But if you think about supply chains, for example, you’re talking about thousands of products. For each product, a lot of information is required, like weight, format, expiry date, composition, etc. This means that blockchain is extremely impractical for many of the applications that its evangelists are proposing. Amazon isn’t using blockchain. Google isn’t. In fact, none of the top digital giants are, although Amazon has said it’s happy to provide cloud storage for it. The Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman has said that Bitcoin will “set the monetary system back 300 years”. AB: Krugman also said in 2011 that the Euro would soon disappear, and look where we are today. And, with respect to Google and Amazon, that’s exactly what disruptive technologies are: they are not usually adopted by the established players, because they disrupt their own – established – business models. And by the way, more and more companies are using blockchain for applications beyond cryptocurrencies. These include music streaming, social networking, commodities trading, property registries – the list goes on. Blockchain is a technology that guarantees full security (it cannot be hacked) because data are already shared by the members of the network, so there is nothing to hack. We are already seeing the transformation moving extremely fast, and that’s why you need to embrace it. CC: The way blockchain works makes it secure and trustworthy, that much is true. But if we introduce blockchain into supply chains, for example, we’re firstly trying to solve a problem that isn’t there – and, secondly, we’re possibly creating further problems for ourselves. This is because trust in supply chains generally isn’t an issue. Let’s imagine I’m Unilever or Procter \u0026 Gamble. Am I going to try to cheat Walmart or Carrefour? No. We have a certain level of trust. We may disagree, but we don’t cheat. But with blockchain comes complete transparency. And we don’t want that. Not because we don’t trust the other partner, but because we use information to negotiate. Besides, in supply chains we’ve been working on sharing information and data for years. We don’t need new data technologies. It’s already complicated enough. AB: I have no problem with that. If trust does not need to be formalised, there is no need for blockchain. I don’t think we will use blockchain to manufacture cookware or to design new means of transportation either. But what makes blockchain revolutionary is the transformation of physical assets into digital ones. This is known as tokenization. Cryptocurrencies, for example, are the tokenization of money, but that is only one example. You can tokenize stocks and financial assets, property, music, services – the list goes on. By replicating assets with a digital token, we can facilitate transactions without physical delivery. CC: Then there’s the challenge of a potential mismatch between the virtual value chain and the physical value chain. You can tokenize assets, but what happens if someone changes the physical product? Blockchain couldn’t have prevented the UK horsemeat scandal, for example, where horsemeat was found in products that supposedly contained only beef. Meanwhile, the need for storage is going to multiply by an order of magnitude as copies of all these ledgers are held by each individual in a blockchain. And the only people who are going to benefit from that are companies like Amazon, selling cloud storage. AB: This is a fallacy. In fact, the structure of a blockchain allows us to store the whole database by storing just a small part of it. I know this is difficult to understand. In fact what happens is that, through encryption, we will be able to drastically reduce the size of the entries. Second, because of the sequential nature of the database, and since all entries are linked both to the previous and the next one, we will need to store just the last block(s) of the database. Overall, I think that we need to think beyond the storage of data and contracts as the main uses of blockchain. Tokenization will transform our transactions. Besides, the lack of need for intermediaries will also transform organisations. We can develop a new type of organisation that is democratic, not in the sense that it doesn’t need a CEO but in the sense of a decentralised autonomous organisation that is super efficient. This is going to be the future. By monetising assets that we currently do not monetise – such as our social capital, our fitness data, our attention to advertisers – we will add value. And that is only possible through a technology so new and complex that we’re still struggling to explain to each other how it works. CC: OK. But so far, I have seen no evidence of blockchain being used for truly revolutionary purposes. Walmart is using it to track vegetables. I saw a headline recently: “IBM joins efforts to create the blockchain equivalent of Yellow Pages” – Yellow Pages died 20 years ago, why are they trying to resuscitate that concept? Blockchain is certainly one of the top strategic tech trends at the moment but from looking at what companies are actually doing with it, I don’t think it’s going to change the world.

It might not be long before its impact is felt everywhere. Blockchain is a secure chain of digital records that exist on multiple computers simultaneously so no record can be erased or falsified. The redundancy of the system ensures many backups, and the lack of a central storage place ensures there is no one target for hackers. Some suggest that blockchain could become a component of the next generation of the internet. Many blockchain systems provide a technology called “smart contract:” these are the rules by which records can be accessed and modified by creating new versions. These rules define, for example, who gets access to the stored records, under what conditions, for what declared purpose and in exchange of what (payment or virtual credit). Smart contracts also record every access to the data in the blockchain. In this way, users can permanently and securely store their data, set their own conditions and control who accesses the data and for what purpose. Because of these features, blockchain technology can be used to store user profile data. Currently, social media giants hoard user data and use it to sell targeted advertisements (their main source of revenue). These social media networks don’t give users a real choice or awareness of what data about them are kept. They provide very few control options and no rewards for users in exchange of their data. Recently, we have seen many cases when user data has been stolen by hackers, leading to breaches of privacy, the possibility for identity theft or exploitation of the data to manipulate people and influence public opinion towards voting. This can have serious consequences for the democratic process in a liberal society. The unauthorized use of personal data is difficult to track. But blockchain can change that. Instead of hoarding the data of millions of users for large companies, each user can hold the keys for access to their data. Currently, there is no universal method to track who shared what, with whom, when and for what purposes in a verifiable fashion. My current research addresses these problems by incorporating the blockchain technology. One of the elements of user data sharing would be to control who can share the data and by what means, and how users can be incentivized to share data. Smart contracts allow storing these access-control policies securely on the blockchain. Blockchain provides an unalterable record of all transactions. Users can also be incentivized with monetary rewards for sharing their data to commercial enterprises. I have been researching how a blockchain-based system can keep users data safe, provide access control and provenance of their ownership, and incentivize them to share their data. My recent paper, presented at the International Conference on Blockchain in Seattle in March 2018, is the first in the area of sharing research data and it generated a lot of interest. University of Saskatchewan professor and computer scientist Julita Vassileva has worked on ways that allow users to control the sharing of their data, and also provide incentives that preserve a user’s control and provide incentives for sharing. Vassileva’s guidance and supervision led me to experiment with blockchain technology to implement such a framework. This led to an award-winning research paper, that I presented at the 2017 Future Technologies Conference. The paper proposed a blockchain-based system to share users’ personal data among tourism businesses. We need new data-sharing practices so that we can maximize what we learn from research. In medicine and health care, for example, both personalized patient care and medical research can benefit from sharing research data from clinical trials. Similar to shifts in the business world, the personalization of services is trending. Various data associated with users’ profiles and behaviours are being shared among commercial enterprises. This information is used to better help businesses target their customers and improve the quality of their services. Much of the data are contributed voluntarily by the user; others are obtained from observation of user activities, or inferred through advanced analysis of volunteered or observed data. Users need to become active participants who stand to benefit from the personal data economy. Blockchain and smart contracts can support users in the following ways: (1) Give the users full transparency over who accesses their data, when and for what purpose; (2) Allow the users to specify the purposes of data sharing, which kinds of data that can be shared, and which applications or companies can access the data; (3) Provide an incentive to users for sharing their data (in terms of payment for the use of the data by applications, as specified by the contracts). My research project develops guidelines and methods for embedding privacy, user transparency, control and incentives from the start in the design of a data sharing framework. This is an alternative to what currently exists, providing a platform that users can trust to protect their data, have control over it and share it in the ways they want.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ajay Kumar Shrestha, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2019-01-15T23:35:23Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eBlockchain has already proven its huge influence on the financial world with its first application in the form of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.techbullion.com/relationship-blockchain-technology-bitcoin/\"\u003ecryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin\u003c/a\u003e.

It could just as easily contain rat, dog, horse or camel meat – or a mixture of them all. It’s gross and dangerous, but also costly. Fraud in the global food industry is a multi-billion-dollar problem that has lingered for years, duping consumers and even making them ill. Food manufacturers around the world are concerned – as many as 39 percent of them are worried that their products could be easily counterfeited, and 40 percent say food fraud is hard to detect. In researching blockchain for more than three years, I have become convinced that this technology’s potential to prevent fraud and strengthen security could fight agricultural fraud and improve food safety. Many companies agree, and are already running various tests, including tracking wine from grape to bottle and even following individual coffee beans through international trade. An early trial of a blockchain system to track food from farm to consumer was in 2016, when Walmart collected information about pork being raised in China, where consumers are rightly skeptical about sellers’ claims of what their food is and where it’s from. Employees at a pork farm scanned images of farm inspection reports and livestock health certificates, storing them in a secure online database where the records could not be deleted or modified – only added to. As the animals moved from farm to slaughter to processing, packaging and then to stores, the drivers of the freight trucks played a key role. At each step, they would collect documents detailing the shipment, storage temperature and other inspections and safety reports, and official stamps as authorities reviewed them – just as they did normally. In Walmart’s test, however, the drivers would photograph those documents and upload them to the blockchain-based database. The company controlled the computers running the database, but government agencies’ systems could also be involved, to further ensure data integrity. As the pork was packaged for sale, a sticker was put on each container, displaying a smartphone-readable code that would link to that meat’s record on the blockchain. Consumers could scan the code right in the store and assure themselves that they were buying exactly what they thought they were. More recent advances in the technology of the stickers themselves have made them more secure and counterfeit-resistant. Walmart did similar tests on mangoes imported to the U.S. from Latin America. The company found that it took only 2.2 seconds for consumers to find out an individual fruit’s weight, variety, growing location, time it was harvested, date it passed through U.S. customs, when and where it was sliced, which cold-storage facility the sliced mango was held in and for how long it waited before being delivered to a store. Beyond tracking products’ origins, blockchain systems are helping ensure cheap plonk isn’t sold in bottles promising expensive wines. Some counterfeiters get their hands on empty wine bottles with top-quality labels, refill them with cheaper wine and reap fraudulent profits. In December 2016, wine expert Maureen Downey debuted a blockchain system that gives each bottle a unique digital identity combining more than 90 pieces of data about its production, ownership and storage history – including high-resolution photographs and data from the glass and cork. As the bottle moves from winery to distributors and resellers, the data are updated, and can easily be checked by warehouses, retailers and even auction houses. More recently, Downey’s system has been updated to fight even more sophisticated wine counterfeiters, who have reverse-engineered a wine-preservation system to extract wine without opening the bottle. The upgraded protection embeds a small microchip above the top of a wine’s cork, so if someone removes the capsule wrapper or pierces the chip, it will be unreadable. Consumers are worried not only about contaminated or counterfeit food products. Many consumers say they prefer products that are environmentally friendly and contribute to improved living and working conditions of small farmers and workers. Middlemen siphon off a lot of the money. In the US$200 billion global coffee industry, for instance, only 10 percent stays in producing countries. Global sales of products approved by Fairtrade, a major certifier of products that respect environmental and human-rights concerns, reached $9.6 billion in 2017. But Fairtrade and other programs like it have not substantially improved poor people’s lives. A study of small farms growing flowers, coffee and tea in Ethiopia and Uganda indicated that areas dominated by Fairtrade producers paid lower wages compared to farms that were larger, commercial and not Fairtrade-certified. Colorado-based Coda Coffee seeks to ensure fair payments by using a blockchain system to track its coffee from African farms to U.S. coffee shops. The system includes a camera that takes a three-dimensional scan of each bean’s outer fruit, called a cherry, paying farmers more if they supply bigger and riper cherries and recording the amount paid in a blockchain database for consumers to inspect later. The bean’s record is updated as it is processed, packed, blended with other beans, roasted and ground, letting consumers know who did what to the bean and how much they got paid. Wholesalers and roasters can learn about where it came from and how it was handled, and evaluate the resulting taste, informing future purchasing decisions. These are far from the only examples – countless others around the world are underway. Blockchain systems are secure, but their data – like other databases – are only as accurate as what is entered. Fraudsters may try to counterfeit certifications of organic processes or farm inspections. In addition, most of the food products in developing economies like Africa and China are produced on very small farms that don’t have access to technology or internet connectivity. Blockchain systems can also be expensive, which is part of why early trials have involved high-end beef, wine and coffee. The research already happening holds the promise of developing cheaper systems that are easier to use and trust – for farmers, food processing plants and customers alike.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nir Kshetri, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-21T11:49:53Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eWhen a Chinese consumer buys a package labeled “Australian beef,” there’s only a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.farmonline.com.au/story/5403286/food-fraud-bites-aussie-ag-exports/\"\u003e50-50 chance\u003c/a\u003e the meat inside is, in fact, Australian beef.

In that time, it has proved revolutionary because it ignores the need for modern money’s institutions to verify payments. Instead, Bitcoin relies on cryptographic techniques to prove identity and authenticity. However, the price to pay for all of this innovation is a high carbon footprint, created by Bitcoin mining. Fundamental to that mining process is a peer-to-peer network of computers, referred to as validators, who perform Proof of Work. In essence, this involves computers solving computationally-intensive cryptographic puzzles that prove blocks of transactions, which are recorded in a public asset ledger, known as a blockchain. This ledger is publicly viewable by all computers, which helps the system achieve consensus in an unreliable network of participants. Validators are called miners because the computer, or node, that successfully validates one of those blocks is rewarded with “mined” Bitcoin. Thus mining is also the process by which Bitcoin adds new coins to the network. But these processes consume a vast amount of power. In my 2016 article, Socialism and the Blockchain, I estimated Bitcoin mining’s annual energy use at 3.38 TeraWatt hours (TWh), which I equated to the total 2014 annual consumption of Jamaica. Recent estimates show the currency’s annual consumption rising exponentially, currently reaching an incredible 55TWh. Indeed, a new paper in Nature Sustainability suggests that the energy costs of mining cryptocurrencies exceed the costs of mining physical metals. Furthermore, the paper estimates that Bitcoin emitted between 3m and 13m metric tonnes CO₂ in the first half of 2018. A team in Hawaii even suppose that, if Bitcoin’s adoption continues to rise, within a couple of decades, such emissions could help push global warming above 2°C. However, both the study in Nature and the team in Hawaii make assumptions about the means of energy generation. In the light of the recent disturbing UN 1.5°C Report, humanity would be wise to act on the recommendation for an “unprecedented shift in energy systems”. The hope is that such a shift towards large-scale renewable energy does occur, thus invalidating the assumptions made in those papers. Nevertheless, concerns over Bitcoin’s energy consumption remain, so Ethereum, another cryptocurrency, is investigating a more energy efficient consensus algorithm known as Proof of Stake. This method differs from Proof of Work because miners on this network use their economic stake to prove transactions and therefore, they are not performing energy intensive calculations. That introduces some complications – not least, how to ensure that people in this network act honestly, as they would have nothing to lose by behaving dishonestly? Ethereum’s proposed solution is to introduce penalties through measures such as penalising miners for simultaneously producing blocks on two versions of the blockchain. After all, only one of those blockchains is valid. Bitcoin’s Proof of Work overcomes such problems implicitly because it includes natural penalties since miners have to expend energy to prove transactions. In economic game theory, a Nash Equilibrium is said to be reached when a system stabilises because no one gains by changing strategy from that which produces the stable state. Since Bitcoin rewards are given to miners only if their blocks help form the valid Bitcoin blockchain, the most profitable outcome, or the Nash Equilibrium, is for each miner to act in consensus with the majority. As a result, Bitcoin’s Proof of Work algorithm has proven effective, despite the excessive energy consumption. In essence, my work looks at whether blockchains are a rebuttal to the hierarchies of capitalism. If Bitcoin promotes a way of organising that does not rely on capitalist consumption, might that indirectly drive down society’s energy use and help lessen its environmental impact? After all, consider the recent alarming WWF report, which all but blamed capitalism for the dramatic decline in wildlife populations. We need alternatives. Perhaps, then, Bitcoin’s revolutionary offer, as an alternative to capitalism, means its energy use is a price worth paying? That argument holds some weight if it drives down consumption in other areas of society because Bitcoin mining is not the primary driver behind climate change. However, even then, given the urgency of environmental degradation, if we continue to produce energy in a manner that creates so much warming CO₂, that argument may provide scant consolation. Perhaps alternative consensus schemes, such as Ethereum’s Proof of Stake, provide part of the solution. However, Bitcoin or not, if humankind is to avoid climate catastrophe, we need to take urgent action and find solutions that produce clean, sustainable energy. If we do that, humanity will benefit, and as a by-product, so will Bitcoin.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Steven Huckle, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-07T12:30:02Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eBitcoin recently turned \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/bitcoin-turns-ten-heres-how-it-all-started-and-what-the-future-might-hold-105782\"\u003eten years old\u003c/a\u003e.

Initiative Q, which is aggressively marketing itself on social media, wants you to think so. It urges you to sign up now, and get your friends to do so as well, to maximise the value of your free “Q” currency. This has invited comparisons to pyramid schemes and suspicions about its legitimacy. It’s not a scam. It also won’t make you fabulously wealthy. It is, nonetheless, an interesting idea. I want to use institutional cryptoeconomics – the study of the basic rules governing emerging economic systems such as cryptocurrencies – to show you how Initiative Q is an interesting experiment, criticisms of its marketing methods aside. If you sign up, you might help the world discover a remarkable new payments system. Initiative Q’s marketing explicitly draws comparisons with the best-known cryptocurrency: “Think of it as Bitcoin seven years ago.” The implication is this is the next Big Thing in internet money. Yet Initiative Q also states it is not developing a cryptocurrency. The basic definition of a cryptocurrency is simply any form of digital money consisting of entries in a cryptographically secure virtual ledger, rather than physical coins and notes. In this sense “Q” can be thought of as a cryptocurrency. However, cryptocurrency is increasingly defined further as using a decentralised system to manage and secure the virtual ledger that records transactions. Bitcoin, for instance, uses blockchain technology to “distribute” the virtual ledger across a network and “decentralise” the process of coming to agreement on how to update it. Blockchain protects a cryptocurrency from manipulation by hackers or governments, but it comes with costs. Read more: Bitcoin turns ten – here\u0027s how it all started and what the future might hold Initiative Q is not like Bitcoin in most technical respects. It will not use blockchain but control the “true” ledger centrally. This makes blockchain enthusiasts uncomfortable, because it cuts against the cryptoanarchist aversion to any one group holding power over a system. But it will avoid some costs of Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies. One is the feared environmental cost of energy-intensive “proof of work” algorithms that prove to the whole network a blockchain is compiled correctly. “Q” will avoid that by the company deciding what is the “true” ledger. That also allows the company to counter fraud and resolve disputes by “reversing” transactions, where blockchains can typically only do this with an intensely difficult “hard fork”. By design the Q won’t fluctuate wildly in value, either. The goal is a stable private currency for payments processing rather than a vehicle for speculation. It is clearly designed with the current “stablecoin” trend in mind. Read more: Four factors driving the price of Bitcoin Lawrence White, who helped design “Q”, is known for advocating systems where money does not fluctuate wildly in value. He has clearly built Initiative Q around monetarist theory, which says the money supply should be controlled to keep prices stable. So the value of “Q” will not fluctuate wildly like many cryptocurrencies. All of this makes Initiative Q unlike Bitcoin, although it creates a private digital currency. My colleagues at RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub call cryptocurrencies “institutional technologies”. Anyone who wants to use the system has to act within the institutions it creates - that is, obey its fundamental rules. These systems can be privatised. Any private citizen with a laptop can write a protocol that administers large-scale institutional systems like money, which historically only the centralised state could enforce. Read more: Rise of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin begs question: what is money? For example, Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, is said to have belted out the source code for the cryptocurrency on a laptop at home during spare time. Now millions of people around the world use the system to interact every day. What’s exciting is that this allows people to invent all sorts of different institutional systems to see which ones work best – feeding a process my colleagues have called “institutional discovery”. From this perspective, what is interesting about Initiative Q is that it creates a novel blend of institutions oriented around streamlined payments processing. It is supposed to take all the good things about PayPal and improve on them. One can understand why Initiative Q’s marketing strategy has caused it to be dismissed as a “pyramid scheme”. But like any payments system, it faces “network externalities”. It needs lots of people to use it. The more people do, the more value it has. If it does succeed, though, it won’t make you fabulously wealthy. You’ll get something more like a gift card. The value of “Q” is designed to be stable, so you shouldn’t be expecting to become a crypto-billionaire. If you do sign up, you might at least enrich the field of institutional cryptoeconomics. Experiments like this are how we improve our institutions, through a process much like scientific discovery.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Brendan Markey-Towler, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-11-05T18:47:35Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eCould free units of a new digital currency end up being worth thousands of dollars?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://initiativeq.com/\"\u003eInitiative Q\u003c/a\u003e, which is aggressively marketing itself on social media, wants you to think so.

Although best known as the technology that underpins Bitcoin, blockchain is starting to disrupt other industries, from supply chains to energy trading. One of the key selling points of blockchain is that once data is added to the chain, it can’t be changed or removed. This makes blockchain trustworthy. But this same immutability makes blockchain problematic in a world where privacy laws require companies to delete your data from databases once it has served its purpose. This is known in some jurisdictions as the “right to be forgotten”. We have designed a blockchain in which users can remove their data from the database without violating blockchain’s consistency. Read more: Blockchain is useful for a lot more than just Bitcoin There is currently a growing market of Internet of Things devices, from smart homes and self-driving cars to voice assistants and smart energy meters. These devices continuously collect digital biographies of our lives. As this data is increasingly being stored on blockchains, the tension between blockchain and the right to be forgotten will only increase. Our tool could help. At its core, blockchain is a database that is jointly managed by a distributed set of participants. Whenever new data is added to the database, all the participants must agree to verify it. In this way, blockchain removes the need for a third-party, such as a bank, to verify transactions. The blockchain ledger is organised into blocks, where each block is linked to the previous block through cryptographic hash functions. These functions create a short code based on the content of the previous block, and it is not possible to guess this code without trying all possible codes. Chaining the blocks in this manner ensures that the data stored in them cannot be altered, as any changes made would break the blockchain consistency. This makes blockchains immutable. It also makes blockchain data easy to trace and audit, particularly for large networks like the Internet of Things. These features are highly attractive for organisations operating across organisational boundaries, and in environments where participants may not fully trust each other. The European Union’s recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a significant piece of legislation that is at odds with a digital economy underpinned by blockchain. The GDPR requires companies that hold people’s data to erase that data once the original purpose they needed it for is complete. That means that people must be able to remove their data from third party databases after a certain period of time. Blockchain – being unchangeable – presents an obstacle to exercising that right. Read more: What Wikipedia can teach us about blockchain technology Let’s say you live in smart home that uses sensor data to monitor your home security. You have a home insurance policy and, in order to receive lower premiums, you allow your smoke alarm and security sensor data to be recorded on a blockchain. The blockchain data can be accessed by the police, the fire department and the insurance company so they can audit any smoke alarm or security events. Once your insurance period has ended, you should be able to remove your security data from the blockchain to enhance your privacy. If you left your data on the blockchain indefinitely, that would increase the risk of your data being identified as yours, and your activities being tracked by any entity with access to the blockchain. A blockchain participant typically uses one or more public keys as its identities. The transactions in blockchain are stored anonymously, as there is no direct link between the public keys and the real participant identity. But a breach in identity in any of the transactions, for instance by linking the transaction content to other known data about the user, leads to all interactions of the users’s devices, stored in blockchain, to be tracked by all blockchain participants. So being able to the remove data from the blockchain without “breaking the chain” would be beneficial for user privacy. It would also be beneficial to save storage space on the servers that store blockchain ledgers. But currently, removing data from a blockchain is not possible without breaking the blockchain’s consistency. We have come up with a solution that makes it possible to remove your detailed transaction data from a blockchain database, without removing the auditable trace that the transaction took place. As described in our peer-reviewed publication this month, Memory Optimised Flexible Blockchain allows you to temporarily store, summarise, or completely remove your transactions from blockchain, while maintaining the blockchain’s consistency. The remaining trace of the data (its hash) on the blockchain can still be used in the future, in case disputes over what happened arise. For instance, if a home owner wanted to verify that a break-in took place at their house under a previous insurance policy, they could provide a private copy of the data with its associated hash. A legal authority could then compare the hash of the person’s data with the hash that is still stored on the shared blockchain and thereby validate the authenticity of the person’s claim. This approach provides you with full administrative control of your blockchain-stored data. It makes it possible for you to remove or summarise this data, without sacrificing the ability to audit the data in the future.

In this way, you can reclaim control of any previously shared data and exercise your right to be forgotten in the age of blockchain.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Raja Jurdak, Ali Dorri, Salil S.

Similar voting schemes have been tried elsewhere in various places around the world. As researchers in the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts, we believe in the transformative potential of blockchain systems in a number of industries. Best known as the technology behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, blockchains can do much more than allow anonymous strangers to send each other money without fear of fraud or tampering. They have created new ways for people to invest in technology ventures that have attracted billions of dollars, and may someday store records that make educational credentials, land ownership and food origins more transparent and harder to forge. Blockchains might sound like an ideal remedy for the trust problems caused by internet voting. Data can only be added to a blockchain – not deleted or changed – because multiple copies are stored on computers owned by different people or organizations and perhaps spread across different countries. Strict controls can be placed on a blockchain’s contents, preventing unauthorized data from being added. And blockchains are designed to be transparent – with their contents often readable by anyone’s computing device anywhere in the world. Yet as scholars who have studied traditional and blockchain-based voting, we believe that while blockchains may help with some specific issues, they can’t fix the basic problems with internet voting. In fact, they could make things worse. For years, experts on election security have warned that the internet is too dangerous for such socially crucial and time-sensitive functions as voting. Renowned cryptographer Ronald Rivest, for instance, has remarked that “Best practices for internet voting are like best practices for drunk driving” – there’s no safe way to do either one. The stakes are enormous. Democracy requires widespread public trust – not just that a declared winner actually received the largest number of votes, but in the integrity of the system as a whole. People need to trust that the votes they cast are the ones that are counted, that their neighbors’ votes are totaled accurately and not the result of bribery or coercion and that local tallies are communicated safely to state election officials. Even advanced computing devices today cannot provide such assurances. Most hardware and software are rife with hidden security flaws, and are not regularly updated. Devices are vulnerable, and so are networks. Internet outages – even caused by trivialities like gamers trying to get a leg up on their competitors – could prevent people from voting. Intentional, targeted attacks against internet traffic could cause major disruptions to democratic institutions on a national scale. The stability and integrity of democratic society itself are too important to be relegated to flawed computer systems. Hackers – backed by foreign governments or not – are always looking for new targets and fresh ways to sow social discord. They’ll find – and fully exploit – any technical weaknesses available to them. Without a paper trail, the very possibility that someone could have secretly changed votes will further erode public trust in democratic elections.  A key method by which blockchain voting could worsen election integrity is by claiming to increase trustworthiness without actually doing so. It’s easy to imagine a voting system in which only authorized voters could cast ballots, with those ballots indelibly recorded on a blockchain. The blockchain would act as a single authoritative election record that could not be erased or tampered with. For all intents and purposes, the record would be hack-proof. However, tallying votes on a blockchain doesn’t magically make a voter’s phone or computer secure. A vote may be securely recorded, but that means nothing if the vote was cast incorrectly to begin with. If your phone is infected with malware that switches your vote from Candidate R to Candidate D, it doesn’t matter how secure the rest of the voting system is – the election has still been hacked. In some cases, blockchains may be able to help voters detect that sort of tampering – but only if the hack-detection software itself hasn’t been hacked. In addition, some companies’ business practices undermine the potential to trust their blockchain systems. The manufacturer of the system West Virginia will use in November – like many companies manufacturing physical voting machines – is refusing to embrace the transparency that is central to the security industry, the blockchain community, and democracy itself. They are not providing public access to the cryptographic protocols at the heart of their systems, leaving the public instead to rely on the manufacturer’s promises of security. There’s no way for an independent auditor to be truly certain that the systems are free of subtle bugs or security flaws – or even massive holes that would be obvious to experts. Another way blockchain voting could worsen existing voting problems is by increasing the likelihood of vote buying. Sometimes a glass of beer is all that’s needed to bribe a voter. Vote buying is happily rare in large-scale U.S. elections, in part because the secret ballot makes verifying a bought vote very difficult and because there are serious criminal penalties. Internet voting could completely negate both of these protections. Putting votes on blockchains eliminates the secrecy of the voting booth. Encryption doesn’t help: Software can prove mathematically to a vote buyer that a voter’s device encrypted the name of a particular candidate. In addition, foreigners who might try to influence people’s votes are very hard to prosecute. Some voting companies contend that their systems publicly identify voters only by random numerical identifiers, so they aren’t subject to vote-buying or intimidation. But in many of these systems, voting identities can be linked to accounts in cryptocurrency systems – where a voter could receive a bribe, potentially without revealing who was paid, how much or by whom. Officials and companies who promote online voting are creating a false sense of security – and putting the integrity of the election process at risk. In seeking to use blockchains as a protective element, they may in fact be introducing new threats into the crucial mechanics of democracy.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ari Juels, Ittay Eyal, Oded Naor, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-10-18T10:34:12Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eLooking to \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.history.com/news/why-do-we-vote-on-a-tuesday-in-november\"\u003emodernize voting practices\u003c/a\u003e, speed \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.vox.com/2014/10/9/6951251/map-voting-time-by-state\"\u003ewaiting times at the polls\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html\"\u003eincrease voter turnout\u003c/a\u003e and generally \u003ca href\u003d\"https://civicyouth.org/why-youth-dont-vote-differences-by-race-and-education/\"\u003emake voting more convenient\u003c/a\u003e, many government officials – and some companies hawking voting systems – are looking to an emerging technology called a “blockchain.” That’s what’s behind a West Virginia program in which some \u003ca href\u003d\"https://sos.wv.gov/elections/Pages/MobileVote.aspx\"\u003evoters serving abroad in the military\u003c/a\u003e will be able to \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/08/10/west-virginia-pilots-mobile-blockchain-voting-app-overseas-voters-november-election/\"\u003ecast their votes from their mobile devices\u003c/a\u003e.

Walmart, one of the world’s largest retailers, has been piloting blockchain projects with IBM for the past 18 months. It is banking on this relationship to put pressure on the entire sector to give consumers what they want from the food industry: more transparency. In Europe, Carrefour also recently began using blockchain to track food products on several of its product lines. Read more: Everything you need to know about fresh produce and E. coli The whole idea is to better manage food recalls, farm to fork and back, and also to tackle the intricate issue of food fraud, which is receiving an increasing amount of attention. Meanwhile, many others are wondering if the investment is worth it. Consumers tend to want many things from the food industry without paying for them. Blockchain is about data, but it is mostly about accountability through enhanced digitalized transparency. With blockchain everyone knows what’s happening all at once. To use a simple analogy, think of blockchain as a hockey rink. All the data is on the ice, protected by the boards so that it can’t be altered. Everyone participating in a blockchain is in the stands. The activity on the ice lets everyone else know who is buying from whom, when, at what price and volumes. As a result, a recalled product can be traced back in seconds instead of taking days. It took investigators days to trace the source of an E. coli outbreak to contaminated romaine lettuce. They had to look through documents to find the source and the potential causes, all the way up the food chain. It would have been managed quite differently with blockchain. Food safety is an obvious driver for blockchain, but food fraud appears to be what is moving the blockchain agenda much faster these days. Blockchain technologies have been used in other sectors, but they have only recently entered the food sector. Food safety was never going to be enough for consumers to embrace blockchain. Consumers expect safety and don’t want to pay more for it. Why pay extra for a safety belt when buying a car? Food safety may have never had market currency, but food authenticity does. Fraudulent products can compromise brands and the viability of a company in a heartbeat. We have seen many cases already around the world. Food fraud is difficult to measure, but it has arguably kept food prices lower, allowing some companies to cut costs and offer lower price points. Economically motivated adulteration is a growth killer, something Walmart and Carrefour both know. To increase sales, companies must eliminate fraudulent food products from their shelves, and blockchain technologies can provide the perfect antidote. How better to deal with food fraud than by making the whole system more transparent? Transparency in the context of blockchain, however, is neither absolute nor unconditional. Each solution will offer a different level of transparency depending on how the system is set up. This is likely why grocers are jumping on the blockchain bandwagon, to exercise their power with the supply chain and generate their own rules of engagement. It is also likely making everyone else less comfortable, including processors and producers. Read more: How technology will help fight food fraud If food fraud is properly addressed, growth in the food sector can be expanded. Over the next decade or so, we should not be surprised to see the disruptive nature of blockchain technologies generate tensions among grocers, processors and producers as they try to cope with grocers’ impositions. Other sectors made traceability a priority decades ago. Drugs, car parts, minerals and so on can be tracked to their sources in seconds. Consumers know the technology exists and are putting the pressure on grocers. It’s time for the food industry to catch up.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Sylvain Charlebois, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-10-17T22:55:57Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIn the wake of this year’s large E. coli outbreak, Walmart notified its leafy green suppliers that \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/lettuce-blockchain-walmart-s-push-lends-legitimacy-much-hyped-technology-n916406\"\u003ethey must be using blockchain technology to trace their products before the end of 2019\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWalmart, one of the world’s largest retailers, has been \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/food-trust/get-started\"\u003epiloting blockchain projects with IBM for the past 18 months\u003c/a\u003e.

The financial community sees speculative promise in the form of trade that currently has little to no regulation. Meanwhile, others argue that it’s a distraction that detracts from the overall longevity of U.S. financial institutions. Bitcoin’s energy consumption has become a recent talking point in the debate. A Forbes article published May 30 indicates that bitcoin dramatically increases global energy consumption – and that electricity is its “Achilles heel.” I am a researcher who studies clean energy technology, specifically the transition toward decarbonized energy systems. I think that the conversation around bitcoin and energy has been oversimplified. New technologies – such as data centers, computers and before them trains, planes and automobiles – are often energy-intensive. Over time, all of these have become more efficient, a natural progression of any technology: Saving energy equates to saving costs. By talking specifically about just the consumption of energy alone, I believe many fail to understand one of the most basic benefits of renewable energy systems. Electricity production can increase while still maintaining a minimal impact on the environment. Rather than focusing on how much energy bitcoin uses, the discussion should center around who indeed is producing it – and where their power comes from. Unlocking a bitcoin requires an intense amount of computational power. Think of bitcoin as sort of a hidden currency code, where its value is derived by solving a programmable puzzle. Getting through this puzzle requires computer brainpower. Electricity is 90 percent of the cost to mine bitcoin. As such, bitcoin mining uses an exorbitant amount of power: somewhere between an estimated 30 terawatt hours alone in 2017 alone. That’s as much electricity as it takes to power the entire nation of Ireland in one year. Indeed, this is a lot, but not exorbitant. Banking consumes an estimated 100 terawatts of power annually. If bitcoin technology were to mature by more than 100 times its current market size, it would still equal only 2 percent of all energy consumption. Bitcoin is certainly consuming an increasing amount of power worldwide, but is it increasing the world’s carbon consumption? Bitcoin miners have traditionally set up shop in China, where coal supplies 60 percent of the nation’s electricity. Now, bitcoin mining is exploding in areas with cheap power, like the Pacific Northwest. Power there is mainly cheap due to the massive availability of hydropower, a low-carbon resource. Bitcoin mining in China, with a largely fossil-based electricity source, may indeed be problematic. China is already one of the world’s major contributors of carbon emissions. However, bitcoin mining in Oregon? Not the same thing. Not all types of energy generation are equal in their impact on the environment, nor does the world uniformly rely on the same types of generation across states and markets. In Europe, for example, Iceland is becoming a popular place for bitcoin mining. That nation relies on nearly 100 percent renewable energy for its production. An abundant supply of geothermal and hydropower energy makes bitcoiners’ power demand cheap and nearly irrelevant. Similarly, in the hydropower-driven Pacific Northwest, miners can still expect to turn a profit without contributing heavily to carbon emissions. Like many other aspects of the energy industry, bitcoin is not necessarily a “bad guy.” It’s simply a new, and vaguely understood, industry. The discussion about energy consumption and bitcoin is, I believe, unfair without discussing the energy intensity of new technologies overall, specifically in data centers. Rather than discussing the energy consumption of bitcoin generally, people should be discussing the carbon production of bitcoin, and understanding whether certain mining towns are adding to an already large environmental burden. Although there has been extensive discussion in the media of bitcoin’s energy consumption, I’m not aware of any studies that actually calculate the comparative carbon footprint of the bitcoin process. Global electricity consumption is going up overall. The U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that world use will increase nearly 28 percent over the next two decades. But increasing energy consumption is bad only if we aren’t shifting toward less carbon-dense power production. So far, it seems that only miners are currently shifting toward cleaner parts of the world. So perhaps people should quit criticizing bitcoin for its energy intensity and start criticizing states and nations for still providing new industries with dirty power supplies instead.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Katrina Kelly-Pitou, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-08-20T10:31:25Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe word “bitcoin” is as likely to garner feverish excitement as it is glaring criticism.

And now along comes a new concept: the blockchain-based token, which I’ve been following as a blockchain researcher and teacher of courses about cryptocurrency and blockchain tokens. In the last 18 months, digital developers have raised more than US$20 billion through a funding process called “initial coin offering” – many of which use tokens. There are two common categories of them: “utility” tokens and “security” tokens. Utility tokens are essentially cryptocurrencies that are used for a specific purpose, like buying a particular good or service. For example, if you want to store information online, the most common way today is to become a customer of a hosting service like Google Drive, Dropbox or Amazon Web Services. You reserve a certain amount of storage space on those companies’ servers and pay for it with dollars, euros, yen or other national currencies. But there is another way. The Filecoin network, for instance, expects to provide similar cloud storage services without itself operating buildings full of massive servers. Instead, its users will store their data, in encrypted form, on the spare hard drive space of other regular people. This needs a different form of tracking of how much space a person uses, and a new way to pay all the people whose hard drives host the data. Enter the utility token, in this case called Filecoin. As a customer stores more data, the network will deduct from their balance of Filecoin tokens and will send those tokens to each storage provider based on how much data they’re hosting. Customers can buy more tokens with whatever currency they wish, and hosts can exchange them for any currency they choose – or keep them to spend on storage of their own data. In addition to automating the data use and payments, Filecoin tokens offer another advantage over regular currencies: They can be used in much smaller increments than pennies, so prices can be very accurate. Filecoin’s goal is a cloud storage system that is as trustworthy and secure as commercial operations, but decentralized. The utility token is simply a tool that makes this approach possible. A security token, sometimes called a “tokenized security” or a “crypto-security,” is more than a currency – it often represents ownership in an underlying real-world asset. Like traditional stocks or bonds, they’re regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Regular securities are tracked either on paper or – more likely these days – in a centralized database. Security tokens use a blockchain system – a decentralized database – to do the tracking of who owns which assets. Using blockchain-based security tokens expands trading beyond regular bankers’ and stock-market hours, and may enable faster finalization of transactions. In addition, a marketplace based in software that allows smart contracts can automate various aspects of regulations and reporting. Security tokens make it easy for customers to access multiple investments: Just as a single E-Trade investment account can keep records for a variety of different stocks and bonds, a blockchain-based digital wallet can do the same for a range of different security tokens, representing equity, debt and even real estate. Neither kind of token requires its own blockchain, the way the bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies do. Instead, tokens can outsource their ownership accounting systems, attaching them to preexisting blockchain ledgers. This in effect creates a new subledger, say of the Ethereum network’s ledger, just for that particular token. Every user who sends a token that is tracked and recorded on Ethereum pays a small transaction fee to the Ethereum network to validate the transaction. Tokens are still at an early stage of development. I expect to see lots of innovation around how to use them for years to come.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Stephen McKeon, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-08-02T10:35:47Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003ePeople are just becoming acquainted with the idea of digital money in the form of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, where transactions are recorded on a secure distributed database called a blockchain.

These records are scattered all over on each business’s computers – and some no doubt in filing cabinets too. They’re not all kept up to date with current information, as a person’s prescriptions change or new X-rays are taken, and they’re not easily shared from one provider to another. For instance, in Boston alone, medical offices use more than two dozen different systems for keeping electronic health records. None of them can directly communicate with any of the others, and all of them present opportunities for hackers to steal, delete or modify records either individually or en masse. In an emergency, doctors may not be able to get crucial medical information because it’s stored somewhere else. That can result in direct harm to patients. There might be a way out, toward a health care system where patients have accurate and updated records that are secure against tampering or snooping, and with data that can be shared quickly and easily with any provider who needs it. In my work on health care innovation at the Center for Health Law Studies, at Saint Louis University School of Law, I have been following the rise of a technology that may help us address the weaknesses in today’s health care record-keeping: blockchain. Blockchain systems, best known in connection with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, are networks of databases stored in different places that use securely encrypted messages to connect with each other over the internet. Information can’t be deleted, but it can be updated – though only by authorized users, whose identities are recorded along with their actions. That would keep years of patient data secure and make any human errors in data entry easy to track down and correct. Patients themselves could review and update information, and even add new information they collect or observe about their own conditions. Both hacking and fraud would be extremely difficult. There are many blockchain systems, each with its own security methods and practices, but developers are working to help them connect with each other, working out how to make the process of collecting records much cheaper and faster than today. Blockchain can also help other areas of the health care industry. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are developing blockchain-based systems to share data on threatening pathogens, analyze outbreaks, and manage the response to public health crises. Some commentators have even suggested that a blockchain system might help track opioid use and abuse. Clinical trials, too, may benefit from blockchain. Today, patchy data and inefficient communication among all players involved in clinical trials pose serious problems. The drug discovery and development processes could see similar benefits. Pharmaceutical companies currently monitor drug shipments and delivery through an inefficient web of scattered databases. In 2017, Pfizer and other drugmakers announced their support for MediLedger, seeking to transfer those tasks to a blockchain – which Walmart is already doing to track its food shipments. In addition to the major pharmaceutical companies’ supply-tracking experiment, other major U.S. health-care companies are beginning to explore blockchain technology. In early 2018, five of the country’s largest health-care companies started using a blockchain system to collect data on health-care providers’ demographics. What’s most striking about this collaboration – including a medical claim processor and a national medical testing lab – is that it includes major health insurers that directly compete against each other: Humana and the UnitedHealth Group. That signals a potential shift toward industry-wide approaches to handling health care data. Europe offers some examples and useful guides for U.S. efforts to use blockchains in health care. In 2016, the European Union began funding a multinational collaboration with privacy companies and leading research universities to build a blockchain system that would aggregate and share biomedical information between health care organizations and individual patients all across the EU. Among other things, this would offer patients secure personal health data accounts online, accessible from computers and mobile devices. Using a similarly collaborative approach, Sweden recently began rolling out an interoperable blockchain health data platform called CareChain. CareChain is being publicized as “infrastructure that is owned and controlled by no one and everyone.” Companies and individual people can use the system to store health information from disparate sources. The system also lets developers create apps and services that can access the information, to analyze users’ data and offer them tips, ideas and products to improve their health. Offering an idea of what’s possible is Estonia, which since 2012 has been using blockchain technology to secure health care data and transactions, including putting 95 percent of health data in electronic form. All of the country’s health care billing is handled electronically, and 99 percent of its prescriptions are digital. That’s a future the U.S. could look forward to, as it experiments on its own and learns from the experience of these existing projects.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ana Santos Rutschman, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-07-19T10:42:01Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe sprawling U.S. health care industry has trouble managing patient information: Every doctor, medical office, hospital, pharmacy, therapist and insurance company needs different pieces of data to properly care for patients.

Bitcoin transactions are essentially a series of puzzles stored in public on the blockchain. The puzzles used to protect bitcoin are so complex that current computer technology isn’t powerful enough to crack them. But quantum computers could crack these puzzles in coming decades. Here’s how it could happen to your bitcoin. Read more: Quantum computers could crack existing codes but create others much harder to break Traditional currencies rely on trusted intermediaries like banks to verify and record all monetary transactions. The cryptocurrency economy instead relies on a public ledger – the blockchain – which is maintained by all honest participants of the bitcoin network. Banks are usually required by law to authenticate the sender and recipient of any transaction. But cryptocurrency transactions can, in principle, be performed anonymously. Imagine a hypothetical potential bitcoin recipient called Alice. She must first create a unique and extremely difficult puzzle that can only be easily solved using a secret hint (called a private key) that she keeps to herself. Moreover, it must be easy to verify that the solution is correct. This is done using another hint (called a public key). After this happens, Alice sends the puzzle out to anybody who would like to send bitcoins to her. Now imagine a sender; let’s call him Bob. If Bob wants to send bitcoin to Alice, he will submit a transaction to the network that contains two ingredients: Alice’s puzzle and a solution to a puzzle unlocking funds sent to Bob in a previous transaction. He’ll also reveal the public key used to verify the solution. If the solution is verified by the different participants of the network, they will assume that Bob is indeed authorised to spend his bitcoin and accept the transaction into the blockchain. Alice can now spend the funds by revealing a solution to her puzzle. In this way, the full ledger of bitcoin transactions is entirely public, while the identities of the bitcoin owners are protected. Read more: Hype and cash are muddying public understanding of quantum computing In fact, anybody who can solve one of the puzzles on the blockchain without the secret hint can access the funds stored there. Hence the only distinguishing feature of the intended recipients is that they can solve these puzzles more efficiently than others, thanks to the secret hint only they know. Most puzzles used for bitcoin take the form of signatures. Namely, bitcoin transactions are electronically signed using a really complicated algorithms based on what mathematicians call elliptic curves. The idea is that creating such a signature is prohibitively difficult for any computer unless one holds the secret key, and that it can be verified easily using the public key. However, while these signatures indeed appear impossible to fake for today’s computers, quantum computers can potentially solve them very efficiently. This is possible because quantum computers are not restricted to processing digital information, but instead perform calculations directly using the quantum mechanical interactions that dominate physics at a microscopic scale. Researchers are still trying to find out exactly what kind of problems quantum computers are superior at solving. But we do know that two problems underlying much of today’s cryptography happen to be ones that tomorrow’s quantum computers may be able to solve quite efficiently (for the experts at home, in addition to solving elliptic curves, the other problem is finding the prime factors of a number). In particular, elliptic curve cryptography can be broken running a variant of Shor’s algorithm. This algorithm is able to compute the secret key from the public key efficiently, and thus is able to create signatures quickly once the public key is revealed. This can’t be done using today’s computers. In fact, we believe that only quantum computers will ever be able to perform this computation. Read more: What Wikipedia can teach us about blockchain technology The current mechanics of bitcoin mean the public key is only revealed with the signature when a transaction is proposed to the network. Hence there is a very short window of opportunity for a quantum computer to calculate the private key from the public key and present an alternative signed transaction (for example, making Bob’s money go to the thief instead of to Alice). We can think of this attack as analogous to robbing a customer just before he enters a bank to deposit money. Making things worse, for many bitcoin transactions the public key is actually already known and stored on the blockchain. This removes the timing constraint for the above attack and allows a thief to steal funds even if no transaction is proposed. This affects approximately a third of the bitcoin market capital, or several tens of billions of dollars. This is more like a traditional bank robbery where the thief doesn’t have to wait for a customer to make transactions. It is hard to predict when quantum computers will be strong and fast enough to perform these attacks, but it is fair to assume that we are safe for at least the next ten years. It is important that researchers find alternatives to elliptic curve cryptography that are resistant against attacks by quantum computers. And although no standard has emerged yet, alternative cryptocurrencies that take quantum computers into account are being developed right now. So even if bitcoin might ultimately succumb to quantum computers, blockchain and cryptocurrencies will certainly live on.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Marco Tomamichel, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-07-15T18:47:08Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eCryptocurrencies like \u003ca href\u003d\"http://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\"\u003ebitcoin\u003c/a\u003e have recently captured the public’s imagination because they offer an exciting alternative to traditional monetary systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitcoin transactions are essentially a series of puzzles stored in public on the blockchain.

The Cambridge English dictionary defines it as “false stories that appear to be news, spread on the internet or using other media, usually created to influence political views or as a joke”. As part of a global push to curb the spread of deliberate misinformation, researchers are trying to understand what drives people to share fake news and how its endorsement can propagate through a social network. But humans are complex social animals, and technology misses the richness of human learning and interactions. That’s why we decided to take a different approach in our research. We used the latest techniques from artificial intelligence to study how support for – or opposition to – a piece of fake news can spread within a social network. We believe our model is more realistic than previous approaches because individuals in our model learn endogenously from their interactions with the environment and not just follow prescribed rules. Our novel approach allowed us to learn a number of new things about how fake news is spread. The main take away from our research is that when it comes to preventing the spread of fake news, privacy is key. It is important to keep your personal data to yourself and be cautious when providing information to large social media websites or search engines. The most recent wave of technological innovations has brought us the data-centric web 2.0 and with it a number of fundamental challenges to user privacy and the integrity of news shared in social networks. But as our research shows, there’s reason to be optimistic that technology, paired with a healthy dose of individual activism, might also provide solutions to the scourge of fake news. Existing literature models the spread of fake news in a social network in one of two ways. In the first instance, you could model what happens when people observe what their neighbours do and then use this information in a complicated calculation to optimally update their beliefs about the world. The second approach assumes that people follow a simple majority rule: everyone does what most of their neighbours do. But both approaches have their shortcomings. They cannot mimic what happens when someone’s mind is changed after several conversations or interactions. Our research differed. We modelled humans as agents who develop their own strategies on how to update their views on a piece of news given their neighbours’ actions. We then introduced an adversary that tried to spread fake news and compared how efficient the adversary was when he had knowledge about the strength of other agents’ beliefs compared to when he didn’t. So in a real world example, an adversary determined to spread fake news might first read your Facebook profile and see what you believe, then tailor his disinformation to try and match your beliefs to increase the likelihood that you share the fake news he sent to you. We learnt a few new things about how fake news is spread. For example, we show that providing feedback about news that’s been shared means that its easier for people to detect fake news. Our work also suggests that artificially injecting a certain amount of fake news into a social network can train users to better spot fake news. Crucially, we can also use models like ours to come up with strategies on how to curb the spread of fake news. There are three things we have learned from this research about what everyone can do to stop fake news. Because humans learn from their neighbours, who learn from their neighbours, and so on, everybody who detects and flags fake news can help prevent the spread of fake news on the network. When we modelled how the spread of fake news can be prevented, we found the single best way was to allow users to provide feedback to their friends about a piece of news they shared. Beyond pointing out fake news, you can also praise a friend when they share a well researched and balanced piece of quality journalism. Importantly, this praise can happen even when you disagree with the conclusion or political point of view expressed in the article. Studies in human psychology and reinforcement learning show that people adapt their behaviour in response to negative and positive feedback – particularly when this feedback comes from within their social circle. The second big lesson was: keep your data to yourself. The web 2.0 was built on the premise that companies offer free services in exchange for users’ data. Billions followed the siren’s call, turning Facebook, Google, Twitter, and LinkedIn into multi-billion dollar behemoths. But as these companies grew, more and more data was collected. Some estimate that as much as 90% of all the world’s data has only been created in the past few years. Do not give your personal information away easily or freely. Whenever possible, use tools that are fully encrypted and very little information is collected about you online. There is a more secure and more privacy-focused alternative for most applications, from search engines to messaging apps. Social media sites don’t yet have privacy-focused alternatives. Luckily the emergence of blockchain has provided a new technology that could solve the privacy-profitability paradox. Instead of having to trust Facebook to keep your data secure, you can now put it on a decentralised blockchain that was designed to operate as a trustless environment.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Co-Pierre Georg, Christoph Aymanns, Jakob Foerster, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-07-12T14:46:00Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe term “fake news” has become ubiquitous over the past two years.

We then introduced an adversary that tried to spread fake news and compared how efficient the adversary was when he had knowledge about the strength of other agents’ beliefs compared to when he didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo in a real world example, an adversary determined to spread fake news might first read your Facebook profile and see what you believe, then tailor his disinformation to try and match your beliefs to increase the likelihood that you share the fake news he sent to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe learnt a few new things about how fake news is spread. For example, we show that providing feedback about news that’s been shared means that its easier for people to detect fake news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur work also suggests that artificially injecting a certain amount of fake news into a social network can train users to better spot fake news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCrucially, we can also use models like ours to come up with strategies on how to curb the spread of fake news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are three things we have learned from this research about what everyone can do to stop fake news.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFighting fake news\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause humans learn from their neighbours, who learn from their neighbours, and so on, everybody who detects and flags fake news can help prevent the spread of fake news on the network. When we modelled how the spread of fake news can be prevented, we found the single best way was to allow users to provide feedback to their friends about a piece of news they shared.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond pointing out fake news, you can also praise a friend when they share a well researched and balanced piece of quality journalism. Importantly, this praise can happen even when you disagree with the conclusion or political point of view expressed in the article. \u003ca href\u003d\"http://neuro.bstu.by/my/Tmp/2009-semester-project/Papers-on-cliff/ReinforcementLearningSutton.pdf\"\u003eStudies\u003c/a\u003e in human psychology and reinforcement learning show that people adapt their behaviour in response to negative and positive feedback – particularly when this feedback comes from within their social circle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second big lesson was: keep your data to yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe web 2.0 was built on the premise that companies offer free services in exchange for users’ data.

In Haiti, for instance, a large earthquake in 2010 destroyed all the municipal buildings that stored documents confirming many small farmers’ ownership of the land they worked. Even years later, many farmers didn’t have proof that they were landowners. People are still fighting over their land. This sort of problem – caused by natural disasters or not – is widespread, causing financial hardship for families in the developing world. Without an official, enforceable legal title to their property, people can’t resolve disputes over who can use which land for what – like who can farm where. They also can’t borrow against their existing assets to invest in their homes, businesses or communities. The value of those properties, and the lost economic opportunities for owners of assets without formal documentation, has been estimated at US$20 trillion worldwide. From researching blockchains and cryptocurrencies for the past three years, I have become convinced that these technologies have the potential to fight root causes of poverty – including by securely recording property ownership. I’m far from alone: Blockchain-based land registries have started up in Bermuda, Brazil, Georgia, Ghana, Honduras, India, Russia and Rwanda. The problems these efforts are addressing are significant. Across the world, land registries are inefficient and unreliable – or even downright corrupt. In Honduras, some government officials altered the country’s land ownership database, stealing property for themselves – including beachfront getaways. In many African countries, more than 90 percent of rural land is not registered. In Ghana, 78 percent of land is unregistered, and the country’s courts have a long backlog of land dispute cases. In India, millions of rural families lack legal ownership of the land they live and work on. The lack of secure land ownership is a bigger cause of poverty in the country than the caste system or a high illiteracy rate. Brazil has no single centralized land registry. Instead, about 3,400 private agents – called “cartorios” – register and check land ownership. The system is confusing, with many different documents created in different historical periods. Most land documents lack specific geographic references on property boundaries. Little wonder, then, that the system is plagued by corruption and double allocations – two formal documents each saying someone else owns a piece of land. These fragile and incomplete property rights systems in the developing world can affect the entire planet. In Brazil’s Amazon rainforest, illicit land grabbers forge deeds and use violence and bribery to falsely claim ownership of property, often under fake names, which the locals call “fantasmas,” or “ghosts.” Then they clear-cut the rainforest, which has serious environmental effects. Having “improved” the land by converting it to pasture, these land thieves then are eligible to register as the formal owners of the land they stole. This cycle has repeated for years, contributing to widespread Amazon deforestation. Using a blockchain system to record transactions could help solve these problems. A blockchain is a secure database that’s stored in a distributed – but connected – set of computers around the internet. It’s not susceptible to tampering, and every addition to the database must be digitally signed, making clear who’s changing what and when. So instead of a system with multiple conflicting documents, some of which may have been forged or altered, there’s only one record with a clear history of modifications, including who did what when. Blockchain transactions can include all kinds of information, including geographic boundaries or serial numbers and an owner’s identity. In Ghana, for instance, the nonprofit Bitland runs a blockchain-based land registry system with a written description of each parcel of land as well as GPS coordinates of boundary points and satellite photos of the area. A collaboration between a U.S.-based blockchain startup and a Brazilian real estate registry has created a record-keeping system for land in the southern coastal municipalities of Pelotas and Morro Redondo. Its blockchain database contains details like the property’s address, the owner’s name and contact information, zoning rules and a unique identification number for the property itself. Blockchain can provide other advantages too. For instance, when transferring land in the republic of Georgia, the buyer and the seller go to a public registry house and pay a fee between $50 and $200. Moving this process onto a blockchain could drop the costs to no more than 10 cents. Just starting a blockchain-based database isn’t enough to solve these problems, though. Data must be accurate when it’s entered, and records must include enough information to be authoritative about the properties they’re referring to. A new technological system won’t fix much in countries where it’s hard to determine the legitimate owner in the first place. Also, bureaucrats may object to new record-keeping systems that reduce their power, status and privileges. However, in places where governments or others who create the systems are viewed as fair and impartial and run a transparent process, blockchain-based land registry systems could give many of the world’s poorest people their first real asset. Once they have straightened out complex, corrupt and contradictory registry systems, people can safely invest in, borrow against and truly improve their properties, helping lift themselves out of poverty.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nir Kshetri, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-06-28T10:36:30Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eMany developing countries don’t have a working system of tracking property rights, and what they do have can be fragile and incomplete.

Expert explains","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"How might the UK “take back control” of its borders without making the border in Ireland any harder. One proposal on the table is maximum facilitation (max fac). This approach does not avoid the creation of a customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland but rather aims to make the border as invisible and frictionless as possible through the use of technology. This includes electronic customs registration, unobtrusive screening techniques and even the technology behind Bitcoin. But the application of technology cannot sugarcoat the fact that being outside the customs union will have a material impact on the Irish border. Such an impact jars with the UK government’s commitment that the Irish border would have “no physical infrastructure or related checks or controls”. For it is absolutely clear what a UK-EU customs border would mean. Goods moving between the two would be subject to customs supervision and this means checks and controls. Custom authorities around the world are keen to find technological means of improving efficiency. Paper forms have steadily been replaced by electronic customs declarations, which can be submitted more easily and enable quicker movement between different customs zones. For this reason, both the UK and the EU are in the process of creating fully electronic customs systems. Singapore has just revealed the world’s first blockchain-based platform for electronic certificates of origin (eCOs). Blockchain is a way of recording transactions on a decentralised public register that’s very hard to tamper with, and is the technology behind bitcoin. Verification of eCOs through a private blockchain network helps prevent fraud and alterations of certificates of origin. This could address one issue that the UK and the EU face. But this doesn’t go anywhere near resolving the risk of customs fraud on the Irish border. The difficulty of policing this border was exploited by smugglers even when it was heavily securitised. More fundamentally, any solution would have to address the historical, economic and geographical realities of the Irish border, as well as its political and social significance. Read more: The Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland at 20 – The Anthill podcast The effectiveness of maximum facilitation in customs enforcement stands or falls on the scale and quality of the information the systems receive. This type of border control requires operators and travellers to pre-register for customs checks and constantly disclose accurate information to all relevant parties. When vehicles pass through approved crossings, officials can track the progress of registered vehicles (albeit without knowledge of what they are carrying). If used on a mass scale, big data can be be used to identify patterns of suspicious activity. It is also possible to gather information that is not willingly – nor wittingly – submitted by those crossing the border. Sensors buried in the ground or micro synthetic aperture radar on drones in the air could detect unexpected vehicle movement across a border. Such technology may have its uses in unpopulated, inhospitable plains where border crossings are almost automatically suspect. But as a means of monitoring a border that is literally criss-crossed with small roads and straddled by farms, households and parishes, it is as redundant as it is offensive. Just think how the residents of Dover or Holyhead would respond to the idea of being constantly surveilled by drones or mobile phone tracing. Those in the Irish border region have recent experience of close surveillance and border controls. Twenty years on from the Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement, the negative consequences of militarised security at the Irish border remain evident: economically, socially and politically. It is absolutely critical to appreciate that the achievement of a porous, unmonitored Irish border is a much-cherished sign of the peace process. Hence the promise to avoid a hard border. Another concern about customs checks is the question of how these might occur. Goods container inspections require physical infrastructure and human resources. Experience on the Irish border shows that routine customs inspections can escalate into serious operations requiring security protection. Politicians hope technology can alleviate this. There have been steady advances in non intrusive screening techniques. Vapour analysis using what’s known as neutron-activated spectroscopy could enable customs to detect the presence of certain chemical compounds. Gamma ray scanning can be used to give a type of x-ray image of what is inside a container, while Muon tomography can help customs assess the volume and location of contents in a container. But these technologies are very expensive and impractical. They are designed for a particular task, such as detecting a specific type of contraband, and are neither speedy nor invisible. Human checks on goods will remain critical to customs supervision. At the very least this will require warehouses large enough to inspect freight. Locating them away from the border does not mean no border controls, only less effective ones. For the further from the border these are located, the greater the opportunity for cargo to be swapped or stolen. Maximum facilitation can do no more than its name suggests – facilitate customs procedures. It cannot end the need for customs checks. In fact, it relies upon them. The more hidden the technology monitoring a customs border is, the greater the need for surveillance and data capture. Movements, transactions and communications across the Irish border are a precious part of everyday life for so many in Ireland, north and south. To gather data on such movements, transactions and communications for the purpose of enforcing a customs border that no one in Northern Ireland wishes to see is hardly a viable (let alone democratic) solution. Max fac could certainly conjure up more efficient and surreptitious border controls than have previously existed between the UK and Ireland. But the sugar-coating of technology would hardly last long before the bitter reality of enforcing a UK-EU customs border in Ireland was revealed.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Katy Hayward, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-05-23T09:29:11Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eHow might the UK “take back control” of its borders without making the border in Ireland any harder.

Its future will likely be as unpredictable as its past given that it’s a currency propped up by risk-takers, a target of lawmakers and tied to nothing more substantial than an algorithm. But there are certain variables and concurrent conditions that are signals worth watching when considering Bitcoin’s future. An international research team comprised of me, Theodore Panagiotidis at the University of Macedonia in Greece and Orestis Vravosinos at the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics in Spain recently analyzed a broad spectrum of data representing several years in the life of Bitcoin. It was our attempt to reach a deeper understanding of what drives the cryptocurrency’s value. Can you really predict how investors will behave around something with so many layers of complexity — around what is essentially a black box system and the subject of so much hype? It’s not an easy task. We set out to bring a measure of predictability to the path the cryptocurrency will take. We looked closely at 21 variables that could potentially affect Bitcoin returns. Vital market determinants like gold and oil prices, various currency exchange rates and stock market indexes from around the world were part of the mix. Government policy-related economic uncertainty, along with the internet search intensity of Bitcoin, were crucial areas of our research. We took more than 2,500 observations of variables spanning a seven-year period and filtered it through what’s known as a LASSO — a “least absolute shrinkage and selection operator.” It’s an analytical model to determine what the possible predictors, or covariates, might be. We found that of all the many variables, the amount of online chatter about Bitcoin, along with gold returns, and uncertainty over government policy stand out as possible predictors. Having said that, Bitcoin is a moving target that appears not to conform to any logical patterns. In relationship to gold, Bitcoin’s value tends to rise as gold rises. But will that remain consistent if the economy stumbles? In those circumstances, investors seek the safer haven of gold, American dollars and euros, entities they know to have value supported by governments and central banks. The riskier currencies, like the crypto ones, might be abandoned. There are many cryptocurrencies in circulation, but Bitcoin has outstripped them all in popularity, mostly because it is cloaked in mystery and because of the media attention surrounding its dramatic value fluxes. There is a fascination with something that is new, that is technologically created and that’s hard to hack. The idea of having a Bitcoin network that can evade governments is alluring to people. We found that the general chatter and interest surrounding Bitcoin, positive and negative alike, is a main determinant of its value. We used Google and Wikipedia analytics to measure the hype. Bitcoin as a means of exchange has been running under the radar of regulation over the entirety of its nine-year lifespan. But we cannot see that scenario continuing for long. And it seems that investors are also mindful of the looming possibility of regulatory oversight since Bitcoin’s value tends to respond negatively when there is speculation about government action. With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, transactions are conducted free of taxation. We can’t be sure what the nature of those transactions are, but often cryptocurrencies are used to avoid taxes or duties, or to engage in illicit commerce, which makes them even more shadowy, darkly appealing currencies. It’s not clear how governments will ultimately respond to this tax-free commerce, but we can be certain that they’ll eventually act. Wherever there are goods and services changing hands and money is being made, government is eager to get a piece of the action. If cryptocurrencies continue to grow and position themselves as systems that are beyond the influence of banks and the reach of government regulation, we can be sure that governments will enact national laws and take their share of the proceeds. Many people believe that Bitcoin is going to replace the money we currently use, but we doubt it. That’s because big government will never allow it. Governments want the tax revenues, and they want control. Once governments begin to demand access to Bitcoin transaction records, especially those carried out with mainstream businesses, it is likely that regulations will follow. Once that happens, the black box will be opened and Bitcoin’s appeal as an underground tax avoidance scheme will be lost. Bitcoin’s fate is therefore highly unpredictable and dependent on what governments will do in the future. Once the crytocurrency was taken seriously by gamblers and techies, it became volatile, and that volatility is showing no signs of abating.

Read more: Why accountants of the future will need to speak blockchain and cryptocurrency if they want your money A blockchain is a decentralised, distributed and open public ledger made up of a sequence of “blocks” that are “chained” via a cryptographic hash. If that still sounds like gibberish to you, there is a popular application that shares the philosophy of the blockchain technology that can help you understand how it works: Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that depends on the collaborative effort of decentralised volunteer writers called “Wikipedians” who add to this constantly increasing repository of information. Despite being based on a central database, Wikipedia is decentralised in the sense that the ability to add information is completely open and public. This freedom to add information to the database, or ledger, and the freedom to access the full history of all previous changes, is similar to a blockchain. While traditional encyclopedias rely on scholars to provide information, Wikipedia gives this role to the public, bypassing trusted authorities. Similarly, Bitcoin gives the role of the intermediary to the public, bypassing traditional central intermediaries such as banks. Wikipedians contribute information with the aim of improving the quality of the existing information. If an edit on Wikipedia is not accepted by other contributors it will be changed until a consensus is reached. If no consensus can be reached, the “edit war” is settled by an appointed authority. The consensus in Bitcoin follows the greatest amount of work expended by the Bitcoin network consisting of “miners”, and is represented by the longest blockchain. Miners verify transactions and expend resources to complete the “proof-of-work”. Once the work is complete the network will show their acceptance by linking new blocks to the existing one. Contributions made by Wikipedians are transparent, similar to the open and publicly accessible transaction history of any user’s Bitcoin wallet stored on the blockchain. The time-stamped history of all edits made to the Wikipedia page is visible through the “View History”. Just as each Bitcoin can be traced to its inception, all prior versions and iterations of a Wikipedia entry are publicly available and show the path towards the current consensus. The dynamic evolution of content within Wikipedia is a major difference from traditional encyclopedias, which offer a more centralised and more static repository of information. Read more: Why it would be in everybody\u0027s interests to regulate cryptocurrencies Both Wikipedians and bitcoin miners replace the necessity for trusted central authorities. Interestingly, the incentive to contribute to the network differs. Wikipedians are not financially rewarded, whereas Bitcoin miners receive Bitcoin for their contributions to the blockchain. If a miner included an invalid transaction in their block, then the cost to complete the proof-of-work would go unrewarded as honest miners would not link new blocks to the chain. Although the opportunity to vandalise and provide inaccurate information on Wikipedia exists, the transparency of edits makes it straightforward for honest writers to identify and rectify changes. This discourages devious attempts to discredit the information on Wikipedia since any attempt will be recorded as a time-stamped, unalterable chain of edits. A long chain of edits represents the amount of work Wikipedians have put into developing the topic. Longer chains can signal a higher quality of information. A feature that Wikipedia does not share with the classical blockchain is encryption. Because ownership and anonymity is an important feature on the Bitcoin blockchain, encryption of information is needed so that coins cannot be stolen or duplicated. On Wikipedia there is no ownership of information, making encryption redundant. Read more: Bitcoin rich kids in Puerto Rico: crypto utopia or crypto-colonialism? Another key difference is synchronised, simultaneous distribution. Wikipedia is not distributed because the participants of the network do not update and store the information on their computers. If they did, it would be very costly and thus very inefficient – a major drawback of distributed systems. Decentralisation is also inefficient as it generally takes longer to reach a consensus. But the final outcome may be better compared to a centralised system. In other words, Wikipedia may be less efficient than a traditional encyclopedia but the final edition may be much better.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Dirk Baur, Daniel Cahill, Zhangxin (Frank) Liu, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-04-12T19:53:33Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eAlmost a decade after the introduction of Bitcoin, there is a lot of hype about the blockchain technology on which cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are based.

But like all computer programs, smart contracts can malfunction and even develop a mind of their own. Smart contracts are popular because they promise cheaper, more secure and more efficient commercial transactions, so much so that even the federal government is investing millions of dollars into this technology. Transactions in smart contracts are enforced by a network of people who use the blockchain- a decentralised, digital global ledger recording transactions. The blockchain effectively replaces traditional intermediaries such as banks, credit companies and lawyers because smart contracts can perform the usual “middleman” functions themselves. Smart contracts can not only perform the terms of a contract autonomously, but can also be programmed to enter the human parties that created them into subsequent, separate follow-on contracts. Whether these follow-on contracts are legally binding is not so straightforward. In fact, it highlights the complex intersection of new technology and old law. US law professor Harry Surden says financial firms often program computers to contract with other parties in security trades. Another example of smart contracts is the pricing and purchasing of certain types of advertisements on Google, which are negotiated autonomously between computers without any human intervention. Companies are now using smart contracts to instantaneously buy and sell real estate, compensate airline passengers with travel insurance, collect debts, make rental payments, and more. But if a smart contract goes rogue, there can be significant consequences. For example, in June 2017 Canadian digital currency exchange QuadrigaCX lost US$14 million worth of the cryptocurrency Ether when its underlying smart contract platform reacted to a software upgrade. The contract merely locked itself and subsequently lost the money. Smart contracts on the blockchain are designed to be immutable, meaning the transactions they carry out cannot be amended or interrupted. So if things go wrong, there is little recourse. So what would happen if a smart contract, which has been coded to make decisions, decided to enter parties into a another contract? In some cases, the human has final say to approve or reject the follow-on contract. However, if the coding of a smart contract allowed sufficient intuition, it could bypass a human’s consent. Contracts written with code are capable of learning and may occasionally behave in a manner inconsistent with their instructions. This possibility, and the questionable status of follow-on contracts, was raised in a white paper issued by renowned international law firm Norton Rose Fulbright in November 2016. The paper highlighted a number of possible legal views regarding follow-on contracts. One view is that a programmed smart contract might be seen as the legal “agent” of its human creator and therefore has the power to make binding agreements on their behalf. This view has been rejected by some English courts on the basis that computer programs lack the consciousness of a human mind. Some American courts have gone the opposite way, deeming a computer program acting autonomously in entering and violating contracts as acting with the dispatcher’s authority. In Australia, section 15C of the Electronic Transactions Act 1999(Cth) makes clear that a contract formed entirely through the interaction of automated message systems is: …not invalid, void or unenforceable on the sole ground that no natural person reviewed or intervened in each of the individual actions carried out by the automated message systems or the resulting contract. The law can imply an agency relationship in certain circumstances. Legally, then, a follow-on contract might be regarded as pre-authorised by the human creator of the original smart contract. An alternative view is that a follow-on contract is not enforceable because the parties did not necessarily intend to create them. Legal intent is one of the core elements of contract validity. However, in law, this is determined objectively: would a reasonable person in the position of the parties think a follow-on smart contract was acting with the legal authority of its human creator? Some academics suggest that the answer may be yes, as the parties made the initial decision to enter into the smart contract and therefore indirectly assented to be bound by the system in which it operates. As one commentator has argued, if a human intentionally coded a smart contract to make its own decisions, they must have intended to accept those decisions as their own. The law generally presumes that commercial contracts are intended to be legally binding, even where computers play a part in the bargain. So should we be hesitant to use smart contracts? Not necessarily: they offer enormous opportunity for businesses and consumers. Blockchain technology is maturing rapidly and so it is only a matter of time before smart contracts feature more prominently in commerce. Rather than being fearful, prospective users should be aware of and address the legal risks, including that autonomous smart contracts may be programmed with the capacity to spontaneously enter binding follow-on contracts.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Mark Giancaspro, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-04-10T19:58:28Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThere is a lot of hype in the business world surrounding the emerging blockchain technology and so called “smart contracts” - computer programs which execute the terms of an agreement.

Blockchains are virtual ledgers on which data can be permanently stored. They are a public record, so they are very transparent and accountable. The Big Four accounting firms, IBM and JP Morgan have been driving uptake by investigating applications. Blockchains could transform everything from national government systems to payment apps for coffee chains to the fight against climate change. They are also starting to make a difference to the world’s waste problem. As we shall see, this has exciting possibilities. Despite significant progress, the weight equivalent of one SUV is still going to landfill every year for each of the circa 500m people in the EU. Waste litters our oceans, beaches and wider environment, making it one of the pressing issues of our times – not least thanks to David Attenborough’s popular Blue Planet series for the BBC, whose last episode addressed waste directly. It is becoming harder to just shift it elsewhere – witness China’s recent ban on importing plastic waste, for example. Most countries are far behind Sweden, which has such a well developed network of waste-to-energy plants that it imports waste to feed them. So where do blockchains fit in? They are a sophisticated way of recording transactions without having one central institution like a bank controlling them. They comprise a series of blocks, each containing a set of transactions such as sales of assets or other transfers of value. It’s almost impossible to tamper with the information these blocks contain, since each has a unique tag of numbers and letters known as a cryptographic hash, overlaid with other complicated security mechanisms. Blockchains are so reliable that the ability of governments and central banks to control currency in future is very much in question. Various waste initiatives have seen potential to incorporate this technology. One is the Plastic Bank, a global recycling venture founded in Canada to reduce plastic waste in developing countries – so far Haiti, Peru, Colombia and the Philippines, with plans to extend this year. The initiative rewards people who bring plastic rubbish to bank recycling centres, and one option is blockchain-secured digital tokens. These can purchase things like food or phone-charging units in any store using the Plastic Bank app. The plastic is meanwhile bought by companies and recycled into new consumer products. The system attracts them because blockchain’s transparency means they can see where their investment goes. A more novel use of blockchains is meanwhile emerging in French rail. Waste management in stations has traditionally been chaotic, with up to six providers sorting endless rubbish. The central station in Lyon, for example, produces 360 tonnes of waste each year. A new system developed by SNCF subsidiary Arep uses blockchain to allow detailed information to be collected. There is a block for each station bin, which uses Bluetooth to continually update on quantities of each type of waste, which waste managers collected it and how it is being moved around. Station managers can use this data to see what providers have done and when. This enables them to improve waste management and optimise sorting. In a pilot, this saved almost €2,000 (£1,746) in one month in one station by facilitating a new system for collecting five different streams of waste separately. Blockchains are also being mooted to underpin a system for trading waste quotas similarly to how carbon quotas are traded under the EU Emissions Trading System. Using blockchains could help keep track of how much waste companies are producing, and could also help facilitate trading. These are various ways in which this technology can help address our waste problem, but they all focus on existing waste. They don’t look at the full life cycle of products from when they are created to when they are thrown away. For a proper life cycle approach to waste, we need to think about holding the companies responsible who made the products in the first place – as well as other companies in the supply chain, since they will potentially put pressure on the producers. We need to introduce standards to underpin this shift in responsibility, along with costly penalties for those who infringe them. Some incentives exist already – the EU’s extended producer responsibility, for example – but countries don’t tend to implement them because of issues around tracking the waste and enforcing the rules. Again, blockchain technologies could have a role here. When goods are produced, responsibility for them could be assigned. This would be recorded as a transaction to be stored in a block on the blockchain, identifying the product and the responsible party. Every time the product was transferred – when it was sold, say, or when it was disposed of in landfill – this would be recorded in a new transaction. This could all be accessible via a QR code stamped on each product. If the product then ended up as litter on a beach somewhere, the blockchain would provide a digital trail to identify who was responsible. It would be up to the government in question to determine where responsibility lay at any given time. Setting up this kind of system raises many practical considerations, of course: set-up costs, running costs, how to monitor and enforce it. But none are necessarily insurmountable. There are parallels, for example, with the EU’s system of requiring energy labels for household appliances to help consumers choose energy efficient products. When it comes to our worldwide problem with waste, it is time to think outside the box. Blockchains are already beginning to provide benefits in this area and they have much greater potential yet. If we can use them to build decentralised reliable networks for where rubbish has come from and where it ends up, it could lead to the breakthrough that has been eluding us for decades.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Katrien Steenmans, Phillip Taylor, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-04-09T13:59:24Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may fill news headlines, but attention has been shifting to the technology that underpins them: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/the-big-business-revolution-why-the-future-is-blockchain-78409\"\u003eblockchains\u003c/a\u003e.

They are a sophisticated way of recording transactions without having one central institution like a bank controlling them.

Blockchains are so reliable that the ability of governments and central banks to control currency in future is very much in question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVarious waste initiatives have seen potential to incorporate this technology. One is the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.plasticbank.org\"\u003ePlastic Bank\u003c/a\u003e, a global recycling venture founded in Canada to reduce plastic waste in developing countries – so far Haiti, Peru, Colombia and the Philippines, with \u003ca href\u003d\"https://sdg14.net/2017/06/22/social-plastic-links-the-clean-up-of-ocean-plastic-to-ending-extreme-poverty/\"\u003eplans to extend\u003c/a\u003e this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe initiative rewards people who bring plastic rubbish to bank recycling centres, and one option is blockchain-secured digital tokens.

The system attracts them because blockchain’s transparency means they can see where their investment goes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA more novel use of blockchains is meanwhile emerging in French rail. Waste management in stations has traditionally been chaotic, with up to six providers sorting endless rubbish.

For the first quarter 2018, the survey ran from February 13 to March 2, 2018. Key findings include: Firms are only slowly adapting to advances in financial technology even when they know it will affect their business models. There is record optimism among CFOs, fuelled notably by tax reform in the United States. Past results show the CFO Optimism Index is an accurate predictor of hiring plans and overall GDP growth. This quarter the optimism index in the United States increased to 71 on a 100-point scale, an all-time high, in part because of recently passed corporate tax reform. Our analysis of past results shows the CFO optimism index is an accurate predictor of future economic growth and hiring. Optimism in Europe remains at 67 this quarter, while UK CFOs had lower optimism at 54. Capital spending is expected to grow at about 5% in 2018, and employment should remain flat. For the third consecutive quarter, and only the third time ever, the top concern among European CFOs is attracting and retaining qualified employees, followed by regulatory requirements, government policies and economic uncertainty. More than 25% of European CFOs say the lower US tax rate makes the country a more attractive place to invest. Optimism in Asia fell from 66 last quarter to 61 this quarter. Economic uncertainty, access to capital, difficulty attracting qualified employees, low employee morale, and currency risk are top concerns in the region. Capital spending is expected to grow about 10% and employment 3%, in 2018. Latin American optimism continues to rebound in most countries, up to 70 in Mexico, 69 in Chile and 62 in Brazil. Optimism fell to 54 in Peru. Economic uncertainty is the top concern among Latin American CFOs, with 54% of firms listing it as a top four concern. Other concerns include weak demand, government policies and productivity. Capital spending is expected to grow 6% and employment 3% in 2018. Business optimism in South Africa jumped to 59 this quarter, up from 42 last quarter. Nigerian optimism remained relatively flat at 62. Median capital spending and median employment should each increase by about 5% in 2018. The biggest concerns for African CFOs are economic uncertainty, governmental policies, currency risk, volatility of the political situation, and access to capital. The proportion of firms indicating they are having difficulty hiring and retaining qualified employees remains at a two-decade high, with 45% of CFOs calling it a top concern, up from 43% last quarter. The median US firm says it plans to increase employment by a median 3% in 2018. The tight labour market continues put upward pressure on wages. Wage inflation is now listed near the top half dozen concerns of US CFOs. US companies expect to pay higher wages, with median wage growth of about 3% over the next 12 months. Wage growth should be strongest in the tech, energy and service/consulting industries. After difficulty finding the right employees, the next largest concern among US CFOs is the cost of benefits, with health care costs expected to rise by more than 7% next year. Concern about government policies, regulations, and data security are the next biggest concerns. Many CFOs say innovations in financial technology such as cryptocurrencies and the blockchain that underpins them will not affect their businesses. Among those who do see disruption ahead, few are responding quickly. The blockchain is widely expected to disrupt many business models over the next decade as a means of verifying ownership and allowing instant, secure, and low fee transactions. But 78% of US CFOs say they don’t expect to be affected or aren’t sure how they’ll be affected by the blockchain. 17% say their firms will be affected but haven’t yet adapted their business model in response. Another 4% say they are working to adopt blockchain, and only 1% say they have already adopted blockchain technology. Only 3% of CFOs said they had a professional understanding of blockchain. More CFOs said they have a good or professional understanding of big data (53%), advanced analytics (52%) and artificial intelligence (48%). 27% of firms said they have already reduced finance workforce or will within 5 years. However, more than 70% of firms said they do not expect to cut finance employees because of fintech advances. In the rest of the world, nearly 20% European CFOs say they understand blockchain technology well, up from only 8% who said they did two years ago. 37% say they are working on or already conduct big data analysis, about the same as two years ago. 13% of Asian CFOs say they understand blockchain technology well, and 36% say they are working on or already conduct big data analysis. One in five Latin American CFOs say they understand blockchain technology well, and 30% say they are working on or already conduct big data analysis. Only 5% of African CFOs say they understand blockchain technology well, while 35% say they are working on or already conduct big data analysis. Sixty-six percent of US CFOs say corporate tax reform is helping their companies, with 36% saying the overall benefit is medium or large. Some benefits of tax reform are already being felt, while others will unfold over the next several years. Among other things, US companies say tax reform will lead to greater profitability, investment, hiring, and wages. Forty-four% of US companies plan to increase wages more than they would have without tax reform. Thirty-eight% plan to increase employment and 36% will increase domestic investment. Thirty-one% will increase cash holdings. Among companies with defined benefit pensions, 29% will increase pension contributions. Among companies that plan to increase investment, 53% say the reduced corporate income tax rate is the reason why. Another 44% indicate immediate expensing of investment will fuel investment. The immediate expensing of investment only lasts for five years, however, and 37% of companies indicate they will shift investment so it will occur within the next five years, hence a portion of the increased investment is ‘borrowing from the future’. Due to tax reform, the effective (or average) tax rate for US companies is expected to fall by about 5%, from 24% to 18.8%.

Because by now, most of us will have heard of Bitcoin and some of us have even jumped on the bandwagon, investing in cryptocurrencies. But despite its popularity, many people still don’t understand the technology that underlines it: blockchain. In very simple terms, blockchain technology is an open access shared ledger that keeps a record of all the transactions between parties and allows all users to agree on its contents. New information is added in blocks linked to the previous blocks, resulting in a chain of blocks being built. This ledger is verified by “miners” to make sure it’s true – and so creating an audit trail. Past records can be viewed but not altered without the consent of the majority. And it is this technology that is behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin – the value of which rose almost 1400% in the past year, but has at times, also fallen massively too. It can certainly be anticipated that this evolutionary technology is set to spark a huge revolution in the business world. It’s already being trialled at governmental level, from the Sweden Land Registry, to the Big Four accountancy firm such as E\u0026Y – who accept Bitcoin as payment for its consultancy services. The Australian Securities Exchange is also considering the use of blockchain technology to replace the current clearing and settlement system of share trading. And even the Bank of England is planning its own Bitcoin-style virtual currency. Listen to The Conversation’s Anthill podcast episode: Bursting the Bitcoin bubble  Major governments around the world have acknowledged and further legitimised the use of Bitcoins as payment vehicles. In fact, more and more major companies are accepting Bitcoins – Microsoft, Virgin Galactic and Subway to name a few. It seems certain then that blockchain technology has a wide appeal. And although it may be a rocky road ahead, with countries such as India and China banning or restricting the use of cryptocurrencies, crypto is here to stay. A recent report from the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales on blockchain, claims it is fundamentally an accounting technology. In its simplest of definitions, accounting is a process of keeping records, and this is precisely what blockchain offers in a more “modern” and “foolproof” way. As once the records are agreed upon and validated, the records are bundled into blocks that are virtually impossible to change, making the technology tamper-proof. Essentially, as the business world adopts the use of accounting systems that use blockchain technology, accountants will spend less time doing the mundane tasks of bookkeeping and reconciliations, and will instead focus their energy and time on the interpretation of information and decision making. Blockchain technology will also make it easier for accountants to measure the accuracy of data. Meaning that the technology should effectively cut down on fraud and make accounting errors disappear. A report by the World Economic Forum suggests that 10% of global GDP will be stored on blockchain-related technology by 2025. This implies that the way transactions are recorded and communicated will completely transform between now and then. It it easy to see then, why accountants of the future will need to educate themselves about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies if they are to account for transactions denominated in it. The profession will evolve and adapt massively over the coming years. And in fact, auditors have already started auditing transactions in the blockchain. Universities around the world have already begun offering blockchain-related courses. Even the professional accountancy bodies now feature blockchain technology in their qualification syllabus. But of course while all this might sound a bit futuristic to some readers, the evolution of money is something that has been going on for centuries. From a barter system to gold bars, metal coins to paper money, to plastic cards. All we are looking at now, is simply the next cycle in evolution – from electronic money to cryptocurrencies.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Anwar Halari, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-20T15:20:53Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIf you haven’t already heard of Bitcoin, you either haven’t been paying attention or you’re a time traveller who just touched down in 2018.

It’s a reminder that the era of self-driving cars is fast approaching. Decades of research into advanced sensors, mapping, navigation and control methods have now come to fruition and autonomous cars are starting to hit the roads in pilot trials. But partial or full autonomy raises the question of who is to blame in the case of an accident involving a self-driving car? In conventional (human-driven) cars, the answer is simple: the driver is responsible because they are in control. When it comes to autonomous vehicles, it isn’t so clear cut. We propose a blockchain-based framework that uses sensor data to ascertain liability in accidents involving self-driving cars. Read more: We must plan the driverless city to avoid being hostage to the technology revolution Uber has suspended self-driving car tests as US authorities gather data about the circumstances surrounding the accident, which involved a car moving in autonomous mode with an operator behind the wheel.  For partially autonomous vehicles, which still involve human control, assigning liability depends on what action led to the collision and whether it was based on decisions by the driver or the vehicle. For fully autonomous vehicles, the blame can be assigned to, or shared by, one of many parties – including the manufacturer, the service centre and the vehicle owner. Manufacturers could be liable in the case of a design fault, the software provider for buggy system software, or the service centre for inadequate service to the vehicle. On the other hand, negligence liability might fall to the owner for failing to implement a software update from the manufacturer, or with the manufacturer if the accident could have been prevented by a human driver. In this complex web of potentially responsible parties, how can the circumstances surrounding an accident be determined? Fortunately, autonomous vehicles are information-rich platforms thanks to the range of sensors on board that track, monitor and measure everything. Navigation sensors determine routes. Situational awareness sensors detect obstacles, follow lane marks and read traffic signs. And performance measurement monitors track critical functions like tyre pressure and oil levels. Read more: Before hitting the road, self-driving cars should have to pass a driving test It seems an obvious solution to consider data from the vehicle sensors for liability decisions. In the event of an accident, we can readily retrieve all the sensor data to reconstruct the scene. However, the reality is more complicated. The challenge in this new ecosystem is that some of the potentially liable parties may also have disproportionate control over the sensor data. There is a risk that one of these parties may alter the data to steer the liability decision in its favour, using the wireless and USB interfaces that current vehicles already support. That means we must not only record tamper-free sensor data, but also any interactions with the vehicle. Blockchain technology can ensure there is untampered evidence of the conditions of an accident to inform decisions about liability. The solution we propose uses permissioned blockchain so that only the relevant parties can record and access information from sensors. These parties are split into two groups. The first group is the “operational partition”. It includes autonomous vehicles, manufacturers, software providers, service centres and insurance companies. It records and shares a ledger with all relevant sensor data from right before and after an accident among all the participants. The blockchain framework ensures that the sensor data and records of interactions stored in the ledger cannot be changed without detection. This provides a reliable audit trail of circumstances surrounding the incident, as well as any communication between the vehicle and the participating parties immediately prior to or following the accident. Read more: We must plan the driverless city to avoid being hostage to the technology revolution The second group is the “decision partition”. It involves the government transport authority, legal authority and the insurance company. This group is responsible for making liability decisions based on information from the operational group. The framework ensures individual vehicle owners remain anonymous to parties in the operational group. Only the decision partition has access to vehicle owner identities for final liability decisions. This contributes to maintaining user privacy while providing transparent and reliable liability decisions. Using blockchain for trust in sensor data goes beyond driverless cars, extending to smart homes, supply chains and smart grids. In smart homes, sensor data can be stored in a secure blockchain to be used for evidence in insurance liability claims such as break-ins or fires. Blockchain can also be used for storing auditable sensor data in supply chains so that consumers can trace the origin and condition of their products reliably. Finally, smart grids can benefit from peer-to-peer transactions in blockchain involving their smart meters for trusted and distributed energy trading. The “internet of things” is growing exponentially, and has introduced billions of sensors into our lives, generating unprecedented volumes of data. Blockchain will deliver sensed data we can trust. This technology is still under development, but with lives at stake when autonomous vehicles hit the road in increasing numbers, we must ensure that the liable party is held to account when things go wrong.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Raja Jurdak, Salil S.

In 2017, there were an estimated 8.4 billion internet-enabled thermostats, cameras, streetlights and other electronics. By 2020 that number could exceed 20 billion, and by 2030 there could be 500 billion or more. Because they’ll all be online all the time, each of those devices – whether a voice-recognition personal assistant or a pay-by-phone parking meter or a temperature sensor deep in an industrial robot – will be vulnerable to a cyberattack and could even be part of one. Today, many “smart” internet-connected devices are made by large companies with well-known brand names, like Google, Apple, Microsoft and Samsung, which have both the technological systems and the marketing incentive to fix any security problems quickly. But that’s not the case in the increasingly crowded world of smaller internet-enabled devices, like light bulbs, doorbells and even packages shipped by UPS. Those devices – and their digital “brains” – are typically made by unknown companies, many in developing countries, without the funds or ability – or the brand-recognition need – to incorporate strong security features. Insecure “internet of things” devices have already contributed to major cyber-disasters, such as the October 2016 cyberattack on internet routing company Dyn that took down more than 80 popular websites and stalled internet traffic across the U.S. The solution to this problem, in my view as a scholar of “internet of things” technology, blockchain systems and cybersecurity, could be a new way of tracking and distributing security software updates using blockchains. Today’s big technology companies work hard to keep users safe, but they have set themselves a daunting task: Thousands of complex software packages running on systems all over the world will invariably have errors that make them vulnerable to hackers. They also have teams of researchers and security analysts who try to identify and fix flaws before they cause problems. When those teams find out about vulnerabilities (whether from their own or others’ work, or from users’ reports of malicious activity), they are well positioned to program updates, and to send them out to users. These companies’ computers, phones and even many software programs connect periodically to their manufacturers’ sites to check for updates, and can download and even install them automatically. Beyond the staffing needed to track problems and create fixes, that effort requires enormous investment. It requires software to respond to the automated inquiries, storage space for new versions of software, and network bandwidth to send it all out to millions of users quickly. That’s how people’s iPhones, PlayStations and copies of Microsoft Word all stay fairly seamlessly up to date with security fixes. None of that is happening with the manufacturers of the next generation of internet devices. Take, for example, Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology, based near Shanghai, China. Xiongmai makes internet-connected cameras and accessories under its brand and sells parts to other vendors. Many of its products – and those of many other similar companies – contained administrative passwords that were set in the factory and were difficult or impossible to change. That left the door open for hackers to connect to Xiongmai-made devices, enter the preset password, take control of webcams or other devices, and generate enormous amounts of malicious internet traffic. When the problem – and its global scope – became clear, there was little Xiongmai and other manufacturers could do to update their devices. The ability to prevent future cyberattacks like that depends on creating a way these companies can quickly, easily and cheaply issue software updates to customers when flaws are discovered. Put simply, a blockchain is a transaction-recording computer database that’s stored in many different places at once. In a sense, it’s like a public bulletin board where people can post notices of transactions. Each post must be accompanied by a digital signature, and can never be changed or deleted. I’m not the only person suggesting using blockchain systems to improve internet-connected devices’ security. In January 2017, a group including U.S. networking giant Cisco, German engineering firm Bosch, Bank of New York Mellon, Chinese electronics maker Foxconn, Dutch cybersecurity company Gemalto and a number of blockchain startup companies formed to develop just such a system. It would be available for device makers to use in place of creating their own software update infrastructure the way the tech giants have. These smaller companies would have to program their products to check in with a blockchain system periodically to see if there was new software. Then they would securely upload their updates as they developed them. Each device would have a strong cryptographic identity, to ensure the manufacturer is communicating with the right device. As a result, device makers and their customers would know the equipment would efficiently keep its security up to date. These sorts of systems would have to be easy to program into small devices with limited memory space and processing power. They would need standard ways to communicate and authenticate updates, to tell official messages from hackers’ efforts. Existing blockchains, including Bitcoin SPV and Ethereum Light Client Protocol, look promising. And blockchain innovators will continue to find better ways, making it even easier for billions of “internet of things” devices to check in and update their security automatically. It will not be enough to develop blockchain-based systems that are capable of protecting “internet of things” devices. If the devices’ manufacturers don’t actually use those systems, everyone’s cybersecurity will still be at risk. Companies that make cheap devices with small profit margins, so they won’t add these layers of protection without help and support from the outside. They’ll need technological assistance and pressure from government regulations and consumer expectations to make the shift from their current practices. If it’s clear their products won’t sell unless they’re more secure, the unknown “internet of things” manufacturers will step up and make users and the internet as a whole safer.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nir Kshetri, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-03-07T11:40:49Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe world is full of connected devices – and more are coming.

Blockchain technology is poised to revolutionise almost everything from supply chains (including illegal fishing and human rights abuses), insurance and health. It is flourishing in an open-source environment, which raises the question whether our current intellectual property laws are fit for purpose to foster innovation. Read more: Demystifying the blockchain: a basic user guide Intellectual property laws, such as patents and copyright, are premised on the incentive theory. To incentivise people to create, they are given, in effect, a monopoly (with some exceptions) on their creations and can go to court and stop others from free-riding on their work. The digital world has made the tension between innovators and free riders even more acute. In the pre-digital era, copying a book incurred considerable costs for the copier. Now, given that digital files can be copied indefinitely for near zero cost, one could argue that we need even stronger IP laws to prevent rampant and unfair copying. But theory does not always match reality. History is littered with examples of patents harming rather than aiding innovation. James Watt’s steam engine was an advance over existing steam engines, yet the technology could not be built upon because of Watt’s patents. It was not until the patents expired — one of which had inexplicably been extended by Parliament — that steam power came into its own in driving the industrial revolution. We should not be surprised that patent law can harm innovation. The English Crown used patents to raise revenue and patents were granted over common goods such as salt. Such was the public outcry, James I was forced to revoke the existing monopolies and only grant them for novel inventions. In the United States, patents were granted for inventions, such as a textile spinning machine, that the government knew were stolen from the United Kingdom. In 1950, in his review of the patent system for the US congress, the distinguished economist Fritz Machlup wrote: If we did not have a patent system, it would be irresponsible, on the basis of our present knowledge of its economic consequences, to recommend instituting one. But since we have had a patent system for a long time, it would be irresponsible, on the basis of our present knowledge, to recommend abolishing it. Countries’ use of law to protect themselves at the expense of others is, of course, not limited to patents. At one time the United States was an unabashed copyright pirate. The US was keen to educate its population and refused to grant copyright protection to works published by non-citizens such as Charles Dickens. The first blockchain application, Bitcoin, was not patented. It is not unique in this regard. Sir Tim Berners-Lee did not patent the world wide web. Likewise the internet was released to the public free from patent restrictions. The lack of patents has meant that blockchain’s rate of development has been nothing short of breathtaking. Bitcoin, released in 2009, has a block time (the time it takes for a transaction to be recorded) of around 10 minutes. Ethereum, released in 2015 and designed to fix some of Bitcoin’s shortcomings, has a block time of around 14 seconds. The key for blockchain’s rapid development is that the source code is open source. People are free to copy the code and improve upon it. A deliberate decision is made not to use copyright law to protect the source code, unlike proprietary software. In addition, traditional industries work on products in secret for many years until they are released. In contrast, many blockchain entrepreneurs explain what they are doing before they have anything to release. Some even provide that information before they have started to build anything. Others are able to use those ideas and create competing products. Indeed, blockchain has turned conventional thinking on its head. If the community does not like what a blockchain technology is doing, it can fork the blockchain (copy the blockchain and its data) and create a competing one. This happened when Ether Classic was created (a copy of the Ethereum blockchain), and Bitcoin Cash (a copy of Bitcoin). Innovation is progressing so fast that Bitcoin’s blockchain is now comparatively primitive technology. More recent technology such as IOTA and Hashgraph makes blockchain look dated. However, without Bitcoin there would be no IOTA or Hashgraph – both were designed to fix blockchain’s limitations. People can make money in the absence of intellectual property protection. Large corporations have made their money through using open source software and providing additional services, for which they charge. Red Hat, an open-source software company, generates more than US$2 billion in revenue. IBM is building blockchain solutions for numerous multinational companies such as Maersk and Walmart using Hyperledger Fabric, an open source programme from the Linux Foundation. The question is: are our current intellectual property laws fit for purpose if three paradigm-shifting technologies – the internet, the world-wide-web and now the blockchain – are flourishing in the absence of protection under such laws?

The recent warning that electricity use at bitcoin mining facilities in Iceland may exceed that consumed annually by the country’s homes, which could in turn lead to a potential energy shortage, was slightly alarmist in tone. But it showcases the huge amount of computational power needed to mine cryptocurrencies. Is the current cryptocurrency mining process really as wasteful and “useless” as critics say, and is it in need of a more efficient and cleaner system? The current mining process is indeed resource-intensive and wasteful, but there is no magic fix in sight. Many would argue that it’s precisely the “useless” nature of cryptocurrency mining that keeps the system secure. Cryptocurrencies are based on a globally distributed ledger shared among all participants in a decentralised network. This ledger is generally organised in the form of a cumbersome data structure – the blockchain – which consists of blocks of transactions that are cryptographically linked to each other. Most cryptocurrencies use a particular mechanism, dubbed proof-of-work (PoW), to determine which participant gets the right to add a new block of transactions to the blockchain. To prevent dishonest participants from creating multiple identities to manipulate the public vote, PoW requires participants – called miners – to use special software to solve an extremely difficult cryptographic puzzle. In simple terms, solving the puzzle involves guessing a random number between zero and an infinitely large number. It demands a lot of computational power because, as more machines are used, a miner can quickly try different combinations and increase the odds of solving the puzzle. But cryptocurrency mining comes at a cost in the form of custom hardware and electricity consumption. Bitcoin miners alone produce tens of quintillion guesses – known under cryptographic terminology as “hashes” – per second. This gargantuan number has risen in tandem with the amount of energy that has been consumed. The main point of contention is that performing these computations doesn’t serve any useful or productive purpose outside of cryptocurrency mining itself. But attempts to address the seemingly wasted computing power generated by bitcoin mining have largely fallen flat. Projects over the past few years include Primecoin, a cryptocurrency launched in 2013 that incentivises miners to find a particular sequence of prime numbers. The same year, Gridcoin was launched to reward people for contributing to scientific research projects by requiring miners to perform scientific computations on BOINC, the Berkeley open infrastructure for network computing. SolarCoin was established in early 2014 to incentivise the generation of solar electricity, and the following year students created MangoCoinz as part of a computer science project that aims to reward miners for performing actual physical work. But, after initial excitement, all these projects had limited success and are only marginally used today. More recently, the concept of “virtual mining” has also emerged to address the high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining by removing the need for performing computations altogether. This works by tying a miner’s vote proportionally to their cryptocurrency holdings – an approach that became known as proof-of-stake (PoS). But it’s unclear, according to previous research, whether pure PoS systems can achieve the same high security standards as PoW and there have been incidents to accentuate such doubts. In 2014, it was reported that stolen cryptocoins could be used to attack PoS-based networks. A hack at an exchange controlling 30% of the monetary supply of the cryptocurrency VeriCoin, prompted the project’s developers to implement an emergency measure – rewriting parts of the transaction history – to prevent the hacker from using the stolen coins to attack the blockchain network. So – for now – PoW remains the best available mechanism to maintain and secure decentralised cryptocurrency systems. Many believe that mining, while energy-sapping, should remain resource-intensive to make it prohibitively expensive for any single entity to gain sustained control over the decentralised system. Given how quickly computing technology develops, perhaps an alternative method will be found. Until then, we appear stuck – for better or worse – with a drain on computational systems and energy resources to power bitcoin and other cryptocurrency networks securely.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Michel Rauchs, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-02-22T08:21:14Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe enormous use of energy needed to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is proving to be very contentious, but alternative methods pose far too much of a security risk.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe recent \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43030677\"\u003ewarning\u003c/a\u003e that electricity use at bitcoin mining facilities in Iceland may exceed that consumed annually by the country’s homes, which could in turn lead to a potential energy shortage, was slightly alarmist in tone.

The crypto expats also hope to demonstrate how the city of the future will look with blockchain methods used for most transactions alongside the development of a new digital cryptocurrency. But it’s less clear about whose future – the few or the many – will be the driving force for change on the US territory. Puerto Rico was devastated by last year’s Hurricane Maria and, with inadequate aid from the US, it desperately needs investment to rebuild the island’s infrastructure. Puerto Rico was already facing severe financial difficulty before the calamity. It goes some way to explaining why local authorities are cautiously welcoming the arrival of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs on the island. But at what cost? The term crypto-colonialism isn’t new. It was coined 18 years ago by Michael Herzfeld, but had nothing to do with cryptocurrencies – the bitcoin network didn’t come into existence until 2009. Crypto-colonialism originally referred to countries, such as Greece and Thailand, seeking to acquire political independence at the expense of massive economic dependence. And it used the original meaning of the word “crypto” – concealed, hidden or secret. Such countries are nominally independent, but their national culture is refashioned to suit foreign models. The term colonialism in this sense is not overt at the point of a gun, but covert through the subversion of norms and cultures. Notably, this definition of crypto-colonialism remains applicable to the socioeconomic consequences of crypto utopia. There is a deep link between libertarianism and the cryptocurrency movement. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin rely on a decentralised, extralegal and unregulated approach. But while the crypto billionaires will enjoy their Caribbean playground, poorer locals with little knowledge of the technology will be excluded. The mostly male entrepreneurs, who moved to Puerto Rico last year and plan to do more than create a cryptocurrency bank, will perhaps bring crypto libertarian ideas to the island. Their vision is similar to another would-be crypto utopia, the Free Republic of Liberland, which claims to be a “micronation” camped on the western bank of the Danube river. It uses bitcoin as its “national” currency. Back on Sol, the wealthy crypto expats want to use the blockchain system for decentralised elections and even to issue citizenship ID. But we doubt that locals who are fighting poverty will be enthused by these ideas. This behaviour reeks of disaster capitalism – the use of a natural or economic crisis to reshape and mould a society into one which entrenches a libertarian, hypercapitalistic worldview. When you are without power for months and feel ignored, any offer of help can seem a good lifeline with little thought for the consequences. Crypto utopias can also cause severe environmental damage. Puerto Rico remains in a deep power crisis after Hurricane Maria, making the idea of Sol simply impractical. One bitcoin transaction consumes 215 kilowatt-hours (KWh), enough power to supply dozens of households on the island when the grid was at full capacity. The annual electricity consumption for mining bitcoin increased from 9.5 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year to 48 TWh in the last 12 months – 2.5 times higher than Puerto Rico’s total consumption of 19 TWh. Resources and infrastructure, post-Hurricane Maria, are too stretched to support cryptocurrency mining on the island. Crypto rich kids made their fortune on the rapid growth of cryptocurrency markets – which are problematic due to their idiosyncratic risks. It’s a game for wealthy people who can cash out early and lock in gains, having been the developers of the bubbly product. This is characteristic of any bubble – those who get in early do well, those who cash in late do poorly. Our recent research shows that cryptocurrency prices are relatively isolated from the shocks transmitted from other assets, such as gold and equities. But cryptocurrency prices are deeply interlinked with each other, so a fall in the price of bitcoin affects other virtual currencies. If bitcoin can ride out its latest price fall, then it’s likely that crypto-colonialism will slowly spread around the globe. Crypto libertarians – if they follow the Sol model – could focus on those parts of the world that have been ravaged by earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes and economic crises. But cryptocurrency has also become a panacea for economic recovery. In December, Venezuela announced a creation of a new cryptocurrency – dubbed “petro” – backed up by Venezuelan reserves of precious metals, oil and diamonds. It hopes to use this cryptocurrency to fight US sanctions, high inflation and low oil prices. However, bitcoin solutions for developing countries – previously known as neo-colonialism – shouldn’t be seen as the ultimate solution for disaster and crisis management. In the transition period, when the potential of cryptocurrencies and applications of blockchain are unexplored, we have to be sceptical of such initiatives as Sol.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Larisa Yarovaya, Brian Lucey, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-02-14T15:06:49Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eCryptocurrency entrepreneurs have moved to Puerto Rico to build a crypto utopia – \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/technology/cryptocurrency-puerto-rico.html\"\u003einitially dubbed Puertopia but now named Sol\u003c/a\u003e – where they plan to pay little in taxes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crypto expats also hope to demonstrate how the city of the future will look with \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/can-blockchain-technology-help-poor-people-around-the-world-76059\"\u003eblockchain methods\u003c/a\u003e used for most transactions alongside the development of a new digital cryptocurrency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it’s less clear about whose future – the few or the many – will be the driving force for change on the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/are-puerto-ricans-really-american-citizens-73723\"\u003eUS territory\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePuerto Rico was devastated by last year’s \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/in-the-caribbean-colonialism-and-inequality-mean-hurricanes-hit-harder-84106\"\u003eHurricane Maria\u003c/a\u003e and, with \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/why-puerto-rico-doesnt-count-to-the-us-government-86262\"\u003einadequate aid from the US\u003c/a\u003e, it desperately needs investment to rebuild the island’s infrastructure.

But there’s little agreement about the forms this should take. If the case for government regulation is strong, the case for a clear, coordinated regulatory approach is even stronger. It would increase the flow of institutional capital into cryptocurrency markets. And that would further strengthen corporate governance in cryptocurrency companies. The trick for regulators is to balance investor protection and systemic stability with the need to protect innovation and encourage capital formation in different legal systems. At present the regulatory environment is a muddle because there’s rapid divergence in the regulation of cryptocurrencies across jurisdictions. Countries like Japan, while thorough, have a more open approach. China is more strict. Sovereign governments need to develop coherent frameworks for cryptocurrency oversight. But solutions will only be found through international cooperation in this cross-border market. Cryptocurrencies originated as an alternative payment mechanism to traditional currencies. But they are now also traded on spot exchanges as highly speculative investment assets. Recent spin-off crowd funding opportunities such as initial coin offerings have become a particular cause of concern. These involve startup cryptocurrency companies offering initial investment stakes in new token issues. China and Vietnam have banned them. Japan has taken a friendlier attitude while the UK and the US have adopted a wait and see approach. South Africa, like many other developing countries, offers zero protection to investors in initial coin offerings. These different responses are due to different legal definitions of cryptocurrencies. The rapidly evolving technology behind them doesn’t help the situation either. The precise nature of an initial coin offerings depends on its structure as well as its context which can change quickly and have hybrid characteristics of financial instruments. The definition, and hence legal treatment, of the tokens issued under an initial coin offering can be as diverse as a currency, commodity, security, property, loan, deposit, derivative or forex contract. Agreeing a taxonomy of cryptocurrencies defined by how they’re used is clearly one of the most urgent tasks facing regulators. Cryptocurrency expert Lawrence Wintermeyer has argued that distributed ledger technology powered digital assets could be organised into three potential buckets: cryptocurrencies, cryptocommodities, and cryptotokens. But the lack of harmonisation across jurisdictions is a wider problem than nomenclature. Cryptocurrency companies sometimes use the distributed nature of these assets – which sit on digital ledgers held by multiple token holders – to argue that there is no issuer. They also sometimes argue that these assets are not securities, and that they should therefore not be subjected to a particular jurisdiction’s securities laws. There are also clear cross border regulatory gaps. What makes it difficult to reconcile these is that the assets can easily be transferred and their origins are difficult to trace. Tokens could be issued in a more token-friendly jurisdiction like Japan. The same tokens could land up in the hands of unassuming retail investors in stricter jurisdictions such as the US. This cross border confusion allows token companies to pick and choose jurisdictions with favourable rules. This could make money laundering easier. There are a few steps governments can take to close these gaps. They should support investment in technology that makes the provenance of tokens clearer while preserving their encryption. Regulators could then enforce an “indicator of origin” as a standard. This would make it less easy for the assets to be transferred illegally. Offshore centres like Jersey have got a lot of bad press in the recent backlash against international financial centres. But there’s a great deal to learn from well-regulated offshore jurisdictions. They are beginning to take the lead with potential applications of international best practice and corporate governance for cryptocurrencies. They offer investors in digital assets an extra set of gatekeepers’ eyes, and potentially, a more calculated risk. In jurisdictions like Jersey issuers of initial coin offerings have to jump through quite a few hoops. This includes using a regulated service provider which has to make an application to the Jersey companies registry for a consent. The service provider is among a number of requirements that provide checks in relation to anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism. But what could a coordinated global regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies look like? Harmonisation via a code of conduct or voluntary signatory to a global compact could certainly stop token companies from cherry picking jurisdictions to their advantage. Not being signatories to the codes would place token companies outside the market. A multilateral code of conduct or global convention or compact, such as those administered by the inter-governmental Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, or a United Nations co-ordinated approach could be model solutions. Standard regulatory codes are particularly critical for some pockets of the investment community. For example, there has been a significant surge in the establishment of investment funds looking to invest in initial coin offerings on behalf of sophisticated investors. Standard codes for institutional investors in the first instance, could help both regulation as well as innovation. Institutional investors, unlike retail investors, can withstand, and even benefit from, the upside of volatility over time. For now, the poorly regulated speculative hoarding of cryptocurrencies reduces the potential of assets like this to become a public good. This ultimately affects the potential value of the tokens by amplifying volatility. Paying attention to this is important for investors and regulators as well as issuers. There will also have to be a degree of self regulation by issuers as global regulators get up to speed.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Desné Masie, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-02-11T08:17:05Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThere are growing \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.wired.co.uk/article/six-ways-to-regulate-cryptocurrency-without-destroying-its-future\"\u003ecalls\u003c/a\u003e for regulation of the cryptocurrency market, which is rapidly approaching a market capitalisation of \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/18/cryptocurrencies-could-be-worth-1-trillion-in-2018-blockchain-ceo.html\"\u003e$1 trillion\u003c/a\u003e.

Now new blockchain-based marketplaces could give individuals control over access to their encrypted DNA data, and the ability to sell it to research companies for their own profit. Read more: It\u0027s time to talk about who can access your digital genomic data Consumer DNA testing saw unprecedented public demand in 2017. By one estimate, 10 million genetic tests were conducted on individuals by companies such as AncestryDNA. People using these services may not realise that the real money for some of these companies could lie in the sale of genetic data to third parties for medical research. A 23andMe board member reportedly explained this in 2013: The long game here is not to make money selling kits… Once you have the data, [the company] does actually become the Google of personalised health care. Understanding the complex relationship between genetics and disease requires powerful statistical tests. The genomic healthcare revolution therefore needs many genomes for its fuel. At the same time, genomic data can reveal highly personal information about us (and our relatives), especially when paired with our very private health data. There are competing interests between individuals, corporations, and the research community. Marketplaces for buying and selling DNA data would be established by the creation of dedicated cryptocurrency “tokens”. People will be able to sell their (encrypted) genomic data to researchers for tokens, which they can cash out or use to buy services, such as disease risk reports. All transactions would be securely recorded on the blockchain. Read more: Demystifying the blockchain: a basic user guide This is a fledgling industry and we’re likely to see more startups in this space. To gauge what this new ecosystem might look like, we spoke to representatives from three companies: David Koepsell, chief executive of Encrypgen, Bob Kain, chief executive of Luna DNA, and Alexey Gorbachev, a founder of Zenome. Of these three platforms, Encrypgen seems to be the farthest along. It is free to upload and securely store genomic data for up to five family members (including pets), and share data with your doctor. Consumers can use one of the sequencing providers on the private blockchain, or upload their DNA sequence from another provider. Access is controlled by the user. If DNA data comes from another provider, you may have already signed an agreement that allows third-party data access. You will be notified if someone wants to buy access to your genome (using Encrypgen’s $DNA tokens) and can say yes or no. You can remove your genome from the service (and future access) whenever you want, but any use previously granted would continue. Zenome’s platform makes use of the computing resources of many “nodes” (different people’s computers) in a distributed approach to genomic analysis. To protect user privacy, genomic data is fragmented so that no node has a full copy. Personal information is stored on a user’s own computer and encrypted. Initially, it will be free to upload data. In return you receive secure storage and a free report about your health and origin. Users can sell access and buy analysis services using Zenome DNA (ZNA) tokens. Users can upload data to Luna’s protected database if they provide broad consent to studies. Users will receive Luna Coin in return for important information such as health data. This broad consent will allow relevant third parties (like academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies) to conduct discovery projects on de-identified data for a fee. Luna won’t reveal user information, but if a third party is interested in conducting clinical trials on a specific genotype then Luna would facilitate the introduction and relationship (with the user’s consent). As the database grows, its value increases. Luna DNA is not initially offering analysis services: the primary aim is to enable genomic research. Read more: Blockchains: Focusing on bitcoin misses the real revolution in digital trust Probably not. The dollar value of our genome is difficult to guess, and it’s also likely to increase as we find new uses for the data. Zenome estimates that 23andMe has made US$130 million to date from selling access to one million genotypes to pharmaceutical companies – which breaks down to US$130 per genotype. The story of Henrietta Lacks has been mentioned in relation to these systems. Her cell line (HeLa) was taken without consent and has gone on to make untold wealth for the biomedical industry. It’s unlikely that one genome alone would lead directly to such massive profits (although it’s impossible to rule this out). It is most likely that you would sell access to your data for the purposes of a study, like participating in a drug trial, and sign an agreement that precludes ownership in any patents resulting from that participation. For research studies, the value of a genome is going to be strongly influenced by the amount and quality of medically relevant data attached to it, for example a family history of heart disease. Some genomes may be more interesting than others, for example supercentenarians – people over the age of 110 years. Carriers of rare genotypes, or people with particular diseases will likely also be more desirable for research purposes. Ease of use and informed consent: Buying and selling cryptocurrency is currently technically challenging. At the same time, consenting to genomic data access, and understanding the implications of an access request can be complex. For these companies to succeed in giving people control of their DNA privacy, they will need to be very clear about what is actually being agreed to in a data request. Quality: This is an issue on both sides of the equation. There are a number of direct to consumer DNA services with questionable scientific basis, like predicting what a couple’s baby will look like. It might be difficult for users to tell whether services are backed by sound science. Conversely, these platforms reward users for data that is useful for genetic research. This could potentially incentivise the provision of misleading or inaccurate health data. Pricing: Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile and their legal status has not yet been clearly established. More generally, there is a risk that the very creation of a DNA marketplace could drive up the cost of access to genomic data. Will people still donate DNA for research when they can sell it? Encrypgen and Zenome both said that the price of data access would be decided by the open market, whereas Luna envisions different pricing for non-profits and corporations. Zenome noted that the overall cost to researchers might be reduced if they no longer have to generate the data themselves. Privacy \u0026 security: Blockchains are secure, but no technology is infallible. There is also a risk that law enforcement could pressure companies to share DNA data. Encrypgen and Zenome said that data was stored in such a way that they could not identify individuals. Luna could identify individuals but said that they would not grant access to outside agencies. Centralisation: If the majority of the world’s genomic data ends up on a single platform, then society would be in a position of trust that the company will continue to act ethically. Read more: The blockchain does not eliminate the need for trust Any system has risks and it is still very early days for these startups. Only the future can tell how each will deal with these issues during their implementation. The actual ownership of our DNA and its digital representation is currently legally unclear. Research shows that people are more likely to participate in genomics research when privacy policies clearly indicate their ownership of their own data and control of its use. Regardless of the legal situation, what these companies are proposing should grant control of genomic data to individuals. This seems like a step in the right direction.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Caitlin Curtis, James Hereward, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-22T19:08:17Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eDid you know that when you take certain genetic tests, the company can make money by on-selling your data to other businesses?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow new \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/patricklin/2017/05/08/blockchain-the-missing-link-between-genomics-and-privacy/#57ebf2cd4b77\"\u003eblockchain-based marketplaces\u003c/a\u003e could give individuals control over access to their encrypted DNA data, and the ability to sell it to research companies for their own profit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e \u003cstrong\u003e Read more: \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/its-time-to-talk-about-who-can-access-your-digital-genomic-data-87682\"\u003eIt\u0027s time to talk about who can access your digital genomic data\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe ‘Google of personalised health care’\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsumer DNA testing saw unprecedented public demand in 2017.

Zenome noted that the overall cost to researchers might be reduced if they no longer have to generate the data themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrivacy \u0026amp; security:\u003c/strong\u003e Blockchains are secure, but no technology is \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.deepdotweb.com/2016/10/06/cryptocurrency-hacks-biggest-heists-blockchain-history/\"\u003einfallible\u003c/a\u003e.

Earlier this month, researchers revealed that the hardware at the heart of nearly every computer, smartphone, tablet and other electronic device is flawed in at least two significant ways code-named Spectre and Meltdown. Regardless of their cause, the mere existence of these significant vulnerabilities is a symptom of a much wider problem. Too few technology companies are taking proper precautions to protect every step in their supply chains, from raw materials through manufacturing and distribution into customers’ hands. Products could be altered either in the factory or en route to a user, turning, for example, an executive’s smartphone into a handy surveillance device. I am part of a multidisciplinary team of researchers based at Indiana University studying this thorny problem. Our work has helped highlight the simple fact that better supply chain security could both prevent and make it easier to recover from accidents – as the chip flaws appear to be – and deliberate meddling. It’s common knowledge that hackers can attack software by sending users virus-infected emails or compromised links. But they can also meddle with computers by altering tiny circuits in microchips most users will never see. These weaknesses are physical, and they’re just as hard to identify as mistakes in software code. The complex supply chains involved in most technological manufacturing are very hard to secure. Apple’s iPhone, for example, involves hundreds of suppliers from around the world making chips and hard drives, all of which have to be shipped, assembled and warehoused before ever being delivered to an Apple store or your door. All of these steps introduce numerous opportunities for security problems to arise; recent research has even suggested hackers could use smartphone apps to destroy manufacturing equipment or even blow up entire factories. While no such large-scale disaster has yet been identified, even sophisticated retailers like Amazon have been fooled by counterfeit or poorly manufactured facsimiles of real products. Some supply chain threats can be more malicious: In 2012, Microsoft warned customers that Chinese computer factories were installing malware on PCs. As more and more devices – not just computers and smartphones but thermostats and baby monitors and wristwatches and lightbulbs and even doorbells – get connected to the internet, the growing scale of the threat from hackers can easily get lost in the excitement. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Defense thought it had a great way to buy a lot of computing power without spending too much taxpayer money: It bought 2,200 Sony PlayStation 3 gaming consoles to use as components in a military supercomputer. But as I and others wrote in response, those systems are often manufactured abroad, making it that much more difficult to verify that they weren’t tampered with. The Navy, at least, has learned from this mistake: The Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division has pioneered automated inspections, using artificial intelligence to examine digital pictures of new circuit boards to detect unauthorized alterations. Americans are rightly concerned about intrusive alterations during the manufacturing and shipping processes – in part because U.S. government agencies conduct them. Leaked documents have shown how the National Security Agency’s Tailored Access Operations team routinely intercepts new computer and networking equipment being shipped to specific people or organizations. Then NSA workers modify the hardware to add vulnerabilities and secret access for NSA hackers to use later, and then put the equipment back in boxes to be delivered as if nothing had happened. One new way to secure supply chains involves blockchain technology – a secure database system stored and maintained across many computers around the internet – to track and verify all aspects of a supply chain, even one as complicated as Apple’s. IBM and the international shipping giant Maersk are experimenting with using blockchain systems to better secure and transparently track shipments, such as by entering information about what is being shipped from whom and from where to whom and to where, and every step along the route in between, in a blockchain database. This type of system can handle many of the existing tasks performed by corporate databases – with scanners monitoring items and packages at key stages, and humans adding data like delivery details. But blockchains offer at least three key advantages: security, transparency and automation. The security comes from two features of blockchains: First, the data is stored in discrete chunks, or “blocks.” And as each block is created, it must securely link to the previous block in the database, making a “chain” of blocks and preventing anyone from modifying previously stored data. Changes can only be stored as additional data in the chain. So, in effect, a person who took a package to the post office couldn’t go into the database file and delete the word “Processing” and type in the word “Shipped” in its place. Rather, the person would add data saying the date and time the package was dropped off at the post office. That lets everyone track the package in real time, but also keep an eye on how long each step takes and help to identify where any problems occur. Blockchain transparency results from the fact that its data is stored in encrypted form, but is otherwise available to participants. Coupled with its security features, a blockchain supply chain database would let any entity involved in a shipment, for example, track the order’s progress with confidence that the data is accurate. Adding value to blockchain systems is the fact that they are digital records, so they can contain software code set to perform specific functions when certain data is stored in the system. These are often called “smart contracts,” because they are unalterable instructions that can automate some processes, like issuing a payment upon delivery. This adds another layer of security, too, because the blockchain itself can keep an eye on how long each step takes for every item, and then alert human supervisors if something takes too long – a sign of a production breakdown, or even a signal someone might be tampering with the goods. No blockchain is immune to hacking – and none of them can evade the effects of hardware vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Spectre. But it could provide a major improvement over today’s methods and practices. There’s a long way to go yet, including training people to use blockchains and agreeing on standards for data communication, encryption and storage. And such a system would still face the problem of insider threats, though the underlying blockchain technology would make such attempts more difficult. At present, companies and government agencies are exploring ways to ensure that items are manufactured, assembled, shipped and delivered reliably and without tampering. Continuing these efforts, and finding new ways for private companies and governments to work together and share best practices such as by developing collaborative standards, would go a long way toward building robust blockchain-based systems that can help track and secure hardware across the burgeoning Internet of Everything.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Scott Shackelford, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-22T11:30:08Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eSecurity vulnerabilities in technology extend well beyond \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/what-are-software-vulnerabilities-and-why-are-there-so-many-of-them-77930\"\u003eproblems with software\u003c/a\u003e.

But blockchains offer \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.logisticsbureau.com/how-blockchain-can-transform-the-supply-chain/\"\u003eat least three key advantages\u003c/a\u003e: security, transparency and automation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe security comes from two features of blockchains: First, the data is stored in discrete chunks, or “blocks.” And as each block is created, it must \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21677198-technology-behind-bitcoin-could-transform-how-economy-works-trust-machine\"\u003esecurely link to the previous block\u003c/a\u003e in the database, making a “chain” of blocks and preventing anyone from modifying previously stored data. Changes can only be stored as additional data in the chain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, in effect, a person who took a package to the post office couldn’t go into the database file and delete the word “Processing” and type in the word “Shipped” in its place. Rather, the person would add data saying the date and time the package was dropped off at the post office. That lets everyone track the package in real time, but also keep an eye on how long each step takes and help to identify where any problems occur.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlockchain transparency results from the fact that its data is stored in encrypted form, but is otherwise available to \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2017/05/the-difference-between-public-and-private-blockchain/\"\u003eparticipants\u003c/a\u003e. Coupled with its security features, a blockchain supply chain database would let any entity involved in a shipment, for example, track the order’s progress with \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2017/09/01/blockchain-in-the-supply-chain-too-much-hype/\"\u003econfidence that the data is accurate\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdding value to blockchain systems is the fact that they are digital records, so they can contain software code set to perform specific functions when certain data is stored in the system. These are often called “\u003ca href\u003d\"https://blockgeeks.com/guides/smart-contracts/\"\u003esmart contracts\u003c/a\u003e,” because they are unalterable instructions that can automate some processes, like issuing a payment upon delivery. This adds another layer of security, too, because the blockchain itself can keep an eye on how long each step takes for every item, and then alert human supervisors if something takes too long – a sign of a production breakdown, or even a signal someone might be tampering with the goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eNeither a magic bullet, nor a lost cause\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo blockchain is \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.recode.net/2016/6/19/11972818/dao-hacked-blockchain-ethereum\"\u003eimmune to hacking\u003c/a\u003e – and none of them can evade the effects of hardware vulnerabilities like Meltdown and Spectre.

But there are genuine differences between these cryptocurrencies, and it’s not just because one is “much currency, such volatility”. There are 1,448 cryptocurrencies around the world, by some counts. For every Bitcoin you have a programmable coin like Ethereum, or a coin that acts like a token for specific services, like Augur. Some of these coins earn better reputations because of their usefulness, the people who made them, or the tech itself. They are not all taken seriously by investors, researchers and users. The developers behind these cryptocurrencies are also important as they convince other people to adopt them and write new code for the technology to evolve. This new tech attracts new users into the system. Read more: Coinye West to Nyancoin ... how to build your own cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies can be divided into several types. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin only provide basic functions such as transferring value from one party to another. The next category are smart contract cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Cardano, NEO, and Waves. These cryptocurrencies can be programmed, and so can become the basis for applications like games and digital markets. The third type are cryptocurrencies designed to preserve your privacy like Monero and Zcash. These claim to be “untraceable” although transaction records are still available. Then there are tokens, which are built with smart contracts to serve many purposes. They are often sold to raise funds to build services, and used as tickets for the services (such as Augur and Power Ledger). The differing technologies in these cryptocurrencies mean that certain coins have more potential than others. IOTA is used for “Internet of Things” devices (such as a smart kettle). But it has a special kind of blockchain (the technology that tracks transactions) and so can achieve much higher speeds of transaction and quicker confirmation of trades than Bitcoin. Others like Nxt, and Ardor have built-in features that let users to do other things than just sending coins, such as creating marketplaces and even messaging. People use cryptocurrencies like Zcash and Monero to settle transactions with “zero-knowledge”. This means the cryptocurrencies hide the information of the real payers and payees, and even the amount of coins transacted. Monero has largely replaced the use of Bitcoin in exchanges on the dark web. Read more: KodakOne could be the start of a new kind of intellectual property And smart contracts built with cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have countless potential usecases, from property transactions to digital asset management and fundraising. The technology also means that one cryptocurrency might use significantly less electricity than another. The major cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are slow because of their inability to handle massive amount of data being sent by users. The technology used to secure the data are expensive and inefficient. Bitcoin can only handle a maximum of seven transactions per second; Ethereum can handle 15 transactions per second. Compare this with the VISA payment system, which can process up to 56,000 transactions per second. But new entrants, such as Red Belly from the University of Sydney, might be able to solve this problem, handling up to 660,000 transactions per second. Smart contracts can also run into problems if they contain bugs. When a decentralised organisation built on Ethereum was hacked in 2016, US$50 million in Ether was stolen. Read more: The DAO: a radical experiment that could be the future of decentralised governance When something achieves the success of Bitcoin we’re bound to see competitors entering the market, hoping to grab a share. This explains the explosion in cryptocurrencies since the Bitcoin source code was released under an open licence. Anyone can copy, modify, and release a modified version of Bitcoin. By looking at the current trend, we will see more cryptocoins in the near future. But as we can see, “cryptocurrency” is a term that encompasses a wide range of different technologies, communities and uses. It’s all of these factors that inform whether users, investors, developers and researchers take a coin seriously.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Dimaz Wijaya, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-22T05:28:33Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eAs Bitcoin loses value, it may seem like it’s just as useful as the cryptocurrency invented for a joke - \u003ca href\u003d\"http://dogecoin.com/\"\u003eDogecoin\u003c/a\u003e.

The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in Australia, Fiji and New Zealand, in partnership with US-based tech innovator ConsenSys, tech implementer TraSeable and tuna fishing and processing company Sea Quest Fiji Ltd, has just launched a pilot project in the Pacific Islands tuna industry that will use blockchain technology to track the journey of tuna from “bait to plate”. The aim is to help stop illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and human rights abuses in the tuna industry. These have included reports of corruption, illegal trafficking and human slavery on tuna fishing boats. It is hoped the use of blockchain technology will strengthen transparency and enable full traceability, thereby countering significant threats to licensing revenue and crew working conditions and safety, and broader impacts on the environment. Blockchain technology is rapidly evolving beyond Bitcoin. Emerging applications are geared to improve business in many ways – including supply-chain transparency for all kinds of products. Read more: Demystifying the blockchain: a basic user guide A blockchain is a digital ledger that is distributed, decentralised, verifiable and irreversible. It can be used to record transactions of almost anything of value. Essentially, it is a shared (not copied) database that everyone in the network can see and update. This system provides multiple benefits for supply chains, including high levels of transparency. This is because everyone in the network can see and verify the ledger, and no individual can alter or delete the history of transactions. For consumers, this means you will be able to scan a code on an item you want to buy and find out exactly where it has been before landing in your hands. It will be easy to answer those tricky questions about whether or not an item – such as a fish – is sustainable, ethical or legal. The WWF pilot project will use a combination of radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, quick response (QR) code tags and scanning devices to collect information about the journey of a tuna at various points along the supply chain. While this use of technology is not new for supply-chain tracking, the exciting part is that the collected information will then be recorded using blockchain technology. Tracking will start as soon as the tuna is caught. Once a fish is landed, it will be attached with a reusable RFID tag on the vessel. Devices fitted on the vessel, at the dock and in the processing factory will then detect the tags and automatically upload information to the blockchain. Read more: Blockchain is useful for a lot more than just Bitcoin Once the fish has been processed, the reusable RFID tag will be switched for a cheaper QR code tag, which will be attached to the product packaging. The unique QR code will be linked to the blockchain record associated with the particular fish and its original RFID tag. The QR code tag will be used to trace the rest of the journey of the fish to the consumer. At the moment, linking tags is not difficult because the project is focusing on whole round exports – that is, the whole fresh fish minus head, gills and guts. It gets a little more complicated when the fish is cut up into loins, steaks, cubes and cans, but the project team is now able to link the QR code tags on the packages of the processed fish with the record of the original fish on the blockchain. While it may be possible to use RFID tags throughout the whole process, the expense of these tags could prohibit smaller operators in the fishing industry from participating in the scheme if it expands. There is also potential to use near field communicator (NFC) devices to track the fish all the way to the consumer in the future. While this use of the blockchain is the first of its kind for the Pacific Islands region, it is not a world first. A company called Provenence and the International Pole and Line Association (IPLA) has already completed a successful pilot project tracing products from Indonesian tuna fisheries to consumers in the UK. Provenance is also working on using blockchain to track a range of other physical things – including cotton, fashion, coffee and organically farmed food products. However, the potential of blockchain goes further. For example, Kodak recently launched its own cryptocurrency to help photographers track and protect their digital intellectual property. Read more: KodakOne could be the start of a new kind of intellectual property Blockchain technology is just starting to change the way business is done. If it delivers on its promise of supply-chain transparency, it will be a great tool to help ensure that industries – including the tuna industry – are doing the right thing. This will give consumers more information on which to base their purchasing decisions. For the global tuna industry, which has historically struggled with illegal and environmentally dubious fishing practices, this could be a turning point as visionary fishing companies demonstrate true stewardship and begin to open up the industry to full transparency.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Candice Visser, Quentin Hanich, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-21T19:15:31Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIn a significant development for global fisheries, blockchain technology is now being used to improve tuna traceability to help stop illegal and unsustainable fishing practices in the Pacific Islands tuna industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe World Wildlife Fund (WWF) in Australia, Fiji and New Zealand, in partnership with US-based tech innovator \u003ca href\u003d\"https://consensys.net/\"\u003eConsenSys\u003c/a\u003e, tech implementer \u003ca href\u003d\"https://traseable.com/\"\u003eTraSeable\u003c/a\u003e and tuna fishing and processing company \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003d8orivCxcH6E\"\u003eSea Quest Fiji Ltd\u003c/a\u003e, has just launched a \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.wwf.org.au/news/news/2018/how-blockchain-and-a-smartphone-can-stamp-out-illegal-fishing-and-slavery-in-the-tuna-industry#gs.jZMlFTw\"\u003epilot project\u003c/a\u003e in the Pacific Islands tuna industry that will use blockchain technology to track the journey of tuna from “bait to plate”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe aim is to help stop \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.fao.org/fishery/iuu-fishing/en\"\u003eillegal, unreported and unregulated\u003c/a\u003e fishing and human rights abuses in the tuna industry.

Most of this mistrust is caused by the numerous scandals that have hit the industry in recent years, often related to controversial clinical-trial practices, data misuse or hidden secondary effects for commercialised drugs. Overall, patients have complained about the increasing lack of transparency of the pharmaceutical industry when it comes to the conditions in which drugs are developed and tested and this attitude is threatening the future of medical research. A study conducted by Ioannidis et al. reported that 80% of trials described in publications were non-reproducible. In 2008, another study revealed that a considerable number of clinical trials were still unpublished up to five years after FDA approval. Moreover, researchers found discrepancies between the information sent to the FDA and data published and analysed in publications, the latter appearing to be more favourable to the sponsor, incomplete or biased. To combat this, in April 2015 the World Health Organisation (WHO) published a statement requiring the public disclosure of clinical trials and re-affirming the basic measures in order to insure the veracity of the results. Moreover, the FDA requires all clinical trials to be registered on the public website clinicaltrials.gov. Despite this measure, only half of the clinical trials run worldwide are published. The graphs below show the number of studies that have been submitted to clinicaltrials.gov alone versus the number of studies submitted with posted results over time. In 2016, out of the 235,066 studies registered, only 25,899 came with corresponding results which corresponds to approximately 11%. This inevitably leads to considering the reasons why the other 89% of the results were not published on the platform. Greater access to medical and pharmaceutical online information is considerably changing the patient’s relationship with the industry. For instance, patients evolve from being simple spectators of their health to being true actors. Indeed, not only do they search their condition and symptoms online, but they also start investigating and questioning the treatments they are prescribed. Patients are now more than ever aware of the latest news in the pharmaceutical industry and, of course, of the latest scandals. Due to the growing number of communication channels, these scandals take a considerable magnitude. However, the issue is not that information circulates among the population; the issue is that said information is often altered or misinterpreted. Therefore, pharmaceuticals labs are often accused, based on poor evidence, of focusing only on profit and not on the patient’s well-being. However when considering the growing amount of problems in the healthcare system, one can wonder if they should really be the only ones held accountable for all of the scandals related to pharmaceutical products or if the error does not sometimes come from elsewhere. Although this creates substantial trust issues between healthcare stakeholders and patients, there are ways in which clinical trials processes can be improved especially using new technologies. One of the most promising tools of the past decade is without a doubt “distributed ledger technologies” such as the blockchain. The blockchain is a decentralized data management system famous for being the underlying technology of the crypto-currency bitcoin. For the past years, there has been a growing hype around this technology mainly due to its central attributes such as security, transparency and traceability. While 80% of the papers covering blockchain link it essentially to Bitcoin only 20% explore other aspects of the technology. Therefore, there is a great need to further explore this promising technology in the healthcare sector. Imagine the blockchain like a big secure notebook that stores a list of encrypted information. The notebook is immutable, meaning that the information it contains cannot be changed or deleted. This notebook is also transparent which means that anyone can make sure that the information has been written by the right person and was correctly registered. However, what makes blockchain different from other technologies, is that it is decentralised. Indeed, the notebook, or ledger, is not stored in one but in multiple computers in a network. In order to add data to the ledger, all the computers have to agree on the information. As there is no central entity controlling the ledger, there is no way an organisation can decide by itself what to write on the blockchain. When applied to the pharmaceutical industry, and more specifically to clinical trials, the interest of blockchain technology seems obvious. If companies use this tool they will have to come to a consensus with all the stakeholders in the network before being able to register an information on the blockchain, the stakeholders therefore becoming midpoints taking part in the trial or regulatory organisations supervising the process. The advantage of such organisation is that the more people defending different interests there are in the network, the more chances there are to only register authentic and reliable data on the blockchain. Various papers explore the use of this technology in clinical trials. Benchoufi et al. studied ways in which blockchain technology can be used to insure authenticity and traceability of patient consent. The study shows that the proof of existence of each consent form can be timestamped and stored in blockchains, enabling clinical research stakeholder to share consent and re-consent in real-time. Patients are notified each time there is a change in the protocol that requires them to renew their consent, allowing them to be informed of the evolution on the trial. The paper also explores the fact that obtaining consent must be a “lock” before taking the trial further. The conditions for a trial to continue can be coded into the blockchain under the format “IF (condition) THEN (consequence)”. This system, called a “smart contract”, automatically triggers an event when the coded clauses are hit. In the case of a consent form, the smart contract could say: “IF patient consent is registered along with the patient’s unique digital signature THEN the patient can be included in the trial”. Consent is not the only point of failure in a clinical trial. As such, Nugent et al. also explored the use of blockchain to reduce data fraud. The paper suggests a private, permissioned blockchain maintained by regulators, pharmaceutical companies and research organisations. Each document produced during the trial can be recorded on this blockchain such as the protocol or patient biological tests results. Moreover, when data privacy is required, information can be encrypted making sure that identifiable data regarding the patient cannot be unveiled. The figure below represents the flow of information that circulate in a clinical trial and the possible interactions with blockchains. Although the technology is relatively young, it is rapidly becoming an important element in the healthcare industry as it allows to store and share information among a group of stakeholders that don’t trust each other. The main concern regarding the adoption of the technology is that fact that blockchain only has as an interest when talking about transactions at an ecosystem level. Therefore, convincing and implementing new systems in a hospital or a pharmaceutical company only is not enough.

For instance, patients evolve from being simple spectators of their health to being true actors. Indeed, not only do they search their condition and symptoms online, but they also start investigating and questioning the treatments they are prescribed. Patients are now more than ever aware of the latest news in the pharmaceutical industry and, of course, of the latest scandals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDue to the growing number of communication channels, these scandals take a considerable magnitude. However, the issue is not that information circulates among the population; the issue is that said information is often altered or misinterpreted. Therefore, pharmaceuticals labs are often accused, based on poor evidence, of focusing only on profit and not on the patient’s well-being. However when considering the growing amount of problems in the healthcare system, one can wonder if they should really be the only ones held accountable for all of the scandals related to pharmaceutical products or if the error does not sometimes come from elsewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough this creates substantial trust issues between healthcare stakeholders and patients, there are ways in which clinical trials processes can be improved especially using new technologies. One of the most promising tools of the past decade is without a doubt “distributed ledger technologies” such as the blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/quelle-blockchain-pour-la-sante-58519\"\u003eblockchain\u003c/a\u003e is a decentralized data management system famous for being the underlying technology of the crypto-currency \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/le-bitcoin-ne-devrait-pas-changer-le-monde-mais-la-blockchain-pourrait-bien-sen-charger-52717\"\u003ebitcoin\u003c/a\u003e. For the past years, there has been a growing hype around this technology mainly due to its central attributes such as security, transparency and traceability. While 80% of the papers covering blockchain link it essentially to Bitcoin only \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308877750_Where_Is_Current_Research_on_blockchain_Technology-A_Systematic_Review\"\u003e20% explore other aspects of the technology\u003c/a\u003e. Therefore, there is a great need to further explore this promising technology in the healthcare sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eA decentralised registry\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine the blockchain like a big secure notebook that stores a list of encrypted information. The notebook is immutable, meaning that the information it contains cannot be changed or deleted. This notebook is also transparent which means that anyone can make sure that the information has been written by the right person and was correctly registered. However, what makes blockchain different from other technologies, is that it is decentralised. Indeed, the notebook, or ledger, is not stored in one but in multiple computers in a network. In order to add data to the ledger, all the computers have to agree on the information. As there is no central entity controlling the ledger, there is no way an organisation can decide by itself what to write on the blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen applied to the pharmaceutical industry, and more specifically to clinical trials, the interest of blockchain technology seems obvious. If companies use this tool they will have to come to a consensus with all the stakeholders in the network before being able to register an information on the blockchain, the stakeholders therefore becoming midpoints taking part in the trial or regulatory organisations supervising the process. The advantage of such organisation is that the more people defending different interests there are in the network, the more chances there are to only register authentic and reliable data on the blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVarious papers explore the use of this technology in clinical trials. \u003ca href\u003d\"https://f1000research.com/articles/6-66/v1\"\u003eBenchoufi et al.\u003c/a\u003e studied ways in which blockchain technology can be used to insure authenticity and traceability of patient consent. The study shows that the proof of existence of each consent form can be timestamped and stored in blockchains, enabling clinical research stakeholder to share consent and re-consent in real-time. Patients are notified each time there is a change in the protocol that requires them to renew their consent, allowing them to be informed of the evolution on the trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe paper also explores the fact that obtaining consent must be a “lock” before taking the trial further. The conditions for a trial to continue can be coded into the blockchain under the format “IF (condition) THEN (consequence)”. This system, called a “smart contract”, automatically triggers an event when the coded clauses are hit. In the case of a consent form, the smart contract could say: “IF patient consent is registered along with the patient’s unique digital signature THEN the patient can be included in the trial”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConsent is not the only point of failure in a clinical trial. As such, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://f1000research.com/articles/5-2541/v1\"\u003eNugent et al.\u003c/a\u003e also explored the use of blockchain to reduce data fraud. The paper suggests a private, permissioned blockchain maintained by regulators, pharmaceutical companies and research organisations. Each document produced during the trial can be recorded on this blockchain such as the protocol or patient biological tests results. Moreover, when data privacy is required, information can be encrypted making sure that identifiable data regarding the patient cannot be unveiled.

Is this even possible? Some companies certainly think so. These startups are harnessing the power of blockchains to democratize green power. Before you can understand how blockchains are part of the solution, you first need to know a few things about the green electricity market. Today, independent auditors assess renewable-energy producers and certify their electricity as “green.” These producers can then sell Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) to consumers who want to buy green energy. This is how corporations such as Apple and Google can say they are 100 per cent green. They aren’t generating their own green electricity, but purchasing certificates from green-energy producers. Of course, the actual energy they use is not always green. As long as every unit of energy they consume matches up with a purchased REC, green energy is displacing carbon-intense energy. A market for RECs creates a strong signal for investment in green electricity generation. Some companies do power some or all of their operations using Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). This commits them to purchasing a certain amount of energy at a certain price from renewable-energy producers over time-scales of about 20 years or so. PPAs reduce risk for generators by guaranteeing return on investment, thus creating a strong motivation for long-term investment in green generation. Both of these approaches, however, discriminate against small generators of green electricity. The certification process for RECs is cumbersome and expensive, with physical audits, so it doesn’t make sense for mom-and-pop green generators. Similarly, PPAs can only be negotiated by large green generators. For these two reasons, small-scale green generators must make do with whatever price their local utility pays them. This price can be volatile due to meddling by legislators as well as by the utilities themselves. Thus, small generators are exposed to higher levels of risk than bigger players. What if we could reduce the cost of certification, eliminate onerous auditing and avoid non-market price controls, so that even a small-scale green generator could de-risk investments? This is what companies such as PowerLedger in Australia and LO3 Energy in Brooklyn provide. They use blockchains to store generation certificates that are created by tamper-proof meters attached to solar panels. Read more: Demystifying the blockchain: a basic user guide These blockchains also store transaction records when the certificates are traded, so that the same unit of generation cannot be resold. By eliminating auditors, transaction costs and price regulation, this solution makes renewable-energy investment attractive even for small players. Unfortunately, this approach has a scaling problem. Today’s blockchains cannot support the addition of more than a few hundred certificates or trades (we’ll call them both “transactions”) per second. This is because blockchain servers need to agree on the contents of each block, despite server and communication failure and the presence of malicious servers. This is the well-known and difficult “consensus problem.” Because of this problem, the scale needed to support hundreds of millions of solar panels is beyond the reach of current blockchain technology. For instance, BitCoin, the best-known blockchain, supports only about 10 transactions per second and HyperLedger, IBM’s competing solution, under 1,000 transactions per second. A democratic REC system would generate transactions at a rate hundreds of times faster. My colleagues at the University of Waterloo have recently devised a new solution to the consensus problem called Canopus. Canopus takes a server’s location on the internet cloud into account, minimizing communication between geographically-distant servers. By keeping most communications local and fast, blockchain servers can process far more transaction records each second than a traditional consensus protocol that doesn’t take location into account. This improvement in scaling allows even mom-and-pop green generators to obtain certificates and participate in energy transactions. We are currently building a prototype blockchain using Canopus that we hope will handle more than one million transactions per second. In our solution, smart meters attached to solar panels send RECs to brokers. Consumers can purchase these RECs using their own brokers. If successful, our work will encourage homeowners and small businesses to invest in renewable energy technologies to become green generators. It would also encourage Ontario’s electricity consumers to become 100 per cent green, just like Apple and Google. Indeed, since blockchain knows no boundaries, our system could allow green generators in sun-drenched developing countries to recoup their investment in green generation by selling RECs to consumers around the world. Of course, this requires placing blockchain servers in every region of the world, but this is easily done using existing datacenter infrastructure. This would reduce the global carbon footprint, and would be more efficient — thus less costly — than deploying solar panels in sun-poor northern countries. The development of a scalable, tamperproof and globally accessible energy blockchain would enable other energy transactions. Emissions-free electric vehicles (EVs) allow consumers to use electricity instead of gasoline to meet their transportation needs. While consumers get incentives to purchase EVs, they receive none to operate them. Blockchain makes it possible to reward EV owners for operating their EVs, or providing ancillary services to utilities, making the vehicles more affordable. EV owners could be further rewarded if they charged their cars with green electricity. Although the technology for building scalable blockchains will soon exist, one problem is that some jurisdictions, including Ontario, give local distribution companies tight control on integrating green generation to ensure grid stability. While this is certainly necessary, there is no intrinsic need for green generators to be tied into a provincially mandated pricing plan such as the microFIT scheme. The province should allow generators to sell their electricity to the highest bidder, just like any other producer. We also need to build, deploy and critically evaluate small-scale prototypes of blockchain-based transactive-energy systems so that we can learn by doing. As solar and wind costs continue to drop and energy storage technologies reach maturity, it is becoming possible to turn away from carbon-intense electricity generation and gasoline vehicles. Democratizing the deployment of these technologies using scalable energy blockchains will, we hope, accelerate this important societal transformation.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Srinivasan Keshav, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2018-01-07T21:25:22Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eImagine buying a solar panel from a hardware store, mounting it on your roof, then selling the green electricity you produce at a price you set.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIs this even possible?

While some suggest cryptocurrencies are a fraud, others believe them to be the next biggest economic revolution the world has seen since the internet. Bitcoin has brought to light blockchain technology, which offers great potential for food safety and verification in the agrifood sector. Yet it is far from being the panacea for a range of issues affecting the industry — at least for now. Simply put, blockchain technology is a way of storing and sharing information across a network of users in an open virtual space. Blockchain technology allows for users to look at all transactions simultaneously and in real-time. In food, for example, a retailer would know with whom his supplier has had dealings. Additionally, since transactions are not stored in any single location, it is almost impossible to hack the information. For consumers, blockchain technology can make a difference. By reading a simple QR code with a smartphone, data such as an animal’s date of birth, use of antibiotics, vaccinations, and location where the livestock was harvested can easily be conveyed to the consumer. Blockchain makes a supply chain more transparent at an all-new level. It also empowers the entire chain to be more responsive to any food safety disasters. Massive organizations such as Nestlé and Unilever are considering blockchain technologies for that reason. Walmart, which sells 20 per cent of all food in the U.S., has just completed two blockchain pilot projects. Prior to using blockchain, Walmart conducted a traceback test on mangoes in one of its stores. It took six days, 18 hours, and 26 minutes to trace mangoes back to its original farm. By using blockchain, Walmart can provide all the information the consumer wants in 2.2 seconds. During an outbreak of disease or contamination, six days is an eternity. A company can save lives by using blockchain technologies. Blockchain also allows specific products to be traced at any given time, which would help to reduce food waste. For instance, contaminated products can be traced easily and quickly, while safe foods would remain on the shelves and not be sent to landfills. However, it will work only if the data at the source is accurate, as current practices in the industry are much more open to human error. Much of the compliance data is audited by trusted third parties and stored either on paper or in a centralized database. These databases are highly vulnerable to informational inaccuracies, hacking, high operating costs, and intentional errors motivated by corruption and fraudulent behaviour. Blockchain operates anonymously, so mistakes would be traceable to individual culprits. Considering recent food-fraud scandals in Canada and elsewhere, this feature is not trivial. Blockchain technology provides a method with which records are kept permanently. Most importantly though, it facilitates data-sharing between disparate actors in a food value chain. Many retailers have sold fraudulent food products unknowingly. With the use of blockchain, those days could come to and end. Blockchain will allow everyone to be paid more quickly, from farm to plate. Farmers could sell more quickly, and be properly compensated as market data would be readily available and validated. Blockchain technology could represent a legitimate option for farmers who feel compelled to rely on marketing boards to sell their commodities. The use of blockchain could prevent price coercion and retroactive payments, both of which we have seen across the food supply chain. Blockchain technologies could “Uberize” the agrifood sector by eliminating middlemen and lowering transaction fees. This can lead to fairer pricing and even help smaller outfits desperate to get more market attention. Our current traceability systems need work, and blockchain technologies could be the evolution they need. Given its architecture, blockchain technology offers an affordable solution to both small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) and large organizations. However, there are noteworthy limitations. The amount of information which can be processed is limited. Since all of the information would be out there and accessible, several contracts between organizations would need to be secured for some level of confidentiality to be retained. How to balance confidentiality with transparency would need to be worked out. The agrifood arena is filled with secrets. Blockchain technology as it is currently being deployed would be problematic for many food companies. For many, blockchain is just a solution looking for a problem. Simply put, some companies, like Walmart, have more power and influence over other companies within the same supply chain. In addition, blockchain is really in its infancy and most people are uncertain about its potential. The innovation in blockchain architectures, applications and business concepts is happening rapidly. It’s a decentralized, open-source organism which is challenging to grasp for many, including governments. In food, innovation is always desirable until it becomes real. Once it manifests itself, guards go up. Some organizations are moving ahead while others wait to see what happens. The marketplace is currently fueled with confusion due to the Bitcoin phenomenon, which is labelled by many as being irrational and ridiculous. Cryptocurrencies allow for transactions to occur while using blockchain technology, but it remains just an option. Nevertheless, the most important challenge for blockchain technology remains participation. All parties must adopt the technology in order for it to work. In food distribution, not all companies are equal and some can exercise their power more than others. A successful integration of the blockchain requires the engagement of all participating organizations. Walmart’s blockchain will likely be successful because it’s Walmart. But thousands of companies do not have the same clout. Blockchain technology in agrifood has potential but it needs work. Industry public leaders should embrace blockchain as an opportunity and should be added to a digitalization strategy currently affecting the entire food industry. Transparency, productivity, competitiveness and sustainability of the agrifood sector could be enhanced. Nonetheless, research should look at how to generate evidence-based blockchain solutions to democratize data for the entire system before we get too excited","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Sylvain Charlebois, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-12-19T22:41:48Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThere has been a lot of noise on cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin of late.

We were first told in 2009 that many transactions would be verifiable and validated by the bitcoin protocol. However, as we argued in a recent study, a significant adoption barrier to bitcoin is the lack of usability. Since the inception of cryptocurrency, developers and researchers have been using metaphors to explain bitcoin in a clear effort to help people feel more comfortable with the technology. A secure application for holding bitcoins is dubbed a “cryptowallet”, the trading platforms where people can buy and sell bitcoins are called “exchanges”, and in several locations around the world, ATMs have emerged for bitcoin-based transactions. The production of bitcoins is described as “mining”, but the only similarity between this and mining for gold or valuable gems, is that both processes are very, very difficult to achieve. Finally, bitcoins are called “coins”, even though they are entirely digital. Using metaphors to refer to these technologies helps people feel more familiar with the technology. But there is also a downside: people expect that the technology can be used as regular money. One could easily believe that, in fact, such “coins” are stored in a “wallet”, which leads to further misinterpretations: if these are coins, what do they look like? if it’s real money, how do I get refunds for paying for stuff? and do I get change if I don’t have the exact amount? But the coins don’t exist. They are merely entries in a highly secure, very restricted database. There are no wallets, crypto or otherwise. These are either software applications that may or may not connect to the internet, or hardware-based solutions (similar to USB sticks). ATMs can be used to buy and sell coins, but teller machines do not hold “coins”. And, in the bitcoin world, there are many transactions that can’t mimic how regular money works. If I pay for something with pound notes and then regret my purchase, I can return the item to the shop and the shop may or may not issue a refund. But the bitcoin protocol doesn’t allow this. If a transfer of bitcoins has been broadcast to the network, by design that transaction is final. It means that, had I paid for that item with bitcoins, the shop can’t issue a refund but instead has to process a new payment, or a charge back – which incurs additional processing fees. This isn’t a refund – as some money would be deducted from the full amount I originally paid. To support the adoption of bitcoin as an alternative payment, we need to have a system that is cheaper, better and more desirable compared with other forms of payments, such as debit cards. The bitcoin is cheaper, because – even when paying by debit or credit cards – there is always a fee involved for processing such transactions. Some merchants will pay the fee themselves, or roll this cost over to the consumer, as an extra charge for paying by card. Paying in bitcoins has zero cost or very low cost, subject to how much of a hurry the consumer is in. Everyday transactions in bitcoins are fairly straightforward and security is robust: if I need to pay somebody in bitcoins, I can send the exact amount to that other person’s bitcoin address (a randomly generated sequence of characters, that changes every time there is a transaction) by confirming it with my unique PIN-like number. The rest is done by the miners (more about which later) who need to verify that the transaction is unique and genuine. Despite these clear advantages, bitcoin’s desirability factor remains low. And there is little we can do (at least for now) to increase its uptake. Notably, adoption is also affected by trust perceptions. People are more likely to trust the technology if they have a better understanding of how the bitcoin protocol works. This can be achieved without forcing everybody to become an expert in cryptography. What is bitcoin? It’s one of many cryptocurrencies – but the only one that has grabbed the headlines. It is a type of digital currency, created and regulated by a network of thousands of computers (known as peers) using encryption techniques. Because of this, its production is independent from any authority, such as banks and sovereign states – and trust in the bitcoin is produced by the technology itself. How does this happen? Meet the blockchain: Simply put, the blockchain is a very restricted database, whose entries are the bitcoin transactions. The blockchain operates as a digital ledger of transactions. Just like regular businesses that keep a record of money coming in and going out, users of the cryptocurrency need to record all bitcoin-based transactions. The difference is that the blockchain is a decentralised and distributed, open-access ledger whose records are permanent and verifiable by the network of peers. So everybody can view past transactions, but nobody can alter them without having the consent of the majority. This means that the blockchain doesn’t exhibit weaknesses associated with traditional ledgers. The blockchain technology is secure by design. How are bitcoins produced? Through mining, which is undertaken by the peers of the network. The miners are people and organisations that connect their computers in the network to offer processing power, using special software to solve very difficult algorithms, while leveraging the power of advanced computers and graphic cards. In return for their services (creating new bitcoins, authenticating transactions, maintaining the blockchain), they get rewarded with new bitcoins. Where are bitcoins stored? A cryptowallet – which is a software application that stores private keys (code that looks like a very long PIN) – is where all bitcoins are stored. These private keys are connected to public keys (code again, but the equivalent would be a bank account). The best way to understand how a cryptowallet works is to think of it, in similar terms, as a secure connection between a person’s PIN to their bank account, which then allows them to check balances and make payments. The bitcoin hasn’t become the alternative payment system for consumers that was promised eight years ago. Widespread adoption of the cryptocurrency is hobbled by a number of factors: its reputation is associated far too often with alleged bad boys, and talk of a bubble that’s about to pop persists even as bitcoin continues to surge. But, above all else, few people can cut through the jargon to understand how it actually works. These perceptions can shift if bitcoin-based transactions become easier to comprehend in a way that will help people build trust in the technology. Instead of replicating old paradigms, bitcoin should be embraced as a fresh new way to pay for stuff.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Efpraxia D.

The extradition case of Alexander Vinnik – the alleged Russian mastermind of a US$4 billion digital money laundering scheme – brings all this to the fore. Vinnik, who was arrested in northern Greece, describes himself as a bitcoin consultant and denies all charges brought against him by US officials who have accused him of running the BTC-e exchange and laundering billions of dollars via bitcoin transactions. He had been waiting for Greece’s Supreme Court to decide whether he could be extradited to the US, where he faces a cybercrime trial. On Wednesday, the court ruled that Vinnik can be extradited to face charges in the US. It’s now up to the Greek justice minister to determine whether the extradition will take place – but it is likely Vinnik will be facing US authorities before long. Vinnik, 38, is one of seven Russian suspects arrested or indicted worldwide this year on US cybercrime charges. He has fought hard against extradition to the US, deploying an expensive team of Greek criminal attorneys before the court. Vinnik has said he is willing to be extradited to his home country of Russia, where he is sought on lesser fraud charges. If the Greek justice minister decides to send Vinnik to Russia instead it will be a diplomatic issue between Greece and the US. Some might bristle at the idea of getting involved in bitcoin, given the Vinnik allegations and other not-so-pretty news stories around the bubbling cryptocurrency that is waiting to burst. But you might still be wondering how it works, and whether you can make some money out of it. A good starting point is to reflect briefly on the value of money. What do you understand by value? Take this year’s must-have Christmas toy – a programmable robot made of little bricks. Your kids want one, you want one, it is in short supply and out of stock pretty much everywhere. Its price is climbing outside standard toy stores. You can buy it for multiples of its retail price on online auction sites. This is a valuable commodity. Perhaps one you could invest in. If you can obtain some of these scarce items at normal price, you could make a killing auctioning them online. Now consider this, what if the toy wasn’t a physical item? What if the sought after product was a game app? You can download it, but you need an activation code to use it, and codes aren’t easy to come about. Scarcity would be due to rationing in supply, not due to physical lack of stock. Assuming you could buy multiple activation codes and auction them online, you could treat these as an investment. Never mind for a second who makes the app and why there are limited activation codes. It is considered a valuable asset. Could it be a commodity, a source of value, a store of such value? Could it be used as currency? Substitute the toy robot or app with bitcoin and you get an idea of what is happening. Bitcoin is a type of software. Think of it as a digital token that can be programmed to do various things, containing a variety of information. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, an information storage system which works as a decentralised ledger. Information is not held on a central server, but is duplicated and dispersed across a huge network. Every time this information is updated, a corresponding change is made across the network. What is the benefit of this decentralisation? Blockchain enthusiasts will tell you that the system is impossible to corrupt or manipulate. Any attempt to “hack” information will be rejected by other nodes in the system that hold the true copy of the information. If you have been awarded a digital token, a bitcoin, you can be sure (we are told) that it is genuine. Great, so we have a supposedly impenetrable digital ledger that evidences little bits of software that people think are valuable. Sounds benign, so why is Vinnik facing allegations of money laundering? Law enforcement officers have realised that the decentralised nature of the ledger and the anonymous nature of the originators and holders of bitcoin potentially make it a wonderful conduit for illegally obtained funds. Remember, the ledger is currently beyond the control, or knowledge of governments and state authorities. Rightly or wrongly, bitcoins are considered valuable and people exchange them for real money. The value of bitcoin has well exceeded US$10,000 and financial firms are set to start trading futures – which are bets on the price of upcoming contracts to exchange bitcoin. Blockchain could be a revolution not only in finance, but also in money laundering. But the era of cowboy cryptocurrency trading is set to come to a grinding halt. Regulators worldwide are reacting to soaring values with attempts to inject a degree of transparency in these trades. Starting with the EU, legislation is planned to force online platforms where bitcoins are traded to carry out due diligence on customers and report suspicious transactions. It will bring trades within the network of rules that try to prevent money laundering and dealing in proceeds of crime, including terrorist financing. If you are thinking of speculating on bitcoin, should you do it? Before you make up your mind, remember this: the last innovation in finance promising incredible rewards with appropriately apportioned risks was the creation of synthetic CDOs and derivative-laden layercakes in the mid noughties. And we all know how that went.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ioannis Glinavos, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-12-13T13:00:56Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eEveryone is going crazy about bitcoin, yet very few people understand what it is, how it relates to \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/uk/topics/blockchain-11427\"\u003eblockchain\u003c/a\u003e and whether this is a legitimate investment tool or a massive scam.

But you might still be wondering how it works, and whether you can make some money out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA good starting point is to reflect briefly on the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://iglinavos.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/money-there-is-no-such-thing-as-money/\"\u003evalue of money\u003c/a\u003e. What do you understand by value? Take this year’s must-have Christmas toy – a programmable robot made of little bricks. Your kids want one, you want one, it is in short supply and out of stock pretty much everywhere. Its price is climbing outside standard toy stores. You can buy it for multiples of its retail price on online auction sites. This is a valuable commodity. Perhaps one you could invest in. If you can obtain some of these scarce items at normal price, you could make a killing auctioning them online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow consider this, what if the toy wasn’t a physical item? What if the sought after product was a game app? You can download it, but you need an activation code to use it, and codes aren’t easy to come about. Scarcity would be due to rationing in supply, not due to physical lack of stock. Assuming you could buy multiple activation codes and auction them online, you could treat these as an investment. Never mind for a second who makes the app and why there are limited activation codes. It is considered a valuable asset. Could it be a commodity, a source of value, a store of such value? Could it be used as currency?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSubstitute the toy robot or app with bitcoin and you get an idea of what is happening. Bitcoin is a type of software. Think of it as a digital token that can be programmed to do various things, containing a variety of information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are based on \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/technology-will-make-todays-government-obsolete-and-thats-good-86430\"\u003eblockchain technology\u003c/a\u003e, an information storage system which works as a decentralised ledger. Information is not held on a central server, but is duplicated and dispersed across a huge network. Every time this information is updated, a corresponding change is made across the network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat is the benefit of this decentralisation? Blockchain enthusiasts will tell you that the system is impossible to corrupt or manipulate. Any attempt to “hack” information will be rejected by other nodes in the system that hold the true copy of the information. If you have been awarded a digital token, a bitcoin, you can be sure (we are told) that it is genuine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBeyond government control\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGreat, so we have a supposedly impenetrable digital ledger that evidences little bits of software that people think are valuable. Sounds benign, so why is Vinnik facing allegations of money laundering? Law enforcement officers have realised that the decentralised nature of the ledger and the anonymous nature of the originators and holders of bitcoin potentially make it a wonderful conduit for illegally obtained funds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure class\u003d\"align-left \"\u003e\n \u003cdiv class\u003d\"placeholder-container\" style\u003d\"--aspect-ratio-percent:68.35443037974683%;--background-color:#b48c51\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg alt\u003d\"\" class\u003d\"lazyload\" data-src\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/198995/original/file-20171213-27565-1dehmr1.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d237\u0026amp;fit\u003dclip\" data-srcset\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/198995/original/file-20171213-27565-1dehmr1.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d411\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/198995/original/file-20171213-27565-1dehmr1.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d30\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d411\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/198995/original/file-20171213-27565-1dehmr1.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d15\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d411\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/198995/original/file-20171213-27565-1dehmr1.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d517\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/198995/original/file-20171213-27565-1dehmr1.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d30\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d517\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/198995/original/file-20171213-27565-1dehmr1.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d15\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d517\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d3 2262w\" sizes\u003d\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n  \u003cspan class\u003d\"caption\"\u003eBitcoin investors are as happy as pigs in mud.

To facilitate movement of value (such as money) and changes in ownership (shares, for example), and even to manage online identities. The Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) has announced that it will use a blockchain-based system to record who owns shares of listed companies, and to keep track of transactions and settlements when people buy and sell shares. The move comes as the price of Bitcoin has risen more than US$14,000 in the past year.

When someone transfers a Bitcoin, it is verified by the system, encrypted, and a new line (or “block”) is added to the spreadsheet. The ASX’s blockchain will replace the ASX’s CHESS (Clearing House Electronic Sub-registry System) system. Currently, the ASX requires each trade to be verified against the ASX’s centralised database of ownership records and reconciled with payments. So while trades take place in fractions of a second, the actual clearance (making sure who owns what) and settlement (the transfer of money and shares) is cumbersome, slow, expensive, and prone to human error.

This means that our financial markets will work better, offering an immediate benefit to Australia’s economy.

Companies choose where to list, based on a variety of factors including the quality of the exchange technology. More business for the ASX will translate into more local jobs. One potential downside of the ASX adopting the blockchain, however, is that some workers who currently process settlements on the ASX may lose their jobs.

In other words, the ASX’s blockchain is just the beginning of a technological transformation of Australia’s financial markets.

This huge spike in value has many asking if it is a bubble or if the high price today is here to stay. Finance defines a bubble as a situation where the price of an asset diverges systematically from its fundamentals. Investment mogul Jack Bogle says there is nothing to support Bitcoin, and the head of JP MorganChase, Jamie Dimon has called it a fraud “worse than tulip bulbs”. Like any asset, Bitcoin has some fundamental value, even if only a hope value, or a value arising from scarcity. So there are reasons to hold it. But our research does show that it is experiencing a bubble right now. Together with Shaen Corbet at Dublin City University, we took as the fundamentals of Bitcoin elements of the technology that underpins it (and other cryptocurrencies). We looked at measures, which represent the key theoretical and computational components of how cyrptocurrencies are priced. New Bitcoin is created by a process of mining units called blocks. Bitcoin is built on blockchain technology – a digital ledger of transactions – which enables the currency to be traded independently from any central banking system, without risk of fake or duplicate Bitcoins being used. Instead of having a bank verify pending transactions (a “block”), miners check them and, if approved, the block is cryptographically added to the ever-expanding ledger. So the first measure we examined relates to mining difficulty. It calculates how difficult it is to find a new block relative to the past. As per the Bitcoin Protocol, the number of Bitcoin is capped at 21m (there are currently 16.7m in circulation). This means that as more people mine for Bitcoin and more blocks are created, each block is, all things being equal, worth less than the previous block. The second measure we looked at relates to the “hash rate”. This is the speed at which a computer operates when mining. To successfully mine Bitcoin, you must come up with a 64-digit hexadecimal number (called a “hash”), which is less than or equal to the target hash. The faster you can do this, the better chance you have of finding the next block and receiving payment. The third measurement was “block size”. This relates to how large the chain is at any given time, with larger chains taking longer to mine than shorter ones. And lastly we looked at the volume of transactions conducted. Any asset, in particular any currency, which is more widely used will be more valuable than one which is used less frequently. In our study, we examined data from Bitcoin’s early days – from July 2010 to November 2017. The price of one Bitcoin did not rise above US$1 until April 16, 2011, then to US$10 on June 3, 2011 and US$100 on April 2, 2013. Since then the price rise has clearly been exceptional. We then applied an accepted method that is used to detect and date stamp bubbles after they burst. In essence, this involves identifying the existence of an explosive component in a series. As the series, here the price of bitcoin, “explodes”, it runs the risk, like any explosion, of flying apart. A possibly counter-intuitive result of this approach is that if a fundamental driver and the price of an asset both show an explosive component, we might not conclude a bubble is present. A bubble is when something deviates from its fundamental value. If the fundamental value is itself growing explosively then the price would also. Think of dividends on a stock. If, somehow, these were to grow at an explosive rate we might expect to see the price do the same. While unsustainable, this is not technically a bubble. To overcome this, we then date stamp a bubble as being present when the price shows an explosive component and the underlying fundamentals do not. Here are the results of the analysis: The orange lines denote when the price is showing explosive behaviour. We also see a period where the hash rate was growing explosively – the blue columns in late 2013 and early 2014. This is also an indication of a price bubble, which went on to burst. So there are clear points where bubbles are visible – including now. The price of Bitcoin at present shows explosive behaviour in the absence of anything similar in its fundamentals. We see the price moving upwards in a manner that is not related to the technical underpinnings. It is a clear bubble. A weakness of these tests and indeed all bubble identification tests is that they take place after the bubble has burst. Even this test, which can be redone as swiftly as new data arrives, is such. Bubbles by their nature grow in a compound manner – so even a day or two delay in addressing the situation can make a bubble significantly worse. What is not yet available is an accurate advanced warning bubble indicator. In its absence, this approach may be the best. Unfortunately, we cannot use this approach to determine the extent of the bubble. There is no well-accepted model that suggests a “fair” value for Bitcoin. But whatever that level is, it is almost certain that, at present, it is well below where we are now.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Larisa Yarovaya, Brian Lucey, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-12-06T13:51:08Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIn the last year, the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#charts\"\u003eprice of Bitcoin\u003c/a\u003e has increased from less than US$800 to more than US$12,000.

Why caution is required","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"With the price of a bitcoin reaching record highs of more than $10,000, more and more ordinary people consider investing in the cryptocurrency. The recent price surge, however, comes with tremendous risks. Investors should be prepared for the possibility that they could lose their entire investment. Bitcoin was launched in 2008 by an anonymous author under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto as a means of transacting among participants without the need for intermediaries. Since the beginning of this year, the price of bitcoin has increased by 1300% as more and more consumers flock to it hoping to profit off its increasing popularity and the associated increase in value. Cryptocurrencies are not currencies at all. As the Financial Times explains, bitcoin is a string of computer codes which means that new bitcons can be created – up to an agreed limit – by computers that gain the right to do so by solving complex puzzles. Transactions are recorded in a database called a blockchain. Bitcoin, like other assets like gold, doesn’t yield income. You have to sell it to realise any value. And, like gold and other currencies, it can be transferred peer-to-peer. Part of the nervousness about bitcoin is that, along with other cyptocurrencies, it challenges the traditional role of banks and central banks. In the classical world, banks act as intermediaries by providing loans out of the deposits they took and from funding from the central bank. The central bank uses the rate at which it provides this funding as a lever to ensure price stability. The introduction of cryptocurrencies threatens this model because banks are no longer necessary to intermediate funds and there is no central bank to ensure that prices are stable. The more immediate fears about bitcoin centre on the recent dramatic rise in its value. There’s nervousness in the market that a flash crash might be imminent after the cryptocurrency tumble by more than $1,300 in minutes on the bitcoin exchange Bitfinex. It did recover to levels above $10,800. The flash crash echoes long standing warnings that the bitcoin party is set to end in tears. Most recently Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, one of the world’s largest investment banks declared that he would fire any employee trading bitcoin for being stupid. In a highly unusual alliance, his words were echoed by economics Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz, who has gone even further arguing that bitcoin: ought to be outlawed. All of these are clear warning signs that the professionals do not trust the lofty promises of crypto enthusiasts. There is no doubt that Bitcoin – and in particular blockchain, the technology behind it – has the potential to revolutionise the financial services industry. A blockchain functions as a transparent and incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions, recorded in chronological order, that operates on a peer-to-peer network. Fundamentally, the technology allows exchange of value to occur in an environment of peers with conflicting interests without the need for trusted intermediaries. That, in effect, wipes out the need for banks or financial services companies which fulfil this role. The use of the technology is not limited to financial transactions. Virtually anything of value can be traded on a blockchain. But no matter how useful the underlying blockchain technology is, or how widely it can be applied, there are real and substantial risks involved in bitcoin. The first, and most significant risk is that compared to any currency, share, or gold, bitcoin is extremely volatile. The volatility of bitcoin to US dollar is almost six times the volatility of the Rand to US dollar. While this is great in good times, it is potentially devastating for investors in bad times. When professional investors decide on which assets to hold, they look at both the return and the volatility of the asset. Only investors with a healthy appetite for risk are willing to invest in risky, volatile assets. Usually these are finance professionals, for example in large investment banks or hedge funds. Investors with a lower risk appetite, such as asset managers or pension funds, prefer assets with a somewhat lower return, but which are less volatile. The rule of thumb is that the sophistication of an investor increases with the volatility of the asset she invests in. But with bitcoin this rule of thumb doesn’t hold true. More and more private investors have been flocking to bitcoin ‘exchanges’ that have sprung up all over the internet and that are aggressively advertised on social media. There is a huge risk that bitcoin is already overvalued. The practical use cases for bitcoin are limited. It doesn’t enable enough transactions to take place per second to be used as a replacement for a modern payment system. And it doesn’t offer any functionality other than pseudonymous transactions – transactions where the true identity of the counterparties is hidden. Bitcoin is favoured by pyramid schemes, including the infamous MMM pyramid scheme in Nigeria. In a recent article, the Financial Times called bitcoin itself a pyramid scheme, much to the dismay of crypto enthusiasts. (A pyramid scheme is usually an illegal operation in which participants pay to join and profit mainly from payments made by subsequent participants. If no new people come in, it collapses.) The third, and possibly biggest risk is regulatory. In September 2017, the Chinese government outlawed bitcoin exchanges in mainland China, sending the price of bitcoin tumbling. Despite the claim that bitcoin is a “global currency”, the reality is that 58% of all bitcoin mining happens in China. If at any point the Chinese government should decide to make Bitcoin mining illegal the price is likely to plunge into oblivion. Other countries have also voiced concern. The Russian Central Bank recently issued a warning to investors on the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies, citing concerns about a bubble. This suggests that there might be a concerted crackdown. Cryptocurrencies are banned in India as their use is a violation of foreign exchange rules. The Australian Reserve Bank has taken a different approach. It monitors the cryptocurrency market in a bid understand the underlying technology. The South African Reserve Bank has expressed its openness to blockchain technologies. But it has also highlighted potential risks to consumers. There are real risks that many consumers investing in cryptocurrency don’t fully understand. Advertisements promise that bitcoin can make you rich fast. And social media is alive with stories about friends of neighbours or distant cousins who have made a lot of money through bitcoin. Without a doubt, these cases are real, and those who invested early can reap large benefits. But this is true in every bubble – from the dotcom bubble to the tulip mania. It’s also true in every pyramid scheme. As always, investors should be extremely wary with any scheme that promises quick returns.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Co-Pierre Georg, Qobolwakhe Dube, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-12-05T12:04:56Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eWith the price of a bitcoin \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.coindesk.com/price/\"\u003ereaching\u003c/a\u003e record highs of more than $10,000, more and more ordinary people consider investing in the cryptocurrency.

In the classical world, banks act as intermediaries by providing loans out of the deposits they took and from funding from the central bank. The central bank uses the rate at which it provides this funding as a lever to ensure price stability. The introduction of cryptocurrencies threatens this model because banks are no longer necessary to intermediate funds and there is no central bank to ensure that prices are stable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more immediate fears about bitcoin centre on the recent dramatic rise in its value. There’s nervousness in the market that a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitcoin-price-flash-crashes-10075-market-goes-berserk/\"\u003eflash crash\u003c/a\u003e might be imminent after the cryptocurrency tumble by more than $1,300 in minutes on the bitcoin exchange \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bitfinex.com/\"\u003eBitfinex\u003c/a\u003e.

That, in effect, wipes out the need for banks or financial services companies which fulfil this role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe use of the technology is not limited to financial transactions. Virtually anything of value can be traded on a blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut no matter how useful the underlying blockchain technology is, or how widely it can be applied, there are real and substantial risks involved in bitcoin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eVolatility versus returns\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first, and most significant risk is that compared to any currency, share, or gold, bitcoin is extremely volatile. The volatility of bitcoin to US dollar is almost six times the volatility of the Rand to US dollar. While this is great in good times, it is potentially devastating for investors in bad times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen professional investors decide on which assets to hold, they look at both the return and the volatility of the asset. Only investors with a healthy appetite for risk are willing to invest in risky, volatile assets. Usually these are finance professionals, for example in large investment banks or hedge funds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInvestors with a lower risk appetite, such as asset managers or pension funds, prefer assets with a somewhat lower return, but which are less volatile.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rule of thumb is that the sophistication of an investor increases with the volatility of the asset she invests in. But with bitcoin this rule of thumb doesn’t hold true. More and more private investors have been \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/27/bitcoin-exchange-coinbase-has-more-users-than-stock-brokerage-schwab.html\"\u003eflocking\u003c/a\u003e to bitcoin ‘exchanges’ that have sprung up all over the internet and that are aggressively advertised on social media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOvervalued\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a huge risk that bitcoin is already overvalued.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe practical use cases for bitcoin are limited.

The most valuable firms in the world, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google, are in a race to hire leading AI researchers to advance their efforts on autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics and a range of other ventures. At the same time, governments are rushing to support the technology that might drive the next economic paradigm shift with funding and incentives. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to the promise of AI at a conference recently, where he focused on the opportunity for Canada to attract investment and create jobs in the burgeoning field. But are governments inadvertently laying the groundwork for their own irrelevance? As policy director at the University of Toronto’s Mowat Centre, I focus on the impacts of technology on the labour market, government services and social programs. Already today, the private sector is deploying cutting-edge technology as soon as practicable while the public sector struggles to implement turn-of-the-century solutions to seemingly straightforward tasks. The federal government’s ongoing travails with the Phoenix pay system upgrade, which was designed to save $70 million a year but instead may cost $1 billion to fix, is just the latest example of public sector challenges with large-scale information technology projects. And the gap between the two worlds is likely to only get wider as technology — whether AI or blockchain — becomes more advanced, complex and disruptive. The private sector’s capacity and ability to work with IT is already higher than the government’s. As salaries and opportunities continue to draw talent to the private sector, we’ll likely see a corresponding increase in the capability gap between the two. Governments are already facing a crisis of trust. According to a survey by public relations consultancy Edelman, only 43 per cent of Canadians trust government, the lowest among surveyed institutions. Just 26 per cent of Canadians surveyed view government officials and regulators as credible. Citizens, increasingly accustomed to living and working digitally, are only going to have higher expectations for government’s technological adeptness and capability in the future. Banks, retailers, manufacturing firms and mines are all transforming themselves into digital organizations. If our governments remain rooted in the industrial age, their decline in relevance is only likely to accelerate. Most government structures and processes date back earlier than the 1950s. This relevance gap won’t just be about accessing services more easily and effectively. In the near future we will likely see a debate about why public sector employees are relatively immune to job disruptions and precarious work conditions, while technology could accelerate both trends for those in the private sector. As job quality continues to erode in the private sector, the public sector will appear to be apart from trends in precarious work. This will likely lead private sector workers to question why their taxes are funding well-paying, secure positions while they themselves may be struggling mightily. The future of work for many in the private sector will increasingly involve jumping from gig to part-time role and back again to make ends meet, with little left over to save for retirement or for “benefits” such as mental health services or prescription medications, labour market trends over the past 30 to 40 years suggest. Part-time work is up 57 per cent over the past 40 years, and now accounts for nearly 20 per cent of jobs in Canada. Temporary work is also up 57 per cent over the past 20 years, and now forms 13.5 per cent of workforce. Across OECD countries, growth in non-standard work accounts for 60 per cent of job growth since the mid-1990s. Those employment trends are likely to get even worse due to technology and corporate strategies. In 2014, the public sector unionization rate was 71.3 per cent — nearly five times the private-sector rate of 15.2 per cent, which raises hard questions about who will speak up for the private sector worker in an increasingly lean and fissured labour market. A 2016 study by Deloitte and Oxford University found that up to 850,000 jobs in the United Kingdom’s public sector could be lost as a result of automation by 2030, in administrative roles as well as jobs for teachers and police officers. Merely applying these same projections to the Canadian public sector would mean over 500,000 jobs at risk out of 3.6 million public sector roles. But collective agreements could impede any attempts to pivot away from employees performing routine administrative tasks and towards workers with digital skills. If the economy at large continues to wring efficiencies out of human labour and substitute technological approaches where possible, it becomes hard to imagine the public sector trundling along as it always has. Quite simply, the public sector will need to develop a more efficient workforce and adopt more agile structures and strategies in order to maintain relevance in a digital world. So, what’s the right path forward? While it’s promising to see governments and other public sector organizations move forward with digital service agendas, we can’t expect them to simply overlay digital solutions onto existing processes and reap the real benefits of technology. The public sector, ranging from the core civil service to health care to education, must fundamentally transform how it operates. Do we need countless contribution agreements, contracts and reimbursements to be physically vetted by clerks in multiple offices when blockchain technology could instantly verify all of those same transactions? Do policy units need 30 advisers to prepare advice for government ministers, or can much of their work be done automatically with a select few adding high-value insights? Can we employ telepresence to reach students in remote communities with high-quality teachers? Will medical diagnostics be transformed by neural networks that can more accurately detect cancers and other diseases? Countries like Estonia, widely regarded as the most advanced digital society in the world, demonstrate that it’s possible to rethink government as a digital platform. Whether and how quickly Canada’s public sector can leverage technological advancements to radically increase the efficiency and effectiveness of programs and services will be perhaps its greatest challenge in the years to come. Delays and missteps will only continue to put the public service further behind mainstream business and consumer trends, and risk a continued decline in relevance for our public institutions.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Sunil Johal, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-29T22:41:29Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eArtificial intelligence is the hot topic of the

But amid the excitement, regulators are fretting about criminals who are increasingly using cryptocurrencies to escape detection from law enforcement. Why is digital currency so appealing to miscreants? Cryptocurrencies are a recent phenomenon and – as with all new technology – it takes time for regulators to catch up. Bitcoin was the first to gain an international reputation as a digital currency that could be used to settle transactions after it was anonymously created in early 2009. Cryptocurrencies are decentralised, meaning that they are issued without a central administering authority. They are cryptography-based, distributed open source and function on a peer-to-peer basis. Significantly, the underlying protocols on which most cryptocurrencies are based do not require or provide user identification and verification. Also the historical transaction records generated on the blockchain (the technology behind bitcoin, which serves as a public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions) are not necessarily associated with an individual’s identity. Cryptocurrencies are also – by definition – convertible virtual currencies, as they can be exchanged for fiat money such as pounds, dollars and euros and this facilitates their use for settling commercial transactions. Bitcoin is now an acceptable form of payment in exchange for goods and services by household names such as Microsoft, Expedia and Subway. At the same time, blockchain technology is being adopted by more businesses. Private transactions enabled by the use of bitcoin are key to understanding the growth of cryptocurrencies among consumers. However, this advantage is keeping regulators and law enforcers awake at night. The infamous Silk Road case drives this point home. Bitcoin was used to purchase drugs through the dark web – transactions that weren’t spotted by the authorities. But hard-to-track criminal activity isn’t the only threat from the use of cryptocurrencies – there’s also the possibility of their use to finance terrorism, given that the formal banking sector is now adept at spotting suspicious movement and mobilisation of monies through the banking system The fact that they can be converted into pounds, dollars and euros does make regulation of cryptocurrency more feasible. It can be done at the point of their conversion through virtual currency exchanges – which, as financial institutions, can be regulated. International financial regulation and a growing number of national measures across the globe, such as “Know Your Customer” (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) directed at financial institutions, have been strengthened. And, when implemented effectively, it’s now easier to track down individuals engaging in illegal transactions. But the global nature of this payment mechanism is the biggest challenge. Payments can be easily affected cross-border because conversion of the likes of bitcoin through currency exchanges can be transacted in different parts of the world – including in jurisdictions with lax financial regulatory regimes and weak KYC/AML measures. This means that, while jurisdictions with stronger regulatory powers may clamp down on criminal activities, such efforts can be easily wiped out because perpetrators are likely to migrate to countries with lax regimes. Nonetheless, positive steps are being taken to regulate financial technology (fintech) products such as cryptocurrencies. Emerging challenges within this sector has led to the arrival of regtech – which, among other things, is regulatory technology adopted to address fintech risk issues. Regtech covers artificial intelligence, big data and machine learning – technology that enables detailed data analysis on platforms such as blockchain. Again, regtech is only likely to be adopted effectively in jurisdictions with advanced regulatory regimes, so the extent of its effectiveness in policing the global cryptocurrency phenomenon appears limited. Another challenge is the investigation and prosecution of illegal activities perpetrated with payments using cryptocurrencies, with semi-anonymity of the blockchain making it difficult to monitor transactions and identify suspicious behaviour, such as drug sales. Law enforcement agencies find it incredibly difficult to trace illicit proceeds that are laundered using cryptocurrencies and – once again – are scuppered by different legal systems around the world. Different jurisdictions have their own approaches to regulating cyber-related transactions, which makes international cooperation deeply challenging. In some countries, such as North Korea and China, regulation of web-based transactions is significant for national security policy. Legal mechanisms are in place to allow extensive government intrusion into the sender and recipient details of every single transmission. Other countries, such as the US and the UK, cautiously approach online regulation to balance security concerns against constitutionally protected freedoms and to preserve privacy and data protection laws. It means that a worldwide effort is needed to regulate this global payment mechanism. Governments, financial regulators, financial intelligence units and law enforcement agencies must all agree to a unified approach in tackling cryptocurrencies. Without this, effective regulation of bitcoin and similar currencies is unattainable. A starting point could be instituting minimum regulation, such as currently exists in some international financial standards including the Basle Committee’s Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision and the IOSCO principles of securities regulation. Countries across the world are encouraged to implement these provisions, which indicates that they embrace investor-friendly policies. A similar standard applied to cryptocurrencies would be a sensible way forward, given the patchwork approach to regulating cyber-related transactions around the globe.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Iwa Salami, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-29T14:49:31Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe news that bitcoin had \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc422666-d4b0-11e7-8c9a-d9c0a5c8d5c9\"\u003ebroken the $10,000 barrier\u003c/a\u003e reflects the way that mainstream investors have been flocking to cryptocurrencies over the past year.

Philip Hammond also spoke of the UK government’s commitment to innovation, with the chancellor calling for a new tech startup to be founded in Britain every half hour. Put the two together and what do you get? Govcoin. You probably haven’t heard of Govcoin because the government has been very discrete about trials of the technology, which began last year. It’s the brainchild of a London-based tech startup of the same name, led by mathematician, former financier and entrepreneur Robert Kay. Govcoin, intent on “disrupting” welfare state provision, has been working with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) since early 2016 to develop a blockchain solution for welfare payments. So how does it work? Govcoin aims to virtually mimic the jam-jar method which, according to the Money Advice Service, is a good way to manage your savings. The aim of Govcoin is to use this traditional method in the virtual environment of a mobile phone app to give claimants instant access to benefits and avoid delays in payment processing. “Claimants can – voluntarily – download an app, which enables them to create virtual jam jars and apportion money to them. Whether that’s ‘rent’, ‘gas and electric’ – it’s entirely up to them,” said Kay in an interview with City AM last autumn. “People who are on the fringes of financial inclusion,” he added, “or who are financially excluded, need a special service which can give them instant access to their benefits – three days going through the banking system may mean using a payday lender, or being thrown out of your house.” Given the recent and ongoing problems faced by government over slipping deadlines for the deployment of universal credit, as well as concerns that delays in payments could lead to an increase of cases of homelessness, Govcoin must sound like music to the ears of ministers. But isn’t it simply a proposal for the wholesale privatisation of welfare distribution – a proposal legitimised by the government’s wider commitment to unfettered tech innovation? Kay claims Govcoin will financially empower benefit claimants. But its distribution model involves benefits being paid – not in pounds and pence – but in the form of a cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin. Govcoin promises to allow claimants to pay for goods and services – such as utilities – linked to the system. This is significant because, unlike Sterling, cryptocurrencies in the form of coins or tokens transacted on a blockchain can harbour additional and potentially valuable data regarding the person “spending” it. This data can then be used to create new markets in goods and services, or what Adam Greenfield refers to in his book, Radical Technologies, as “ever-tighter loops of response to desire”. Using benefit claimants’ data in this way is highly cynical. Far from empowering individuals, it offers up seriously vulnerable people to the forces of commercial opportunism. This might appear unreasonably speculative on my part and there have been “categorical assurances” made by the government that it won’t be used to monitor the activities of claimants. What is more, according to Kay, “the DWP has no access to the application or the data” held by Govcoin. But I’m not sure government or the state ought to be the concern here, given how clear Kay has been about the commercial opportunities offered by the technology in this sector. Govcoin aims to monetise the project through a network of merchants. However, it doesn’t end there. “We also haven’t looked at advertising opportunities yet, but clearly they exist,” Kay said. Just because the DWP – we’re told – won’t have access to the data, doesn’t mean the data will evaporate. Quite the opposite in fact when the immutable recording of information and data that blockchain provides is taken into account. The technology might in this sense be considered “disruptive” – insofar as that term has any real meaning in the context of political economy, as I have argued elsewhere. But not in any way that can or should be considered good, fair or even reasonable. If the cost of disrupting welfare provision in order to satisfy desires for innovation involves the cynical exploitation of vulnerable people for commercial gain, then it is not a cost worth paying. Govcoin is yet to be implemented and it’s uncertain if the DWP plans to move it beyond small-scale trials. If Hammond’s Budget speech is to be believed, the tantalising opportunity of a tech “solution” to the problems of universal credit may be too tempting for the government to overlook. Conservative peer Lord Henley, who is a government spokesman on the Govcoin experiment, said in March 2017: “There is no next trial planned at this stage.” More recently, during a upper chamber debate on the “Fourth Industrial Revolution” – in which blockchain is viewed as playing a key role – Henley failed to mention Govcoin by name. A feeble response was elicited from Henley, following an enthusiastic comment made by fellow Tory peer Lord Holmes, who – hinting at the subject – said: “There are some excellent initiatives in various departments, not least the use of blockchain in the Department for Work and Pensions to greatly empower benefits recipients.” Henley replied: “My noble friend is right to say that there are great opportunities ahead of us.” The government may be backing tech innovation, but it doesn’t mean companies such as Govcoin should have a free pass into the heart of civic life. Ironically, the dream for some who backed the technology from the start was that cryptocurrencies and blockchain would mean less government interference – not more.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Robert Herian, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-27T16:35:35Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe UK chancellor’s recent Budget reminded us that systemic problems continue to plague the government’s delayed roll-out of universal credit – a single monthly welfare payment that will replace six separate benefits.

If true, this means we could create a world without a trusted “man in the middle”. We could have financial services without a bank verifying transactions and we could transfer ownership (of a house, for instance) without a lawyer. But this idea is wrong. The blockchain does not create or eliminate trust. It merely converts trust from one form to another. While we previously had to trust financial institutions to verify transactions, with the blockchain we have to trust the technology itself. It is also not clear that a blockchain-powered currency (such as Bitcoin) can go mainstream without the backing of a trusted authority. In fact there are hardly any examples of money (including gold) that have ever worked without the backing of a central authority or a sovereign. Read more: Demystifying the blockchain: a basic user guide When you make a traditional money transfer the bank will first verify that you have sufficient cash, and then debit your account and credit the recipient. Think of the blockchain as a decentralised version of this process. Rather than all of this information being held and verified by the bank, it is done on an “open public ledger”. When someone transfers a Bitcoin, it is verified by “miners” (really powerful computers), then encrypted, and a “block” is added to the ledger. Because all of the verification is done by the system itself, the idea is that users do not need a trusted central authority. Instead, trust is transferred from one central authority (such as a bank) to many decentralised, anonymous participants (the miners). But here lies the problem – users must trust the technology and the governance of the system. In economic exchanges there are three kinds of trust: institutions-based, characteristic-based, and process-based. Institutions-based trust comes from the involvement of a central authority. Think of a commercial bank (and a government insuring deposits in that bank), as in the previous example. Characteristic-based trust is the trust we have in people mostly because they represent some sort of similarity to us, or show admirable features or values that warrant trust. For example, you are more likely to trust someone from the area where you grew up than someone from elsewhere; you might also trust someone with a similar taste in music, or who simply embodies what you value in life. Process-based trust arises when previous experiences suggest that the inputs by one party will be predictably reciprocated. This trust often evolves into social micro-rules or norms. For example, most people would generally trust that if they do not harm a person, that person will also not harm them. Likewise, one would trust that others will answer when asked a question. It follows that trust can be destroyed and lost if the central authority fails, the person you trusted fails, or the process you trusted fails. Read more: Blockchain really only does one thing well When it comes to the blockchain specifically, we can see that there are at least two forms of this trust at play. Because of its complexity many people may find it difficult to trust the process. But some may choose to trust it when like-minded people use it (characteristic-based trust). Indeed, friends of or nerds in the same sphere as Vitalik Buterin, the founder of the Ethereum cryptocurrency, likely became early adopters of the technology. Yet, a different kind of trust may also be at play. For instance, when the Ethereum-powered decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) was hacked, users asked Buterin to respond. This shows that people still need a central authority or will appeal to one if the system fails. Likewise, the fake news that Vitalik had died led to US$4 billion dollars being wiped off the market value of Ethereum. With the assumed loss of the central authority, many also lost their trust in the underlying system. Read more: What\u0027s holding up the blockchain? This may not be ideal but a truly open public blockchain (that is, one without any central authority behind it) is unlikely to work. Analysis of the evolution of money shows that almost all currencies throughout history have had the backing of an authority. This is easy to understand. Think of a raw gold nugget. To be sure about its value you would need to trust a jeweller - a valuation authority. Because this process of identifying the quality of gold takes time, raw gold is not the ideal medium of exchange. This problem with gold was largely resolved by the creation of the mint. In other words, the minting and standardisation of gold coins reduced the identification costs and thus the need to trust decentralised third parties such as the jeweller. Instead, there was now a need to trust a central authority – the mint. You also need to trust that the government will accept tax payments in the minted gold coins, and that other people will take the coins as payment for goods and services. More generally, if people lose trust in the authority and the value of a currency, they will try to sell the currency, leading to inflation or even hyperinflation. All of this shows that gold and any other form of money – including cryptocurrencies – are not “trustless”. The importance of the trusted central authority can also be understood in the case that a currency is destroyed. For example, when the Roman empire fell, the central authority collapsed and so did the currency it backed. Process-based trust collapsed as well, which shows that the process only worked because of the institution. If history is any guide, privately created money such as Bitcoin or any other blockchain-based currency is unlikely to become globally accepted without a trusted central authority. This means that an “open” blockchain will not succeed. Although a “closed” blockchain, with the backing of a central authority, might work, it would be very different to the core feature of Bitcoin and the blockchain - decentralization.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Dirk Baur, Niels Van Quaquebeke, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-16T01:26:53Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eA common idea about the blockchain, the technology that powers Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is that it can “\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21677198-technology-behind-bitcoin-could-transform-how-economy-works-trust-machine\"\u003ecreate trust\u003c/a\u003e”, or allow two parties to make a transaction “\u003ca href\u003d\"https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\"\u003ewithout relying on trust\u003c/a\u003e”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf true, this means we could create a world without a trusted “man in the middle”.

But this innovative new technology has a surprising link to the days of medieval treasuries. Blockchain is a distributed ledger that uses cryptography — mathematical code — to chain together records of transactions in a tamper-resistant and transparent manner. It is being used as an alternative or replacement for national currencies, contracts, internet device authentication and more. This form of record-keeping, though technologically novel in the digital era, is not so new after all. Historian M.T. Clanchy tells us that it existed in the medieval era, during the transition from oral to written forms of memorialization. At that time, symbolic objects played a crucial role in providing evidence of transactions, rights and entitlements. I’ve been researching how governments and businesses around the world are either planning for or already piloting the use of blockchain for record-keeping. The goal of my research is to determine what these applications of the technology actually do — as opposed to what the marketing hype says they do. I’ve been to Estonia to study how the government there is using distributed ledger technology to protect the integrity of citizens’ medical records. I’ve been to Sweden to discuss how its land registry is testing blockchain to record the transfer of land ownership. I’ve reviewed proposed blockchain systems for land title registration in Honduras, new pilot implementations for land transaction records in Brazil. And I’ve spoken with innumerable new ventures looking to transform record-keeping with blockchain technology. From this research, I’ve noticed three specific design patterns for blockchain record-keeping, which need explanation to understand how blockchain relates to medieval practices. I have classified these categories as mirror, digital record and tokenized systems. The first of these design patterns is what I call the “mirror” type system. I characterize this type of system as being the most similar to current centralized record-keeping. In these types of systems — be they for medical records, land titles, public archives or some other kind of records — digital records are neither created nor kept “on chain,” despite some claims by blockchain companies to the contrary. Instead, a kind of digital fingerprint of the records in the form of a 256-bit random number, known as a “hash,” is entered into the blockchain. The purpose of recording this digital fingerprint in the blockchain is to protect the integrity of the records and be able to detect if they were tampered with. To prove that the records are tamper-free, the original digital records must be preserved in off-chain trustworthy digital repositories alongside preservation of their hashes in the blockchain. Proving integrity of the records involves matching the hash of the record you want to validate with its digital fingerprint on the blockchain. If the hashes match, then the record you hold has not been altered. The second type of approach I’ve noticed is one that I call the “digital records” design pattern. In this type of system, new digital records are actually created within the blockchain itself, primarily by using smart-contracts. Smart-contracts are computer programs that instruct the blockchain when to carry out a transaction, such as sending funds from one user to another. In these types of systems, the text of records is no longer in natural language that people can read. It is written in computer code for machines to read. The rise of the smart contract raises a number of challenging and currently unanswered questions, such as what to do in case an error occurs and a smart contract doesn’t behave as expected. In the 2016 Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) incident, for example, the attacker exploited poorly written smart code to siphon off 3.6 million Ether — an alternative to the popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin — roughly equivalent to $68 million at the time of the attack. Equally importantly, current principles, standards and practices for managing and preserving digital records are not designed for smart-contracts and other distributed autonomous records created on chain. Ensuring that society’s evidence infrastructure remains intact presents challenges similar to the early days of email and other electronic records. New approaches, yet to be developed, will be needed. The third type of blockchain record-keeping design pattern is the “tokenized” type of solution. This is arguably the farthest from our current form of record-keeping, and many would argue the most innovative. With this type of system, not only are records captured on chain but valuable assets are represented and captured on chain. These assets can symbolize anything of value: currency such as a primary use blockchain, Bitcoin; land, fine wine, food, diamonds, artworks — you name it. In this third, tokenized form we can find centuries-old predecessors to blockchain. Are these assets really records? For answers, we may turn to the English archival theorist Sir Hilary Jenkinson, who observed in his 1937 Manual of Archive Administration that “there is a case where an old pair of military epaulettes; and among enclosures to letters, forming in each case an integral part of the document, the writer can recall portraits, human hair, whip-cord (part of cat-o’-nine-tails), a penny piece inscribed with disloyal sentiments, and a packet of strange powder destined to cure cancer.” In Jenkinson’s view, these “exhibits” formed part of the archive, or collective body of records, because they provided evidence of business transactions. We now have come to view these so-called exhibits more as museum objects than records because before the digital era, the physical awkwardness of these objects meant that they could not be managed with other records. Just as coins and paper currency once represented records of reserves of gold in a national treasury, Jenkinson’s exhibits were themselves tokens that represented other things. Today, what once had a material form can be essentially dematerialized. Paper currency can be transformed into cryptocurrency. Land, fine wine, artwork, diamonds, food and other material objects — though still physically in existence — can be transformed into virtual representations called “tokens.” In this way, in a tokenized, blockchain record-keeping system, literally every thing potentially becomes a record. This is not a new idea. At the time of the Norman Conquest, many grants were conferred by the bare word (nude verbo) without a writing or charter, but only with a sword, helmet, horn or cup. One example is the broken knife of Stephen de Bulmer kept in the archives of Durham Cathedral. It bears a parchment label recording the details of a gift of land made in the middle of the 12th century — which the knife itself symbolizes. Just like the knives, horns, cups, rings and other objects customarily used in the conveyance of land during the medieval period, today’s tokenized blockchain record-keeping systems use valuable cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as symbolic representations of assets like land. This raises the question of whether blockchain technology will return today’s archival repositories to their medieval roots as the treasure storehouses of kings. Will it be back to the future?","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Victoria Lemieux, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-09T22:58:10Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eBlockchain is an emergent technology that may be as transformative as the internet, according to many predictions.

The RBA has already been approached by interested startups to create this new digital currency, known as the “DAD” or Digital Australian Dollar. In contrast with other cryptocurrencies a state-backed digital currency has the advantage of being backed by the government as in fiat currency, but at the same time has the technological advantages shared by other cryptocurrencies. A digital Australian dollar could remove the role of middlemen and create a cheaper electronic currency system, while at the same time enabling the government to fully regulate the system. It would also allow transactions to settle faster (several minutes to an hour) than the traditional banking system (several hours to several days), especially in a situation where an international payment is involved. We already use the Australian dollar in a digital form, for example paying via your smartphone. But banks are essential in this system, moving money on our behalf. When using a cryptocurrency, you interact with a system like the blockchain, an online ledger that records transactions, directly. Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum are examples of cryptocurrency that use the blockchain in this way. These currencies are created by the community that use them and are accepted and trusted within the community. However, since the community runs the system, the price of the cryptocurrency solely depends on the market mechanism. When the demand increases, the price increases, but when the demand decreases, the price also decreases. While it might create an opportunity for speculators to gain profit from trading, it also creates risk for the cryptocurrency holders. In comparison to cryptocurrency, the digital Australian dollar might be well managed that the price volatility could be reduced significantly. The government holds the capability of increasing or decreasing the money supply in the system. This power can be used to stabilise the market supply of the new digital currency. The blockchain technology also reduces the fee for every payment made. This is made possible by removing the role of banks or other intermediary parties charging fees for their services. However, a small transaction fee still needs to be introduced to protect the system from being flooded by adversaries with insignificant transactions. The characteristics of cryptocurrency itself might limit its usage to daily transactions. As the pioneer of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin was created to become a payment system, but the users gain incentive by simply saving their cryptocurrency and not using them to purchase goods or services. They believe the future price of the cryptocurrency is higher than the current price and thus does not make a good medium of exchange nor a store of value. There is no guarantee that the cryptocurrency will hold any value in the future. Since there is nothing to back up the value, users will lose their wealth when the community no longer acknowledges the value of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency might also jeopardise the local government’s effort of implementing regulations to minimise illegal activities. Perpetrators create cryptocurrency transactions easily without being detected by the government’s financial monitoring system. The privacy features of cryptocurrency also make it hard for law enforcement agencies to determine the actors behind illegal activities. Although most governments in the world have enforced the coin exchange services to identify their users, the operation of the cryptocurrency is beyond their reach. The idea of creating a national cryptocurrency is not new. Estonia has explored ways to create Estcoin, following an initiative on the blockchain-based residency registration called e-Residency. Lebanon’s central bank has also started to examine the possibility of creating one. Despite the efforts of those central banks, several questions must first be addressed before launching the real product to the public. The user’s financial data could be exposed since the blockchain will make all transactions created in the system transparent. Consumer protection is also a concern since all transactions made in the blockchain are permanent without the possibility of being reversed. Without firm solutions to those problems, the digital Australian dollar will not satisfy all requirements to be the next groundbreaking innovation for the country’s financial system.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Dimaz Wijaya, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-11-01T18:56:17Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe Reserve Bank of Australia could join the likes of Estonia and Lebanon in creating a cryptocurrency based on the Australian dollar, to reap the benefits of technology like \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/au/topics/blockchain-11427\"\u003ethe blockchain\u003c/a\u003e but with more stability than other well known currencies like Bitcoin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe RBA \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.afr.com/business/banking-and-finance/financial-services/a-digital-australian-dollar-making-the-case-20171027-gz9hai\"\u003ehas already been approached\u003c/a\u003e by interested startups to create this new digital currency, known as the “DAD” or Digital Australian Dollar.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn contrast with other cryptocurrencies a state-backed digital currency has the advantage of being backed by the government as in \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/12/06/fiat-currency-what-it-is-and-why-its-better-than-a.aspx\"\u003efiat currency\u003c/a\u003e, but at the same time has the technological advantages shared by other cryptocurrencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA digital Australian dollar could remove the role of middlemen and create a cheaper electronic currency system, while at the same time enabling the government to fully regulate the system.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"slot clear\" data-id\u003d\"17\"\u003e\n \u003cdiv class\u003d\"inline-promos-skeleton\"\u003e\n  \u003ch5\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cbutton\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt would also allow transactions to settle faster (several minutes to an hour) than the traditional banking system (several hours to several days), especially in a situation where an international payment is involved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe difference between a digital Australian dollar and Bitcoin\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe already use the Australian dollar in a digital form, for example paying via your smartphone.

In the aftermath of the horsemeat scandal in Europe, and with cases reported around the world, including in Canada, awareness is high. Dalhousie University recently released a study on food fraud and the results were surprising: A whopping 63 per cent of Canadians are generally concerned about food fraud. Worse still, more than 40 per cent of Canadians feel they have been victims of food fraud already. These are alarming results that can’t be ignored. Food fraud can take many forms. It can include adulteration — substituting one ingredient with a much cheaper one — or misrepresentation, which may include selling a product as organic when it is not. Food categories that are more vulnerable to food fraud are fish, seafood, liquids, spices, fruits, vegetables and meat products. Canada has seen its share of cases in recent months, one of the most notable ones is Mucci Farms in southwestern Ontario, near the tip of Lake Erie. The company was fined $1.5 million for selling Mexican tomatoes as a product of Canada. Mucci Farms denies that the labelling was intentional and faults their computer system. Other cases have emerged through whistleblowers trying to draw attention to food fraud. Cericola Farms, one of the largest poultry processors in the country, was charged with fraud last year over allegations of organic mislabelling. The number of cases is adding up. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has received over 40 complaints in 2016 and industry observers expect that number to increase in 2017. Some may believe that food fraud is a victimless crime. This is not so. What is at stake is the entire food economy. For any food business to grow and offer high-quality food products, it requires consumer trust. If trust is lost then everything the industry is trying to accomplish will become more challenging. Why would consumers pay more for a product they may deem fraudulent? The majority of food companies are ethically sound, but you only need a few cases to damage the reputation of an entire industry. Most importantly, the Dalhousie study suggests that consumers with allergies or intolerances to particular foods are likely to feel more vulnerable than other consumers when thinking of food fraud. Consequently, food fraud is as much a socioeconomic issue as it is one of public health. Grocers have made recent investments in blockchain technologies that provide a tool to detect products that may pose as counterfeit. But these measures can only do so much. Companies can’t really report fraudulent rivals for fear of retaliation — food companies denouncing fraudulent cases are themselves accused of food fraud. They can’t win. Regulators would have to sample-test everything, which would be operationally impractical and, frankly, impossible. Public regulators have been aware of the issue for quite some time but have struggled to find any solutions to address the issue. A few provinces, including Ontario, have created provincewide committees on food integrity to work with industry in finding fraudulent cases. However, their work will take a while before we see anything new. Meanwhile, consumers should shop for food and visit restaurants with extreme prejudice. Consumers should look for consistencies in pricing and quality. If a food product is much cheaper at one outlet, perhaps the deal is too good to be true. Consumers should also ask pointed questions about procurement strategies to retailers and restaurant operators to make the supply chain more transparent to them. But humans are humans and food fraud has been going on for more than 2,000 years. The first known reported cases go back to the Roman Empire when suspicions around adulterated wines and oils were prevalent. Today, however, we have technologies allowing us to detect fraudulent behaviour. Companies and research centres from around the world are currently developing portable technologies that allow consumers themselves to validate the content of food labels. Imagine testing your own products at home to see if that apple is really from Ontario or that olive oil is really from Italy. The technology exists, but costs are prohibitive. Some of these devices can cost more than $200,000. One day though, consumers empowered by these technologies will become the most powerful regulators the food industry can ever imagine. Knowing that consumers can ultimately test the integrity of any product, the entire food supply chain will need to be more disciplined and the rotten apples will need to go, no pun intended. Over time, humans themselves may not get rid of food fraud but technology will.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Sylvain Charlebois, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-10-16T22:01:25Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/18/lax-enforcement-at-ports-allows-bogus-organic-foods-to-reach-u-s-government-report-says/\"\u003eFood fraud is everywhere\u003c/a\u003e.

The key innovation is how it reduces the need for central third-party institutions to serve as central authorities of trust — banks, courts, large corporations, stock markets and even governments, for example. Distributed trust enables co-operative forms of organization without a centre. It can distribute power away from centralized institutions to those that traditionally have less power. Such powerful institutions do not let go of their influence easily. The ongoing debate about how to regulate distributed trust technologies assumes that the advocates of the technologies will seek both legal status and enforceability. Scholars propose that such developments in distributed trust are a competitive threat to nation-state paper currencies. Much of the current, popular focus is on cryptographic currency — or cryptocurrency — applications such as Bitcoin. Regulators are struggling to deal with a fundamental shift in market structure. National central banks are implementing policies to keep control and regulate distributed trust technology. For example, the Chinese government has banned several types of distributed trust activities, and is launching its own non-distributed, centralized digital currency. The Japanese government has made Bitcoin a legal payment method, and major Japanese banks are planning to launch a J-Coin digital currency pegged to the Yen which may be built on a blockchain. Russia initially treated non-approved currency trades as illegal, but is now determining how to regulate them. In fact, traditional centralized, powerful organizations like banks, governments, regulators and technology behemoths are all spending billions figuring out how to use and control distributed trust technologies. But distributed trust technologies have many uses beyond cryptocurrency. Organizational theory has a lot to say about this transition. Distributed trust technologies are organized in what we call a Community Form (C-Form) of organization. C-Forms are not new. They have been around since the 1800s when the Oxford English Dictionary was created by a distributed community of volunteers. The growth of C-Forms was accelerated by technological developments enabling inexpensive peer-to-peer communication. C-Forms came into focus with the last internet-enabled major organizational shift to distributed information-creation platforms. As a result of that innovation, we have seen many forms of information production shift to C-Forms. Open source software such as the Linux computer operating system, which competes with Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS, is produced and shared by individuals in C-Forms instead of centralized software companies. Encyclopedias such as Wikipedia are created by individuals in a C-Form instead of a centralized publishing house. Video content on Vimeo is produced and shared by individuals in a C-Form instead of centralized studios. Similarly, distributed trust technologies are shifting the organizational landscape of how trust is produced and managed from centralized institutions to a C-Form. The development of distributed trust technologies is having a similar enabling effect on the growth of C-Forms replacing the trust functions of centralized institutions. Fundamentally, this is a decentralization of power. Many of our previous assumptions about formal organization are being challenged by shifts to distributed forms of trust. Individuals can now enter into direct peer-to-peer trusted exchanges with strangers. They no longer need a central institution to vouch for the other party. A blockchain-enabled microgrid in Brooklyn is already allowing individuals to sell their excess solar energy directly to neighbours without involving a central utility company. This is a drastic shift to many of the underlying assumptions about how markets and society are organized. As power centralizes, opportunities emerge. Many Silicon Valley success stories are simply centralized platforms. They capitalize on the power and legitimacy of enabling trusted interactions for others. Just as Uber matches riders to drivers, Facebook matches consumers to advertisers. This centralization of power has created an opportunity for distributed trust. The major platforms stand to lose their power as distributed trust takes hold. Such powerful organizations will no longer be needed. But those in power tend to try to hold onto power. Microsoft faced a challenge to its centralized market power as open-source software C-Forms grew. The “Halloween Documents” were internal Microsoft communications about responding to the strategic threat of open-source software. One tactic detailed was “FUD” (fear, uncertainty, and doubt). We are now seeing similar responses to distributed trust technologies. JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co. CEO Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a “fraud,” and claims governments are going to close down “crypto things.” He is being accused of market abuse in Sweden by a company called Blockswater. Blockswater alleges he “deliberately spread false and misleading information.” In other words, Dimon is being accused of creating FUD. We used to assume that large centralized organizations had legitimacy and power. But that’s starting to change. As distributed trust technologies develop, we will continue to see this power shift. We must question the role of centralized organizations in a time of distributed trust. The key now is to ensure that we use insights from organizational theory, and sociology, to shape our joint societal future in a world of distributed trust. It’s a world where the role of powerful central institutions will be greatly diminished. With such insight, we will be able to design a more equitable future for all.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Marc-David L.

That often means they use cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to collect payment, hoping to remain hidden behind a digital mask. The WannaCry hackers went a step farther, though. They converted their bitcoins into Monero, another e-currency designed to offer even stronger privacy. At the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts, we have explored the ways cryptocurrency systems protect users’ anonymity. Anonymity in cryptocurrencies is fueling crime by enabling criminals to evade identification by law enforcement. We believe that this problem will get worse as cryptocurrencies evolve stronger privacy protections and become more flexibly programmable. We also believe there’s no simple solution. All cryptocurrency systems work in roughly the same way. Groups of computers receive transaction information directly from users who want to send each other money. The computers order and permanently record these transactions in a public ledger so that anyone can read them. The public ledger also makes it possible to keep track of how much currency individual users own. Developers tweak the code in different cryptocurrency systems to add additional features, like fast transaction processing or improved anonymity. The first major cryptocurrency system, bitcoin, allows users to conceal their real names. But users’ transaction amounts and bitcoin account numbers (known as “addresses”) are visible to anyone – even people who don’t use bitcoin but know how to read the transaction ledger. This approach offers more privacy than credit cards and bank accounts, even against powerful entities like governments who might try to trace money obtained by criminals. Bitcoin’s privacy both attracts users – law-abiding and otherwise – and raises law enforcement agencies’ suspicions. It is true that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies create opportunities for tax evasion, ransomware and illicit marketplaces selling everything from narcotics to illegal arms. Some concerns, though, like the potential uses for terrorists, are probably overblown. When crimes happen that involve bitcoin, law enforcement and security experts can exploit the system’s privacy defects. They study illicit activity by analyzing chains of transactions. Sometimes they can trace criminals to systems where their true identities can be discovered. If this isn’t possible, they can often still obtain clues about criminals’ behavior. For example, analysis of the bitcoin transaction patterns of WannaCry quickly showed that victims would not automatically receive decryption keys for their ransom payments. To identify a payer, bitcoin requires that the payer send payment to a unique address. This address acts like a kind of transaction serial number. WannaCry victims were all told to pay into just three bitcoin addresses. Because payments were commingled in this way, investigators realized that the WannaCry perpetrators could not figure out which victims actually paid the ransom. Systems with stronger privacy have arisen to shield users – and criminals – from such scrutiny. One type, called “mixes,” such as CoinShuffle++ and TumbleBit, bundle transactions together, allowing bitcoin users to launder their money and achieve stronger anonymity. Distinct new cryptocurrencies have arisen that offer very strong privacy using powerful built-in mixes. These include Monero, Zcash and MimbleWimble. Their success has been limited so far. Technical problems are one reason, but mainly their technical complexity and limited software support makes them hard for people to use. Ransomware usually requests payment in bitcoin. It is simply easier for victims to buy bitcoins than more exotic cryptocurrencies that better conceal ransomware creators’ identities. Ransomware creators hope to get the best of both worlds – enabling easy payment for victims in bitcoins, but then converting ransom payments to currencies like Monero to obtain strong privacy. Someday, once privacy-hardened cryptocurrencies are easier to use, though, ransomware creators and other criminals will be able to bypass this two-step process. Cryptocurrencies are not limited to simple money transfers. Newer systems like Ethereum also include in the public ledger not just a record of which account sent money to whom, but small computer programs called “smart contracts.” Once entered into the ledger, these programs remain forever executable. They can store and send money in arbitrarily complex ways. Any user – or another smart contract – can trigger execution of a smart contract simply by sending it a transaction. When autonomous smart contracts are combined with anonymous cryptocurrency, they provide opportunities to handle money in complicated ways that hackers can exploit. Twice, money has been stolen from Ethereum contracts in heists that each involved more money than the largest bank robbery in the United States. The identities of the thieves remain unknown. In the future, “criminal smart contracts” may emerge. These might be programmed to make automatic payments when specific secrets are stolen, when particular websites are hacked and defaced, or even for physical crimes ranging from vandalism to terrorism. A person who wanted a particular crime to be committed could post a smart contract reward to be paid out to the criminal who actually does the deed. Someone seeking to claim the reward would, before committing the crime, add an encoded message to the smart contract containing specific details only the criminal would know beforehand – such as a unique phrase or long string of numbers to be posted on a hacked website. When the crime is committed, the person who did the deed would decode the added message, revealing the details that had been specified in advance. The smart contract could then check the actual details of the crime and, if they matched, pay out the reward. The anonymity of the underlying cryptocurrency would hide the criminal’s identity. Today, smart contracts cannot easily obtain trustworthy data from the internet about crimes like vandalism in a form that computer programs can easily understand. So criminal smart contracts have not yet come about. But advances in crime driven by smart contracts will eventually emerge, aided by continuing improvements in anonymity technologies. Anonymity isn’t all bad, of course. On the contrary, it’s a key ingredient of privacy-preserving systems, and necessary to prevent overreach and abuses by governments. Cryptocurrency cannot thrive without privacy protections. What’s hard is finding a socially responsible blend of privacy and accountability. Today, law enforcement authorities can exploit privacy weaknesses in systems like bitcoin to identify certain cryptocurrency as belonging to criminals and thus as “tainted.” They try to catch criminals when, for example, they convert tainted currency into ordinary currency like U.S. dollars or euros. This strategy will no longer work when stronger privacy technologies conceal tainted cryptocurrency. Scientists have for decades sought to design systems that balance law enforcement needs with individual privacy in digital currency. Most of these systems provide what is called “conditional anonymity,” allowing authorities to learn user identities selectively through a technical process that can involve courts or other overseers. Appealing as it sounds, this approach is unworkable. If one authority, say the U.S. federal court system, has the ability to strip users of anonymity, then all authorities will want it. Privacy will then be meaningless. Crime-fighting tools require empowerment of authorities. Cryptocurrencies are innately anti-authority technologies. How this tension is resolved will determine the future of the world’s monetary systems. There is no simple answer.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ari Juels, Iddo Bentov, Ittay Eyal, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-26T00:17:32Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eWhen hackers hold their victims’ data for ransom, as happened in the WannaCry and NotPetya \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wannacry-ransomware-attacks-wannacry-virus-losses/\"\u003eransomware attacks\u003c/a\u003e that spread across the globe in mid-2017, a key to the criminals’ success is getting away with the money.

Both sides of politics in Australia appear supportive of privatising these registries and it is happening fast. The New South Wales Liberal government privatised the operation of its land registry in 2016. The South Australian Labor government did so earlier this year. Now, Victorians await Treasurer Tim Pallas’ decision on whether that state’s Labor government will follow suit. The robust titling systems in Australia’s states and territories are key contributors to the country’s economy. Secure registries provide the foundation on which the enormous wealth in real estate rests. Mortgage lenders rely on the low risk resulting from a state guarantee of title in securing real estate loans. Privatisation processes need to protect the integrity of Australia’s titling systems. However, with the rise of relevant technology, privatisation presents an opportunity to transform titling systems to operate even better in the public interest. Further reading: What are the implications of privatising land title offices? While rare, privately operated land title offices do exist elsewhere. A private operator, Teranet, administers the buying, selling and subdivision of properties in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba. In 1991, Teranet engaged in a public-private partnership to modernise the titling system in Ontario. In 2003, the Ontario government sold half its shares in Teranet to a private consortium. In 2010, Ontario extended Teranet’s operating licences for 50 years. Manitoba has licensed Teranet to run its land registry for 30 years. In other jurisdictions, there have been unsuccessful privatisation attempts. In 2013, the Canadian province of Alberta’s Real Estate Council concluded that a proposal to privatise the title office was not in the public interest. And last year, the province of Nova Scotia assessed the prospect of a privatised titling office and concluded there would be no considerable gain from it. The UK Conservative government in 2016 also examined this idea but did not go ahead with privatisation. This was primarily due to a lack of support from the property industry and a fear of public backlash. Further reading: Torrens, our land-title pioneer, might have approved of privatised registries There are many arguments against privatising title offices. These include: increased fees a natural monopoly banks requiring title insurance for purchasing properties risks to the integrity of land registration processes and property information depreciating existing skillsets in the title offices that are hard to source the prospect of jobs moving elsewhere and even overseas. Fees in Ontario’s privatised title office are, on average, higher than in Alberta’s public title office. For example, a title search in Ontario costs three times more than in Alberta. To gain access to property information in Ontario, users are required to buy specific software. The NSW government also increased fees just before engaging its private operator. The way land titles are issued, bought and sold in future will be different. Who would once have thought that we, through smartphones, could carry the map of the entire world and a positioning system in our pockets? While current land titling systems are efficient, privatisation provides an opportunity to harness technologies that transforms these for faster and more automated processes, while removing intermediary fees and reducing red tape. Technologies such as blockchain allow instant exchanges of assets online, including land and property, and transparent verification. Using these techniques, titles and other documents can be encrypted and protected in digital transactions. This challenges the need for lawyers to check documents, financial institutions to prove money exchange, insurance companies to back your title, and title offices to register the transactions. Consumer-grade technologies such as drones, 3D scanners and smartphones also make it easier for the public to collect land information. This will challenge regulated professions such as land surveying. These professions need to be rethought in a technology-driven society where land data collection becomes accessible to everyone. Advances in technology will soon be challenging several facets of land-titling systems in Australia. Privatisation can be an opportunity to reform and update these systems, so that regulatory requirements are either reduced or automated. The next generation should be able to buy a property and pay less or no bank fees, title insurance and stamp duty.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Mohsen Kalantari, Gary Jeffress, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-25T20:04:47Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIt’s highly likely that all Australians buying or selling property or subdividing land will soon be dealing with privately operated land title registries.

It could also be debt or equity and so it should be regulated and taxed in the same way as other finance. The tokens investors get when they buy a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, can be used to buy into blockchain startups (businesses that use the same online ledger as cryptocurrencies). When blockchain startups issue shares in their businesses using cryptocurrency, it’s called an initial coin offering. For investors, this is like any other equity investment. Cryptocurrency can also be used to finance specific assets, like debt. So what we have is a single financial instrument that has the advantages of both debt and equity. So startups issuing their own tokens for investment purposes should have to comply with the same rules and regulations that startups issuing more traditional instruments must comply with. Cryptocurrency investors should be taxed on the same basis as traditional investors. Money is very often defined by its functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account (used to represent the real value or cost of any economic item), and a store of value (that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time). The early consensus about Bitcoin among economists is that it’s not money. At best cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange. But many economists doubted that Bitcoin, given its volatility, could ever serve as a unit of account, let alone as a store of value. So if cryptocurrency isn’t money, is has to be something else. It could be an asset of some sort. Usually if investors acquire or sell an asset, it would be liable to tax, such as the GST. This means people using Bitcoin would be taxed twice when using it. It would be taxed when the person buys the Bitcoin and taxed again when they used it to buy something. Luckily the federal government realised this was a bad idea and moved to repeal the double taxation of Bitcoin. Clearly the federal government’s view is that cryptocurrency is not legal tender – so don’t try pay your income tax in Bitcoin anytime soon. And there are important differences between money, specifically legal tender, and cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies tend to strictly rules bound. How they’re created, when they can be earned, how they’re distributed and how many there ever can be, is all determined by rules. In fact, users like strict rules. By contrast government controlled money is not rules bound. Government employs substantial discretion in exercising control over money. So while the US dollar has the words “In God we trust” printed on it, this system actually requires substantial trust in government. This trust has been repaid by a substantial reduction of value over the past century. It seems that government-backed money may also be a poor unit of account and store of value. Debt and equity are financial instruments used to raise money to finance economic activity. It is something of a puzzle to financial economists why firms use debt in some instances to raise finance while using equity in other situations. An important 1988 paper by the 2009 economics Laureate Oliver Williamson provides a possible answer to that question. Williamson argues that debt, being a strict rules bound financial instrument, is best used to finance general assets, while equity is best used for so-called specific assets. Specific assets are those assets that cannot be cheaply or easily redeployed from their current use to alternate uses without a substantial loss of value. As it turns out Williamson had speculated about the existence of such an instrument (that he labelled “dequity”) and then rejected that instrument as being unworkable. The reason dequity was unworkable was due to opportunism – investors simply could not trust dequity issuers. The ledger that cryptocurrencies use - the blockchain - is a actually “trustless” technology because it’s decentralised. It allow users to see each other’s ledgers and transactions, negating the need for a trusted third party to manage risk. Instead it relies on cryptographic verification. With the absence of the ability for investors to game the system, cryptocurrencies are the dequity Williamson first imagined and it could become an efficient financing mechanism. The idea of regulating or taxing cryptocurrency finance may not be to the liking of many crypto-enthusiasts who are likely to argue that traditional rules and regulations are very onerous. They are correct, of course. Yet the solution to over-regulation is not a carve-out for special interests but rather regulatory reform that reduces the burden for all business. The good news for crypto-enthusiasts is that some governments appear willing to engage in genuine regulatory reform and tax competition to attract investment in this space. For example, the Singaporean government is relaxing existing regulation to accommodate cryptocurrency. Its proposed framework would require applicable companies to obtain a license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and divides payment activities into several categories. But regulators should really regulate cryptocurrencies in much the same way as they do existing financial instruments. It shouldn’t be given special treatment. Despite all the complexity of cryptocurrency it really is simple: it’s a financial instrument that combines all the advantages of money with debt and equity. It’s none of those well known concepts in isolation, but a viable and workable hybrid of all three.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jason Potts, Chris Berg, Sinclair Davidson, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-24T20:04:03Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eDespite its name, cryptocurrency isn’t just money.

The decision to also ban initial coin offerings altogether (the unregulated means by which funds are raised for a new cryptocurrency venture) has taken traders and analysts by surprise. China is the world’s largest cryptocurrency market with around 80% of Bitcoin transactions taking place in yuan. The blockchain (a digital ledger in which digital currency transactions are publicly recorded) is poised to have a massive impact on the future of finance. This recent crackdown suggests the Chinese government is determined to cement its place as a leading rule maker and power-broker in the quickly emerging area of cryptocurrency transactions and exchange. The Chinese government released a list of 60 initial coin offering trading platforms and instructed local agencies to make sure all platforms were listed and closed down. The delayed crackdown is in line with previous practice in China. The Chinese government often adopts a wait-and-see approach to activities that are largely unregulated until the magnitude of the activity becomes clear. The extent of speculative investment and the risk of losses to investors if the bubble bursts motivated the government to intervene in cryptocurrency trading. Read more: Can cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin survive scrutiny from central banks? In China, the popularity of cryptocurrencies has been boosted by the tightening of controls on money moving out of the country over the past two years. This has lowered the value of the China’s currency, the renminbi, as investors seek assets in different denominations and chase higher yields. Cryptocurrencies are also popular because they can be used to transfer funds offshore and circumvent foreign exchange controls. The government is particularly concerned with the use of cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings to perpetrate and disguise fraudulent activity, including money laundering and ponzi type investment schemes. Chinese authorities are anxious to avoid any social unrest in the lead-up to the 19th Party Congress. The effects of the 2015 stock market collapse, where the A-share market lost one-third of its value over a period of one month, are still being felt. In some respects, the regulatory intervention in China is mirrored in other countries that have been dragging their heels in coming to terms with cryptocurrencies. It was only in July this year that the US Securities Commission issued a report determining that DAO tokens were “securities” and must be regulated accordingly. In January last year, the People’s Bank of China issued a notice announcing it would be issuing its own digital version of the renminbi. The notice highlighted the benefits of a government backed digital currency in terms of cost, coverage, convenience and security. Read more: The big business revolution: why the future is blockchain In the initial phase, it’s likely that trading in this digital currency will be limited to regulated entities such as banks along similar lines to trading on the conventional foreign exchange markets. By launching its own digital currency, the Chinese government avoids the risks associated with privately-issued cryptocurrencies and ensuring they are not used as a means of circumventing China’s strict capital and currency controls. When China introduces its own digital currency (no formal date has yet been announced), the impact on the global economy will be significant.

There is a growing consensus among businesses, investors and countries (Venezuela in particular) that these alternative forms of online money are going to dominate payments in the next decade. There may be agreement on the potential, but quite how regulators and central banks will respond is still up in the air. The combined market value of all cryptocurrencies in circulation reached US$170 billion by the end of August 2017, 850% higher than at the beginning of the year, according to CoinMarketCap, a leading cryptocoin prices and market capitalisation tracker website. It is no surprise that this kind of growth sparked much hand-wringing among regulators and central banks, who are still undecided whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as a commodity, an asset or a form of currency. That might seem like an odd discussion to be having. But one of the basic functions of currency is to facilitate transactions in a timely manner. And to protect the security of the blockchain (the technology behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin), the processing of Bitcoin transactions is sometimes very slow. Due to restrictions on the limit of Bitcoin transactions which can be completed in a day, it may take a few days to complete a single transaction, rendering the cryptocurrency unable to fulfil the basic function of money at times. Private blockchains can speed up transactions but they are not popular and availability is limited. The call to better regulate cryptocurrency gained momentum after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) issued a staff discussion note stating that banks should consider investing in cryptocurrencies: Rapid advances in digital technology are transforming the financial services landscape, creating opportunities and challenges for consumers, service providers and regulators alike. Any wholesale adoption by the banking sector would clearly establish a huge market for cryptocurrencies, but the traffic isn’t moving entirely one way. Chinese regulators dealt a huge blow to the crypto market at the beginning of September when the People’s Bank of China made it illegal to raise funds through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). An ICO is a fundraising tool that trades future cryptocoins in exchange for cryptocurrencies of immediate, liquid value. They have become an easy platform for digital currency geeks to raise funds quickly. In simpler terms, ICOs are a crowdfunding platform for future cryptocoins. They have already raised US$2.32 billion, according to industry website Cryptocompare. China is getting stricter in general. It was even reported that it may ban the trading of virtual currencies on domestic exchanges entirely. If this goes ahead, it will certainly dampen the enthusiasm around the sector. But there always seems to be some better news round the corner, and more oversight may well generate the confidence that can overcome concerns. The Russian finance ministry is pushing to regulate the use of cryptocurrencies in the country by the end of 2017, while the central bank has been working on regulation for digital currencies since the beginning of the year. Perhaps the biggest boost for cryptocurrencies came from Finland’s central bank economists, who called the infrastructure behind crypctocurrencies such as Bitcoin “revolutionary” and praised its ability to prevent manipulation. There has also been recognition for cryptocurrencies in countries such as Australia and Japan, which are both implementing polices to legalise cryptocurrencies exchanges. Japan has made it mandatory for Bitcoin exchanges to register with regulators and undergo annual auditing by certified accountants. Singapore’s central bank noted that the function of digital tokens went beyond simply being a virtual currency while asserting some oversight. It said that ICOs would have to be approved or recognised by the bank or recognised under Singapore’s Securities and Futures Act. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission echoed that sentiment, announcing that ICOs will be regulated as securities and any unregistered offerings could be subject to criminal punishment. This kind of growing acceptance – China aside – is an acknowledgement of the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies as a financial instrument. Looking further ahead, regulators have two options. First, they could implement stricter regimes to ensure cryptocurrency transactions are not related to dark net activities, terrorism financing or money laundering activities. Alternatively, central banks could start issuing their own digital currency known as Central Bank issued Digital Currency (CBDC) based on the distributed ledger technology (DLT), the same blockchain technology behind the cryptocurrencies. This raises the possibility of CBDCs destroying the value proposition of existing cryptocurrencies. The Bank of England has taken a lead in the initial discussion while its peers in Canada, Sweden and at the European Central Bank all analyse the feasibility of launching digital currencies. The wider discussion on CBDCs is a testimony to the fact that central banks are serious about cryptocurrencies, and in a way competing with their growing popularity. In the worst case scenario for this still fledgling market, central banks could decide to make trading or possessing cryptocurrencies illegal. That would be tough to enforce as there is no single organisation or person that controls cryptocurrencies and transactions don’t go through a central clearing house. There is precedent, however. Back in 1933, the US president, Franklin Roosevelt, made holding gold bullion a crime and required all Americans to hand over their cache of gold to the Federal Reserve. If that happens here, then the cryptocurrency market would die a natural death. It all rests now with the central bankers. China has offered a glimpse of a difficult future; crypto evangelists will hope others continue down the more accommodating path.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nafis Alam, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-19T12:50:29Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe future of money looks very different in the world of cryptocurrencies.

And with several high-profile attacks already committed this year, the numbers for 2017 may be even higher. Perhaps it’s time then for a new approach to tackling cyber-attacks, one that focuses not on defending against them but preventing them from happening in the first place. Some cyber-security experts are already working on what they describe as “vaccines” to stop attacks reaching our computers or data. But this kind of prevention could just be the start. If we can avoid metaphors that imagine computers as things that need defending and instead use new words that don’t suggest ways to attack them, then we might be able to develop far more effective preventative technologies. In the case of the recent Petya ransomware attack, researchers developed a vaccine in the form of a single computer file that would instantly disable one type of virus as soon as it infected a computer, before it could cause any damage. This is different from traditional anti-virus software that tries to spot and remove any malware on a computer, but this could be after it has done its work. This approach has been little used until now and could, at least in the short term, offer a slightly different approach to cyber-security. But vaccines are still a way of addressing viruses after they have been downloaded. Even defences such as firewalls try to stop attacks from reaching a computer but they don’t prevent the attack in the first place. If we want to move to a more genuinely preventative approach, we may need to change something that fundamentally influences how we think about technology, the language we use to describe it. From the earliest days of computers, metaphors from the physical world were used to make this new digital realm accessible and understandable to human beings like you and me. On the positive side, words such as desktop and file, folder and memo were recognisable from office life and home. On the negative side, we also transferred into cyberspace many of the very problems computers promised to solve. And so today many “inboxes” are more cluttered than they ever were when they held paper. Our folders are chaotically organised and we send and receive more messages and mails. There’s evidence that we are no more productive today than we ever were. And there’s evidence also that our virtual homes are equally vulnerable to break-in. Ransomware attacks, such as the high-profile ones carried out earlier this year, also borrow terms from the physical world, leaving our computers “frozen” and even damaged unless we “pay up”. In this case it is the realm of the highwayman as we are held to “ransom”. Stick ‘em up! Your money or your virtual life. Over time, these attackers become better at what they do, vying for the position of almost legendary cyber Dick Turpins. The way we protect our computers follows a similar pattern. By borrowing these physical world concepts we have also replicated the risks associated with them. A firewall points to a physical wall, but even thick walls can be scaled or tunnelled under via a “worm”. Our computers are akin to castles, with protective walls and guards on duty, ready for attacks from all sides. Windows PCs come with their own “Defender” software. The alternative is to create new words and images for the digital realm. These can pose different problems but also offer new opportunities. Take, for example, Blockchain technology, a system for securely recording online transactions. There are differing views about how secure blockchain really is, but the balance of expert opinion is that it is more secure than mainstream business transacting (such as traditional online payment systems). This could be related to the fact that the word itself doesn’t evoke the physical world so easily. It is harder to grasp what it is just from the word. Another example is the word “encryption”, which is viewed by many experts as a relatively secure way to prevent cyber break-ins to messages, shared data and transactions. Here security has been more successful than relying primarily on password protection (though not foolproof). There’s also Ethereum, a type of blockchain technology. At its simplest, Ethereum is a way to build decentralised applications (software programs run by a network of computers rather than being controlled by a single server). It has recently called the most secure, public blockchain. Again, the word “ethereum” is not drawn from the mundane physical world. Its success could be related to the more elusive metaphor of “ether” that it suggests. How do you hold ether to ransom? It suggests something more diffuse and harder to specify. So, perhaps it’s time to ditch the lazily invoked physical phrases and to get creative. Let’s engage in the digital realm as a positive more alien place. It might become harder to grasp and we might have to think more carefully about it, but it might also become harder to hack too.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Paul Levy, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-12T15:48:38Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThere were 638m attempted ransomware cyber-attacks in 2016, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL\u003dhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2017/02/07/2016-saw-an-insane-rise-in-the-number-of-ransomware-attacks/\"\u003eaccording to one report\u003c/a\u003e.

Every signal is that he will be proved right very soon. Those roles in finance where the knowledge required is systematic will soon disappear. And it will happen irrespective of how high a level, how highly trained or how experienced the human equivalent may currently be. Regular and repetitive tasks at all levels of an organisation already do not need to be done by humans. The more a job is solely or largely composed of these routines the higher the risk of being replaced by computing power. The warning signs have been out there for a number of years as enthusiastic reports about artificial intelligence have been tempered with fears about significant job losses in most sectors of the economy. Many roles have already all but disappeared in the march towards a fully digital economy. Older readers may recall typesetters, typists, and increasingly, switchboard operators and back room postal workers, as work of the last century. And the changing nature of work is relentless. The finance sector was once driven by human judgement and decision making. But slowly, it has changed. One-to-one conversations with your local bank manager were replaced by scripted call centre interactions during the 1990s. Today, increased processing power, massive cloud storage, strong encryption and an increase in the use of blockchain make possible tasks that had previously been seen as too complex for automation to be done quickly and consistently without any human intervention. Artificial intelligence reduces the need for human work that requires analysis, consistent applications of decisions and judgement calls. These are pivotal actions for many legal and financial activities. Combined, in the background, with blockchain – essentially a publicly shared automated ledger of agreed contracts – arrangements that require some form of trust between two parties will also be able to be completed with little or no human intervention. Blockchain is the basis of every cryptocurrency – forms of money exchanged online. Banks are slowly working towards ways of embracing these alternative systems. While alternative forms of money attract popular headlines it is the automation behind the scenes that is most compelling aspect for the finance sector. By removing the influence of human decision making from as many processes as possible, a fully digital supply chain can be created. As artificial intelligence learns more about the impact and influence of every process each time it happens, a bank’s efficiency should continuously improve, and profits increase, with fewer and fewer employees. In this atmosphere of change to the world of work in banking, however, there are some roles that will prove more resistant to change. Work that is unpredictable or inherently people-focused will survive. Customer service staff will still need to tackle the inevitably complex queries that are the product of the human mind rather than the outcome of algorithms. AI will deal with most enquiries, but will inevitably need to transfer the most cryptic to a human interlocutor. Mortgage decisions, for example, will come as an automatically generated message; more intricate questions will still require face-to-face conversations. At the other end of the (pay) scale senior executives will continue to steer the direction of their individual organisations, although the nature of their work will subtly change to become technology-based decisions. Executives will find themselves choosing an algorithm instead of directly making a high-risk investment decision, or they may end up selecting an artificial intelligence machine rather than interviewing people to become employees. Reduction in the wage bill at other levels of the business and the increasing significance of the few human decisions that need to be made may even assist in justifying their annual bonuses. The traditional banking sector is an obvious area for artificial intelligence and automation to generate competitive advantages for companies. This is a result, in part, of previous reluctance to embrace change. In the late 1990s there was a collective hysteria around the Y2K bug and fear of a wholesale shutdown of computers which failed to cope with the millennium date change. That highlighted the sector’s uneasy relationship with fast-moving technological change. But even this public panic prompted few immediate, practical changes. Now, mobile app-only banks, with no branches, such as N26 and Monzo, challenge the traditional banking sector and its human resources legacy. Traditional banks are still largely oriented towards humans doing most of its work. In 2016, over 1m people, or 3.1% of the UK workforce, were employed in the finance services sector, which is the biggest tax contributor to the UK economy and the country’s largest exporter. Most predictions claim around 50% of the jobs in the sector will be lost. Depending on who you listen to, this process will take between five and 20 years. The impact of these changes will be felt across the entire economy. There exists a genuine fear that artificial intelligence, robotics and fully digital businesses may contribute to a significant increase in the gap between rich and poor. Deutsche Bank’s CEO is being frank about a future where jobs in banking and elsewhere will become ever more scarce as digital business becomes a reality. This realisation has reinvigorated calls for a universal basic income (UBI) or a social dividend in the UK and elsewhere. The proposal has found support with some MEPs as a means to maintain personal levels of prosperity in this new world. Crucially too, the UBI would seek to maintain the foundations of the current Western economy in an era of increasingly fully automated digital businesses – a goal, if achieved, which might also just about keep the current finance and banking sector in business.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Gordon Fletcher, David Kreps, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-09-12T13:06:37Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eDeutsche Bank CEO John Cryan has \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/sep/06/deutsche-bank-boss-says-big-number-of-staff-will-lose-jobs-to-automation\"\u003epredicted a bonfire of industry jobs\u003c/a\u003e as automation takes hold across the finance sector.

Sometimes security researchers release a fix that allows computer owners to decrypt their machines without paying, but many people are forced to pony up to free their data. In 2016, the FBI estimated that the ransomware industry took in US$1 billion – and that’s only the cases officials know about. All that money isn’t paid in cash. Before digital currencies existed, extortionists asked victims to send money by more formal transfer companies like Western Union or make deposits to bank accounts. Those were easily traced. Today, ransomware attacks demand payment in bitcoin and its ilk, systems praised by supporters for their transaction speed and protection of users’ anonymity. In researching cybercrime and cybersecurity for more than a decade, I have found that obtaining cybercrime proceeds is often the biggest challenge that cybercriminals face. In this regard, diffusion of cryptocurrencies is a major development that enables cybercriminals to achieve their goals. In fact, the escalation of ransomware attacks and the increasing prominence of cryptocurrencies may be connected. Some companies have invested in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies specifically so they can pay extortionists if it ever becomes necessary. That helps contribute to the rapid growth in use and value of e-currencies. And as digital currencies become more common, ransomware attackers will have an easier time hiding their illicit transactions among the growing crowd of legitimate transfers. The extortionists behind most ransomware attacks demand payments in bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency. The WannaCry attackers demanded between $300 and $600 per computer; the Petya ransomware wanted $300 in bitcoins before providing a code that would let victims decrypt their data. Not many people actually pay, though: WannaCry victims paid only about $241,000 in bitcoins to the extortionists. If everyone infected had paid, the criminals would have received at least $60 million. It translated to a payout rate of 0.4 percent. Even fewer paid the Petya perpetrators: They got just 66 payments, totaling barely over 4 bitcoins, or about $18,200. Other attacks are more successful: In June, a ransomware attack hit more than 150 servers owned by South Korean web hosting firm Nayana. More than 3,400 of the company’s customers were affected – mostly small businesses running their websites on Nayana’s equipment. Nayana itself stepped up, taking loans to cover a payment of more than $1 million in bitcoins to the attackers, saying it had to save its clients’ sites. The attackers don’t always need to make much money to be effective. Many cybersecurity researchers believe that Petya attacks were carried out with political motives rather than for financial gains. But ransomware has a much higher payout rate than other common cybercrimes. One study found that for every 12.5 million spam emails sent promoting a fake online pharmacy, the scammers got only one response. That’s a success rate of about 0.000008 percent. They make a lot of money – up to $3.5 million a year – only by sending out enormous numbers of messages. One reason cybercrime success rates are low is that victims don’t trust the extortionists to actually unlock their data once they get paid. In 2016, about a quarter of the organizations that paid ransoms were not able to recover their data. The WannaCry attackers were particularly bad: Their system was labor-intensive, requiring the criminals to manually connect payments with encrypted files before letting victims decode them. In fact, a flaw in the WannaCry attack software made it almost impossible to decrypt a paying victim’s data. More sophisticated methods do exist, including those that incorporate what are called “smart contracts,” another aspect of some cryptocurrency systems that runs a particular program as part of completing a transaction. In those ransomware attacks, making payment automatically releases the information a victim needs to decrypt and recover hijacked files. The fear of ransomware is growing. In mid-2016, a study found that one-third of British firms had bought bitcoins just in case they needed to pay off ransomware attackers. More than 35 percent of large firms, those with more than 2,000 employees, reported being willing to pay as much as $65,000 to unlock critical files. Even Cornell University was reported to be stockpiling bitcoins in case of a future ransomware attack. At the same time, bitcoin and other similar systems are becoming much more popular. In 2016, the total value of all cryptocurrencies was 0.025 percent of the world’s GDP. By August 2017, that number had increased more than eight-fold, to 0.21 percent of global GDP – about $162 billion. The World Economic Forum projects cryptocurrencies will hold 10 percent of global GDP by 2027.

Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at the New York University, known as Wall Street’s “dean of valuation”, has said that among the younger generation, digital currencies have replaced gold as a choice of investment and that, sooner or later, currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum will compete against nation-state paper currencies. So could bitcoin become a popular currency and decrease the popularity of euros, dollars, pounds, roubles and others? For anything to be seen as “money” it needs to meet three functions – a store of value, a measure of value and a medium of exchange. Bitcoin’s volatility shows that it is an infant in meeting these three criteria, but has the potential to do so. However, digital currencies like bitcoin are just one application of the blockchain technology that makes them possible. Blockchain, as the BBC explains, is: a method of recording data – a digital ledger of transactions, agreements, contracts – anything that needs to be independently recorded and verified as having happened. The big difference is that this ledger isn’t stored in one place, it’s distributed across several, hundreds or even thousands of computers around the world. And everyone in the network can have access to an up-to-date version of the ledger, so it’s very transparent. Blockchain combines the security of cryptography, the storage and transmission of data in coded form, with peer-to-peer networks to create a shared database of transactions that is trusted, yet controlled by no one. If blockchain finds uses in various industries we could see a more digitally integrated global economy, something that could enhance economic growth and decrease poverty. In business today, we still require trusted administrators to manage and record the numbers and databases – auditors, supervisory boards and so on. The potential of blockchain is that it offers the chance to “distribute” these digital ledgers to others through a network of computers across the world. It could actually dispense with those businesses that are based on trusted relationships – such as banking, auditing, solicitors, even aspects of government. For example in Sweden, Georgia and Ukraine property registers are being moved on to the blockchain. In finance, people rarely lend directly to each other, hence the need for banks as trusted go-betweens. The beauty of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ethereum is that they remove the need for the trusted third party, using instead an encrypted, secure database. This has huge implications for any business that requires the verification of payments and performance of contracts – that is, most businesses. The beauty of blockchain is that something can be unique and stored digitally with ease, without needing an equivalent in the real world. For example, things like contracts, wills, deeds and share certificates might only require a piece of code stored on the blockchain that represents the exchange. Instead of a trusted intermediary verifying transactions, the computers of the shared network of bitcoin users themselves perform the verification at no cost to those involved in the transaction. This verification process holds the seeds of change across huge numbers of industries. The distributed ledger – the blockchain – offers the chance to enhance truth and trust in every system to which it is applied. It can prove who owns what at any given moment. Anything that currently exists to verify contracts, ownership, payments and even performance can be shifted to the blockchain. This would transfer power away from those who currently manage or verify transactions – a seismic change to the way the world currently operates. As with any power shift, those holding power are reluctant to surrender it. The “winners” in this scenario will come from existing companies rather than start-ups, given that for this new system to work, it requires buy-in and trust – existing brands already have this advantage. So what are blockchain’s main advantages? By performing the functions of record keepers and managers it would enhance decentralisation, reduce the amount of intermediaries involved and provide an alternative to how value can be stored. Physical as well as digital assets could be uniquely verified online to prove ownership. As transactions stored on the blockchain could be independently verified and traced, it would be easier to fight crime, counterfeiting and fraud, reducing systemic risk in the financial system. A distributed digital ledger would make it near impossible to change or falsify data, because data would have to be altered across all the related “blocks” in the digital chain, so any tampering would be exposed. Consequently associated costs would fall, enhancing economic growth and prosperity. A dramatic disruption is happening already in the financial industry: the world’s largest custodian bank, BNY Mellon, is using a blockchain based platform for government bond settlement. And one of the Bank of England’s research focus areas is based around financial technology or “fintech” and how it affects the way markets and society function. Another benefit would be to make micropayments possible digitally. A country such as India, where huge number of people still do not have access to banking, could experience profound economic change if brought within their reach, helping them save, borrow and plan for their future. The online marketing and advertising industry has feasted on data generated by internet users, and social media platforms such as Facebook – with more than two billion users – Google and Amazon collect considerable amounts of individualised data on us to target adverts at us. Blockchain could enhance our online privacy, by allowing us to store our digital footprint on our own unique blockchain and control who has access to it. Rather than these massive organisations building up records of our tastes and preferences, this data would be decentralised and within our own control. Blockchain could enhance entrepreneurship in developed and developing countries, breaking down barriers built from embedded bureaucracy and corruption by providing a means to bypass existing power structures. For example, the digital ledger Everledger is tracking a real-life object – diamonds – to prove their provenance and ownership. As a result, trust in the system is enhanced. When the internet came into being, it was a disruptive, game-changing force for many industries – blockchain technology holds the same potential. In moving trust from the current “verifiers” to a distributed blockchain system, the world could see a massive shift in power to the masses – a truly revolutionary idea.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Rob Gowers, Jukka Aminoff, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-07-25T13:33:04Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe value of one \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.bitcoin.com/you-need-to-know\"\u003ebitcoin\u003c/a\u003e recently hit a record high of US$3,025, a staggering rise of over 200% in value this year alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAswath Damodaran, professor of finance at the New York University, known as Wall Street’s “dean of valuation”, has said that among the younger generation, digital currencies have \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/18/wall-streets-dean-of-valuation-says-digital-currencies-replacing-gold.html\"\u003ereplaced gold\u003c/a\u003e as a choice of investment and that, sooner or later, currencies such as bitcoin and \u003ca href\u003d\"https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-ethereum/\"\u003eethereum\u003c/a\u003e will compete against nation-state paper currencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo could bitcoin become a popular currency and decrease the popularity of euros, dollars, pounds, roubles and others?

If people could use both two-step verification and spending limits on the blockchain, this would reduce any economic loss from cyber attacks and in turn encourage more users. The blockchain is a global network of computers that run the same blockchain software. Transactions on the blockchain are currently limitless and there is no one governing body. Introducing security measures could demonstrate a level of predictability in the blockchain that could build more trust. At the moment there are third-party sites that perform transactions with the blockchain on your behalf. They are owned and managed separately from the blockchain itself, and this presents a single point of failure. These sites, like Kraken, Changelly and Shapeshift, allow people to purchase, as well as exchange, blockchain assets. Activity on these sites includes purchasing Bitcoin with US dollars or exchanging Bitcoin for Ethereum assets. The blockchain ecosystem is by no means perfect. Many people shy away from using it due to its perceived volatility. There is no “code of conduct” protocol for the blockchain at the moment and it’s likely there never will be. In addition, creating and maintaining blockchain software is arduous and managed by only a few people globally. These software developers, who are the trailblazers of this technology, are being disadvantaged by constantly being forced to respond to malicious attacks. There have been many malicious attacks on the blockchain including the very recent attack on a third-party online wallet. In this attack, an unknown user was able to hijack the third-party site and redirect all transactions to their account. These and other malicious attacks have made blockchain assets either temporarily unavailable or permanently unrecoverable. It’s for these reasons that the solution to secure the blockchain can’t be owned and managed by third-parties, and must be part of the blockchain itself. Security measures like the ones we’re proposing may reduce the severity and speed of any malicious attacks. Lowering the bounty for malicious attacks could also prove to be a disincentive for this behaviour. The mechanisms we use to build trust in the traditional financial institutions could be coded into the blockchain. It’s unlikely that a blockchain user will use the technology to spend 100% of the assets in their account, with no notice whatsoever. This is why hacks of these accounts are so obvious, just as they would be if your bank account was suddenly drained. Adjustable spend and transaction limits currently protect mainstream bank account users from one malicious transaction. There is no reason the same kind of consumer protection cannot apply to cryptocurrency users. In order for this to work, the blockchain needs to verify that you are the legitimate user of the account, who is wanting to raise and lower spending limits for the purpose of transferring funds. We propose this could work via voice authentication. This is where a blockchain user performs a transaction on the blockchain and is subsequently prompted to provide a single-use vocal passphrase – this is the second step in the two-step verification process. This would be similar to the program Captcha, but with one unique twist. Captcha is designed to discern legitimate users of the internet from online robots. It works by generating a one-time image of letters and numbers that the user has to type correctly to proceed. Captcha can verify if you are human, but is unable to verify your individual identity. Using the human voice with this type of technology could be more commonplace in the future. It’s also less complex than other types of biometric verification, which require sophisticated infrastructure such as retina- and iris-scanning hardware. More importantly, the human voice shares blockchain attributes. Your voice and your public blockchain key are both public and unique. At present there is no guarantee of holding blockchain assets without disruption of some kind. Providing security in the blockchain would convert into a degree of predictability in the technology. If this was shown to work in the long term, it would also create trust. Obviously, we trust traditional currencies. For example, laws provide a promise that a $20 note will result in a mutual exchange of goods and services to that value. So once a degree of predictability is established in a blockchain, there will also be new business opportunities from traditional markets, such as insurance in case of sudden undue economic loss. It’s in the interests of the majority stakeholders of blockchain to consistently look for responses and improvements that reduce the limitations of the technology. A malicious attack, intent on bringing down the architecture of blockchain technology, would unfairly relegate the blockchain to a history as another ponzi scheme.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Timothy McCallum, Luke van der Laan, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-07-16T19:58:38Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThere are ways to improve the online ledger blockchain by taking some security notes from banks.

Two reports released this week by the CSIRO’s Data61 not only inject some well-researched gravitas into the conversation, they also provide insight into why some of the major blockchain projects have stalled. Since 2015, banks, regulators, tech giants and startups all over the world have raised billions of dollars to explore the blockchain. But the only really successful, scaleable use of the blockchain remains cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Bitcoins currently trade at almost AU$4,000, with a total market cap of A$61.4 billion. Think of the blockchain as a type of transparent spreadsheet or “public ledger”. When someone transfers a Bitcoin, for example, the transaction is verified by “miners”, encrypted and a “block” is added to the spreadsheet. Mining takes a lot of computing power, and so miners are incentivised to participate in the system with a reward of bitcoin. It’s finding a way to put all these pieces together for purposes other than cryptocurrencies that has yet to be figured out. Because of all the computing power required to verify and encrypt new blocks, running a blockchain network is expensive and consumes a lot of electricity. For this reason, a blockchain should only be used if it solves particular problems. For example, a blockchain could allow users to see each other’s ledgers and transactions, negating the need for a trusted third party to manage risk. The blockchain itself, through sophisticated cryptography, would provide privacy and trust. Conversely, if there is already a central third party managing trust between users and verifying transactions (something banks already do for consumers), then a blockchain is probably not needed at all. Failing that, a sophisticated database or expert system would be a cheaper and simpler alternative. The Data61 reports describe some of the possible opportunities for the blockchain in Australia, including monitoring the outbreak of pests or animal and plant diseases, border surveillance, tracking intellectual property, and identity systems that provide greater certainty over entitlements, benefits, and tax obligations. The reports also identify some of the risks. The risks include both business and technical risks. For example, public ledgers do not afford privacy and blockchains generally are not suitable for storing large volumes of high speed data. Bitcoin’s blockchain has been suffering from this very problem for more than a year. Finding a solution is a priority for any developers wanting to attract the number of users needed to make running a network profitable. The use of blockchain in financial transactions also poses problems for compliance with anti-money laundering legislation, which requires that anyone providing financial services (for example) must satisfy themselves as to the identity of their client or customer. These shortcomings may explain why a number of high-profile blockchain projects have recently stalled. For example, last week, the Bank of Canada announced that its blockchain project, Jasper, is not yet fit to handle settlements. Citing transparency and privacy issues, the bank found that the benefits of using blockchain did not outweigh the risks. But risk is not the only reason that blockchain projects are stalling. In February 2017, the R3CEV consortium of banks and technologists announced after more than 18 months of investment, innovation, and testing, that they would not be using blockchain for their project because they did not need it. Meanwhile, in a speech delivered to the Africa Blockchain Conference in March 2017, Andreas Antonopoulos warned that many recent “blockchain” projects are fraudulent attempts to raise capital under the guise of innovation and disruptive technologies. While bitcoin has proven what the blockchain can do, the technology still needs a killer app to justify the hype. The most likely contender is currently a “smart contract”. Smart contracts are programmable transactions with complex internal logic that can interact with internet-enabled devices and other smart contracts. At this time, the problem with smart contracts is that they are susceptible to manipulation. What is needed to test the capacity of the blockchain is a small-scale low-stakes low-risk smart contract that (for example) regulates energy consumption, manages permissions, or ensures payment on supply. Data61’s Smart Contracts Report lists some contenders, but first we need to manage the risk of fraud, breach of privacy, and blockchain bloat. Once these risks have been reduced to nil or negligible, the real work can resume.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philippa Ryan, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-06-08T07:10:01Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIt’s not technology or regulation holding back \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/demystifying-the-blockchain-a-basic-user-guide-60226\"\u003ethe blockchain\u003c/a\u003e - software that stores and transfers value or data across the internet - we just haven’t figured out the next big use-case. \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.data61.csiro.au/en/Our-expertise/Expertise-Strategic-insight/Blockchain\"\u003eTwo reports\u003c/a\u003e released this week by the CSIRO’s Data61 not only inject some well-researched gravitas into the conversation, they also provide insight into why some of the major blockchain projects have stalled.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince 2015, \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.r3cev.com/blog/2016/4/4/introducing-r3-corda-a-distributed-ledger-designed-for-financial-services\"\u003ebanks\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/fsr-june-2017-chapman.pdf\"\u003eregulators\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/identity/\"\u003etech giants\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.agridigital.io\"\u003estartups\u003c/a\u003e all over the world have raised billions of dollars to explore the blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the only really successful, scaleable use of the blockchain remains cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

As governments gathered in Paris at COP21 in 2015, pledging to reduce their carbon emissions to keep global warming below 2°C, the spread of digital technology continued to take place without the slightest concern for the environment. The current popularity of the bitcoin and blockchain provide the perfect example. The principle of the blockchain can be summarized as follows: each transaction is recorded in thousands of accounting ledgers, and each one is scrutinized by a different observer. Yet no mention is made of the energy footprint of this unprecedented ledger of transactions, or of the energy footprint of the new “virtual currency” (the bitcoin) it manages. In a 2014 study, Karl J. O’Dwyer and David Malone showed that the consumption of the bitcoin network was likely to be approximately equivalent to the electricity consumption of a country like Ireland, i.e. an estimated 3 GW. Imagine the consequences if this type of bitcoin currency becomes widespread. The global money supply in circulation is estimated at $11,000 billion. The corresponding energy consumption should therefore exceed 4,000 GW, which is eight times the electricity consumption of France and twice that of the United States. It is not without reason that a recent headline on the Novethic website proclaimed “The bitcoin, a burden for the climate”. Since every blockchain is a ledger (and therefore a file) that exists in many copies, the computer resources required for the calculation, transmission and storage of the information increases, as well as the energy footprint, even if improvements in the underlying technologies are taken into account. The two important factors here are the length of the blockchain and the number of copies. For the bitcoin, the blockchain’s length grew very quickly: according to Quandl, it was 27 GB in early 2015 and rose to 74 by mid-2016. The bitcoin, whose system is modeled on that of the former gold standard currencies, is generated through complex computer transactions, which become increasingly complex over time, as for an increasingly depleted goldmine in which production costs rise. In 2015, Genesis Mining revealed in Business Insider that it was one of the most energy-consuming companies in Iceland, with electricity costs of 60 dollars per “extracted” bitcoin – despite benefiting from a low price per kWh and a favorable climate. Finally, we can also imagine all the “smart contract” type applications supported by the Internet of Things. This will also have a considerable impact on energy and the environment, considering the manufacturing requirements, the electrical supply (often autonomous, and therefore complicated and not very efficient) and disposal. However, although the majority of connected objects will probably not support smart contracts, a very large amount of connected objects are anticipated in the near future, with a total likely to reach 30 billion in 2020, according to McKinsey, the American consulting firm. The bitcoin is just one of the many systems being developed without concern for their energy impact. In response to the climate issue, their promoters act as if it does not exist, or as if alternative energy solutions existed. Yet decarbonizing the energy system is a vast issue, involving major risks. And the proposed technical solutions in this area offer no guarantees of being able to handle the massive and global increase in energy consumption, while still reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Digital technology already accounts for approximately 15% of the national electricity consumption in France, and consumes as much energy, on the global scale, as aviation. Today, nothing suggests that there will be a decrease in the mass to be absorbed, nor is there any indication that digital technology will enable a reduction in consumption, as industrialists in this sector have confirmed (see the publication titled La Face cachée du numérique – “The hidden face of digital technology”). The massive decarbonation of energy faces many challenges: the reliability of the many different carbon sequestration techniques proposed, the “energy cannibalism” involved in the launch of renewable energies, which require energy to be manufactured and have technical, social, and political limitations (for example, the various sources of renewable energy require large surface areas, yet the space that could potentially be used is largely occupied)… The challenges are huge.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Fabrice Flipo, Michel Berne, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-05-16T19:59:49Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe digital world still lives under the illusion that it is intangible.

That’s now the case with blockchain, today’s buzziest new tech tool. Introduced in 2008 as the technology underpinning Bitcoin, a digital currency that is created and held electronically without any central authority, blockchain is a secure digital ledger for any kind of data. It simplifies record keeping and reduces transaction costs. Its range of applications in commerce, finance and potentially politics continues to widen, and that has triggered a debate around how to regulate the tool. Because it does not require a centralised authority to verify and validate transactions, blockchain enables people who may not trust each other to interact and coordinate directly. With blockchain, there is no middleman in peer-to-peer exchanges; instead, users rely on a decentralised network of computers that interact through a cryptographic, secure protocol. Blockchain has the ability to “codify” transactions by deploying small snippets of code directly onto the blockchain. This code, generally referred to as a “smart contract”, executes automatically when certain conditions are met. An early example of smart contracts are the corporate-oriented digital rights management (DRM) systems limiting uses of digital files. Having DRM on your ebook may restrict access to copying, editing, and printing content. With blockchain, smart contracts have become more complex and, arguably, more secure. In theory, they will always be executed exactly as planned, since no one party has the power to alter the code binding a given transaction. In practice, however, eliminating trusted brokers from a transaction can create some kinks. One high-profile smart-contract failure happened to the DAO, a decentralised autonomous organisation for venture capital funding. Launched in April 2016, the DAO quickly raised over US$150 million via crowdfunding. Three weeks later, someone managed to exploit a vulnerability in the DAO’s code, draining approximately US$50 million worth of digital currency from the fund. The security problem originated not in the blockchain itself but rather from issues with the smart-contract code used to administer the DAO. Questions arose about the legality of the act, with some people arguing that since the hack was actually permitted by the smart-contract code, it was a perfectly legitimate action. After all, in cyberspace, “code is law”. The DAO debate raised this key question: should the intention of the code prevail over the wording of the code? Blockchain proponents envision a future in which entire companies and governments operate in a distributed and automated fashion. But smart contracts pose a series of enforceability issues, which are outlined in a recent white paper by the London law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. How can we resolve disputes arising over a self-executing smart contract? How do we identify what types of contractual terms can be properly translated into code, and which ones should instead be left to natural language? And is there a way combine the two? It is not yet clear that code can address the necessary levels of complexity to replace legal language. After all, the vagueness inherent in the language of law is a feature, not a bug: it compensates for unforeseeable cases that must be assessed on a case-by-case basis in a court of law. Traditional contracts acknowledge that no law can index the entire complexity of life as it is, let alone predict its future development. They also precisely define terms that can be enforced by law. Smart contracts, by contrast, are simply snippets of code both defined and enforced by the code underpinning the blockchain infrastructure. Currently, they do not have any legal recognition. This means that when something goes wrong in a smart contract, parties have no legal recourse. The DAO’s founders painfully learned this lesson last year. If blockchain technologies are ever to go mainstream, governments will have to set up new legal frameworks to accommodate such complexities. Positive law prescribes behaviour and penalises non-compliance. It can encapsulate the normative ideal that a respective government seeks to achieve, demonstrate an ethical vision for society or reify the power structure of the current regime. Technological developments, on the other hand, are often oriented toward profit and change. There’s an inherent tension here. Laws may delay the development of technology and hence hurt the competitive advantage of an entrepreneur or even a state. Take the case of nanotechnology regulation in the European Union versus in the United States. European law so mitigates risks that it may end up limiting the technology’s potential, losing its competitive edge against the US. That’s another fact about the law: slow and reactive, it can be a gross annoyance. But ever since technological advances began speeding along on an exponential curve last century, the law has played a critical role in helping societies maintain certain previously negotiated standards for cohabitation. Our legal system may sometimes seem antiquated in today’s fast-moving world. But before changing our laws to accommodate new technologies that may (re)define our lives, it is important to have room for debate and time for social struggles to take place. The law serves this function of creative friction. It can restore human agency against fierce technological development. Given all the excitement over blockchain technologies, it is probable that interested parties will soon enough seek legal recognition and state-sanctioned enforceability of smart contracts. These emerging technologies are still too new to have been subjected to a sufficiently thorough analysis of their social, economic and political implications. More time is also needed to assess how blockchain could be deployed in a socially beneficial way. Blockchain technology seems poised to constitute an important component of tomorrow’s society. The legal system – slow-paced as it is – might be just what we need at this juncture to ensure that this new tool is deployed in a way consistent with established principles and values, with the common good at its core.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Vasilis Kostakis, Primavera de Filippi, Wolfgang Drechsler, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-05-03T06:26:38Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eThe headlong pace of technological change produces giant leaps forward in knowledge, innovation, new possibilities and, almost inevitably, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/we-need-new-laws-to-regulate-the-worlds-newest-frontier-the-datasphere-66458\"\u003elegal problems\u003c/a\u003e.

But it’s not just the upper crust of high finance who can benefit from this new technology. Most simply, a blockchain is an inexpensive and transparent way to record transactions. People who don’t know each other – and therefore may not trust each other – can securely exchange money without fear of fraud or theft. Major aid agencies, nonprofits and startup companies are working to extend blockchain systems across the developing world to help poor people around the world get easier access to banks for loans or to protect their savings. In my work as a scholar of business and technology focusing on the impact of blockchain and other modern technologies such as cloud computing, big data and the Internet of Things on poor people, I see four main ways blockchain systems are already beginning to connect some of the world’s poorest people with the global economy. A blockchain is a fancy word for a transaction-recording computer database that’s stored in lots of different places at once. The best-known example of blockchain technology is the electronic cryptocurrency called bitcoin, but the concept can be applied in lots of different ways. One way to think about a blockchain is as a public bulletin board to which anyone can post a transaction record. Those posts have to be digitally signed in a particular way, and once posted, a record can never be changed or deleted. The data are stored on many different computers around the internet, and even around the world. Together, these features – openness to writing and inspection, authentication through computerized cryptography and redundant storage – provide a mechanism for secure exchange of funds. They can even involve what are called “smart contracts,” transactions that happen only if certain conditions are met – such as a life insurance policy that sends money to the beneficiary only if a specific doctor submits a digitally signed death certificate to the blockchain. Right now, these sorts of services are available – even in the developed world – only because nations have strong regulations protecting the money people deposit in banks, and clear laws about obeying the terms of formal contracts. In the developing world, these rules often don’t exist at all – so the services that depend on them don’t either, or are so expensive that most people can’t use them. For instance, to open a checking account in some parts of Africa, banks require enormous minimum deposits, sometimes more money than an average person earns in a year. A blockchain system, though, inherently enforces rules about authentication and transaction security. That makes it safe and affordable for a person to store any amount of money securely and confidently. While that’s still in the future, blockchain-based systems are already helping people in the developing world in very real ways. In 2016, emigrants working abroad sent an estimated US$442 billion to their families in their home countries. This global flow of cash is a significant factor in the financial well-being of families and societies in developing nations. But the process of sending money can be extremely expensive. Using MoneyGram, for example, a worker in the U.S. with US$50 to send to Ghana might have to pay $10 in fees, meaning her family would receive only $40. In 2015, transaction costs and commission rates averaged 10.96 percent for remittances sent from banks and 6.36 percent for sending money through money transfer operators. Companies justify their costs by saying they reflect the price of providing reliable and convenient services. By contrast, Hong Kong’s blockchain-enabled Bitspark has transaction costs so low it charges a flat HK$15 for remittances of less than HK$1,200 (about $2 in U.S. currency for transactions less than $150) and 1 percent for larger amounts. Using the secure digital connections of a blockchain system lets the company bypass existing banking networks and traditional remittance systems. Similar services helping people send money to the Philippines, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Uganda, Sierra Leone and Rwanda also charge a fraction of the current banking rates. Most people in the developing world lack health and life insurance, primarily because it’s so expensive compared to income. Some of that is because of high administrative costs: For every dollar of insurance premium collected, administrative costs amounted to $0.28 in Brazil, $0.54 in Costa Rica, $0.47 in Mexico and $1.80 in the Philippines. And many people who live on less than a dollar a day have neither the ability to afford any insurance, nor any company offering them services. In India, for example, only 15 percent of the population has health insurance. Even those people pay higher relative premiums than in developed countries. As a result, people in South Asia pay a much greater share of their health care costs out of their own pockets than do people in high-income industrialized countries. Because blockchain systems are online and involve verification of transactions, they can deter (and expose) fraud, dramatically cutting costs for insurers. Consuelo is a blockchain-based microinsurance service backed by Mexican mobile payments company Saldo.mx. Customers can pay small amounts for health and life insurance, with claims verified electronically and paid quickly. Blockchain systems can also help very small businesses, which are often short of cash and also find it expensive – if not impossible – to borrow money. For instance, after delivering medicine to hospitals, small drug retailers in China often wait up to 90 days to get paid. But to stay afloat, these companies need cash. They rely on intermediaries that pay immediately, but don’t pay in full. A $100 invoice to a hospital might be worth $90 right away – and the intermediary would collect the $100 when it was finally paid. Banks aren’t willing to lend money in places where fraudulent invoices are common, or where manufacturers and their customers might have inconsistent and error-ridden records. A blockchain system reduces those concerns because these records must be authenticated before being added to the books, and because they can’t be changed. Those Chinese pharmaceutical companies are getting help from Yijan, a blockchain that is a joint effort of IBM and Chinese supply management company Hejia. Electronics, auto manufacturing and clothing companies facing similar difficulties are the test markets for Chained Finance, a blockchain platform backed by financial services company Dianrong and FnConn, the Chinese subsidiary of Foxconn. Blockchain technology can also improve humanitarian assistance. Fraud, corruption, discrimination and mismanagement block some money intended to reduce poverty and improve education and health care from actually helping people. In early 2017 the U.N. World Food Program launched the first stage of what it calls “Building Block,” giving food and cash assistance to needy families in Pakistan’s Sindh province. An internet-connected smartphone authenticated and recorded payments from the U.N. agency to food vendors, ensuring the recipients got help, the merchants got paid and the agency didn’t lose track of its money. The agency expects using a blockchain system will reduce its overhead costs from 3.5 percent to less than 1 percent. And it can speed aid to remote or disaster-struck areas, where ATMs may not exist or banks are not functioning normally. In urgent situations, blockchain currency can even take the place of scarce local cash, allowing aid organizations, residents and merchants to exchange money electronically. Blockchains can even help individuals contribute to aid efforts overseas. Usizo is a South Africa-based blockchain platform that lets anyone help pay electricity bills for community schools. Donors can track how much electricity a school is using, calculate how much power their donation will buy and transfer the credit directly using bitcoin. In the future, blockchain-based projects can help people and governments in other ways, too. As many as 1.5 billion people – 20 percent of the world’s population – don’t have any documents that can verify their identity. That limits their ability to use banks, but also can bar their way when trying to access basic human rights like voting, getting health care, going to school and traveling. Several companies are launching blockchain-powered digital identity programs that can help create and validate individuals’ identities. Using only an internet-connected smartphone, a person is photographed and recorded on video making particular facial expressions and speaking, reading an on-screen text. The data are recorded on a blockchain and can be accessed later by anyone who needs to check that person’s identity. Without email, phones, passports or even birth certificates, a blockchain could be the only way many poor people have to prove who they are. That could really make their lives better and expand their opportunities.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Nir Kshetri, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-05-01T01:57:44Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eBig Wall Street companies are using a complicated technology called blockchain to further \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-backs-blockchain-for-savings-on-derivatives-1483979438\"\u003eincrease the already lightning-fast speed of international finance\u003c/a\u003e.

Blockchain is an online ledger that records transactions. It’s capable of recording the movement of any kind of asset from one owner to the next. It’s public and isn’t owned by any one corporation, there are no charges to record transactions. Its openness ensures the integrity of transactions and ownership, as everyone involved has a stake in keeping it honest. This means there are fewer intermediaries; less middle-men who increase the costs and time to complete a transaction. There are risks associated with the system as it’s only as strong as the code that supports it, which has come under attack in the past. Despite this, examples from overseas show it is possible to apply this technology successfully to our housing market. For buyers able to find the right property, secure a mortgage and save a deposit, they must also pay for a range of so-called “hidden costs”. These are additional payments associated with the transaction over the cost of the home itself. Many legal and title-related costs would become near-obsolete in a blockchain system. The combined costs of title registration, title insurance, and legal fees associated with register the property transfer approach A$1,000 on the average Australian house. Costs continue to rise as the prudent buyer undertakes further due diligence, through building inspection documentation, previous sales records and so forth. On top of the financial cost, it then typically takes over a month to settle a real estate transaction in Australia. The blockchain system can speed things up, as currently tedious checks undertaken by hand, move to an automated system overseen and approved by the relevant stakeholders. There is also the risk that land titles offices with a single database simply get things wrong too. In 2016 it was reported that 300 incorrect certificates had been issued in NSW, with 140 of those being recent property buyers affected by government plans for major motorways in Sydney’s west. There are now concerns that the system’s quality could be compromised in several states, including NSW and South Australia, as land titles offices become privatised. If blockchain were applied to the property market in Australia, every property would be encoded with a unique identifier. Property IDs already exist in most land registry systems, so these would need to be migrated to a blockchain. Next, the blockchain ecosystem then needs to have defined who the people behind the transaction are, those stakeholders that include the owner, lender, and government. Transactions of property are conducted via “smart contracts” – digital rules in the blockchain that process the agreement and any specified conditions. Buying and selling could still take place via agents, or the smart contract can be advanced to incorporate the sale rules and make this decision automatically. The blockchain for each property grows as transactions are added to the ledger. A housing market without agents, conveyancers and a land-titles office may seem decades away, but a handful of countries have already piloted blockchain land registration system. In Australia, our current land titles system is among the world’s best, but it is not infallible. A range of hidden taxes and transaction costs increase market inefficiencies. And while the electronic system Property Exchange Australia or PEXA, has brought us to the point of a near paperless property market, it’s still an intermediary between the parties and the record of the transfer in the Torrens system - our current land title system. The added advantage of a blockchain system is in eliminating risks, in particular the risk of records being accessed fraudulently and altered or deleted because it is a permanent and immutable record. This means that a huge amount of computing power would be required, probably along with some collusion, and the alteration is easily detected across the ledger. That’s not to say the blockchain system is perfect. Blockchain’s advantage in restricting any changes to historical records becomes a disadvantage when incorrect or fraudulent entries are added. Digital currency managers, Ether and Bitfinex, learned this the hard way through cyber attacks. Last year these attacks siphoned off over US$50 million in ether tokens from The DAO, the largest crowdfunded venture capital fund. This breach led to a controversial split of Ether into two separate active digital currencies. Only months later, Hong Kong-based crytocurrency trading firm, Bitfinex, had the equivalent of US$68 million stolen by hackers in a security breach reminiscent of the hack that bought down Mt Gox in 2014. It is little comfort to cautious market regulators that the thieves behind these attacks can not spend it without revealing their identity on the blockchain. These hacks demonstrate that blockchain systems are only as secure as the code which supports them. As a nascent technology, its cracks are detected only when they are exposed. Sweden became the first western country to explore the use of blockchain for real estate in July last year. At the time, the Swedish Land Registry partnered with blockchain startup ChromaWay to test how parties to a real estate transaction – the buyer, seller, lender, government – could track the deal’s progress on a blockchain. Other countries at the forefront of blockchain for real estate include The Republic of Georgia, Honduras, and Brazil which announced a pilot program earlier this month. While this might seem like a disparate list, it’s in these countries where the long-term potential of a blockchain for real estate are most significant. Systemic corruption and insecure database management in these countries, and many other emerging economies, is seen as a major constraint on growth and prosperity. Why would you invest in a house, or any other asset, if there is a distinct possibility that the record of your ownership could simply disappear? With ever increasing demands for improvements to transaction efficiency and local real estate industry giants like CoreLogic appointing research teams dedicated to new technology applications, it might not be long before we see a real estate blockchain system in Australia.

This and similar innovations mark the coming of age of a new generation of applications – an Internet of Intelligent Things – that could provide a new infrastructure for economic development across Africa. The Internet of Things is a network of physical devices, vehicles, buildings and other items. They are equipped with electronics, software, sensors and network connectivity so they can collect and exchange data. There’s wide enthusiasm about spectacular innovations such as Intelligent refrigeratorsand driverless cars. But a quieter revolution is underway in everyday systems and facilities, such as financial services. There are particular possibilities here for Africa. The potential for the continent’s economic growth is well established. There’s also an abundance of opportunity for digital innovation. This was clear from a recent continent wide entrepreneurship competition organised by the University of Cape Town’s Graduate School of Business. More broadly, the new Internet of Things has the potential to compensate for Africa’s legacies of underdevelopment. The key here is the development of the blockchain from a fringe concept into a mainstream digital innovation. The blockchain, mostly known as the technology that underpins digital currency Bitcoin, is an almost incorruptible digital ledger of transactions, agreements and contracts that is distributed across thousands of computers, worldwide. It has the potential to be both foundation and springboard for a new developmental infrastructure. New blockchain platforms such as Ethereum are supporting the development of distributed applications. These “DApps” can provide accessible ways to use the blockchain. They act like “autonomous agents” – little brains that receive and process information, make decisions and take actions. These new capabilities will have widespread implications when linked to cryptocurrencies through “smart contacts” that are also securely recorded in the blockchain. DApps provide a practical and affordable means of making Things intelligent and able to interact directly with other Things. They can be programmed to take data-informed actions without human intervention. These innovations will have particular benefits across Africa. Economic growth is underpinned and enabled by appropriate financial services. Early internet-based innovations such as Kenya’s M-PESA have clearly demonstrated the appetite for accessible, Internet-financial services. But many small and medium businesses are still restricted. Their owners usually can’t access standard loan financing. Banks will not extend credit facilities without traditional title deeds to land and buildings, or a conventional payslip. Don and Alex Tapscott have shown in their recent book that the new blockchain can be “the ledger of everything”. A house can become an intelligent entity registered on a secure, distributed database once it’s tagged with a geospatial reference and sensors that monitor its continuing existence. The owner of the asset can, through an Ethereum-based smart contract, secure a loan to expand a start-up enterprise. Intermediary arrangements become unnecessary. Economist Hernando de Soto has suggested this could create “a revolution in property rights”. Property and financing aren’t the only areas where the new Internet of Intelligent Things has the potential to compensate for Africa’s legacies of underdevelopment. Economic growth also depends on affordable and reliable services like water and energy. Water is an increasingly scarce resource in many parts of Africa. This is particularly true in cities. Rapid population increases are making old precepts of urban planning redundant. Technology can help. Autonomous agents positioned across all aspects of water reticulation systems can monitor supplies of potable, storm and waste water. These “little brains” can take appropriate actions to detect and report damage and leakage and close off supply lines. Smart devices can also monitor water quality to detect health hazards. They can regulate and charge for water consumption. Similarly, for the supply of energy, smart devices are already being deployed across conventional and ageing power grids in other parts of the world. In Australia, for instance, intelligent monitors detect when an individual pole is in trouble. They then report the fault and call out a repair crew. They can also communicate with other poles to redirect the supply and preserve the grid’s integrity. In parallel with conventional supply systems, new digital technologies can enable full integration with renewable sources of energy and the intelligent management of supply at the household level. The new blockchain is designed for secure peer-to-peer transactions combined with incorruptible contracts between multiple parties. Individual households can manage their own supply and demand to incorporate self-generated energy. A house equipped with a simple windmill and a roof made up of photovoltaic tiles could sell surplus power to a neighbour in need. They could also buy from another house to meet a shortfall. Such microgrids are already in development. The combination of ubiquitous and affordable bandwidth and low cost autonomous agents could bring affordable energy to communities that have never enjoyed reliable electricity supply. A new infrastructure built up in this way could be a springboard for economic development – from small enterprises that would have the resources to take innovations to scale, to significant household efficiencies and increases in consumer purchasing power. As has been the pattern with previous digital technologies, costs of production will fall dramatically as the global market for intelligent things explodes. That which seems extraordinary today will be everyday tomorrow. So what’s standing in the way? It’s not the technology that’s holding Africa back from embracing the Internet of Things. Rather, it’s the established interests in play. These include state enterprises and near-monopolies that are heavily invested in conventional systems, local patronage networks and conventional banks, and the failure of political vision. What’s needed is effective public policy and business to ensure that the potential of this next wave of digital innovation is realised. Government and civil society innovators need to be directing much of their attention here. This is why the West African Monetary Union’s cryptocurrency initiative is encouraging. It’s a step towards the future that Don and Alex Tapscott envision; a move towards an Internet that’s driven by the falling costs of bargaining, policing, and enforcing social and commercial agreements. In this new space integrity, security, collaboration, the privacy of all transactions will be the name of the game. So too will the creation and distribution of value. And that’s great news for Africa.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Martin Hall, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-03-28T15:07:41Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eLate in 2016 Senegal’s Banque Regionale De Marches announced the launch of the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/senegal-will-introduce-blockchain-based-national-digital-currency/\"\u003eeCFA Franc\u003c/a\u003e; a cryptocurrency for the countries of the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.uemoa.int/en\"\u003eWest African Monetary Union\u003c/a\u003e – Senegal, Cote d’Ivoire, Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Togo and Guinea-Bissau.

This is particularly true in \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/jun/07/africa-urbanisation-megatrend-needs-to-deliver-growth-says-report\"\u003ecities\u003c/a\u003e. Rapid population increases are making old precepts of urban planning redundant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnology can help. Autonomous agents positioned across all aspects of water reticulation systems can monitor supplies of potable, storm and waste water. These “little brains” can take appropriate actions to detect and report damage and leakage and close off supply lines. Smart devices can also monitor water quality to detect health hazards. They can regulate and charge for water consumption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, for the supply of energy, smart devices are already being deployed across conventional and ageing power grids in other parts of the world. In \u003ca href\u003d\"https://powerledger.io/\"\u003eAustralia\u003c/a\u003e, for instance, intelligent monitors detect when an individual pole is in trouble.

The new blockchain is designed for secure peer-to-peer transactions combined with incorruptible contracts between multiple parties. Individual households can manage their own supply and demand to incorporate self-generated energy. A house equipped with a simple windmill and a roof made up of photovoltaic tiles could sell surplus power to a neighbour in need.

Chatbots are replacing humans, big data threatens our privacy, and the blockchain is linking it all together. In our series on tech and advertising, we’re taking a look at how the industry is being reshaped. While technology has been making more devices “smart”, and we carry phones with all sorts of sensors, these haven’t yet been systematically applied to advertising’s central problem – engagement. The blockchain, however, will make advertising much smarter. Traditional advertising – think of posters on bus stops and TV commercials – is easy to ignore and its effectiveness is hard to measure. Even online advertising has problems measuring engagement. But with the blockchain, advertisers will be able to tap into the data in our devices, automatically pull together multiple sources of information, and even offer rewards to consumers. Think of the blockchain as a kind of a public spreadsheet. This spreadsheet is stored simultaneously on a bunch of different computers and is encrypted. When someone transfers a Bitcoin (or anything else you’re trading on the blockchain) the transaction is verified by all of the computers, encrypted and added to the spreadsheet, where everyone can see. The encryption and transparency are what make the system secure. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, such as Ripple XRP and Ether, sit on top of the blockchain. They can be used as currencies, transferred between people just like normal money. Or they can be used as a kind of token, the transfer recorded to signify when something has been exchanged. A computer program known as a smart contract has evolved out of this system. It can execute specific actions when predefined conditions within the blockchain are fulfilled – such as automatically paying a farmer when crops are delivered. But smart contracts could also have huge implications for advertising. Advertising in the age of blockchains and smart contracts will be something more like an ecosystem. Information and value will flow and be captured in numerous directions. Using smart contracts, many different entities and data streams will be brought together. Let’s imagine Jane sees an advertisement for a pair of shoes on her smartphone. The advertiser asks that, in exchange for Bitcoin, she reveal her identity by turning on her camera and taking a selfie. She must also allow the advertiser to access her SIM and verify with the phone company that it is indeed Jane who owns the phone. The advertiser would also like to know where Jane is located using the Google Maps application on her phone. Individually, none of these actions are new. What will be new is having a smart contract to tie it all together. At the initiation of this advertising effort, the parties involved in the smart contract are Jane, the advertiser, the phone company and Google. A predefined reward (in the form of Bitcoin) promised by the advertiser will be released to Jane only once all parties fulfil their part of the contract. Jane must take a selfie and send it to the advertiser, the phone company must confirm with the advertiser that Jane indeed owns the phone used to take the selfie and Google must release Jane’s location to the advertiser. There are a few implications from this example. Consumers like Jane will now be empowered to choose whether they want to give up their privacy in exchange for something. Jane could choose to block Google Maps from revealing her location, for example. Advertisers will know exactly how consumers interact with their ads. By specifying actions for Jane to perform, like taking a selfie after watching an ad, advertisers will overcome the crucial problem of not being able to verify whether people are actually paying attention. They will also know whether consumers have adhered to every part of the agreement. If Jane does not allow Google Maps to reveal her location, the advertiser will be aware of this and may release only some of her reward. This is an efficient and cost-effective method of piecing together the profiles of customers. Finally, the blockchain will enable advertisers to capture value they could not previously, because they could not track or measure interaction with ads. For example, let’s say the advertiser’s request is more ambitious, and Jane decides to reveal she is using a cab from company X and dropping by cafe Y to pick up a latte before going to the shoe store. The original advertisement has now generated value not only for the advertiser but also for those other entities. Using the blockchain means all parties will have access to information about what happened. The advertiser could collaborate with other companies like cab company X and cafe Y to boost business. They could even demand those companies chip in to cover the costs. At this point we must go through a reality check. While some parts of this picture are already being experimented with – Nasdaq has built a marketplace to buy and sell advertising on a blockchain, and others are building the tokens to sit on top – technologically and politically we are still sorely lacking. There are also many digital blind spots that, like missing links among security cameras, allow some actions to go unobserved and unaccounted for during the advertising process. But it is possible that in the future, once the infrastructure and our societies have caught up, every digital device will be connected to a blockchain-like system so that all digital actions are accounted for. When that happens, advertisers won’t know what hit them.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Eric T.K.

But one problem with this great expansion in renewables is they are intermittent, meaning they depend on weather conditions such as the wind blowing or sun shining. Unlike conventional power, this means they can’t necessarily meet surges in demand. Hence many press headlines in recent years about the “lights going out”. National Grid, the UK grid operator, has several ways of ensuring supply can always meet demand. For shorter gaps in generation, it asks electricity suppliers to run their conventional power stations at below maximum potential output and ramp up as needed. For longer gaps, it ensures power stations, particularly gas-based ones, are kept on standby. Some stations may only be asked to generate power for between several dozen and a few hundred hours a year. Besides contributing to carbon emissions, operating power plants for such short interventions is expensive. The question is what to do about this problem. We could build less renewable power and make conventional power “greener” instead by removing the CO₂ and burying it underground. Opinion divides on when these carbon capture technologies can be made commercially viable on a large scale. In the UK, unfortunately two government kickstarter projects have floundered due to concerns about costs and departmental disagreements. An alternative is to install very big (“grid scale”) batteries capable of storing renewable power to be released when required. This has generated a lot of interest lately. But given the costs of current battery technology, grid-scale storage requires expensive upfront investments. While researchers study these problems, the UK is developing an alternative known as demand-side response. One aspect involves rewarding certain electricity consumers for reducing their usage at short notice. This can range from large industrial customers to smaller consumers using power for heating rooms, cooling, lighting or even refrigeration. The other aspect of demand response involves asking customers who own equipment that can store power to help balance surges in demand. For example, the owners of a house equipped with solar panels and corresponding battery storage might reduce repayment costs on the equipment by making the battery units available to the grid. Other equipment in this category includes electric vehicles and hospital/university uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units. Both types of demand response are happening already. Some industrial power customers and certain other companies such as hotel operators have contracts for reducing power, while National Grid has been attracting much bidder interest for power storage schemes and has some underway in parts of the country. This storage is an alternative to deploying large-scale batteries, and promises to be much more economical if we can make it work on a large enough scale. The problem is that these schemes get more complicated once the pool of customers gets beyond a certain size. Knowing which customers to sign up and what tariffs to offer requires understanding to what extent devices will be available and at what cost, for example. Once a pool of customers is set up, some devices might not always be available for storage or reducing demand when needed. This needs to be factored into the calculations both to minimise grid disruption and incentivise customers to participate at these times. There can also be undesired effects, such as large simultaneous rebounds in consumption. For example many refrigerators will draw extra power to get their internal temperature below the required level when a demand response period ends. Finally there’s a potential major security issue: a central system that collects data about energy usage from many devices may be prone to malicious attacks and information tampering. This could undermine both grid balancing and keeping track of what customers are owed. Emerging artificial intelligence technologies look like providing answers to these challenges. To select the best participants, for example, grid operators will be able to use sophisticated machine-learning techniques to model the behaviour of individual devices and battery storage units by reviewing data from smart meters and sensors. Once signed up for grid storage, it should be possible to estimate the useful lifetime of a battery pack or unit by applying prognostic algorithms to its charging/discharging data. Owners will then receive appropriate compensation, plus the added incentive of knowing how long their battery will last. When it comes to managing devices in the pool, people used to think we could use individual smart meters or control devices to feed a central server in the cloud. But meters are expensive and the short response times require the cloud server to analyse data in milliseconds, which looks unfeasible once many thousands of units are in a pool. An alternative is to have metering devices which detect demand levels on the grid themselves and reduce power accordingly. These take pressure off the central server and it only requires metering at site level, rather than for every electrical device. But it still leaves you with a complex control problem in coordinating all these individual decisions. We at Heriot-Watt are working on a solution to this using AI-based algorithms. Another line of AI research draws on insights from algorithmic game theory to develop reward/penalty mechanisms which ensure enough customers in the pool are willing to participate, and actually respond when necessary. Researchers are also optimistic that blockchain protocols, using the same technology as Bitcoin, could underpin a decentralised ledger system that would get round the security risk of having a single storage point for user data. Numerous AI research groups, both in the UK and elsewhere, have been addressing these challenges, while a number of start-ups have started developing such systems in practice – relatively simple versions of machine learning are now beginning to be used, for instance. The UK has a good chance to be at the forefront of international efforts to make smarter demand response a reality over the next few years.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Valentin Robu, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-01-27T13:54:50Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eA \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/the-year-coal-collapsed-2016-was-a-turning-point-for-britains-electricity-70877\"\u003erecent Conversation piece\u003c/a\u003e pointed out that the British electricity mix in 2016 was the cleanest in 60 years, with record capacity from renewable energy, mainly from wind and solar power.

An algorithm programmed by one of the world’s biggest companies now partially controls what news reaches 1.8 billion people. And this algorithm has come under attack for censorship, political bias and for creating bubbles that prevent people from encountering ideas they don’t already agree with. Now a new kind of social network is emerging that has no centralised control like Facebook does. It’s based on blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and promises a more democratic and secure way to share content. But a closer look at how these networks operate suggests they could be far less empowering than they first appear. Blockchain has received an enormous amount of hype thanks to its use in online-only cryptocurrencies. It is essentially a ledger or a database where information is stored in “blocks” that are linked historically to form a chain, saved on every computer that uses it. What is revolutionary about it is that this ledger is built using cryptography by a network of users rather than a central authority such as a bank or government. Every computer in the network has access to all the blocks and the information they contain, making the blockchain system more transparent, accurate and also robust since it does not have a single point of failure. The absence of a central authority controlling blockchain means it can be used to create more democratic organisations owned and controlled by their users. Very importantly, it also enables the use of smart contracts for payments. These are codes that automatically implement and execute the terms of a legal contract. Industry and governments are developing other uses for blockchain aside from digital currencies, from streamlining back office functions to managing health data. One of the most recent ideas is to use blockchain to create alternative social networks that avoid many of the problems the likes of Facebook are sometimes criticised for, such as censorship, privacy, manipulating what content users see and exploiting those users. Most of these services are in pilot stages but one, Steemit, has been successfully operating for a number of months and its user numbers have grown significantly. Its main function is as a content-sharing site where posts are ranked by popularity, similar to Reddit, although it has recently added a private messaging function and the ability to follow specific users. Perhaps its most important feature is the way users are rewarded. Every time they produce or share content, they receive Steem tokens, which are like shares in the organisation. These can be exchanged for any real-world currency or used to vote on how the platform will develop, giving users governance power. Steemit doesn’t control or own user data since it is stored using blockchain and so it doesn’t sell the data to third parties such as advertisers. Being built on publicly available and visible blockchain technology prevents any form of censorship and discrimination in the system. The network doesn’t filter what content users see with an algorithm – posts are ranked by pure popularity – and there is no central entity that can manipulate or censor the data, or be forced to by governments. Most of the other decentralised blockchain social networks are very similar. There is Synereo, which has the added option to post images and hashtag content, and Akasha, which is like a decentralised Twitter, as well as ThanksCoin and Yours Network. For all their interesting ideas, however, social networks built on blockchain face some big questions over whether they can really achieve what they promise. To begin with, most are funded by venture capital or individual investors and don’t have clear business models for generating sustainable revenue or profits. There is also the problem that using blockchain as the underlying technology means any content shared becomes a matter of public record. Data and, more importantly, users’ history cannot be erased or changed, which means a slight mistake could haunt people forever. But there is also some doubt over whether these projects really create decentralised social networks at all. They must entail a certain degree of centralisation to develop the code behind them and solve problems such as software bugs or potential hacks. They have been set up by a small group of people that have decided to use technology in a certain way. Some projects might involve users in a more democratic way, but blockchain does not remove centralisation and politics altogether. What’s more, Steemit looks much more like a blogging platform than a social network as we know it, and so far has a very limited range of user-generated content. To become viable alternatives to the likes of Facebook, blockchain networks will have to find a way to attract a much wider population. One strong appeal might be that they provide users with a way to make money from their work rather than allowing someone else to exploit it. Yet there’s a limit to the degree to which Blockchain networks are really empowering users. They do not offer alternative economic models, such as collaboration between a community. Instead, they just offer a way to be a part of the “market/attention economy”, where individuals receive money for clicks and likes. And on a political level, while Steemit offers users the chance to gain power, it doesn’t distribute it equally. The more popular the content you post or like is, the more power you have. Not only does that lead to inequality, but it also might have distorting and negative effects on the content. For example, it could encourage users to post more dumbed-down, salacious or even fake content in pursuit of the highest readership – something that is already a problem for social networks that don’t pay users for clicks. Blockchain does offer a technological solution for creating alternative organisational models. But it’s worth remembering that decentralisation has been behind the internet’s architecture since its inception and it has not led to a significant redistribution of power to the general population. That said, blockchain networks are still in their early stages, and their focus on developing more egalitarian models for social networking means it is worth watching how they develop.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Jelena Dzakula, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-01-25T12:54:28Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eYou may well have found this article through Facebook.

It is essentially a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/demystifying-the-blockchain-a-basic-user-guide-60226\"\u003eledger or a database\u003c/a\u003e where information is stored in “blocks” that are linked historically to form a chain, saved on every computer that uses it. What is revolutionary about it is that this ledger is built using cryptography by a network of users rather than a central authority such as a bank or government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery computer in the network has access to all the blocks and the information they contain, making the blockchain system more transparent, accurate and also robust since it does not have a single point of failure. The absence of a central authority controlling blockchain means it can be used to create more democratic organisations owned and controlled by their users. Very importantly, it also enables the use of smart contracts for payments. These are codes that automatically implement and execute the terms of a legal contract.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class\u003d\"slot clear\" data-id\u003d\"17\"\u003e\n \u003cdiv class\u003d\"inline-promos-skeleton\"\u003e\n  \u003ch5\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cbutton\u003e\u003c/button\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cfigure class\u003d\"align-center \"\u003e\n \u003cdiv class\u003d\"placeholder-container\" style\u003d\"--aspect-ratio-percent:66.71087533156499%;--background-color:#324853\"\u003e\n  \u003cimg alt\u003d\"\" class\u003d\"lazyload\" data-src\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/154234/original/image-20170125-23862-1ul9dhe.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;fit\u003dclip\" data-srcset\u003d\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/154234/original/image-20170125-23862-1ul9dhe.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d400\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/154234/original/image-20170125-23862-1ul9dhe.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d30\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d400\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/154234/original/image-20170125-23862-1ul9dhe.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d15\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d600\u0026amp;h\u003d400\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/154234/original/image-20170125-23862-1ul9dhe.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d45\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d503\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/154234/original/image-20170125-23862-1ul9dhe.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d30\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d503\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/154234/original/image-20170125-23862-1ul9dhe.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026amp;q\u003d15\u0026amp;auto\u003dformat\u0026amp;w\u003d754\u0026amp;h\u003d503\u0026amp;fit\u003dcrop\u0026amp;dpr\u003d3 2262w\" sizes\u003d\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"\u003e\n \u003c/div\u003e\n \u003cfigcaption\u003e\n  \u003cspan class\u003d\"caption\"\u003eFollow the chain.\u003c/span\u003e \u003cspan class\u003d\"attribution\"\u003e\u003cspan class\u003d\"source\"\u003eShutterstock\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n \u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndustry and governments are developing other uses for blockchain \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/finally-interesting-uses-for-the-blockchain-that-go-beyond-bitcoin-51213\"\u003easide from digital currencies\u003c/a\u003e, from streamlining back office functions to managing health data.

To begin with, most are funded by venture capital or individual investors and don’t have clear business models for generating sustainable revenue or profits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also the problem that using blockchain as the underlying technology means any content shared becomes a matter of public record. Data and, more importantly, users’ history cannot be erased or changed, which means \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.coindesk.com/absolute-immutability-will-slow-permissioned-blockchain-progress/\"\u003ea slight mistake could haunt people forever\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there is also some doubt over whether these projects really create decentralised social networks at all. They must entail a certain degree of centralisation to develop the code behind them and solve problems such as software bugs or potential hacks. They have been set up by a small group of people that have decided to use technology in a certain way. Some projects might involve users in a more democratic way, but \u003ca href\u003d\"https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/invisible-politics-bitcoin-governance-crisis-decentralised-infrastructure\"\u003eblockchain does not remove centralisation and politics altogether\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s more, Steemit looks much more like a blogging platform than a social network as we know it, and so far has a very limited range of user-generated content. To become viable alternatives to the likes of Facebook, blockchain networks will have to find a way to attract a much wider population. One strong appeal might be that they provide users with a way to make money from their work rather than allowing someone else to exploit it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eUnequal power share\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet there’s a limit to the degree to which Blockchain networks are really empowering users. They do not offer alternative economic models, such as collaboration between a community. Instead, they just offer a way to be a part of the “market/attention economy”, where individuals receive money for clicks and likes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd on a political level, while Steemit offers users the chance to gain power, it doesn’t distribute it equally. The more popular the content you post or like is, the more power you have. Not only does that lead to inequality, but it also might have distorting and negative effects on the content. For example, it could encourage users to post more dumbed-down, salacious or even \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/facebooks-problem-is-more-complicated-than-fake-news-68886\"\u003efake content\u003c/a\u003e in pursuit of the highest readership – something that is already a problem for social networks that don’t pay users for clicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlockchain does offer a technological solution for creating alternative organisational models. But it’s worth remembering that decentralisation has been behind the internet’s architecture since its inception and it has not led to a significant redistribution of power to the general population. That said, blockchain networks are still in their early stages, and their focus on developing more egalitarian models for social networking means it is worth watching how they develop.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"LINK":"https://theconversation.com/centrelink-data-matching-problems-show-the-need-for-a-government-blockchain-71156","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"The Conversation","IMAGE":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/152614/original/image-20170113-11198-1htvjsm.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026q\u003d45\u0026auto\u003dformat\u0026w\u003d240\u0026h\u003d240\u0026fit\u003dcrop","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"Centrelink data-matching problems show the need for a government blockchain","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Governments across the globe are experimenting with the blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, as a way to reduce costs and provide more accountability to the public. In Europe alone, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and Estonia are experimenting with blockchains to fight corruption and deliver public services. Australia, too, is looking at what a blockchain might achieve. The recent problems with Centrelink’s automated data-matching system show precisely where a government blockchain would fit in. Rather than siloing our data in government agencies, we could create a single source of information. This would speed up our interactions with government, while reducing errors and fraud. The blockchain is a kind of public database, one stored simultaneously on a bunch of different computers. When a new transaction occurs it is verified (otherwise known as “mining” or “consensus”), encrypted and added to the database. The most famous example of the blockchain is Bitcoin, a crypto-currency built upon the blockchain. However, the blockchain is suitable for many other applications, not just financial transactions. For example, the blockchain could be used to authenticate that a diamond has not come from an illict source, or for buying and selling property. For the government’s purposes, the killer feature of the blockchain is that it is a way to record transactions so that they are transparent and cannot be altered or tampered with. When used to track fish through a supply chain, for instance, it allows customers and restaurants to follow where the fish has been and have confidence in the data. When applied to a government context, these capabilities could be useful for collecting tax, delivering benefits, or regulating business. From the public’s point of view, this could enable us to track government spending, eliminate fraudulent transactions, reduce errors in data processing and speed up service delivery to almost real time. It could be useful almost anywhere records are kept. All the while the public could be more confident about the accuracy and integrity of the data being held. The Australian government makes benefit payments and provides support services through Medicare, Centrelink and Child Support services. It also collects information through numerous other agencies, such as the Australian Tax Office. A government blockchain could record the transactions about a citizen and link together information about health, welfare and child support. The information would be entered only once into the blockchain by any one of these agencies. There would be no need for the data to be re-entered or matched again. Thus errors that occur in data processing as information is passed on down the line will be eliminated, avoiding some of the issues with the current Centrelink system. Further, once data is entered it cannot be altered or changed in any way without proper authentication. Any authorised officer within the government could then access the information in the blockchain, avoiding a paper-pushing exercise between government departments. All of your data would be in one place. We could go even further, as the blockchain would also allow other services to be processed through an app, as the UK is trialling with welfare payments. The overall cost savings, reduction in bureaucracy and increased responsiveness to helping people in need could be immense. All we need is the government to invest in its own blockchain. The essence of a blockchain is to reduce the reliance on centralised systems (such as the government), replacing it with a system with inherent accountability, transparency and trust. The original blockchain concept achieved this by being open, like the internet (also known as unpermissioned), relying on independent, anonymous “miners” to validate transactions. This guarantees the integrity of the data as no-one knows who the miners are to bribe or bully them into underhanded actions. However, some might view a government-run, “permissioned” blockchain with suspicion. The trust of the public would need to be gained. A government blockchain would not be open, and we would have to rely on the government to approve all of the transactions. This negates some of the benefit offered by a blockchain. The legitimacy and trust would have to come from the government itself. Thus a government-run blockchain would not be without its challenges. But if an Australian government blockchain is developed and allowed to succeed, then the potential benefits could be enormous. Society as we know it will be disrupted!","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Christine Helliar, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2017-01-13T05:07:21Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eGovernments across the globe are experimenting with the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/demystifying-the-blockchain-a-basic-user-guide-60226\"\u003eblockchain\u003c/a\u003e, the technology behind Bitcoin, as a way to reduce costs and provide more accountability to the public.

The original blockchain concept achieved this by being open, like the internet (also known as unpermissioned), relying on independent, anonymous “miners” to validate transactions. This guarantees the integrity of the data as no-one knows who the miners are to bribe or bully them into underhanded actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, some might view a government-run, “permissioned” blockchain with suspicion. The trust of the public would need to be gained. A government blockchain would not be open, and we would have to rely on the government to approve all of the transactions.

From self-driving vehicles and the sharing economy through to cloud computing and blockchain technologies, each of these trends is quite significant on its own. But the convergence of their disruptive forces is what will create real value and drive innovations. Take blockchain and the sharing economy as an example. Bringing these two forces together can potentially disrupt established companies like Uber and Airbnb. The success of these companies is largely due to their ability to make use of existing assets people owned, that had been paid for, but from which new value could be derived. Effectively, these companies set up digital platforms that harnessed “excess capacity” and relied on other people to deliver the services. The same applies to other so-called “sharing economy” companies that merely act as service aggregators and collect a cut off the top. In the process, they gather valuable data for further commercial gain. But can this business model be challenged and enhanced for the benefit of those who are delivering the service and creating the real value? Can technology be used to bypass the third party and allow direct peer-to-peer collaboration within a distributed governance structure? What could a “peer-owned” and “peer-run” marketplace look like? Blockchain technology could just be the answer. You can think of blockchain as the second generation of the internet – a transformation from an internet of information to an internet of value. Blockchain allows suppliers and consumers – even competitors – to share a decentralised digital ledger across a network of computers without the need for a central authority. The assets that can be described on the blockchain can be financial, legal, physical or electronic. No single party has the power to tamper with the records – sophisticated algorithms keep everyone honest by ensuring data integrity and authentication of transactions. But the impacts of blockchain go well beyond financial services and transactions. Its real value is in establishing trust-based interactions and accelerating the transfer of governance from centralised institutions to distributed networks of peer-to-peer collaboration. The impact can be profound: a centralised institution acting as intermediatory in a transaction of value is now at risk of being disrupted because the same service can be provided on the blockchain through peer-to-peer interaction. Blockchain gives service providers a means to collaborate and derive a greater share of the value for themselves. Smart agents on a blockchain could do just about everything provided by a service aggregator. The technology’s trust protocol allows autonomous associations to be formed and controlled by the same people who are creating the value. All revenues for services, minus overheads, would go to members, who also control the platform and make decisions. Trust is not established by third parties, but rather through an encrypted consensus enabled by smart coding. We already have examples of this technology in action. Arcade City, a global community of peer-to-peer services, is planning to offer a ride-sharing service on the blockchain. To catch a ride, the user buys digital currency (known as tokens), creates an offer and commits funds for the ride. A driver claims the offer, matches the funds to signal their commitment to provide the service, and picks up the passenger. The blockchain releases the funds as soon as the user acknowledges completing the ride. Arcade City has a city council, which will overlook the system for three years until it is fully decentralised and up and running. The same concept of using distributed public record technology can be applied to a wide range of urban applications. For example, an energy startup in Perth is looking to trial a peer-to-peer technology solution that would allow consumers to offer excess energy, available through their solar panels, on the blockchain. Clever code matches the suppliers with consumers without the need to go through the energy provider. The blockchain technology and ecosystem around it are evolving rapidly, and are probably raising more questions than answers. How do we establish a system of transparent governance to ensure the longevity of the blockchain? What about security, speed, cost and, more importantly, regulations? As with other disruptive technologies, there will be winners and losers. If the technology is successfully managed for scalable growth, it could very well disrupt established norms and transform our societies. Large layers of data generated by consumers today, which are controlled by hubs, can become public. In a world driven by blockchain, consumers can monetise their own data to derive greater value. By knowing when and how to take advantage of this technology, we have an opportunity to transform the digital platforms for tomorrow’s cities. The blockchain becomes the city’s operating system, invisible yet ubiquitous, improving citizens’ access to services, goods and economic opportunities. Today, the technology is yet to mature. It remains to be seen if the expectations can live up to reality. But, in many ways, this is quite reminiscent of the internet in the mid-1990s. Not many people would have predicted its significance back then. Had we understood the impacts of the internet 20 years ago, what could we have done differently to create more value? That is where we stand today with blockchain. The power of this transformation will become more compelling as the hype settles down and we begin to unleash the possibilities.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Hussein Dia, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-12-13T19:04:57Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eMany trends on the horizon offer opportunities that could transform our cities.

Not quite eight years ago, in November 2008, a mysterious and still unknown developer going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto launched bitcoin –- the first practical electronic cash that didn’t rely on a digital reserve bank. A decentralised crypto-currency scheme requires global consensus on when someone spends a virtual coin, so she cannot spend it again. Blockchain’s trick is to broadcast every single bitcoin transaction to the whole community, which then in effect votes on the order in which transactions appear. Any attempt to “double spend” (move the same bitcoin twice), or to introduce a counterfeit coin that hasn’t been seen on the network before, is detected and rejected. With no umpire, the continuous arbitration of blockchain entries requires a massive peer-to-peer network in order to resist distortion or manipulation. Anyone at all is free to join the blockchain network, as a holder and spender of currency, and/or as a node contributing to the consensus process. The incentive to participate comes in the form of a random reward paid whenever the ledger is settled, which is roughly every 10 minutes. The odds of a node winning the reward go up with the amount of computing power it adds to the network, and so running a node is dubbed bitcoin “mining”. The only authoritative record of anyone’s bitcoin balance is held on the blockchain. Account holders operate a wallet application, which shows their balance and lets them spend it, moving bitcoin to other accounts. Counter-intuitively, these “wallets” hold no money; all they do is control account holders’ private keys, and provide a user interface to what’s in the blockchain. In fact bitcoin is entirely ethereal, with not even virtual coins. The Blockchain only records the movement of bitcoin in and out of account holders’ wallets, and calculates virtual balances as the difference between what’s been spent and what’s been paid. The only way to spend your balance is to use your private key, to digitally sign an instruction to the network, specifying the amount to move, and the address (that is, the public key) of where to move it to. If a private key is lost or destroyed, then the balance associated with that key is frozen forever and can never be spent. Ever. There has been a string of notorious mishaps where computers or disk drives holding bitcoin wallets have been lost, together with millions of dollars of value they controlled. And predictably, numerous pieces of malicious software have been developed specifically to steal bitcoin private keys and balances. The enthusiasm for crypto-currency innovation has proven infectious; the feeling is that if blockchain “squared the circle” in payments, then it must have untold powers in other domains. In particular, many commentators have promoted blockchain for identity management. The conspicuous thing about proposals to put “identity on the blockchain” is that they overwhelmingly come from blockchain advocates and not identity management experts. What’s missing in the great majority of blockchain-for-identity proposals – and indeed in most of the non-payments use cases – is a careful statement of the problem and proper analysis of why distributed consensus is important. Sadly, when you look closely, the blockchain just doesn’t do what most people seem to think it does. There is nothing “on” the blockchain. All it holds is a record of bitcoin movements and associated metadata. The metaphor of recording anything “on” it belies the need for additional technologies and processes over and above blockchain, to decide how to represent physical items in code and to oversee the assignment of those codes. These necessitate extra key management, registration of ownership, and governance. Blockchain does nothing about these realities, neither does any other distributed ledger technology that has followed in bitcoin’s wake. Blockchain was expressly designed to manage crypto-currency without any key management or registration. No one is trusted in the naked bitcoin world. No administrator and no third party is needed to vouch for any wallet holder or network node. The lack of friction is great for the unbanked (as well as illicit users) and it also helps build the peer-to-peer network, which must be maintained at a huge scale in order to guard against those untrusted participants conspiring against the system. And it’s best to remember that the incentive to run blockchain nodes comes from the mining reward. Take bitcoin away from non-payment use cases and it’s unclear who will pay for the infrastructure, and how. The original blockchain is not separable from bitcoin. Now, there is certainly plenty of fresh research and development being done on alternative consensus mechanisms and participation models. But nothing yet is up and running like the established public blockchain, and nothing else has yet been proven with blockchain’s security properties. Blockchain does just one thing: it establishes the order of entries in a distributed ledger, so as to prevent double spend without an umpire. The truth of the contents of the ledger is an entirely different matter. Blockchain doesn’t magically make the entries themselves trustworthy, let alone the people that created them. Despite the hype, blockchain is not a “trust protocol”; it’s actually the opposite. Just think about it: it’s not as though paying by bitcoin stops you from being ripped off. For anything of value other than bitcoin to be transacted via the blockchain requires additional layers of agents, third parties and auditors – things that just don’t square with the trust-free architecture. Lofty claims are made for blockchain’s ability to decentralise all sorts of things. But in truth, blockchain only decentralises the adjudication of the order of entries in a ledger. It is not a general or native “Internet of Value” as claimed by authors like Don and Alex Tapscott. It was expressly designed for electronic cash; it has no native connection to real world assets. Few businesses have escaped the call to evaluate blockchain technologies. If you’ve been persuaded to have a look, then as a first step, re-examine your security and record keeping needs. Take the time to understand what blockchain does, and all the things it leaves to be done by other systems. If your business is decentralised and your assets are purely digital, then blockchain has a lot to offer, but otherwise, it’s just another database.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Stephen Wilson, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-07-19T20:08:53Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eNo new technology since the dawn of the internet has captured the imagination like blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDesigned to run unregulated electronic currency, the blockchain is promoted by many as having far broader potential in government, identity, voting, corporate administration and healthcare, to name just some of the proposed use cases.

In this Blockchain unleashed series, we investigate the many possible use cases for the blockchain, from the novel to the transformative. If the food industry is not in crisis, it certainly contains an increasing level of complexity and associated risks. A recent analysis suggested 50% of US food production is wasted, with global estimates above 30%. Retailers want perfect produce, leading to wastage occurring throughout the food supply chain. They also seek low prices, leading to industrialisation of processes. Food scares such as mad cow disease (BSE) and cross contamination mean many consumers have less trust in their food, increasingly seeking information on authenticity and production practices. Over 80% of antibiotics used in the US are used in food production. Farming practices lead to environmental issues and may exacerbate to climate change. Alternate “real world” models are being developed to address some of these issues. For instance, farmers’ markets can reduce food miles, and demonstrate localism. Gleaning, where people collect leftover crops from farmers’ fields after they have been commercially harvested, is becoming popular. There is ever increasing legislation and standards, though these tend to be national or regional, and often onerous to implement. Recent developments in the digital economy could help. Among these are a growing use of sensors providing information to allow more intelligent practices to reduce costs and improve flexibility. Real time temperature monitoring and smart fridges in homes can help reduce waste. But a relatively new innovation, the blockchain, is seen by many as offering significant opportunities within agricultural supply chains. Blockchains are the technology that underpin cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, but they have uses other than currencies. They record information in a distributed ledger in a way that is both secure and immutable; by being distributed among many users these ledgers are resilient with no single point of failure, and they can be (depending on design), transparent to all users. Described by the Economist as “the trust machine”, blockchains provide supply chain transparency and data integrity, allowing a visible assurance of authenticity. A number of startups are exploring the potential for blockchains in agriculture. Most notable is Provenance.org, a small UK B2B software startup using the blockchain to establish the authenticity of high value goods, including food. They are experimenting with proving the supply chain of tuna caught in Indonesia being delivered to Japanese restaurants. They will use information on sensors or RFID tags and local certification, recorded in the blockchain, to track the fish along its journey from “hook to fork”; creating in the words of one of their founders, a “reputation system”. Other software firms are developing similar off the shelf solutions for global tracking. Innovators are researching ways in which DNA can be recorded and tagged to an animal, and recorded in the blockchain. This information can easily be made available to end users and customers using mobile phones and apps. BlockCrushr Labs is a Canadian startup addressing issues of local food poverty and is using the currency and transparency aspects of blockchain technology to increase donations to homeless people, and also to ensure these donations are responsibly spent. Farmshare is using blockchain to evolve community-supported agriculture, where a local “currency” can be used to purchase locally produced food within a natural community. A wireless sensor firm, Filament, is developing sensors to monitor crop health and recording results in a blockchain. Others are embedding sensors in the harvested crop to record temperature and humidity. These make it easier to trace damaged crops. Linking these sensor records to other connected equipment in the internet of things, such as transport and storage coolers ensures end to end monitoring and safe handling. Skuchain is developing improved barcodes and RFID tags, and blockchain technology with the aim of protecting end to end global supply chains against counterfeiting. Firms such as sandwich chain Subway have pledged to remove antibiotics and preservatives from their ingredients. If the wish to deliver these promises, a transparent blockchain where product origin and contents are visible to all would seem to be a suitable approach. We may typify these proofs of concept and ideas as using the blockchain to provide a permanent audit trail, where visibility leads to accountability and trust, without the need to establish local reputation. This philosophy is obviously not restricted to agriculture. However blockchain solutions have their own limitations. Principal among these are the need to ensure a tight coupling between the product and its digital representation, and the ongoing need for some form of reputable local certification system in the first mile to, for example, establish the fact of ethical practices. The inevitable mixing of products and supply chains is another factor complicating easy adoption and implementation. For these reasons current proofs of concept tend to be high value and low volume, and often stimulated by strong social motivations of their founders. Blockchains can only be part of a wider solution, and may remain limited to niche markets where establishing provenance can command higher returns.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Phil Godsiff, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-07-18T20:18:54Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eCompanies around the world are exploring blockchain, the technology underpinning digital currency bitcoin.

You had to wire the money through a mainstream financial service, like Western Union or a bank. That meant paying high fees and waiting up to several days for the money to arrive. A radically new option arose in 2009 with the introduction of bitcoin. Bitcoin makes it possible to transfer value between two individuals anywhere in the world quickly and at minimal cost. It is often called a “cryptocurrency,” as it is purely digital and uses cryptography to protect against counterfeiting. The software that executes this cryptography runs simultaneously on computers around the world. Even if one or more of these computers is misused in an attempt to corrupt the bitcoin network (such as to steal money), the collective action of the others ensures the integrity of the system as a whole. Its distributed nature also enables bitcoin to process transactions without the fees, antiquated networks and (for better or worse) the rules governing intermediaries like banks and wire services. Bitcoin’s exciting history and social impact have fired imaginations. The aggregate market value of all issued bitcoins today is roughly US$10 billion. The computing devices that maintain its blockchain are geographically dispersed and owned by thousands of different individuals, so the bitcoin network has no single owner or point of control. Even its creator remains a mystery (despite many efforts to unmask her, him or them). Bitcoin’s lack of government regulation made it attractive to black markets and malware writers. Although the core system is well-secured, people who own bitcoins have experienced a litany of heists and fraud. Even more than the currency itself, though, what has drawn the world’s attention are the unprecedented reliability and security of bitcoin’s underlying transaction system, called a blockchain. Researchers, entrepreneurs, and developers believe that blockchains will solve a stunning array of problems, such as stabilization of financial systems, identification of stateless persons, establishing title to real estate and media, and efficiently managing supply chains. Despite its richly varied applications, a blockchain such as bitcoin’s aims to realize a simple goal. Abstractly, it can be viewed as creating a kind of public bulletin board, often called a “distributed ledger.” This ledger is public. Anyone – plebeian or plutocrat, baker or banker – can read it. And anyone can write valid data to it. Specifically, in bitcoin, any owner of money can add a transaction to the ledger that transfers some of her money to someone else. The bitcoin network makes sure that the ledger includes only authorized transactions, meaning those digitally signed by the owners of the money being transferred. The key feature of blockchains is that new data may be written at any time, but can never be changed or erased. At first glance, this etched-in-stone rule seems a needless design restriction. But it gives rise to a permanent, ever-growing transactional history that creates strong transparency and accountability. For example, the bitcoin blockchain contains a record of every transaction in the system since its birth. This feature makes it possible to prevent account holders from reneging on transactions, even if their identities remain anonymous. Once in the ledger, a transaction is undeniable. The indelible nature of the ledger is much more powerful and general, though, allowing blockchains to support applications well beyond bitcoin. Consider, for example, the management of title to a piece of land or property. Property registries in many parts of the world today are fragmented, incomplete, poorly maintained, and difficult to access. The legal uncertainty surrounding ownership of property is a major impediment to growth in developing economies. Were property titles authoritatively and publicly recorded on a blockchain, anyone could learn instantly who has title to a piece of property. Even legitimate anonymous ownership – as through a private trust – could be recorded on a blockchain. Such transparency would help resolve legal ambiguity and shed light on malfeasance. Advocates envision similar benefits in blockchain recording of media rights – such as rights to use images or music – identity documents and shipping manifests. In addition, the decentralized nature of the database provides resilience not just to technical failures, but also to political ones – failed states, corruption and graft. Blockchains can be enhanced to support not just transactions, but also pieces of code known as smart contracts. A smart contract is a program that controls assets on the blockchain – anything from cryptocurrency to media rights – in ways that guarantee predictable behavior. A smart contract may be viewed as playing the role of a trusted third party: Whatever task it is programmed to do, it will carry out faithfully. Suppose for example that a user wishes to auction off a piece of land for which her rights are represented on a blockchain. She could hire an auctioneer, or use an online auction site. But that would require her and her potential customers to trust, without proof, that the auctioneer conducts the auction honestly. To achieve greater transparency, the user could instead create a smart contract that executes the auction automatically. She would program the smart contract with the ability to deliver the item to be sold and with rules about minimum bids and bidding deadlines. She would also specify what the smart contract is to do at the end of the auction: send the winning bid amount from the winner to the seller’s account and transfer the land title to the winner. Because the blockchain is publicly visible, anyone with suitable expertise could check that the code in the smart contract implements a fair and valid auction. Auction participants would only need to trust the correctness of the code. They wouldn’t need to rely on an auctioneer to run the auction honestly – and as an added benefit, they also wouldn’t need to pay high auctioneer fees. Behind this compelling vision lurk many technical challenges. The transparency and accountability of a fully public ledger have many benefits, but are at odds with confidentiality. Suppose the seller mentioned above wanted to conduct a sealed-bid auction or conceal the winning bid amount? How could she do this on a blockchain that everyone can read? Achieving both transparency and confidentiality on blockchains is in fact possible, but requires new techniques under development by researchers. Another challenge is ensuring that smart contracts correctly reflect user intent. A lawyer, arbiter or court can remedy defects or address unforeseen circumstances in written contracts. Smart contracts, though, are expressly designed as unalterable code. This inflexibility avoids ambiguity and cheating and ensures trustworthy execution, but it can also cause brittleness. An excellent example was the recent theft of around $55 million in cryptocurrency from a smart contract. The thief exploited a software bug, and the smart contract creators couldn’t fix it once the contract was running. Bitcoin is a proof of concept of the viability of blockchains. As researchers and developers overcome the technical challenges of smart contracts and other blockchain innovations, marveling at money flying across the Atlantic will someday seem quaint.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ari Juels, Ittay Eyal, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-07-18T10:17:17Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIn 2008, short of sending a suitcase full of cash, there was essentially just one way for an individual to send money between, say, the United States and Europe.

In this Blockchain unleashed series, we investigate the many possible use cases for the blockchain, from the novel to the transformative. Blockchain technology is being developed in everything from financial technology companies to the GLAM industries. Some, such as Backfeed, are using blockchain for decentralised coordination through smart contracts. As the recent attack on the DAO has revealed, blockchain-based innovations can also create social harm by being difficult to fix when things go wrong. While it is likely that platforms such as Ethereum will evolve to deal with these risks, a further consideration is who will reap the benefits of blockchain applications in the long term. To understand that, we need to consider the infrastructures on which these technologies are run and accessed, not just the code. Originally developed to support bitcoin, Blockchain is essentially a public ledger. It’s like a giant spreadsheet for recording assets, which can be utilised for any form of exchange and which no individual entity controls. By providing a secure and distributed means of authentication and recording, Blockchain eliminates the need for intermediaries that pull information to verify transactions. The technology can therefore be used for autonomous machine-to-machine communications, taking the Internet of Things and the sharing economy to the next level (for instance, cars that manage their own rental and re-fuelling). The benefits of blockchain technology for developing economies have so far only been discussed in terms of remittance payments and providing an alternative currency in unstable fiscal environments. However it could also be applied in sharing economies that are present in some developing communities, just like the one I observed during field work in the Kedaya Telang Usan area in Sarawak, Malaysia. In a sharing economy, people make use of their excess assets by charging others to access them – houses for holiday accommodation, garages for storage, cars (and their drivers) for rides. During British colonial rule, the Orang Ulu began to grow crops for profit not just for subsistence, and out of this came the kinds of payment for services that characterise the sharing economy. One of my fellow researchers, Simpson Njock, a Kenyah man from the region, said it was once the case that you had to share a wild boar, but now if someone asks you for some of your wild boar you say to them “how much?” Until logging roads were built a decade ago, it would take the Orang Ulu days to get to their kampung (village) by longboat. As only a small number of people in each kampung own a car, the Orang Ulu developed a ride-sharing system, whereby you pay someone with a ute to take you where you need to go - a lot like ride sharing service Uber but without the internet platform. In another example, the house of the headman may include rooms for those on their way upriver. These systems have also developed in a region where many fall into the unbanked category (those without bank accounts or credit) and live a largely subsistence lifestyle, but where money is required for schooling, medical treatment, and home maintenance. Many make that money from handicrafts or food they have grown on their padi farms. Some goods are bartered rather than sold. Using technology in development projects has been controversial, with research showing some projects reinforce exploitative economic and political hierarchies whilst claiming to encourage entrepreneurship from the so-called “bottom of the pyramid”. Blockchain will not necessarily resolve the complexities of the development industry, but it might assist the coordination of existing systems, making them more efficient, rather than imposing different ones. For instance, it could make possible a shift from forest industries, such as logging and oil palm, to economies that rely on a healthy forest, where natural heritage and culture are valued rather than diminished. In the nearby Bario region, a technology project has helped facilitate local tourism since 1998, primarily through websites that promote home stays. Technology is already changing life in remote Sarawak, enabling people to coordinate car rides and handicraft sales through instant messaging and social media. Emerging peer-to-peer platforms could be of significant further economic benefit through more efficient and automated systems, without the high transaction costs or standards required by commercial platforms. The most interesting and important blockchain transformations could be those built for economies that have been underserved by established financial institutions and classified as ‘informal’. Current blockchain debates are focused on the conflicts between law and automated governance. We need to remember that there are many spheres of interaction that have not be well served by markets, regulations and institutions, which could benefit from technologies that reduce the need to interact with them while providing simple, trusted transactions. Such possibilities are a long way off, and not just because of bugs in the code. For these technologies to run, there must be reliable connectivity and infrastructure. While some communities have mobile broadband base stations, we found that these are often poorly maintained or suffering from congestion. The possibilities for economic development via blockchain applications will be nothing more than an idealistic and novel concept unless more fundamental digital infrastructure needs are addressed.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ellie Rennie, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-07-17T20:05:49Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eCompanies around the world are exploring blockchain, the technology underpinning digital currency bitcoin.

In this Blockchain unleashed series, we investigate the many possible use cases for the blockchain, from the novel to the transformative. Recently dubbed “the biggest crowdfunding project ever”, the decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) is essentially an investment fund without humans making the investment decisions. Established in April 2016, the DAO draws from the notion of a human-led organisation, but unlike traditional companies, is automated. Formalised governance rules are enforced through software, not a board of directors. No one body owns or controls the DAO, and essentially everyone can take part. More than 10,000 have done so already, raising more than US$150 million for the fund. The DAO is not a physical entity, instead transactions and balances are kept on a public ledger which is sustained by enormous amounts of computing power coupled with the use of algorithms. Instead of a hierarchical management structure managed and regulated by humans, the DAO is typified by the use of blockchain technology which involves people interacting with each other according to a protocol specified in code. Blockchain technology is based on Bitcoin protocol, digital open-source currency which was generated in 2009. With all of this technology working towards an automated entity, the DAO brings into question what the organisation of the future will look like. This question is especially prominent now, with the recent hacking attack on the DAO leading some to wonder how the DAO will respond in restoring its finances and reputation. The DAO clearly demonstrates the evolution of a revolutionary new type of firm. This raises the question of the role of management, in particular the CEO. If the majority of tasks can and will be performed by algorithms, supported by code, will conventional CEOs become a thing of the past? Could CEOs really become an endangered species? Algorithmic mathematical technology has the potential to fundamentally change the way we do business, and has been flagged as the most prominent sweeping change since the industrial revolution. Still very much in its infancy, the application of algorithmic technology within business has however begun to take hold, and is most visible so far in the retailing sector. Amazon, for example, uses algorithms to refine the accuracy of recommendations by predicting customer preferences. The power of algorithms is challenging and altering tried and true business models. It’s creating new opportunities for businesses to interact with consumers in much more personalised ways than ever before. Algorithmic technology and machine-to-machine intervention may also help managers or CEOs to increase their capability and capacity and the speed of their decisions. Algorithmic-based technology will be able take care of mundane and repetitive work – such as data entry or financial management, allowing entrepreneurs to be more creative and entrepreneurial. More time could potentially be available for entrepreneurs to focus on tasks that are aligned with big picture and forward-thinking, innovation and creativity. Imagine a CEO that could bridge international work days, across country markets, working 24 hours a day. Or one that could handle cross-cultural sensitivities including communicating and translating in foreign markets. How about a CFO that could avoid the computation errors that are more than likely to arise with any human involvement. The potential use of algorithms to support business functions has seldom been explored or discussed, however there is enormous potential for businesses that seize the opportunity. But when is replacing human CEOs with an algorithm going a step too far? An algorithm, by its very nature, does not have morals, feelings, or anything other than pure logic based on patterns and projections. Would a CEO algorithm sign off on a plan to test on animals if the resulting product would be cheaper, and thus make more sense profit-wise? Even if the algorithm is being watched by human members of the company, damage can occur quickly in this dynamic environment. Conversely, as with the recent hacking attack, the company response needs to be swift in times of crisis: can an algorithm provide the same level of response as a human? The DAO is certainly not the first to encounter these types of situations. The dangers of algorithms have been well-documented in the media, from hackers teaching a Microsoft chat-bot algorithm to be racist to algorithms that do not follow equitable hiring practices. Of course algorithms are created by imperfect humans, so the burden of ensuring that things do not go awry ultimately lies with us. The involvement of humans is necessary in order to ensure algorithms behave appropriately. But human involvement is also something to be carefully managed. Some, such as Uber drivers, are already working under the direction of an algorithm, which they sometimes find makes unreasonable – though logical – demands. Is this necessarily worse than a human boss? We are now teaching robots morals by having them read fairy stories. If we can program algorithms well, and keep watch over them, then perhaps algorithms may come to make better decisions than a human CEO could. This hinges, however, on our own understanding of what “better” means, and our ability to program our algorithms accordingly. The evolution of decentralised organisations will force many companies to substantially change, or at the very least reconsider the ways in which their businesses are structured and managed. This will require new expertise, skills and capabilities as the use of algorithms for decision-making increases. With the proliferation of algorithms impacting everyday business, it’s important to consider that the end user is in most cases, human. As Simon Hathaway, president and global chief retail officer at advertising agency Cheil Worldwide says: “as we all seek automation in operations, we must not lose sight of the fact that our customers are human.”","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Charmaine Glavas, Kate Letheren, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-07-13T19:40:24Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eCompanies around the world are exploring blockchain, the technology underpinning digital currency bitcoin.

In this Blockchain unleashed series, we investigate the many possible use cases for the blockchain, from the novel to the transformative. Most people agree we do not need to know how a television works to enjoy using one. This is true of many existing and emerging technologies. Most of us happily drive cars, use mobile phones and send emails without knowing how they work. With this in mind, here is a tech-free user guide to the blockchain - the technology infrastructure behind bitcoin, and many other emerging platforms. What does the blockchain do? The blockchain is software that stores and transfers value or data across the internet. What can I store and transfer using the blockchain? To use the blockchain, you will need to set up an account or address (a virtual wallet). At this time, the most popular use for the blockchain is to make micro-payments with virtual currencies. For example, you can buy bitcoin with real money and then spend it on the internet using the blockchain. Authorising a payment using the blockchain is similar to using a credit card to buy something online. Instead of a 16-digit credit card number, you provide the vendor with a unique string of numbers and letters generated for each transaction. With this unique identifier, the blockchain can verify and authenticate the transaction. Can I use the blockchain to transfer real money? Not yet. Some companies are using the blockchain to make international financial transfers, but most of these transactions are enabled by bitcoin or other digital currencies. Exchanging real money for bitcoin incurs fees for the sender, but the benefit is speed, security and convenience. How is transferring value or virtual currency on the blockchain different from transferring money from my bank account? Depending on the amount and the destination, when you transfer money from your bank account, your bank will limit the amount you can transfer. Most banks impose daily limits for all transactions. When you use virtual money on the blockchain, there are no limits. When you transfer value or currency from your bank account to an account with a different bank or other financial institution, the transfer can take days. When you use the blockchain, the transfer is immediate. If a transfer from your bank account puts your account into debit, your bank will charge you a fee. The blockchain will not allow a transfer in excess of your balance and so your virtual wallet will never be in debit. How is storing value using the blockchain different from keeping my money in a bank account? Bank accounts and credit cards are vulnerable to attack from fraudsters and hackers. The blockchain is a more secure way to store and transfer funds, particularly if you keep a modest value in your virtual wallet. Hacking the blockchain is difficult, time-consuming and expensive. No one breaks into Fort Knox for just $500. Of course, value stored on the blockchain will not earn you interest or improve your credit rating; and the blockchain will not lend you money to buy a house or car. The blockchain does not replace your bank, but very soon banks will be using the blockchain too. How is transferring data using the blockchain different to attaching a file to an email? Unlike emails with attachments, the blockchain enables the immediate transfer of data no matter how big the file. Also, there is less danger of spam or viruses and no need for firewalls or junk folders. How is storing data using the blockchain different to storing my files on my computer? If you lose or break your computer or if it is attacked by a hacker or virus, you could lose that data. The blockchain resides in the cloud. Like any web-based storage, you just need your username and password to access your data from anywhere anytime. What else can I use the blockchain for? Very soon the blockchain will be used for online transactions. It will enable smart contracts, crowdfunding and auctions. It will verify the provenance of artworks and diamonds; transfer title to real estate and other assets; and store information about people, products and property. Apps for music distribution, sports betting and a new type of financial auditing are also being tested. Why is the blockchain described as “riskless”? The blockchain verifies and authenticates both ends of each transaction. It will not release a purchaser’s funds until it has checked that the vendor will deliver as promised. Is the blockchain safe? Standards and regulations are needed so that the technology can be readily used across different organisations, industries and jurisdictions. Blockchains can be private (like an email) or public (like Facebook), so users need to know which type is being operated before joining a new blockchain. My tips for safe use of the blockchain are: keep your virtual wallet details secure; do not let an unknown third party hold virtual currency or data for you; and do not provide your online banking details to anyone. As seen in a recent attack on a crowdfunding project, the blockchain is at its most vulnerable when significant value is stored in a single address. The blockchain may be trustworthy, but the people on it might not be.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Philippa Ryan, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-07-12T19:45:43Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eCompanies around the world are exploring blockchain, the technology underpinning digital currency bitcoin.

The electronic system, Property Exchange Australia or PEXA, set up by financial institutions and a number of state governments, changes conveyancing of real estate in a way not seen since the introduction of title by registration in the mid-1800s. What this transition achieves is a remote electronic based system for the buying and selling of land. The new process from contract to settlement can be paperless. The only physical aspect of the transaction involved the vendor moving out, the purchaser moving in, and the stakeholders, such as mortgagees and conveyancing agents entering keystrokes on a remotely maintained work space. Once the parties enter into a contract for the sale of real estate, an online work space is created through PEXA, whereby relevant information is populated by all stakeholders who retain password verified access to the site. Instead of the buyer and seller signing forms to be lodged at land titles offices, agents on behalf of these parties (such as conveyancing agents) will digitally sign on their behalf. Overseeing this is the Australian Registrars National Electronic Conveyancing Council a regulatory agency providing guidance and oversight through operating and participation rules. These rules govern the relationship between the PEXA operator and the land title registry, as well as the electronic lodgement operator and direct participants such as conveyancing agents and financial institutions. At the moment only conveyancing agents and other subscribers such as financial institutions can lodge online and have direct access to PEXA. To facilitate the use of the system, some land contracts now require that the conveyancing be done through PEXA. In the foreseeable future its unlikely that the consumers will be able to use PEXA themselves. The cost and impediments to obtaining access are only feasible for someone engaging in transactions on a routine basis. In theory, the system should reduce costs and unintentional errors through embedding checks in the process of lodging these forms. Currently the paper-based system is arguably more prone to human error, though computer systems depend greatly on the security that sits behind them and the mistakes potentially made by the keystroke operators. From the point of the real estate industry, it increases productivity and can provide simpler and easier access to real-time data in relation to the property and to the state of the transaction. Because money is transferred electronically within moments of the settlement occurring, it reduces the current gap that occurs between settlement and registration within paper-based systems. The new system should streamline the complex legal problems that can sometimes occur in transactions. It should help resolve a category of irreconcilable legal decisions around the priority between two unregistered interests, where there’s one interest in a property and a second interest is also created in the period between settlement and registration. At the moment, judicial bodies resolve these on a case by case basis, but with PEXA reducing the gap between settlement and registration, the opportunity for these sorts of conflicts should disappear. The first sale using PEXA has already occurred with the five largest states already using the system. But with any development comes risks. At its heart conveyancing requires that a purchaser be able to identify the vendor, verify that the vendor is indeed the owner of the land, and finally, confirm that this vendor has the right to deal with that land and is not constrained by others (such as a mortgagee). These requirements are key to preventing identity fraud. PEXA’s response has been to impose significant identity verification requirements that can exceed the well-known 100 point requirements to open a bank account. Purchases by overseas parties have had significantly greater requirements for identity verification imposed upon them. However identity fraud will continue to pose a threat in the PEXA environment if users are not vigilant in complying with these enhanced identity requirements. There may also be risks in the movement of funds at settlement. Because this occurs electronically, the capacity to cancel cheques paid in settlement before these cheques are cashed will disappear. The risk of a person accessing the computer system fraudulently and altering multiple records is palpable. At its heart, what this new era does is reallocate risk. Lawyers, conveyancing agents, mortgagees, assurance funds and land title registries have for close to 150 years of private law jurisprudence on title by registration developed a complex series of rules governing this allocation. The new dawn of electronic conveyancing will inevitably provoke new jurisprudence with the stakeholders jousting for position. Whoever emerges with the least amount of risk attached to them will be a powerful player in this new paperless property market.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Lynden Griggs, Rouhshi Low, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-07-12T06:05:34Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003ePaperless house sales are now a reality but it might be some time before we’ll all be buying and selling property online.

Falling CD sales, illegal downloads, the low payments from legal music streaming platforms, and a shift towards buying single tracks rather than whole albums all play their part. Recently, a number of music industry projects have turned to a particular technology as a possible solution to these problems. These include Mycelia, launched by singer, songwriter and producer Imogen Heap, and Dot Blockchain Music, launched by PledgeMusic founder Benji Rogers. Then there’s Ujo Music, Blokur, Aurovine, Resonate, Peertracks, Stem and Bittunes, which already claims users in 70 countries. What links these projects is that they all are based on blockchain. Blockchain is the software that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Comprised of blocks of data cryptographically chained together in chronological order, it has two key features. It is immutable: data cannot be modified. And it is distributed rather than centralised: many exact copies are maintained independently of each other. Blockchain technology has been touted as the answer to problems facing industries as diverse as banking, the diamond trade, online gambling and fashion – even how we govern society. How might it help musicians? The first problem facing musicians comes down to the fact that no comprehensive database of music copyright ownership exists. There are several databases, but none features every track in existence, and when a track appears in more than one database the details don’t always match up. The blockchain, as Vinay Gupta put it in a recent talk, is both database and network. If music copyright information were stored on the blockchain, via a cryptographic digital fingerprint (like a barcode), then up-to-date information could be accessible to all users, rather than being held by particular gatekeepers. The second problem is payments. Listeners can access tracks immediately with a click, yet according to a Rethink Music report it can take years for royalties to reach those responsible for making the music. Smart contracts, implemented on the blockchain via software, could split royalties in agreed proportions as soon as a track is downloaded or streamed. Such micropayments might not be feasible with current systems, but systems built around using cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin could facilitate payments in fractions of pennies. Third, the mechanism by which royalties are calculated and paid is often opaque. Some revenue ends up in a “black box” beyond the reach of the artists and songwriters to whom it rightly belongs. In a culture of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, artists (or their managers) cannot properly audit their payments if they are not certain how much they are due. The final issue is cash, required upfront to help musicians create new music. It’s often said that artists no longer need record labels, but funds are required to compete commercially – and that still usually means the backing of a substantial label, especially one of the three remaining “majors”: Sony, Universal and Warner. The transparency offered by blockchain technology could help attract new funders, including investors currently put off by the difficulty of seeing a clear route to profitability for musicians. It could also see the emergence of “artist accelerators” similar to those available for tech start-ups, where early support is rewarded by a stake in future income, monitored and paid automatically via smart contracts. The same transparency and traceability could encourage crowdfunding, with artists issuing shares to be cashed in against future earnings. This is new technology and new terrain. Away from the music industry, another blockchain-related project called The DAO (a “decentralised autonomous organisation”) crowdsourced millions of dollars of funding, only for the site to be hacked and the money stolen. Bitcoin survived a similar crisis when millions were stolen during the Mt Gox scandal, so while this won’t spell the end for blockchain technology it is a reminder of the risk, as well as the potential. Blockchain has the support of banks and even some governments, and there has been significant investment in a number of industries, including music: Stem, a company that tracks and organises revenue from streaming platforms, raised a reported US$4.5m earlier this year. Certainly some claims made of blockchain are inflated, but blockchain does have the potential to transform the music industry. We have to consider, though, whether this is the right way of looking at it. For one thing, there isn’t a single music industry – sometimes, wrongly, assumed to be synonymous with the record industry – but multiple music industries. Blockchain technology would not necessarily affect them all in the same way. In any case, the fact that change could happen is no guarantee that it will. There are considerable barriers to overcome, from issues with the cryptocurrencies themselves to concerns over the integrity of the data, as well as the resistance of industry figures who perceive this new technology as a threat. Perhaps we should not ask whether blockchain technology has the capacity to change the music industry (singular). Instead, we should ask whether the will to change exists and, if so, where; how the considerable barriers to adoption might be overcome; and what the effects, both positive and negative, might be on a number of music industries. With my research colleagues at Middlesex University, in a report and at a panel discussion in London, these are the questions we’re asking. But it’s only the start.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Marcus O\u0027Dair, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-07-07T08:21:18Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIn the decade and a half since Napster, it’s got harder for musicians to make a living, at least from recorded music.

Something similar is happening right now, and it could do for organisations and their governance what the internet did for information and its distribution. The DAO is a wildly ambitious, risky and radical new entity that has already raised more than US$29 million in a little over a week. When it reaches the end of the funding phase on May 28, it will begin contracting blockchain-based start-ups to create innovative technologies. The extraordinary thing about The DAO is that no single entity owns it, and it has no conventional management structure or board of directors. How can an investment fund work without management oversight? In 2013, a Russian-Canadian genius called Vitalik Buterin, proposed to do for managers and directors what the industrial and robotics revolutions did for factory workers: replace them with technology. Buterin is the co-creator of Ethereum, a platform that, among other things, aims to automate management through code: creating rules that determine what can be done within an organisation through smart contracts. Buterin wonders: […] what if, with the power of modern information technology, we can encode the mission statement into code; that is, create an inviolable contract that generates revenue, pays people to perform some function, and finds hardware for itself to run on, all without any need for top-down human direction? These code-made organisations are called “distributed autonomous organisations” (DAO). A DAO is a cryptographic technology that relies on multiparty secure computation – the same technology used by Bitcoin – to ensure no attacker can subvert it. In a surge of spectacular self-conceit, “The DAO” is the name given to the first major DAO to launch on the Ethereum platform. For another two weeks, anyone can trade Ethereum’s altcoins, Ether (ETH or Ξ, the crypto tokens of Ethereum), for tokens on The DAO (Ð). Once the creation phase is complete, anyone with a project can pitch to and receive investment from The DAO. Only those who own DAO tokens will be able to vote on which projects are funded by The DAO, and receive rewards if those projects make a return. It all sounds like science fiction, a spontaneous entity evolving out of something named after a nebulous gaseous material (thin air?), which claims to be immutable and incorruptible. The significance of this DAO – The DAO – is that its creators have done the hard work in coming up with a rulebook and its underlying code that others can copy, and thereby use to set up other DAOs. This standard DAO framework was created by Slock.it, an Internet of Things company that plans to propose more than one project to The DAO when it is formed. The rules are designed to ensure no one interest can take over a DAO. For example, token holders can withdraw their stake if they disagree with a decision, while keeping their stake in any project that The DAO took when they were invested, and continuing to earn a return from those that make profits. The DAO’s white paper, as well as Slock.it’s proposal are attracting significant attention in crypto currency forums. For social scientists like us, The DAO is perhaps one of the purest experiments in microeconomic theory, particularly of contracts, digital organisations and mechanism design. And it is likely to produce significant insights into how innovation occurs. The thinkers behind Ethereum and The DAO are also investigating radical new governance models that might be implemented using blockchain, including Futarchy, which uses prediction markets to choose between competing policies. One immediate area to watch will be how the token-holders on The DAO behave. Will all token-holders pay sufficient attention to responsibly vote? Or will it fall victim to crowd mentality? Does having a financial stake mean that voters are more likely to do due diligence, as Stephan Tual, COO of Slock.it suggests? Needless to say, like all activities at the frontiers, The DAO will be highly risky as an investment, and not just because nine in ten start-ups fail. The DAO is only as good as the code it is made from. As recent disputes in the bitcoin community have demonstrated, code is susceptible to the human error and frailty of those who made it. Another dimension that no one is talking about is the lack of diversity of the curator team (a group intended to do due diligence on contracts), when research shows that gender and cultural diversity on boards is a good thing. If The DAO fails, it may be because it did not work hard enough to involve a broader group of thinkers in its design. The DAO reflects a Silicon Valley culture where attracting venture capital for technology start-ups is equated with democracy and seen as the height of innovation. A system in which only those who buy tokens can vote is not an experiment in democracy, but in plutocracy. Yet the appeal of Ethereum is that it provides a platform for those who don’t want to build a private blockchain to create, organise and govern. This opens blockchain technology up to a world far beyond helping big financial corporations and markets achieve efficiency gains. It is possible that the innovations that prove the most transformative will actually be those parts of our social fabric that are currently not reaching their full potential because no effective distributed coordination mechanism exists. An interesting example is scholarly publishing. In a recent paper with some other co-authors, we have suggested a new way to move scholarly publishing on to the blockchain by reinventing a journal as a DAO. To paraphrase US congressman Barney Frank, governance is the name for the things we do together. If DAOs can remove some of the messier aspects of governance, we might be able to do a whole lot more.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Ellie Rennie, Jason Potts, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-05-10T20:19:12Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eFor many people, the birth of the internet happened on August 9, 1995, when \u003ca href\u003d\"http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/07/25/8266639/index.htm\"\u003eNetscape\u003c/a\u003e went stratospherically public.

Blockchains can be used for a wide variety of applications, such as tracking ownership or the provenance of documents, digital assets, physical assets or voting rights. Blockchain technology was popularised by the Bitcoin digital currency system. But, essentially, a blockchain is just a special kind of database. The Bitcoin blockchain stores cryptographically signed records of financial transfers, but blockchain systems can store any kind of data. Blockchains can also store and run computer code called “smart contracts”. What makes a blockchain system special is that it doesn’t run on just one computer like a regular database. Rather, many distributed processing nodes collaborate to run it. There can be a full copy of the database on every node, and the system encourages all those nodes to establish a consensus about its contents. This boosts our confidence in the database and its contents. It’s difficult, if not impossible, to meddle with the database without others finding out and correcting it. The global consensus among the nodes about the integrity and contents of the distributed database is why it’s often called a “distributed ledger”. In our society, we normally rely on trusted third parties, such as lawyers, courts, banks and governments to process and keep authoritative records about commercial transactions. These transactions aren’t just about financial transfers, but also include the creation or transfer of physical assets, shareholdings, certifications, digital rights, intellectual property or even votes. These third parties are trusted because we rely on them. If they fail or lie, we suffer. We tend to trust the third parties for reasons that are external to the database; lawyers are accredited; votes are counted by independent monitors; and courts run to established laws for matters such as oversight and the possibility of appeal. Blockchains are interesting because the integrity of the contents of the distributed ledger does not rely on any specific individual or organisation. So, rather than relying on trusted third-party organisations to facilitate these commercial transactions, we might instead rely on a trusted blockchain system. This means blockchains give us new opportunities to rethink how parts of our society work. Innovation here might reduce friction in the economy, or create new kinds of services and ways of doing business with each other. Whether or not blockchain systems are trustworthy is an interesting question. The reasons for believing that blockchain systems won’t fail or lie would be based on our understanding of the underlying software technologies. It also depends on our understanding of market incentives that influence behaviour of the many distributed processing nodes that run blockchains. However, blockchain technologies are still new in the scheme of things, and the community is still discovering their risks, limitations and potential economic and social impact. Because blockchain technology is so new, it’s difficult to predict exactly how they will end up being used. This is why we at Data61 in CSIRO are exploring new ways blockchains can be used across industries. To understand the economic and societal opportunities presented by blockchain technology, we also need to understand its technological risks and limitations. At Data61, we plan to identify, develop and evaluate some “proof of concept” systems using blockchains to investigate them. A recent UK government report on blockchain technologies provides a good overview and examples of the use of blockchain. One of these is Everledger, a company founded by Australian woman Leanne Kemp. Everledger uses a blockchain to record information about the provenance and ownership of individual diamonds and other valuables. Here, rather than the blockchain recording transfers of digital currency, it records transfers of ownership of identified physical assets. This globally accessible provenance trail could reduce fraud and theft, and enable new or improved kinds of insurance and finance services. The same general idea could be used for any supply chain, such as in retail, agriculture or pharmaceuticals. The drivers for improving assurance of supply chain quality vary in different industries. It could be brand reputation in retail, or safety in pharmaceuticals, or a combination in agriculture. It is worth observing that blockchains don’t totally do away with the need for trusted third parties. A blockchain is only a digital record, but we need others to determine if those records actually match the corresponding physical assets in the real world. Everledger relies on major diamond certification companies to measure identifying information about individual diamonds. These measurements can be independently cross-checked. But in some sense, companies such as these become trusted third parties for this blockchain-based system. One can imagine the adoption of blockchain technologies creating opportunities for new kinds of trusted third-party organisations. Underlying all of these applications is the need for data integrity, which is the key security property for commercial systems, and the primary property for blockchain technologies. For financial transactions, data integrity means you can’t spend money you don’t have, and you can’t spend money twice. For physical supply chains, this means you can’t fraudulently acquire record of ownership for an asset. However, other security properties, such as privacy and confidentiality, are also important in many application areas. To achieve confidentiality, other mechanisms such as cryptography must be used in conjunction with the blockchain. Part of our software architecture research at Data61 is to seek to understand how design choices for software-based systems affect tradeoffs for qualities including security (integrity, confidentiality, privacy), performance (latency, throughput and scalability), and others. Good design choices can control risks to achieving these qualities, and this is part of what is evaluated in our research using proof-of-concept systems. Computer programs are a special kind of data and so can be stored in a database. That means we can store programs in the distributed ledger of a blockchain system, and execute those programs while later transactions are being processed. In the Ethereum blockchain, these programs can be highly complex. These programs are normally called “smart contracts”. Smart contracts can carry value, and can conditionally transfer that value according to complex business conditions based on the latest state of the distributed ledger. This means blockchain systems can do more than store information about commercial transactions; they can also process commercial transactions too. This greatly expands the opportunities for using blockchain systems. Although smart contracts are often thought of as standing for self-executing legal contracts, they are written in a general purpose programming language and can be used to implement a wide range of business logic. Can smart contracts actually stand as legal contracts? This is an interesting question. For legal contracts to be enforceable, they need to be understandable by reasonable persons. Can the bytecode of a program stored on a blockchain really be understood by any human? Perhaps only obsessive hobbyists might be able to develop that skill! Another thread of research in Data61 is investigating new ways of representing and analysing smart contracts, using recent results from legal informatics. Blockchain technology is still in its infancy. There are a wide range of plausible future scenarios for their future impact, ranging from efficiency improvements for commercial transactions through to a complete reinvention of the economy. As with any disruptive technology, understanding the plausible, possible and probable impacts – the opportunities and risks – will be vital for wise policy, strategy, and design choices by Australian governments and companies.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Mark Staples, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-05-09T20:04:28Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eBlockchain technology is not just useful for creating \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/finally-interesting-uses-for-the-blockchain-that-go-beyond-bitcoin-51213\"\u003edigital currencies\u003c/a\u003e such as Bitcoin or developing new \u003ca href\u003d\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_technology\"\u003efinancial technologies\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlockchains can be used for a wide variety of applications, such as tracking ownership or the provenance of documents, digital assets, physical assets or voting rights.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBlockchain technology was popularised by the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/au/topics/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e digital currency system.

Well, that’s what’s soon going to happen to those who make money from Bitcoin mining, the process of earning the online currency Bitcoin. The current expected date for this change is 11 July 2016. Many see this as the day when Bitcoin prices will rocket and when Bitcoin owners could make a great deal of money. Others see it as the start of a Bitcoin crash. At present no one quite knows which way it will go. Bitcoin was created in 2009 by someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto, borrowing from a whole lot of research methods. It is a cryptocurrency, meaning it uses digital encryption techniques to create bitcoins and secure financial transactions. It doesn’t need a central government or organisation to regulate it, nor a broker to manage payments. Conventional currencies usually have a central bank that creates money and controls its supply. Bitcoin is instead created when individuals “mine” for it by using their computers to perform complex calculations through special software. The algorithm behind Bitcoin is designed to limit the number of bitcoins that can ever be created. All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public database known as a blockchain. Every time someone mines for Bitcoin, it is recorded with a new block that is transmitted to every Bitcoin app across the network, like a bank updating its online records. Unlike with traditional currencies, which can have their money supply reduced by central banks to prevent too much inflation, a bitcoin will stay in circulation forever unless it is accidentally deleted (which should be rare). An over supply of any currency can weaken its value so economists try to carefully balance the supply of cash with the demand. Without a central bank to do this, Bitcoin has an absolute limit built into the system. There are currently around 15.5 million bitcoins in circulation out of a possible maximum of 21 million. This means that around 73% of all the bitcoins that will ever be created are already in circulation. In order to put off the day when there is no Bitcoin left to be mined, mining becomes more difficult as time goes on. The system is also designed to halve the value of what you earn from mining on a specific date. This is expected to be on 11 July 2016, based on the number of new transactions for bitcoins and the estimated rewards for creating the new ledger entries. Many believe that this halving could have a strong effect on the value of Bitcoin as a whole. If lots of people decide it is no longer worth mining Bitcoin and give up on the system, it could cause the currency to lose its value and start a crash. But if it just helps to limit the supply of Bitcoin while demand stays the same, its value will increase. What seems most likely is that Bitcoin mining will become increasingly centralised, carried out by a few big organised mining groups comprising companies and multiple users pooling their resources, while individual miners exit the market. More computing power will be needed to produce the same value of Bitcoin and the bigger pools will be more likely to bare the cost of this while small miners may decide it is no longer economically viable. Currently, users in China make up more than half of the Bitcoin mining industry, with AntPool and DiscusFish/P2Pool each covering around 17% of the market and BTC China Pool taking another 14%. The problem is that a more centralised mining network will be open to attack because there are fewer users to go after. Hacking, extortion or even failures in critical infrastructure could bring down large swathes of the mining market in one move. No one knows for sure what will happen and the answer may even be nothing at all. The price of another cryptocurrency, Litecoin, has remained untouched after its recent halving process. But Litecoin has a considerably smaller scope and limited effects on the global economy. All we know for sure is that we are entering a new phase of discovery for Bitcoin.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Bill Buchanan, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-04-26T13:34:19Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eImagine being told that your wage was going to be cut in half.

It was decided that trusts should not be held to the same standards as companies when it came to making the end owners and beneficiaries publicly known. But now the Panama Papers raise important questions as to whether trusts ought to be more open to public scrutiny. A major reason for this relates to fairness when it comes to paying taxes. Blockchain may provide a solution to this problem, enabling trusts to be more transparent, while ensuring the security of their holdings, too. Trusts are often highly complex legal arrangements; but they tend to work on the same fundamental basis. First conceived many hundreds of years ago, trusts provide a unique method of property management. This uniqueness relates to how wealth is used, and relies on the separation of beneficial ownership from the responsibilities of property management that come with holding legal title. Trusts come in both public and private forms. But their history points to an intimate desire for individuals and families to be able to preserve their wealth and, importantly, pass it on to the next generation. One popular story of how trusts came into being involved the Crusaders of the 11th and 12th centuries who, before leaving to fight in the Middle East, arranged for their land to be tended and managed by a friend in trust (a trustee), on behalf of their family (as beneficiaries). This method of property management and transfer had not previously been recognised by Common Law, which viewed the friend as taking the land absolutely when given charge of it. But Equity, at the time a separate body of law in England and Wales, saw things differently. Based on fairness, Equity developed rules that protected the beneficial interest of the family, while at the same time applying strict fiduciary duties and obligations of trust and loyalty to the friend. This meant that the friend had to look after the property as they had been directed to by the Crusader. Trusts now appear in the form of international commercial investment and trade vehicles; public and private pension funds; and charities, to name but three of the more economically significant. Yet those same foundations and consensual principles between the Crusader, the friend and the family fundamentally remain. This means that trusts conform to traditional privacy models found elsewhere in banking and finance, insofar as they shield from public view the identities of the objects of the trust, as well as the nature of many of the trust’s investments and transactions. It is primarily in regard to where this “shield” is positioned that greater levels of transparency apply on the blockchain. As part of some recent research, I have been considering how blockchain technology (most famous for its role in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin) and other legal-like processes that blockchain facilitates, namely computer programs called “smart contracts”, might be mapped onto trusts law and trusteeship. The key to the question of whether or not blockchain can make trusts more open to the public lies in its fundamental characteristics. Blockchain is essentially a peer-to-peer, distributed ledger system that is able to register information in an immutable way. This could take the form of a register of legal titles to property and beneficial interests, both of which are central to trusts. In this sense, blockchain is a highly reliable witness regarding the information it deals with. Furthermore, as part of the process of adding or registering information on blockchain, that information is announced publicly, providing an entire, transparent history capable of public scrutiny. This does not mean that the blockchain is not private – cultural as well as commercial sensitivity around the privacy of financial information can still be maintained – but it is achieved in a different way. Using two sets of encrypted keys, one public and one private, to validate transactions provides the possibility for secure, private spaces that nevertheless remain in public view. Unlike other methods that maintain privacy of investments and transactions by shielding the entire process from public view, including the identities of individual parties, the blockchain breaks the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. So a trust could take the form of a “private space”. More specifically what is legally defined as a trust could be mapped onto the blockchain processes behind that “private space”. This would create, what I call a “smart trust” – a secure private space, yet one primed for public scrutiny. The potential of the blockchain as described here is something of a “third-way” to existing privacy models. Because trusts come in many shapes and sizes, blockchain “smart trusts” would undeniably suit some types more than others – it is not a case of one size fits all. While trusts have a very long history, the blockchain has a very short one. It will take time to understand if and how the two might work together. But if greater levels of honesty and transparency are needed, the blockchain could provide an answer.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Robert Herian, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-04-08T16:36:15Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eAmid the \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/panama-papers-david-cameron-admits-7711340\"\u003eoutcry\u003c/a\u003e over David Cameron’s tax affairs is the UK prime minister’s intervention in 2013 to block EU transparency rules \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/07/david-cameron-offshore-trusts-eu-tax-crackdown-2013\"\u003eregarding offshore trusts\u003c/a\u003e.

It is primarily in regard to where this “shield” is positioned that greater levels of transparency apply on the blockchain.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSmart contracts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs part of some \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.academia.edu/23964505/Trusteeship_in_a_Post-Trust_World_Property_Trusts_Law_and_the_Blockchain\"\u003erecent research\u003c/a\u003e, I have been considering how blockchain technology (most famous for its role in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin) and other legal-like processes that blockchain facilitates, namely computer programs called \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3035723/app-economy/smart-contracts-could-be-cryptocurrencys-killer-app\"\u003e“smart contracts”\u003c/a\u003e, might be mapped onto trusts law and trusteeship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key to the question of whether or not blockchain can make trusts more open to the public lies in its fundamental characteristics. Blockchain is essentially a peer-to-peer, distributed ledger system that is able to register information in an immutable way. This could take the form of a register of legal titles to property and beneficial interests, both of which are central to trusts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this sense, blockchain is a highly reliable witness regarding the information it deals with. Furthermore, as part of the process of adding or registering information on blockchain, that information is announced publicly, providing an entire, transparent history capable of public scrutiny. This does not mean that the blockchain is not private – cultural as well as commercial sensitivity around the privacy of financial information can still be maintained – but it is achieved in a different way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing two sets of encrypted keys, one public and one private, to validate transactions provides the possibility for secure, private spaces that nevertheless remain in public view. Unlike other methods that maintain privacy of investments and transactions by shielding the entire process from public view, including the identities of individual parties, the blockchain breaks the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo a trust could take the form of a “private space”. More specifically what is legally defined as a trust could be mapped onto the blockchain processes behind that “private space”. This would create, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://www.academia.edu/23964505/Trusteeship_in_a_Post-Trust_World_Property_Trusts_Law_and_the_Blockchain\"\u003ewhat I call a “smart trust”\u003c/a\u003e – a secure private space, yet one primed for public scrutiny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe potential of the blockchain as described here is something of a “third-way” to existing privacy models. Because trusts come in many shapes and sizes, blockchain “smart trusts” would undeniably suit some types more than others – it is not a case of one size fits all. While trusts have a very long history, the blockchain has a very short one. It will take time to understand if and how the two might work together. But if greater levels of honesty and transparency are needed, the blockchain could provide an answer.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"LINK":"https://theconversation.com/how-do-you-mine-bitcoin-and-is-it-still-worth-it-55977","WEBSITE_SOURCE":"The Conversation","IMAGE":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/115441/original/image-20160317-30211-jttq6z.jpg?ixlib\u003drb-1.1.0\u0026q\u003d45\u0026auto\u003dformat\u0026w\u003d240\u0026h\u003d240\u0026fit\u003dcrop","TYPE":"News Article","SUMMARY":"","TITLE":"How do you mine Bitcoin – and is it still worth it?","INTRO":"","DETAILED_CONTENT":"Most people are bamboozled by Bitcoin. It’s shrouded in jargon and geek speak. It borrows physical metaphors from all over the place adding to the confusion. It talks of “coins”, but there are no physical coins. You’ll hear about “miners”, although there is no physical digging or drilling. You’ll also hear made-up words such as “blockchain”. People shake their heads in confusion. The Bitcoin community itself doesn’t even know for sure who invented Bitcoin – I even met one of those who claims to be the big founder. But there are definitions of Bitcoin that even a five-year-old could understand. Bitcoin is an online form of money – each one is currently worth around £290. So, when you read “cryptocurrency”, think digital gold. Think virtual money. You can buy and sell bitcoins or exchange them for goods and services in the physical world, and a small but growing number of businesses you’ve heard of accept them. What takes place is a wholly digital trade – no physical coins or notes exchange hands. If you want to cash out into physical paper money, you’ll probably have to pay a fee. When you send a dollar elsewhere online it is usually a bank that verifies the transaction – and takes a fee for its trouble. Your money is usually in the hands of age-old institutions, many of whom we now mistrust due to decades of corruption and profiteering. But bitcoins can be bought and sold without the need for those organisations. It does this by distributing what used to be our trust in one organisation across a system of many people. Trust is shared out. And here another metaphor borrowed from the physical world comes into play. We ensure that our digital transactions are true and secure by writing them onto a shared, public “ledger”. It’s a big, open, digital book of truth and openness. This ledger is secure and transparent. It isn’t owned by one corporation – it’s shared and kept up to date by the Bitcoin community. And no one charges you for recording your transactions into that ledger. Instead, those who verify the truthfulness and reliability of those transactions are the bitcoin miners. They all compete to verify the bitcoin transactions we all make, and those who succeed, are rewarded with bitcoins. In a way, it’s a game. A clever competition, with high stakes. And the winners not only win bitcoins but also help the whole thing to keep working reliably. A bit like gold, not all bitcoins have yet been discovered. You can buy and sell the ones that are “out there”. On average their value has been rising over the years. The ones yet to be discovered are prospected for by “mining”. When Bitcoin was founded, a finite limit on the number of bitcoins was set, just as there is a finite amount of gold in the physical world. The number was 21m. So far, more than 12m are in circulation. That means that a little fewer than 9m bitcoins are waiting to be discovered. So there are people buying and selling already existing bitcoins. There are people buying and selling goods and services with bitcoins – some of whom exchange them for stuff and money back in the physical world. And then there are people trying to find those increasingly elusive golden tickets – they are mining the undiscovered bitcoins. Anthony Volastro offers a clearer description than most: “‘Mining’ is lingo for the discovery of new bitcoins – just like finding gold. In reality, it’s simply the verification of bitcoin transactions.” And how is that done? “It’s not just one transaction individuals are trying to verify; it’s many. All the transactions are gathered into boxes with a virtual padlock on them – called ‘block chains’ … Miners run software to find the key that will open that padlock.” And when they achieve that, new bitcoins are released as a reward. They are tending the bitcoin garden, playing a kind of functional game – keeping the ledger true and the transactions verified. And it has all been set up so that, by doing that, you can find the unreleased bitcoins and dig them up. In the early days, it was easier to be a miner. There were fewer miners around. As the bitcoin universe has expanded, however, more people are after the finite digital gold, just as in real gold prospecting. People have banded together, created “pools”, sharing ever more expensive hardware, processing capability and even electricity costs that go with finding those precious bitcoin golden nuggets. You see, it isn’t easy to find a bitcoin. The easier days are over. The view on the street now is that “only the biggest centralized miners will profit.” To answer that question, it’s worth hearing from the practitioners – the digital diggers and drillers. “It took ages for me to mine bitcoins because of enormous competent people mining with excellent machines,” said one. Mining has become more competitive and tougher. On discussion boards the advice is not to even attempt it solo. You’ll have to join a “pool” – a group mining together, with some pretty impressive computer kit. (Most are all-night coders in China). You’ll need access to some hardcore hardware and be ready to burn 24/7 electricity. Some now claim that the hold just a few groups have now over the mining operation is a significant barrier to entry for anyone else, especially a rookie. There’s no going it alone. You’ll have to join a “mining pool” and you might just feel like you’ve ended up in another institution. Ironic, eh? There are alternatives to Bitcoin, such as Litecoin or Quarkcoin. Yet these alternative forms of digital money are becoming increasingly competitive as well. And as they evolve and become more competitively turbulent, the rewards diminish as well.. If you are just starting out as a potential miner, you stand a better chance going for one of these newer alternatives. So, unless you are ready to dive in with some serious hardware, investment of time and even real money, bitcoin mining is probably not for the little guy any more, if it ever truly was. Bitcoin is institutionalising around centralised groups and may well be becoming similar to the organisations the whole thing was set up to replace.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Paul Levy, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-03-17T12:41:35Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eMost people \u003ca href\u003d\"http://themerkle.com/what-gives-bitcoin-value/\"\u003eare bamboozled by Bitcoin\u003c/a\u003e.

How much would you pay to get them back? There’s a burgeoning form of cybercrime that hinges on the answers to these questions. You have probably heard of viruses and malware. These dangerous pieces of software can make their way into your computer and wreak havoc. Malware authors are intent on stealing your data and disrupting the proper functioning of your digital devices. Then there is ransomware. This is crafted by cyber-criminals for extorting data from innocent users, and is rapidly becoming a threat to individuals, small business and corporate users alike. Unlike malware, ransomware does not steal data. Rather, it holds it captive by encrypting files and then displaying a ransom note on the victim’s screen. It demands payment for the cyber-extortion and threatens obliteration of data otherwise. While the concept of ransomware has existed for more than 20 years, it wasn’t until 2012 that several key technological advances aligned and allowed it to flourish. Now ransomware has evolved. It combines file encryption, it uses “dark” networks to conceal the attacker, and uses (or, rather, misuses) cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, to prevent law enforcement from tracing the ransom payment back to the attacker’s den. For a small upfront cost and with low risk of getting caught, ransomware developers can net good returns: industry estimates range from 1,000% to 2,000% return on investment. Paying small ransom amounts is quite simply adding to the problem. If you don’t, you lose your data; if you do pay, then you contribute to a worsening problem. Yet for ransomware creators, it’s a lucrative business. Industry figures vary greatly, but reports suggest that developers can earn more than US$1 million per year, which is enough to attract skilled programmers and engineers. There have been many reports of Australian businesses paying ransoms. Even the authorities aren’t safe, with several police departments in the US having paid ransoms in order to recover files. And we’ve even seen reports that FBI experts have advised victims to “just pay the ransom” if they need their data. The biggest concern with ransomware is the rate at which it is adapting to combat security protections. We recently examined the evolution of ransomware and found that ransomware developers are learning from their mistakes in previous versions. Each generation includes new features, and improved attack strategies. We also found that over 80% of recent ransomware strains were using advanced security features that made them difficult to detect, and almost impossible to “crack”. Things don’t look good for end-users; ransomware is increasingly using advanced encryption, networking, evasion and payment technologies. The developers are also making fewer mistakes and writing “better” software. It’s not a stretch to imagine a ransomware developer currently working on ways to attack even corporate databases, or versions that lay low while they identify all of your backup disks. Recovering files from ransomware is impossible without the attacker’s approval, so you need to avoid data loss in the first place. The best thing you can do is practice good “digital hygiene”: Don’t fall prey to social engineering or phishing, which is where an attacker attempts to have you reveal sensitive information to them. If you receive a suspicious email from your grandma or work colleagues, ask yourself whether it’s unusual before you click. If you’re not sure, contact the sender via a different medium, such as giving them a phone call, to cross-check Don’t install any software, plugins or extensions unless you know they’re from a reputable source. If in doubt, ask and only rely on trusted download sources. And certainly don’t be tempted to pick up USB sticks found on your pathway Update your software (comprising your operating system, web browser and other installed sofware) regularly to ensure you are always running the latest versions Backup! Important documents need to be treated like valued possessions. Grab a hand full of USB keys and rotate your backups daily or weekly, and don’t leave USB keys plugged in (current malware strains can scan removable USB disks). Having multiple copies means the adversarial effort on holding you for ransom is pretty much worthless. Ransomware is a very real threat. Its rapid growth is being driven by the low risk to attackers and good financial returns. We all need to stay ahead of the game.

One of the main reasons is to upgrade its share registry system by using blockchain or distributed ledger technology. And it’s been reported that JP Morgan Chase is also partnering with Digital Asset Holdings to trial the technology. Put simply, blockchain technology is a method of recording and confirming transactions where instead of a centralised platform, participants each hold a complete record of transactions through peer to peer verification of transactions. This means there is no central recording system, rather each participant keeps a record of all transactions ever made. This is the same system which allows Bitcoin to operate with no central body. Instead of the ASX clearing house settling trades, trades will be settled by participants confirming transactions through the peer to peer network. The network (likely made up of brokers) will record the buyer and selling participants, the number of shares traded, price of shares, time of exchange and the exchange of funds. The ASX will still provide a centralised electronic exchange for participants to place orders, only the settlement or back office function will be sourced to the network. Blockchain has great potential to cut inefficiencies in the share settlement function. As trades are settled by peer confirmation, there is no need for a clearing house, auditors to verify trades and custodians to ensure a fund has the shares they say they hold. Essentially this is cutting out the middleman in the back office which means less costs in record keeping and in turn less costs to trading on the ASX. Given the high costs in getting a third party to audit, record keep and/or verify trades these costs are substantial. The peer confirmation of trades also means settlement can be almost instantaneous. Compare this to the current settlement period of three working days (‘T+3’) as the ASX needs to make sure the participants have the money and shares on hand to exchange. This would make shares a far more liquid investment – almost as good as having cash on hand. Higher liquidity means more investment into ASX shares. As all participants have the full record of transactions and therefore holdings of investors there is complete transparency in the equity market. This makes it almost impossible to falsify transactions or to alter prior transactions. If a false trade occurs, participants will find inconsistencies in their full ledger and reject the trade. For example an investor would be unable to sell stock that they did not own as all participants would know exactly how much stock the investor owns now. First, implementing a clearing system using blockchain will introduce a new type of fee. In the Bitcoin blockchain, miners process Bitcoin transactions by solving optimisation problems and get rewarded by newly created Bitcoins and settlement fees offered by Bitcoin users who wish to have their transactions processed. Miners prioritise the order of transactions to be cleared based on the fees offered and the difficulty of the problems to record the transaction in a block. This is what allows a blockchain to have no centralised clearing house. If the ASX blockchain requires investors to include transaction fees in order for their transactions to be cleared, then the ASX is transferring the cost of maintaining the back office to the investors. If this is to happen, investors will have to compete against each other to have their transactions cleared faster than those of others. Alternatively, if the new system doesn’t allow such fees and relies on brokers or other entities to clear the transactions, then the ASX is again transferring the cost of maintaining back office to those entities. The second concern is increased transparency. Under the proposed trading system, most of positions of the market participants could be exposed to the public as the trading ID can be identified. This could disadvantage many investors such as super, managed and hedge funds. For example, a super fund typically sells a large position on a gradual basis for a prolonged time period. In this process, it is critical not to be noticed by other traders who may take advantage of such large-scale sales. With complete transparency such as in blockchain, such a sell-off could not be applied effectively. Potentially this may make investors leave the ASX and seek more opaque venues to trade such as dark pools. Clearly a direct adoption of blockchain from Bitcoin technology would not be viable for the ASX. If the ASX is able to adopt blockchain technology and address privacy, security and trade transparency concerns then this would yield great cost savings to investors.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Adrian Lee, KIHoon Hong, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-02-03T19:05:23Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eRecently the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) bought a \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.asx.com.au/documents/about/ASX-Selects-Digital-Asset-to-Develop-Distributed-Ledger-Technology-Solutions.pdf\"\u003e$15 million stake\u003c/a\u003e in Digital Asset Holdings, a developer of blockchain technology.

Now it is blockchain, the technology that makes bitcoin possible, that is having its moment in the sun: the UK government’s Chief Scientist Sir Mark Walport laid out a possible role for it in delivering public services. What is the blockchain? In essence it is just a digital ledger – a means to record events that have taken place – but its design provides considerable advantages over other ways of recording transactions. The details of every transaction is stored cryptographically on the blockchain, a stream of linked data available online. The entire blockchain is decentralised, with all those using it creating copies of the blockchain record. This one-version-but-many-copies approach removes the need for a centralised authority, such as a bank or legal body, which also provides protection from a single central point of failure. The blockchain is open and public, and practically impossible to alter a record once the block representing the transaction has been added. This removal of central authorities is seen as a holy grail by some. Using bitcoin in global transactions provides security at low cost, and banks are among those investigating how blockchain or distributed ledgers might replace their monolithic and increasingly dated hardware and software systems. But there has been little implementation of blockchain outside its use in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Some companies have proposed using distributed ledgers as part of their supply chain. Everledger is a firm that records the properties and ownership of diamonds to reduce criminal use or fraud. Provenance is another company doing the same for those wishing to prove the authenticity or fairtrade credentials of their products to customers. Blockchain provides new technical solutions to situations where trust and authenticity are important. But as with any technology there are positives and negatives – for example, bitcoin’s pseudo-anonymity suits its use by criminals. But in truth almost all crime takes place in the real world with real money: banks we trust pay fines for money laundering, and allegations of unauthorised payments have risen in various sports. Perhaps this most obvious dark side is not the one we should be concerned with. Bitcoin’s founders share a distrust of central government’s role in manipulating the value of currencies, and the increasing willingness to use digital technology to interfere in the lives of their citizens, for example through mass surveillance. Nevertheless, governments have legitimate concerns and are democratically accountable. Bitcoin on the other hand (although not the blockchain underlying it) is governed by a small group of developers and increasingly operated by a concentrated group of bitcoin miners who process the transactions’ computation in exchange for free bitcoin. While the ledger may be distributed, control of it is not. One established bitcoin developer has recently sold his bitcoin, calling it a “failed experiment”. This may be the death of bitcoin, or it may be the start of the revolution devouring its own children. Is the blockchain just a solution looking for a problem? Walport’s report attempted to describe how blockchain might become a solution, and how that could be encouraged and managed. Asked to join the report’s advisory panel, I argued that distributed ledgers could be the moment where the internet moves beyond news, entertainment and shopping and starts to do some heavy lifting. Distributed online ledgers that spread the transactional costs across many points on the network could lead to a revolution in how the economy and society works. Previously, the industrial revolution and the railway and transport revolutions left institutions of society and government essentially intact. Blockchain challenges our existing mindset of how society is organised, and provides the bones of an alternative – for example one with many fewer layers of government and bureaucracy, and less control lying in commercial organisations. The report recommends among other things that the government should use distributed ledgers to challenge the status quo, and work with new governance structures not against them by enhancing accountability at a local level, while reducing forms of centralised control. This fits a small government agenda espoused by some. The exploration of distributed ledgers is likely to continue, regardless of any concerns about bitcoin’s success or failure or its potential use by criminals. What’s needed is to move the debate beyond techies, financiers and privacy advocates where it has stalled. The potential of blockchain to change society and how it is run should be a central theme of discussion: distributed ledgers could offer the sort of internet we want, controlled or distributed, centrally administered or community led. This debate should not just be the preserve of a small group of developers or those organisations already dominating the internet. As essayist William Gibson pointed out: “The future is already here, it’s just unevenly distributed.” We need to find the ways and means to decide how better to distribute the benefits in today’s digitally-enhanced world.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Phil Godsiff, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2016-01-26T12:31:20Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIn only a few years, digital currency bitcoin has emerged from the shadows to become something debated by politicians and pondered by economists.

Two months later, he posted the code for the first version of the software that would allow people to create and exchange the currency. The paper was revolutionary because it brought together ideas that people had been working on in the area of digital currencies. It solved the problem of exchanging money in a safe and secure way, without having to trust third parties or even the other person in the deal. But who was the enigmatic author? Who was Satoshi Nakamoto? The paper was written in a style that referred to “we” rather than “I”. This could have been a ruse. But if not, it suggests there was more than one person behind the idea of Bitcoin. Over the next two years, the person (or persons) calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto worked with volunteers to refine the software until one day in April 2011, the communications stopped. Since that time, Bitcoin has seen a meteoric rise and fall in value. It hasn’t yet disrupted the global financial system, but it has persisted nonetheless. In part, this ongoing interest in the currency has been fueled by China, whose market for Bitcoin represents 81% of the entire Bitcoin trading volume. But why is revealing the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto so important to many people? As with almost everything connected to Bitcoin, the answer is complicated, and in all likelihood, will remain unanswered until the person or persons behind the Satoshi Nakamoto identity step forward and try and prove that they are Satoshi. The internet age has given us the ability to get instant answers to almost any question anyone cares to ask. With Satoshi Nakamoto, there are many unanswered questions. For instance, the fact that we live in an age of technological superstars such as Microsoft’s Bill Gates, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Google’s Larry Page and Serge Brin, Apple’s Tim Cook and others. The idea that someone could bring a technology as important as Bitcoin into the world without taking credit for it, is unheard of. Why was their anonymity so important? Various theories have been put forward for this including the fact that the inventors may have been concerned about the illegality of creating an alternative currency. This would have been true at the time when digital currencies were being investigated for their capacity to support money laundering and other criminal activities. But this theory doesn’t explain why they would wish to remain anonymous today, now that Bitcoin has largely been accepted, even with its association with cybercrime. Another theory is that Satoshi Nakamoto was concerned that Bitcoin should be a truly open source project that didn’t have leaders to dictate how it should function and evolve. This perspective does have merits but part of the reason the Bitcoin community could be wishing for the appearance of a real leader who can lay claim to the title is that there is currently a split within the Bitcoin developer community, which is undecided on how the future software should work. These arguments arise in other projects such as the operating system Linux for example but in Linux’s case, there is a leader, the inventor, Linus Torvalds, who can act as the ultimate arbiter in these disputes. Probably the most intriguing question, however, and possibly the motive behind the interest by the media, is the whereabouts of one million Bitcoins that Satoshi Nakamoto is reported to have access to. At current market values, that is worth US$420 million. This trove doesn’t appear to have been touched and, again, the question has been asked as to why not? One theory here is that the selling of the Bitcoins would possibly link back to unmask the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. Another view holds that the Bitcoin founder would not want to send a selling signal to the market by offloading large quantities of Bitcoin. Another question that has been raised in regard to the Bitcoins, and in particular the idea that Australian businessman Craig S Wright could have been Satoshi Nakamoto, has been the possibility that this was what motivated the Australian Tax Office to ask police to raid his home and office. However, it is likely that the ATO’s interest in Wright was for his involvement in many different companies and their tax obligations rather than anything specifically to do with Bitcoin. As to any claims that Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto, further evidence has surfaced that points to this being an elaborate hoax. Encryption keys that were used to link Wright back to Satoshi Nakamoto were most likely created far more recently than claimed and made to look like they came from an earlier date. There have been many possible “sightings” of Satoshi Nakamoto based on a number of different possible leads. There are as many people seemingly hoping that the inventors’ identities will not be revealed. The mystery and enigma is very likely to be far better than the reality. On the other hand, there are the others who hope that the “Steve Jobs of Bitcoin” will step forward and drive Bitcoin, and its underlying technology, to new heights. Personally, I think it is better that Bitcoin remains a project that the community ultimately drives because that idea seems closest to the original intention of Satoshi Nakamoto.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"David Glance, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-12-11T00:22:56Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIn 2008, someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto posted a \u003ca href\u003d\"https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\"\u003epaper\u003c/a\u003e describing the workings of what would become the world’s most important digital cryptocurrency, \u003ca href\u003d\"https://theconversation.com/what-is-bitcoin-it-is-not-that-complicated-if-you-ignore-the-geek-speak-46512\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e.

It’s the technology that underpins digital currencies and ensures that all transactions are properly conducted and recorded. But what is stored on the blockchain need not be just a currency unit – it can be put to all manner of other interesting uses. The blockchain is defined as “a system that’s secure without a higher authority, distributed across many strangers’ computers, yet tamper-proof, and promises a mechanism for trust mediated directly between individuals”. Essentially, by providing a distributed means to guarantee and verify transactions, the blockchain offers the ultimate opportunity to cut out the middleman. A key aspect is the programmable smart contract: code stored on the blockchain that automatically executes when certain conditions have been met. In uses that involve a financial transaction, it makes sense to use bitcoin or some other digital currency for the same reason – by doing so, transactions can be automated and guaranteed without recourse to third parties, such as a bank. Not all uses involve payments. For example, Kim Jackson and Zach LeBeau were married on the blockchain in November. Is a blockchain marriage legally binding? Well, some parts of it would fall within contract law, but it’s a first symbolic step. Many major companies are looking to the blockchain as a way to simplify and strengthen supply chains, where the blockchain could record each step a product has taken. For example, it could be used to guarantee the origin of foods. In other cases, the blockchain can be used for peer-to-peer exchange or sale. Imagine you have an electric car. When your charger is unused, you can rent it out to other car owners, paid in bitcoins via a blockchain smart contract. Another use is automated security, using code embedded on the blockchain to trigger granting or denying access depending on the requester. This way security is assured, as no third parties are involve and no one holds the “keys”: the lock has become one with the key, and assurance lies in the distributed trust of a shared, anonymous network. One firm supplying this is Slock. The owner can set a deposit amount and a price for renting a property, which the user pays through a blockchain transaction (not even Slock is a middleman), which permits the user to open and close the smart lock through their smartphone. It’s a lock activated by money, without any need for third-party authority. And it’s not just start-ups such as Slock that are taking notice – bigger players, including IBM, are onto it too. A radically different application comes from Bitnation, a project aimed at using blockchain to decentralise governance. Bitnation is offering victims of the refugee crisis an emergency digital ID and bitcoin-based credit card which can be used to receive funds from family members or friends without bank accounts. With this it is possible for an individual to prove their existence and identity through family relations cryptographically, recorded on the blockchain like a distributed public ledger. This acts as a sort of international notary public. Bitnation works by generating a QR code – a barcode – which can be used with a cellphone to apply for a bitcoin credit card which can be used throughout Europe and the UK without a bank account. Australian software firm Edgelogic offers a glimpse of how blockchain technology could be used at home, a bridge between digital payments and the Internet of Things. For example, a sensor could report to the blockchain when it detects damp, an alert which triggers a set of instructions that transfers cash for repairs from an insurer to a claimant’s account, even before the person knows anything is wrong. A digital crypto-currency has just launched that is generated by human movement. Bitwalking dollars can be earned simply by walking, unlike other digital currencies such as bitcoins that require “mining” though using computers to solve cryptographic problems. With Bitwalking, a phone app counts and verifies users’ steps and walkers earning approximately BW$1 for every 10,000 steps (about five miles). These can be spent in an online store, or traded for cash. While some ideas may seem like solutions looking for a problem, others are more closely tied to real needs. They redefine what use the blockchain could be put to – eliminating the need for banks, or even for aspects of government. It’s clear that the blockchain has expanded beyond bitcoin and cryptocurrencies – but as with all disruptive technologies, in which direction it will be taken remains to be seen.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"Paul Levy, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2015-12-04T14:19:51Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eMost people who have heard the term think that the “blockchain” is only something to do with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, litecoin, doguecoin and others.

Bitwalking dollars can be earned simply by walking, unlike other digital currencies such as bitcoins that require “mining” though using computers to solve cryptographic problems. With Bitwalking, a phone app counts and verifies users’ steps and walkers earning approximately BW$1 for every 10,000 steps (about five miles). These can be spent in an online store, or traded for cash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile some ideas may seem like solutions looking for a problem, others are more closely tied to real needs. They redefine what use the blockchain could be put to – eliminating the need for banks, or even for aspects of government.

All of its technological possibility lies ahead, nobody is sure what particular path it will take, but in the meantime it is going to give everyone a rough ride. The Inside Bitcoins conference, held this week in Melbourne, has brought together more than 500 people to discuss Bitcoin’s possible futures - all within the framework of an industry that needs to develop in order to support that future. The key take-home message of the views expressed by speakers at the conference was that Bitcoin was still a long way off from being used as a currency for everyday transactions. Most of the activity in Bitcoin today, and for the near future, is to do with people trading the currency. Government regulation is unlikely to change that.  This view was particularly reinforced by Asher Tan, CEO of local Bitcoin exchange CoinJar. He has concentrated on simplifying the process of buying and selling Bitcoin in Australia with seamless user identification and currency transfer. The company itself has been funded by venture capital provided by Blackbird Ventures whose managing director, Niki Scevak, is particularly enthusiastic about the potential for Bitcoin-based companies to develop out of the local market. CoinJar is about to launch an ATM card that will automatically convert Bitcoin into cash, making it far simpler to spend. The fact that this is needed is again a reflection of the lack of avenues for spending Bitcoin directly. This is possibly a consequence of Bitcoin’s struggle to gain acceptance as a currency. Here’s my interview with Asher Tan at the conference:  Economist Nicholas Gruen, CEO of Lateral Economist and chairman of The Australian Centre for Social Innovation, was emphatic in stating that Bitcoin did not yet demonstrate one of the main functions of money in being a unit of account. Simply put, whenever anyone deals with Bitcoin, they immediately trade it for some other currency like Australian or US dollars. We haven’t reached the stage where people hold onto Bitcoin because it is a generally useful currency in its own right. On a more general note, and from more of a philosophical view, Gruen went on to discuss the general notion of Bitcoin being a “public good privately provided”. Gruen framed the notion of Bitcoin as being something that is being supported and developed by the private sector and not governments. It is a public good because anyone can benefit from the use of Bitcoin’s underlying protocols as no single person or government is in control of the technology. This is not necessarily a view that all economists share. Some would argue that the only reason anything will thrive when it is provided by the private sector is if the public benefit financially from it. The biggest benefit from Bitcoin and the thing most talked about is still the technology called the “blockchain”. This underpins every transaction that takes place in the Bitcoin network. The blockchain is the technology that ensures that no Bitcoin is ever spent twice and it does this without the need of a bank or payment third party as is necessary with normal currency transactions. The blockchain is public and is monitored by everyone using Bitcoin. It turns out that you can do lots of very clever things with the blockchain. One of those people trying to take advantage of this is Leon-Gerard Vandenberg, a Bitcoin technologist working on being able to use Bitcoins through regular SIM card technologies found in every phone. He talked about the potential for organisations like the World Bank to use blockchain technology to ensure that funding is trackable and is used only as agreed. This would be impossible to do using any non-blockchain-based currency. Vandenberg explains more about blockchain here:  A more concrete example of a current use of the blockchain is digital proof of ownership of a file. This has been an ongoing problem because you need to prove not only that you owned the file, but that you owned it at a particular time. A site called Proof of Existence allows a user to upload a file and have the digital signature of that file added to the Bitcoin blockchain. Because the entry’s ownership is known only to the person adding it and it is independently verified and shared in the Bitcoin network, it provides incontrovertible evidence of ownership at a specific time. As perhaps a reflection of the nascent state of Bitcoin, there were few companies exhibiting products or services at the conference. Disappointingly, it was not possible even to buy a coffee using Bitcoin. Maybe next year.","TAGS":"","AUTHOR_NAME":"David Glance, ","CATEGORY":"","CREATION_DATE":"2014-07-10T06:15:50Z","HTML_CONTENT":"\u003cp\u003eIn terms of a life-cycle of technology, it is easy to see Bitcoin as being at the same developmental stage as babies going through the “terrible twos”.
